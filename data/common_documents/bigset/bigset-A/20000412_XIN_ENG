<HEADLINE> Pak Must Own Up Kargil Mistake for Talks: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said on Tuesday that talks with Pakistan were
possible only after Islamabad owned up its mistake of foisting the
Kargil war on India and desisted from sponsoring cross-border
terrorism, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Vajpayee also noted that India realized the importance
of holding talks with Pakistan for normalization of relations
between the two countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public meeting in West India's Gujarat State,
Vajpayee criticized Pakistan as a "theocratic state" indulging in
anti-India and anti-Hindu propaganda in order to divert the
attention of its people from its internal problems, the PTI
reported.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had betrayed India's trust and stabbed it in the back
by waging the Kargil war of last summer, Vajpayee said, obviously
referring to his peace-seeking bus journey to Lahore in February
last year.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Refutes Rumors with Regard to DPRK-Germany Contact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Monday refuted rumors spread by some "
foreign forces" that Germany had put pressure on the DPRK when the
foreign ministers of the two countries made contact recently in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA),
a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said that on April 5 the DPRK
foreign minister met his German counterpart during his stopover in
Berlin en route to Colombia to participate in the meeting of
foreign ministers of non-aligned countries.
</P>
<P>
During the contact, the DPRK side informed the German side of
the recent situation in the DPRK, its proposals for national
reunification and independent foreign policy and both sides
exchanged views on matters of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister of the DPRK clarified the country's
principled stand on a series of issues raised at the contact, and
the two sides reached a consensus that it is in bilateral interest
to continue discussions on issues of mutual concern in the future.
</P>
<P>
But some forces let media under their control spread
misinformation about the contact. They asserted that the German
side put sort of "pressure" on the DPRK, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Friendly relations are established and developed between states
not by any "request" or "pressure" from someone under any
circumstances but by each other's independent decision and
judgment on the principle of sovereignty, mutual respect and
equality, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK government will as ever establish and develop friendly
and cooperative relations with all the countries which respect its
sovereignty and are friendly to it on the basis of the fundamental
idea of independence, peace and friendship, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Calls for Efforts to Protect Collective South Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe
Perez Roque Tuesday called for closer cooperation among developing
countries to collectively protect the interests of the peoples in
the South against the current unjust international economic system.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his welcoming statement at the opening session of
the meeting of foreign ministers here, the foreign minister said,
"The time has come. Our peoples have run out of patience. For
decades they have suffered broken promises, and are today living
in an economic and social situation that is increasingly serious."
</P>
<P>
"It is more essential and urgent than ever before, that the
Group of 77 adopts a common strategy to defend our interests," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit was launched in the Caribbean island country
after the failure of the World Conference of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle, the United States, and with just a few
months before the Convocation of the Millennium Summit in
September at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to forge a common stance for our 133 countries
to demand a more just world, based on solidarity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The 1.3 billion people on the Planet, who are struggling today
to survive in circumstances which are classified as 'critical
poverty', have good reason to hope that their children will not
have to put up with this tragedy at their lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The 900 million starving people on the Planet have every right
to hope that the wonderful scientific and technological advances,
and the increase in world trade will mean that they at least have
a decent plate of food every day," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"The parents of the 12 million children who will die this year
from illness that are completely preventable, have every right to
hope that this South Summit will be devoted to defending the most
important human right: the right to life," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have the right to dream of a future for our children that
is better than the lives we have lived," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The globalization of the world economy cannot carry on causing
underdevelopment, poverty and exclusion for the majority, and
wasteful and unnecessary luxury for a privileged minority," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials began a working meeting on Monday morning to
hammer out the two draft documents to be adopted at the end of the
Summit on April 14. Foreign ministers will consider the drafts and
then submit them for the approval of heads of state and government
when they begin to meet for three days on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Although the G-77 membership grew to 133 countries over the
past decades, the original name of the body, set up by 77
developing countries in June 1964 in Geneva, was retained due to
its historic significance.

<HEADLINE> Policeman Killed While Searching for Abducted Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A 31-year-old Chinese policeman
of Mongolia nationality was killed last night while searching for
kidnapped women in a village in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, the Ministry of Public Security disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
The policeman, Sainbair, and his two colleagues were
investigating in the village when Han Yonglai, a 32-year-old
farmer who bought an abducted woman from southwest China's Sichuan
Province, attacked him with a knife.
</P>
<P>
Sainbair died on the way to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, Sainbair is the first police
officer to be killed in the line of duty since the nationwide hunt
for traffickers of women and children kicked off on April 1 this
year.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prospecting to Continue in Tanzania: Deputy Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Oil search is expected to
continue in Tanzania to quench the country's thirst for energy,
according to Deputy Minister for Energy and Minerals Manju
Msambya.
</P>
<P>
Since late March, fuel price in Tanzanian pump stations have
hit a record high, inflicting a heavy blow on local consumers.
</P>
<P>
The official said on Monday at the National Assembly, which is
now in session in the designated new capital of Dodoma in central
Tanzania, that oil prospecting would continue despite the great
loss of money.
</P>
<P>
Foreign prospectors have invested more than 242 million U.S.
dollars in search of oil in the east African country over the past
20 years but in vain, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prospecting activities were first launched in the colonial
era in early 1950s by two companies, British Petroleum and Shell.
</P>
<P>
The exploration, funded by prospectors with assistance from the
 governments of Norway and Canada, cost a total amount of 242
million U.S. dollars from 1981 to 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now we haven't been able to discover oil in the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the deputy minister said that the drilling rigs
installed in the offshore waters of the Indian Ocean have
discovered natural gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
The prospectors first struck natural gas deposits at the
Songosongo Island in Kilwa District in 1974 before hitting another
gas deposit in 1982 at Mnaza Bay in Mtwara Region, all in
southeastern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he disclosed that the Pemba Channel is believed to
have great potential of petroleum reserves, although oil
prospecting in the area has stopped.
</P>
<P>
"A Canadian company, ANTRIM, is ready to start drilling for oil
but we have to wait for a license from the Revolutionary
Government of Zanzibar," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, consisted of the main Unguja island and its sister
island of Pemba in the western part of the Indian Ocean, has its
own government dealing with all matters except foreign and defense
affairs since its emergence with the then Tanganyika to form the
United Republic of Tanzania in 1964.

<HEADLINE> International Community Urged to Aid Drought-Hit Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Representatives in
Ethiopia Tuesday urged the international community to step up food
aid to drought- affected people in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The relief food extended so far by the international community
is not adequate, said representatives from the World Food Program
(WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO), The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The world community should stretch out a continuous food
assistance to stem the food crisis in Ethiopia, they said.
</P>
<P>
"We have too little to many people right now (in Ethiopia),"
said WFP country representative Judith Louis, who stressed that
the country needs immediate pledges from the donor community.
</P>
<P>
She said the relief food from donors should reach in Ethiopia
by the end of next June.
</P>
<P>
WHO country representative Michel Janclos said that although
WHO has distributed food among the drought-affected people, the
supplies are not sufficient compared with the gravity of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a representative from UNICEF said the U.N. body has
appealed for 7.7 million U.S. dollars to provide clean water as
well as health and emergency education services to people hit by
drought.
</P>
<P>
However, so far only 500,000 U.S. dollars has been received,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Large part of Ethiopia has been reportedly suffering from
drought since late last year with more than eight million people
facing starvation.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Holds Ceremony to Welcome Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
held a ceremony here Wednesday to welcome Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, who is paying a state visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In his welcome speech, Weizman hailed Jiang's visit as a
historic one, noting that this is the first time that a Chinese
president pays a visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
This visit will surely "lay a foundation for the deepening of
relations between Israel and China," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Israel attaches great importance to its relations with China and
is seeking to widen cooperation with it in many fields, especially
in economy, agriculture, science, medicine and culture, Weizman
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit also comes at a time when Israel is making efforts
to achieve a comprehensive peace with its Arab neighbors, Weizman
said, adding that he hoped Jiang's visit will help move forward the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Chinese president expressed his heartful
thanks to Weizman's warm welcome and friendly remarks, saying it is
a great pleasure for him to pay a state visit to this beautiful
country.
</P>
<P>
"Both the Chinese nation and the Jewish nation are among the
oldest nations in the world that have made great contributions to
the human civilization and progress," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The important subject of his visit is to explore ways to further
strengthen the traditional friendship between the two nations and
to promote cooperation for the benefits of both, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government sincerely hopes that the Middle
East peace process will continue to move forward. "I hope my visit
will be helpful to the advancement of the undertaking of Mideast
peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
The national anthems of China and Israel were played at the
beginning of the ceremony. Jiang was accompanied by Weizman to
inspect the Israeli honor guard.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Israel earlier Wednesday on the first leg of
his five-nation state visit, which will also take him to Palestine,
Turkey, Greece and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Invites More Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Trade Center
announced on Wednesday that a number of invitations will be sent to
potential foreign investors to attract investments needed for Saudi
projects.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the office of Saudi Prince Tala Ibn Abdul-Aziz,
chairman of the trade center, said the center had asked a Saudi
bank to deliver the invitations to investors who are willing to
invest in the Gulf kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just two days after Saudi cabinet endorsed
a new foreign investment law on Monday, which encourages foreign
investments by allowing 100 percent ownership rights and reducing
corporate tax for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners had been limited to 49 percent stakes in joint
ventures and barred from owning property in the kingdom where about
a quarter of 20 million people are expatriates.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, corporate taxes imposed on firms with high
profits of over 100,000 Saudi riyals (26,660 U.S. dollars) are
likely to be reduced to 30 percent from 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation also changed the old arrangement stipulating
that all foreigner workers in the kingdom must have Saudi sponsors,
a move which received widespread applause from the expatriates.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Calls for Inter-Arab Parliamentary Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti National Assembly
Speaker Jasim Al-Kharafi on Wednesday called for cooperation among
parliaments of Arab countries, particularly between Kuwait and
Yemen, in order to settle differences among the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming his visiting Yemeni counterpart Sheikh Abdullah Al-
Ahmar, Al-Kharafi said the "Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was
the main reason for the rupture of the Arab fold."
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Gulf war triggered by Iraq's invasion and occupation of
Kuwait led to a nine-year freeze of ties between Kuwait and Yemen
since Sanaa showed sympathy with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The two countries restored full relations in May last year, when
Yemen reopened its embassy in Kuwait after nine years of closure.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kharafi said that "cutting ties between the two countries
reflected badly on bilateral relations as well as on the Arab and
Islamic relations."
</P>
<P>
But the Kuwaiti parliament leader expressed hope that both
countries will join hands at all levels because there "is no choice
but cooperation."
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Yemeni speaker, who arrived in Kuwait on
Monday on a four-day visit, also voiced hope that his visit, the
first of its kind in almost 10 years, "would foster ties to secure
the interests of both states."
</P>
<P>
Ahmar also hoped this visit would end with fruitful results on
the way of cooperation and joint action between the two
parliaments.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Two explosions shocked Iran's
northeastern city of Mashhad on Wednesday, but caused no
casualties, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred at about 4 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. local time
(1130 GMT and 1200 GMT) in two places in Mashhad, Khorassan
province, according to Hussein Zare, deputy governor general for
political and security affairs in the province.
</P>
<P>
He said the first explosion occurred in the Taleqani street near
the Homa hotel, which was apparently caused by a bomb planted in a
dustbin.
</P>
<P>
The other explosion took place in the lane Khamenei near the
holy shrine of Imam Reza. No one was hurt and only some windows
were shattered, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been in a political tension since the sixth
parliamentary elections in February, in which reformers supporting
President Mohammad Khatami won a landslide victory over their
conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Guardians Council, supervisor of the elections,
recently cancelled the election results in some constituencies,
which has stirred up a series of protests.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sings High Praise of Cuban Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan, who is the first U.N. chief to visit the Caribbean
island country in 15 years, told the opening ceremony of the South
Summit of the Group of 77 (G-77) his "gratitude for the chance to
visit Cuba once again -- a state which has shown that even a poor
country need not leave its people defenseless against some of life
's worst hardships."
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for Annan to be in Cuba, but the first
for him to pay an official visit to the country as the U.N.
secretary-general. The last U.N. chief to visit Cuba was Perez de
Cuellar in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
"On the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures
education and life expectancy as well as income per head, Cuba
consistently ranks above other countries whose per capita product
is much higher," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Its efforts for public health are particularly impressive,"
he said, citing the acknowledgment by the Economist newspaper last
year that "Cuba maintains levels of health care unknown to most
poor countries."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to teachers and students Tuesday at the Havana
University, Annan praised Cuba for guaranteeing 11 million people
good social services despite the long-term U.S. embargo.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the embargo, Cuba's achievements in social
development are impressive given the size of its gross domestic
product per capita," he said. "As the human development index of
the United Nations make clear year after year, Cuba should be the
envy of many other nations ostensibly far richer."

<HEADLINE> Clinton: National Security at Stack in China PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has stressed that China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and U.S. decision on Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR) will promote America's prosperity and security in
the future.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, in a statement released Tuesday, said that
the economic reasons for PNTR are "clear cut" since the move will
further open China's market for American workers, farmers and
businesses, bringing more jobs and growing exports for Americans.
</P>
<P>
"China will join the WTO regardless of what we decided to do.
The decision before Congress is whether the United States will
receive the same trade benefits from China as will do our trade
competitors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that China's entry into the WTO also has national
security implications for the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Bringing China into the WTO will entwine China in the global
economy, increasing its interdependence with the rest of the world,
" and "it will strengthen China's reforms and the reformers behind
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed his concern about the "extremely harmful
consequences" a vote against PNTR would do to the national
security of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Because the economic case for PNTR is so strong, the Chinese
will see a rejection as a strategic decision by the United States
to turn from cooperation to confrontation, to deal with China as
an adversary," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will spare no effort in the coming days and weeks to make
sure that the Congress and the American people understand what the
stakes are. And I am confident that when the debate is over and
the votes are cast, the Congress will do what is right -- both for
our prosperity and our security," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kofi Annan Proposes to Create Health Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan recommended Wednesday the creation of a world health
network through the Internet to provide a wide range of
information on the latest scientific knowledge to the developing
world's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Annan spoke at the opening session of the South Summit before
heads of state, ministers and ambassadors of the member countries
from the Group of 77 (G-77).
</P>
<P>
He explained that his report at the Millennium Summit includes
two initiatives destined at putting information technology at the
service of Third World countries' populations.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the creation of an Internet health network, he said
that there will be over 10,000 on-line sites to serve hospitals,
clinics and medical installations in every developing country.
</P>
<P>
It will be possible to have access to up-to-date instantaneous
medical information adapted to the needs of these medical centers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The second initiative presented by the U.N. secretary-general
includes the formation of voluntary corps specialized in advanced
technology, which will train professionals in developing countries
in the use of information technology.
</P>
<P>
Both initiatives, said Annan, will be carried out through
alliances between the United Nations, the private sector,
philanthropic foundations and every institution aimed at serving
people in the North as well as in the South.

<HEADLINE> G-77 Pays Homage to Julius Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 (G-77) paid homage
Wednesday here to one of the historical pillars in South-South
cooperation, the late Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 president, Nigerian leader Olusegun Obasanjo, asked
the South Summit assistants for a minute of silence to the memory
of the Third World African leader, who passed away last year.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo referred to Nyerere as an eminent world leader and as
an outstanding founding figure in Africa who gave invaluable
services for the establishment of South-South cooperation and
contributed to the principles that serve as a base to the South
Summit which started Wednesday in Havana.
</P>
<P>
About contacts among developing countries, the G-77 leader
regretted that many of the numerous agreements have been moved out
of the United Nations reach because "we will enter the new
millennium with many of our expectations affected by the
globalizing wave."
</P>
<P>
Among the negative effects of this situation, he talked about
poverty in developing countries, and the fall in every human
development indicator. A new strategy to cope with this problems
is needed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries, he said, still are the great beneficiaries
of this situation, while most of the developing countries are
lacking opportunities such as those developed countries can count
on.
</P>
<P>
Globalization has not propitiated economic recovery, higher
growth and more opportunities for the eradication of misery in the
developing world, Obasanjo added.

<HEADLINE> Queen Presents N.Irish Police Heroism Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua -- Queen Elizabeth flew into Northern
Ireland on Wednesday and presented its battle-scarred police force
with the George Cross, Britain's highest civilian gallantry award.
</P>
<P>
Under tight security after recent attacks by republican
renegades, she lauded the record of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC) record during 30 years of strife.
</P>
<P>
"This award is an exceptional recognition of the outstanding
contribution made by the RUC to peace in Northern Ireland," she
told hundreds of police officers and families, including widows,at
Hillsborough Castle.
</P>
<P>
Paying tribute to the 302 officers who died and the thousands
who were wounded, she said it was "a singular acknowledgment of
the gallantry and courage shown, and on all too many occasions,
the ultimate sacrifice paid, by the members of the constabulary...
"
</P>
<P>
Reforms to the largely Protestant force, especially plans to
drop the "royal" tag in a new name, have riled pro-British
Protestant unionists, who say the changes insult the force's
casualties in sectarian violence that took 3,600 lives.
</P>
<P>
Widespread changes to Northern Ireland's police service will go
ahead, Tony Blair confirmed on the day the force was awarded the
George Cross.
</P>
<P>
Paying tribute to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the prime
minister nevertheless insisted changes to make it more acceptable
to the whole community, were vital.
</P>
<P>
The Queen presented Britain's highest civilian award for
gallantry, speaking of the "exceptional recognition of the
outstanding contribution made by the RUC to peace in Northern
Ireland".
</P>
<P>
But many former, serving and disabled RUC officers, have said
that if the government changes the force's name to the Police
Service for Northern Ireland it would be a crushing blow.
</P>
<P>
In the House of Commons, Tony Blair said: "Many officers died
during that period of time, many others suffered loss of limb.
</P>
<P>
"Their families have often lived in the most appalling
circumstances of fear and terror and I am delighted and honored to
pay my tribute to the RUC for all the work that they've done,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Some unionist politicians have expressed concern that the award
of the George Cross at this time was an attempt to damp down anger
about the proposed changes.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have also condemned the award of the medal. Sinn
Fein's Bairbre de Brun described it as "offensive" to members of
the nationalist community killed and injured by the "discredited
force".
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein staged a protest in Londonderry against the ceremony
as it was taking place and a victims' group, Relatives for Justice,
held a black flag vigil at Belfast City Hall to protest against
the award.
</P>
<P>
But Ulster Unionist Leader David Trimble said the award
recognized the "service and sacrifice of the RUC" in the way the
Patten report did not.
</P>
<P>
The UUP, the largest political party in Northern Ireland,
recently decided to link retaining the RUC's name with political
progress.
</P>
<P>
The RUC was awarded the George Cross in tribute to the
sacrifice and service of its members and to recognize the force's
bravery during more than 30 years of paramilitary violence in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Three officers received the medal on behalf of the force at a
ceremony at Hillsborough Castle in County Down.

<HEADLINE> Reno Travels to Miami to Settle Dispute on Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said that Reno is
planning to work out a resolution, trying to meet with the parties
concerned to seek a cooperative settlement in this case.
</P>
<P>
Marlin said Reno would meet with the Miami relatives who is
taking care of Elian and community leaders in Miami, where angry
Cuban exiles have vowed to prevent the boy's return to his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the father indicated in a meeting with the
Rev. Joan Brown Campbell that he was through with negotiating and
is going to simply ask now that the attorney general issue a court
order and that the boy be returned immediately to him.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year after his mother and
other 11 people died when their boat capsized in the Atlantic off
Florida. His relatives in Miami then took custody of him.
</P>
<P>
The relatives insists that the boy should remain in the United
States even after the boy's father came to the U.S. to pick up his
son.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department ruled earlier this year that the
boy belongs to his father and should be returned to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Arrives in Ethiopia for Drought Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Catherine Bertini, special
envoy of U. N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, arrived here on
Tuesday to gather information about the current drought situation
in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
She was briefed by Ethiopia's Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commissioner (DPPC) Simeon Mechale Wednesday on how
the emergency relief assistance is being distributed to the famine
victims.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia had appealed earlier to the international community to
extend relief food to the drought affected people, Simeon said,
adding that over 836,000 tons of relief food is required, but only
half of the assistance has so far been obtained.
</P>
<P>
Responding to how Ethiopia could cope with the large quantity
of shipment of relief assistance as it only uses Djibouti port,
the commissioner said the ports of Sudan and Somalia could be used
as alternatives.
</P>
<P>
There would not be a problem in transport as there are enough
number of trucks that could be leased, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPPC, Bertini and her entourage would inspect
one of the drought-hit areas, Gode, in Somali State during the
visit.

<HEADLINE> WWF Objects to Resuming Turtle Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Foundation
announced Wednesday in a news release that it completely objected
to Cuba's proposal to reopen the international trade in Hawksbill
turtle.
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't reopen the trade because controls in the main
importing country, Japan, are inadequate, the status of the turtle
populations in the Caribbean is unclear, and regional management
is patchy," said Elizabeth Kemf, WWF Species Information Manager,
in her newly published report.
</P>
<P>
Despite decades of conservation efforts, six of the world's
seven species of marine turtle are still in danger of extinction,
Kemf said in the report entitled "Wanted Alive! Marine Turtles in
the Wild".
</P>
<P>
"Local extinctions of marine turtles have occurred in all ocean
basins, and no population, not even those that are stable as a
result of long term conservation and management, is completely
safe," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Hawksbills, like other marine turtles, are facing ever-growing
numbers of threats," she said in the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, though trade in turtles is banned
under CITES, they are still hunted and sold openly as tourist
curios in Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico and parts of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Up to 300,000 turtles are killed each year as "bycatch" in
trawling nets or shrimp nets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that tourism is also a major threat to turtles because
the construction of seawalls, hotels and other facilities have
destroyed large areas of turtle nesting beaches around the world.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and Dominica have proposed that the ongoing Convention on
the Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)
held in Nairobi should resume the international trade in Hawksbill
turtle.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Raise Minimum Wage for Public Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set up
a 19- member committee to review salaries and allowances for its
600,000 strong public sector workers in an effort to narrow the
gap with the private sector, a senior government official said in
a statement published here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by chief economic adviser to the
president Philip Asiodu, would help "narrow the gap between wages
in the public and private sectors," in the interest of the
management of the economy, said Ufot Ekaette, secretary to the
Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
"The government considers that there is now an urgent need to
initiate the process of raising the level of wages and associated
allowances payable to workers in the public sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
Already the government has provided 8.6 billion naira (one U.S.
dollar equals 100 naira at present) in this year's budget in
anticipation of the wage increase. The step would enhance the
success of the government's campaign against corruption, Ekaette
said.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which includes eight representatives of the
government and six representatives of the Nigeria Labor Congress,
also includes representatives of the employers association, the
Chamber of Commerce and farmers.
</P>
<P>
Public sector wages were increased early last year when the
former military leader Abdulsalami Abubakar raised the minimum
wage from 1,200 naira to 3,500 monthly.

<HEADLINE> Condition of Comatose Iranian Reformer Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Iranian reformer, who
was injured in a car accident Wednesday morning, is now in a coma
and breathes through a respirator, but his condition is said to be
improving.
</P>
<P>
Rajabali Mazroui, head of Iran's Association of Journalists, was
hospitalized in the intensive care unit of Tehran's Day hospital,
and a surgical operation has been carried out on his chest, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
According to doctors treating him, the operation has been
successfully performed to pump blood out of the respiratory organ
of the patient and treat injuries caused by the fractured rib
ripping into his lung.
</P>
<P>
The danger to Mazroui's life has been removed and his overall
condition is satisfactory, said the doctors, adding that once the
patient regains consciousness, a decision would be made on ensuing
treatment and period of hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
According to Mazroui's relatives, the road accident occurred as
the car Mazroui was traveling in swerved and hit roadside railing.
The car then overturned.
</P>
<P>
Mazroui was on his way back to Tehran from Rasht, Gilan
Province, where he delivered a speech on the role of the press in
reforms on Tuesday, when the accident took place.
</P>
<P>
Mazroui is a leading member of the Islamic Iran Participation
Front (IIPF), the party which led reformers to an overwhelming
victory in February's parliament election. He was elected into the
sixth Majlis (parliament) from the central province of Isfahan in
the election.
</P>
<P>
Before the February 18 elections, Mazroui served as an economic
advisor to reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Since the parliamentary election, there has been in an air of
growing tension between Iran's political factions representing
reformists and conservatives.

<HEADLINE> 13 Lebanese Detainees to Be Released by Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's prison authority
announced Wednesday that 13 of the 15 Lebanese detainees now in its
custody will be set free by the start of next week.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was issued following an ruling of Israel's
Supreme Court earlier in the day, which ordered immediately release
of eight of the detainees because they have been illegally kept for
years as bargaining chips for missing Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the ruling reached by a nine-judge panel with a 6-3 vote, the
court said Israeli law does not give Israeli defense ministry the
authority to hold these Lebanese citizens in administrative
detention as they are not presenting threats to the security of the
country.
</P>
<P>
All these Lebanese hostages are used by Israel as bargaining
cards for information or return of missing Israeli servicemen,
including Ron Arad, an Israeli Air Force navigator who has been
missing since 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Five Lebanese hostages were freed last December and another one
was released by Tel Aviv District Court last week on the grounds of
his deteriorating mental health after long-time detention.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Zvi Rish, the lawyer representing these detainees,
asserted that seven Lebanese prisoners remained in custody should
be let go under the framework of the Supreme Court ruling, although
they did not appeal in the case.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Israel's Prison authority agreed to release five more
of them and said that all 13 detainees will be freed after the
authority reaches a transfer arrangement with the International Red
Cross organization.
</P>
<P>
This means that the two most prominent detainees, Sheik Abdel
Karim Obeid and Mustafa Dirani, will still be held in Israeli
prison without a trial.
</P>
<P>
Obeid, a spiritual leader of Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, was
kidnapped from his home in south Lebanon in 1989, and Dirani,
security chief of the Lebanese resistance militia Amal, was
captured by Israeli agents in a special operation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It was Dirani who held Arad after the Israeli navigator
parachuted from his hit Phantom fighter on Lebanese soil in October
1986. Dirani reportedly traded Arad to either Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas or Iranian elements later.
</P>
<P>
In response to the court ruling, Israeli Chief of General Staff
Shaul Mofaz said the Israel Defense Forces have objected to the
release of Lebanese detainees due to its moral responsibility to
ensure the return of Arad and other captured Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Now the army would have to learn the details of the closed-door
decision reached by a 6-3 vote before taking any actions, Mofaz
said.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to Arad's family that the defense establishment would
continue its efforts to get Arad back to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
Arad's mother Batia Arad condemned the court decision, saying
she felt betrayed by the court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Human Rights Organization issued a statement
to welcome the order of release and urge immediately release of all
the Lebanese citizens in Israeli detention.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Bolster Economic Cooperation with Egypt: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien told Egypt that his country has the desire to bolster
bilateral cooperation in economy, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Chretien
said Canada is ready to promote relations with Egypt in trade,
vocational training and technology transfer, Moussa told reporters
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the talks also dealt with the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process and discussed ways of
breaking the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Canada currently provides peacekeepers to the Middle East,
including 180 soldiers stationed on the Israeli-occupied Syrian
Golan Heights, and hosts talks on Palestinian refugees as part of
the multilateral phase of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Chretien arrived here Tuesday night for a three-day visit as
part of a regional tour, which also includes Jordan, the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Israel, Syria, Lebanon and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Chretien also held talks with his Egyptian
counterpart Atef Obeid on enhancing bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed to beef up their annual trade
volume from less than 200 million U.S. dollars at present to some 1
billion dollars over the coming five years, Obeid told reporters
after the talks.
</P>
<P>
He called on Canada to open up market to Egypt's textiles and
handicrafts in a bid to reach the target.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' trade volume stood at 176 million dollars in
1999. Canada exports lumber, newsprint and high-technology products

contribution to Egypt's development projects, especially in the
field of infrastructure, irrigation and technology transfer.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Authorizes Interception of Polluting Oil Tankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian public court on
Wednesday authorized interception of foreign oil tankers polluting
the Iranian waters in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The court at the Kish Free Trade Zone issued the ruling after
the zone administration complained about the damage on the
environment of the resort island and sought compensation from the
oil tankers, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ruling also followed a crackdown on smuggled Iraqi oil in
the Gulf by Iran which has been under pressure from the West to do
so.
</P>
<P>
Director for Legal Affairs of the zone Mahmoud Alam said that
the tankers carrying the smuggled oil left behind oil slicks,
polluting the environment and endangering marine life.
</P>
<P>
The zone has reported the issue to the Iranian Ports and
Shipping Organization and provided films and slides to show the
extent of the oil slicks and contamination of water and
environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) recently
seized a dozen of oil tankers in the Gulf for being involved in the
smuggling and violation of Iranian territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Iran will not permit the use of Iranian territorial waters for
the smuggling of oil, an IRGC officer stressed.
</P>
<P>
The United States has said that the smuggling of oil enables
Iraq to obtain hard currency outside the U.N.-supervised oil-for-
food program which limits the export volume of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Demands Full South Access to Global Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo, chairman of the Group of 77 (G-77), Wednesday demanded "
full and active participation" of the developing South in the
management of international financial architecture, and the
concerted efforts to create the new, just and reasonable
international economic order.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his speech at the opening ceremony of the first
South Summit, Obasanjo said such participation is crucial for the
social development of developing countries facing the challenge of
the inter- and intra-state conflicts, the crushing debt burdens
and increasing marginalization in the tide of globalization of the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
"The South must take part in fully and actively in the
management of the international financial architecture," he said.
</P>
<P>
The globalization process "is marginalizing the South," he said.
"Collectively, we saw ourselves being disabled within the
international economic order."
</P>
<P>
"We resolve to act in unity to tackle common difficulties and
promote mutual interests," he said. "We believe that acting in
solidarity with the necessary social and economic transformation
of our countries, ...our coming together will assure our people a
dignified existence."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo made the remarks after the opening ceremony of the
first South Summit, which comes in the largest gathering of heads
of state and government of the Group of 77 (G-77) since its 1964
founding in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Describing G-77 as "an effective negotiating force within the U.
N. system he said, the body has been focusing its efforts on such
issues as trade, finance, social development and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries face today the challenge of formulating a
common vision and constructing a platform for collective action in
order to achieve a comprehensive formulation and forceful
articulation of their shared concerns and objectives.
</P>
<P>
The current Havana Summit is a unique opportunity to renew the
South's commitment to South-South cooperation and define an action
plan with clear targets and a time frame for its effective
implementation.
</P>
<P>
G-77, set up by 77 developing countries in June 1964 in Geneva,
has seen its membership growing to 133 countries, the original
name was retained due to its historic significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations, G-
77 is aimed at providing the means for the developing world to
articulate and promote its collective interests and enhance its
joint negotiating capacity on all major international economic
issues in the U.N. system, and promote economic and technical
cooperation among developing countries.

<HEADLINE> IMF: U.S. Economic Growth Will Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The IMF, in its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, said the U.
S. economy would likely ease to a "soft landing." But it cautioned
there was no evidence that growth, boosted by rising stock prices,
would slow on its own.
</P>
<P>
An alternative -- less likely -- scenario assumed a pickup in
global growth and inflation, followed by higher interest rates, a
25 percent correction in highly valued U.S. equity prices and a 20
percent slump in the dollar in response to a reversal of capital
flows, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
This would virtually bring U.S. growth to a halt and knock
almost a full percentage point off economic growth in the world
outlook next year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF recommended that the U.S. Federal Reserve probably need
to continue to move progressively but prudently to a tighter
monetary stance.
</P>
<P>
Since 1999, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five
times. But the IMF said the full effects of the rises in short-
term interests rates, coupled with a rapid increase in oil prices,
have yet to be fully seen.

<HEADLINE> Tech Selloff Drags Down Canada's Benchmark Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's benchmark index fell
sharply Tuesday as the country's high-tech companies slumped after
a disappointing earnings warning by wireless phone maker Motorola
Inc.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index (TSE 300) fell
102.91 points, or 1.1 percent, to 9,358.03.
</P>
<P>
Total trading was valued at 4.2 billion Canadian dollars (about
2.9 billion U.S. dollars), with 161 million shares changing hands
on the TSE, compared with a three-month daily average of 215
million.
</P>
<P>
Motorola dragged technology-related companies lower after it
said second-quarter earnings would fall short of analyst estimates.
</P>
<P>
Canada's largest telecommunications firm BCE Inc. fell 6.35
Canadian dollars (about 4.38 U.S. dollars) to 170.65 dollars (
about 117.75 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Networking firm Nortel Networks Corp. closed down 8.10 Canadian
dollars (about 5.59 U.S. dollars) at 170.05 dollars (about 117.33
U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
Fiber-optics equipment company JDS Uniphase Corp. fell 12
Canadian dollars (about 8.28 U.S. dollars) to 149 dollars (about
102.81 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was the second day in a row for the tech selloff at the
Toronto Stock Exchange amid concern that some technology stocks
are too expensive given the outlook for profit.
</P>
<P>
But some investors are convinced that technology stocks' slide
in recent weeks won't last.
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think we rally from here," said Brian Acker,
president of Acker Finley Inc. in Toronto. "We are really seeing
some unbelievable value. Technology has to be bought here," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Benchmark index for the first time late last month
broke the milestone record of 10,000 points, only to fall back
because of the fear that the high-tech led surprise rise may be
over-priced.
</P>
<P>
Despite tech fluctuations, the TSE 300 has still gained 11
percent this year, making it the best-performing major index in
North America and the second-best in the world after Sweden's OMX,
according to Canadian newspapers.

"We must acknowledge, if in frustration, that most of the

<HEADLINE> EU Squeezes for More Say on Networking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has pushed
for more say in computer networking by announcing a series of
recommendations to improve the functioning of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations, published Wednesday, reflected the EU
concerns over the dominance by the United States and U.S.-based
network solutions over the registry of Internet domain names.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet's capacity to unleash enterprises is beyond
question," said Erkki Liikanen, EU commissioner for the
information society.
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner added that the EU must now show that its
infrastructure can be run fairly and effectively to benefit all
its users.
</P>
<P>
The EU is unsatisfied with the implementation of the agreement
of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
that was reached two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, proposed to make the election of the ICANN's governing board
a more open and transparent process and to secure funding of the
ICANN in an open manner through the network of recently created
registries for domain names.
</P>
<P>
The commission also raised question about the fact that the
ICANN staff is dominated by U.S. personnel who lack the linguistic
capabilities necessary for a truly international organization.
</P>
<P>
The commission wanted rapid approval of the proposed ".eu" high
level domain.
</P>
<P>
This new domain name will coexist with the 15 national domain
names within the EU and will be available for cross-border
electronic commerce services, European institutions and non-profit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The EU recommendations were published as part of the union's
continuing efforts to accelerate European access to the Internet
and the EU deems it a top priority if the EU is to successfully
compete in the global e-commerce market.
</P>
<P>
Up until last year, the NSI had held exclusive rights to assign
domain names ending in ".com,.net" and ".org". But the U.S.
Department of Commerce, under pressure from various U.S. and non-U.
S. parties, has allowed competitors into this field.
</P>
<P>
But the NSI has kept control rights of the Internet name
registry which contains every address on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes to See More Effective South Role in World Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Wednesday voiced his belief that the peoples of the developing
South should play a more active and influential part in world
affairs, and said that the upcoming Millennium Summit will be an
opportunity for the South to express itself on major international
political and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his speech at the opening ceremony of the first
South Summit here, Annan said, "I have always believed that we,
the peoples of the South, should play a more active and
influential part in world affairs. We could do so with great
benefit to ourselves and to the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>
"But in the last resort, our doing so depends on our own
efforts -- those each nation makes on its own behalf, and those we
make to assist and learn from each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To assist that coordination and cooperation is one of the
main purposes of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
within which there is a Special Unit for Technical Cooperation
among Developing Countries," he said. "UNDP is making South-South
cooperation a pillar of its new approach."
</P>
<P>
The South Summit came as the largest gathering of heads of
state and government since the founding of the Group of 77 (G-77)
in 1964. The historic event was held less than five months before
the U.N. convocation of the Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
"In less than five months' time, the Millennium Summit will
offer us all a unique chance to mobilize the world's energy behind
a common agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Assembly and the Millennium Summit will be
convened in early September at the U.N. Headquarters in New York,
which is believed an opportunity to strengthen the U.N. role in
the new century.
</P>
<P>
"In that gathering, the voice of the South will be heard, and
heard good and loud," he said. "But what is even more important is
that the summit should lead to real improvements in people's lives,
especially in those of the poor."
</P>
<P>
"That means the South's voice must not only be loud but clear,
consistent and constructive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan has presented his Millennium report to the General
Assembly, which lists the choice of priorities on major issues
facing the world at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations, G-
77 has been an effective negotiating force in the 188-nation world
body to defend the collective interests of the South.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Compensate Stricken Workers at Atomic Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The plan, which has been under development for about a year and
must still be submitted to Congress, follows the acknowledgment by
the Energy Department earlier this year that workers involved in
building the nation's nuclear arsenal showed higher-than-normal
rates of several different kinds of cancer and other ailments,
based on a review of years of scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
The concession opened the door for compensation. Wednesday's
New York Times quoted government sources as saying the plan could
cost 400 million U.S. dollars over the first five years. But costs
would decline as the number of eligible workers declines.
</P>
<P>
Through the cold war and beyond, the Energy Department and its
predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, denied that
workers had received harmful doses of radiation.
</P>
<P>
And few of the workers qualified for workers' compensation,
because that was designed for sudden injuries that clearly
happened on the job, not ailments developed by chronic exposure.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal being unveiled, the government would assume
workers were exposed to the highest expected level of radiation
associated with their work if actual medical records were not
available.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department and its contractors routinely opposed
such payments for compensation based on supposed radiation

<HEADLINE> EP Rejects GMO Liability Clause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament
Wednesday rejected major changes to proposed laws governing
genetically-modified organisms (GMOs).
</P>
<P>
The proposed laws could have otherwise made GMO producers
liable for environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
The governments of the European Union member states and the
European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc,
have already agreed to a new authorization procedure for GMOs but
under the EU rules on co-decision, the European Parliament has new
rights to have more say on legislation.
</P>
<P>
The changes to proposed laws were rejected in the 626-member
assembly that met Wednesday in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
The changes have been attacked by Europe's biotech industry
which warned that the changes would have negative influence upon
biotech companies already stifled by "intolerable financial and
regulatory burden." They could have cost jobs and forced the
fledgling sector out of Europe altogether.
</P>
<P>
Green Europe members of the parliament, who argued the changes
were needed to protect public health, were disappointed by the
outcome of Wednesday's series vote.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the parliament, backed by consumer lobbies,
wanted to go even further and force those who produce GMOs to be
held liable for any damage they cause, either to the environment
or to public health.
</P>
<P>
The GMO approval process, provisionally agreed by the EU member
states last June, set a 10-year authorization period for new crops,
after which licenses would be reviewed. The process demanded
stricter regulation on labeling and tracking the GMOs through the
food chain.
</P>
<P>
No new genetically-modified crops have been approved in Europe
since April 1998, antagonizing the United States, the world's top
GMO grower.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Up in Both EU, Euro Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The volume of retail trade was
up in both the European Union and the euro zone in January this
year, Eurostat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
community said that the retail sales were up by 3.0 percent for
the 15-nation bloc and up by 2.3 percent in the 11-nation euro
zone, compared with the figures in January last year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Germany, all EU countries have registered increases,
ranging Spain's 8.6 percent to Italy's 1.1 percent. In Germany,
however, the retail sales fell by 3.2 percent as against January
last year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with December last year, the retail trade was up by 0.
3 percent in both the EU and euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales fell in Germany for the third consecutive month in
January, by 1.9 percent as against last December.
</P>
<P>
The increase of retail sales has contributed to the economic
growth in the European Union and the euro zone as well. The gross
domestic product grew by 0.8 percent in the European Union and by
0.9 percent in the euro zone in the fourth quarter of last year,
according to Eurostat.

<HEADLINE> Romanian-Hungarian Battalion Holds Drill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A Romanian-Hungarian joint
battalion Wednesday proceeded to the final phase of the Open
Windows-Ro-2000 drill of troops and transmission.
</P>
<P>
The drill was meant to train the battalion command and troops
for peace-keeping actions, as well as to increase the experience
concerning such operations in keeping with NATO standards.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six Romanian troops of the Infantry Battalion Arad 191
and sixty-six Hungarian troops of the Hodmezovasharhely Brigade 62,
Battalion 2, participate in the drill.
</P>
<P>
The drill unfolds upon a fictitious scenario in which a
southeast European country -- Colo Republic -- goes under a
military dictatorship after 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to the story, the Colo Republic is currently "
politically, financially and economically isolated because of its
own home and foreign policy." Under OSCE aegis, the joint Romanian-
Hungarian battalion carries on in the Colo Republic a peace-
keeping and humanitarian aid mission in conditions of heavy floods.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries decided to make up the joint
battalion when their defense ministers met in the Hungarian city
of Debrecen in February 1997. The battalion counts 1,000 soldiers,
among whom 500 are Romanians and 500 Hungarians. Its main
objective is to carry out missions of peacekeeping and
humanitarian aid in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The battalion became operational at the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Up to 25,000 Serbs to Return to Kosovo: NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Up to 25,000 Serbs are expected
to return to Kosovo in the coming months, said an official of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the
figure was an estimate and could be on the optimistic side of it.
</P>
<P>
Between 100,000 and 200,000 Kosovar Serbs have left the
Yugoslav province since last June since the 78-day NATO air
campaign forced out the Yugoslav army and police forces from the
province. The Serbs left for fear of violent revenge by ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The same NATO official said that some 18,000 more ethnic
Albanians were also expected to return.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Western military alliance was keen for Serbs
to return to the province and its peacekeeping forces KFOR in
Kosovo were ready to guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
Many Serbs left Kosovo due to justifiable fear of reprisals by
ethnic Albanians but many others had nothing to feel guilty about,
added the official who admitted that the return of Serbs to Kosovo
would be difficult in that the ethnic relations remain tense in
the province.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs remaining in Kosovo are estimated to number 100,000
as against an ethnic Albanian population of 1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and NATO to end the air campaign, the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia can return some 1,000 officials to Kosovo to guard
Serb monuments and officiate the borders with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 regards Kosovo
as an integral part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Restore Ecological Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Minister of Waters,
Forestry and Environment Protection Romica Tomescu Wednesday
called for more efforts in tree planting so as to restore the
country's ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
"Almost 50 percent of the forest ecosystems are ecologically
unbalanced" although Romania still has virgin natural forest
massifs, exceptional in biodiversity and stability, the minister
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of how big Romania's economic difficulties could be,
the increase in wood areas has not to be conditioned by the size
of the sacrifice," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
For about half a century the woods' biodiversity has been
diminishing, some types of ecosystems disappeared even before they
were scientifically known, Minister Tomescu said, adding that
felling was the main reason, to which pollution, drought, grazing,
and hydrotechnical works were added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the strategy for long-lasting development of
Romanian forestry over 2000-2020, Tomescu said it is necessary
that, on the average, 35-40 percent of the country's territory be
covered by woods and other forms of forest vegetation.
</P>
<P>
"As many as 243,000 ha of land have to be planted by 2010 and
added to the forest fund existing in 1989, and another 715,000 ha
by 2020, so the total is of 958,000 ha," added Romica Tomescu,
stressing that the land for afforestation will come from a cut
down in the farmland.
</P>
<P>
Tomescu also said that "in order to avoid the isolation of
Romanian forestry, with very bad consequences in the entire
national economy, its integration into the European programs and
structures is a priority as important as the development of
scientific research in the field."

<HEADLINE> Southern African Countries Seek to Sell More Ivory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Sun Huixia
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Four southern African countries
are seeking permission to sell more ivory from the ongoing 11th
conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species here, saying that highly controlled ivory trade will
benefit their countries.
</P>
<P>
Botswana delegation head Garyland Kombani told Xinhua on
Wednesday that the habitat for the species became too small since
106,000 elephants in his country occupied an area that could
handle only 50,000.
</P>
<P>
"They are even becoming a danger to themselves due to the
limited food sources and the herd is growing by five percent a
year," Garyland noted.
</P>
<P>
The stocks of ivory are useless if they are not sold and also
cost a lot of money to preserve them, Garyland said.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Zimbabwe delegation Simon Khaya Moyo emphasized the
mutual beneficial relation between humans and elephants.
</P>
<P>
"Habitat for wildlife will only be preserved on a large scale
if this preservation benefit people, and it is therefore
critically important that we reconcile nature and human needs in
ways that serve both humans and wildlife," Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has demanded an annual quota of 30 tons; Botswana
12 tons; Namibia 2 tons, and Zimbabwe 10 tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Namibia were approved by the
10th CITES meeting to export 59 tons of ivory experimentally to
Japan. The total ban on ivory trade was imposed in 1990 due to a
sharp decline of the elephant population in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya and India strongly oppose relaxing the ivory ban
and demand a return to the total ban.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya would oppose lifting the ban until poaching is brought
under control," Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi said Monday in
his opening statement for the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Wildlife Service said that poaching was on the rise
following the one-off experimental sale of ivory to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Britain Supports Congo Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain is determined to play its
part in international efforts to support the peace process in the
war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the British High
Commission in Zimbabwe said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to financial support already provided to the Joint
Military Commission and the National dialogue, we are now able to
offer further help, a technical adviser to the Facilitator of the
National Dialogue," the High Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Philip Walker, who had worked
extensively in Central Africa over the last 20 years, began his
work in Gaborone, Botswana, this week.
</P>
<P>
Walker would assist the facilitator in all aspects of the
National Dialogue, including helping coordinate support from
international donors, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said, "Britain believes that it is vital that an open and
inclusive inter-Congolese dialogue, as provided for in the Lusaka
Agreement, gets underway soon."
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka cease-fire agreement, which was signed by all
parties involved in the two-year DRC conflict in July and August
last year, seeks to bring peace to the second largest country in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Since August 1998, Zimbabwe, together with other allies, has
deployed troops in the DRC to fight Rwanda and Uganda backed
rebels who are trying to oust the government of President Laurent
Kabila.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Open Skies Idea Criticized by COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has said that the newly introduced open
skies agreement by the United States may affect the region's
liberalization of air-transport program, the Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Open skies agreement permit unrestricted air service by
airlines of different countries to and from the United States and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
The regional grouping would institute measures aimed at
discouraging member states from signing the agreement, said COMESA
Director of infrastructure and development Jerome Ntibarekerwa.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview in Lusaka on Tuesday that although
progress had been made to fully liberalize the air transport
program which will come into effect in October this year, the
program would not be achieved if member countries sign the open
skies agreement.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of air transport is important as it would enable
the COMESA member states to promote the growth of regional
economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said COMESA would also strengthen the rules and regulations
so that member states can benefit from the air industry
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"We would soon call a meeting with member states to discuss the
rules and regulations as well as to educate them on the effects of
entering into an agreement with open skies agreement," the
director was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Africans should not allow situations where a plane coming from
the United States comes and picks people from three African
countries. This would make the air program ineffective," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the only answer to the investment opportunities in the
COMESA region is to implement the liberalization of air transport.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is now working with relevant authorities and the
region's airlines on a program to remove air traffic controls,
with the aim of eventual removal of all air traffic controls
except for those concerned with safety.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the COMESA interim air transport regulatory board
meeting is scheduled to take place in two weeks' time in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to discuss the way forward for the air
transport.
</P>
<P>
The countries that constitute the board are Zambia, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Namibia, Sudan and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Improve Indigenization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe needs to improve
implementation of the indigenization policy by developing an
action plan to expedite the empowerment process, said Minister of
State Cephas Msipa on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the signing ceremony of a research project
on the state of indigenization between the ministry and the
Scientific Industrial Research and Development Centre.
</P>
<P>
The action plan could only be formulated after determining the
achievements and constraints to the indigenization process so far,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The research study, he said, would give the indeginization
process the necessary direction to effectively realize the
expectations of the action plan.
</P>
<P>
The study would also establish indicators to provide relevant
information for proposing the way forward in putting in place
specific policy measures and incentives, he said.
</P>
<P>
"After the launching of the policy framework on indigenization
in February 1998, it is crucial that we undertake a survey to find
out where the indigenous Zimbabweans are in terms of participation
in the mainstream economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, information from the study would be
useful to the government and indigenization lobby groups.
</P>
<P>
The government is working out legislative incentives to promote
 implementation of an employee stock ownership scheme to accord
workers a stake in the companies they work for, he said.
</P>
<P>
He commended some large corporations which had come up with
their own programs to help develop an indigenous private sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa Wednesday urged the country's industry to be
export-oriented to earn more foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of the Export Credit Guarantee
Corporation (ECGC) in Harare, the minister said, "a buoyant export
sector is vital for any economy to realize its growth and
development potential for it is through exporting that we
guarantee adequate foreign exchange flows into the economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of adequate foreign currency generation, he
said, Zimbabwe is severely constrained in its ability to realize
full productive potential as the country relies heavily on
imported machinery and raw materials for production.
</P>
<P>
"The government is cognizant of the fact that exports are not
only important simply for their contribution to foreign exchange
inflows, but also because of their key role in a country's
industrialization process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said as an export promotion agency with an intention of
introducing private participation and owned by the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe, ECGC would increase its focus towards reinsurance,
market research and the securing of lines of credit to support
export business.
</P>
<P>
The corporation would assist the government to achieve the
objectives of stabilizing the Zimbabwean dollar and resolving the
foreign currency crisis prevailing in the economy, he said.

focus on eradicating poverty worldwide before trying to create
peace and stability, South African Foreign Affairs Minister
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Wednesday at the G77 South Summit
in Havana, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A statement from South African Foreign Affairs Department

Dlamini-Zuma was invited as the first speaker to outline South

"She said that the vision of the UN expressed in its Charter
and founding documents is outlined clearly, and there is a need
to examine its track record to assess where it has succeeded and
where there have been obstacles," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also pointed out that although the UN had done
well with performing peace keeping operations, it was usually
done after conflict had developed.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to prevent conflicts, hence the need for the
UN to develop an early warning system, with the view of being able
to take preemptive measures before conflicts actually start,"
Dlamini-Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the UN and its institutions should play a greater
role in creating democracy and good governance and addressing the
needs and peculiarities of different countries as there is no
"one size fits all" model democracy.

LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
promised to stimulate local fish production in an effort to reduce
its dependence on fish import.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria Wednesday quoted Agriculture
Minister Alhaji Daura as saying that an annual expenditure of 30
billion naira (300 million U.S. dollars) on importation of fish
has worried the Nigerian government a lot.
</P>
<P>
He told executive members of the National Union of Fishermen
and Seafood that the sum was spent to meet the yearly fish demand
of 1. 2 million tons in Nigeria, because the country can only
produce 350,000 tons of fish every year.
</P>
<P>
The minister promised to reduce the country's dependence on
fish imports and work towards stimulating local fish production
through favorable government policies on fisheries and allied
products.
</P>
<P>
"Through you and through our departments of fisheries of the
ministry, if we are able to galvanize our fishermen as well as our
fish farmers, within a space of time, we can reduce substantially
the importation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And gradually, overtime, given the commitment, we can even
stop importing fish," he added.

</P>
<P>
The cult also accommodated people from different areas of the
country and others from Uganda, without informing concerned
authorities, which is in contravention of the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister of Justice and Institutional Relations Jean

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Launches Month of Action for Food Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is making efforts to ensure
food hygiene and safety by launching here Wednesday the Month of
Action for Food Safety and Hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Attending the launching ceremony, held by the country's Health
Ministry and Hanoi People's Committee, were representatives of the
World Health Organization, the Embassy of Japan, the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization and the Asian Development Bank,according
to a report of Vietnam News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Month of Action for Food Safety and Hygiene will last from
April 15 to May 15 with the aim of broadening knowledge and
ensuring the practice of hygiene and food safety by production,
processing and trading establishments, particularly small and
medium establishments,food stands in markets and on streets and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to improve the state's management in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Health Minister Do Nguyen Phuong said the number of
acute food poisoning cases has increased. Major cases involving
many people frequently occur at funeral parties and in the dining
halls of factories, enterprises and schools.
</P>
<P>
People's knowledge of food safety and hygiene is very poor and
many people in the food industry are also uninformed and will do
anything to make profit while paying no attention to the health of
consumers, Phuong stressed.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem encouraged the
entire people to take part in the Month of Action for Food Safety
and Hygiene and called for assistance from foreign countries and
international organizations in this field.
</P>
<P>
As many as 45 food poisoning cases were reported, affecting 1,
530 victims in the first three months of this year, according to
reports from 39 out of the 61 cities and provinces nationwide. Of
the victims, 17 died. In the same period last year, 1,451 people
suffered food poisoning and 18 of them died.

<HEADLINE> India, Germany Start Strategic Dialogue (repeat, add title and first name of German official) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- India and Germany opened here
on Wednesday their first-ever "strategic dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The Indo-German strategic dialogue discussed at length some
major issues like the need for concerted international efforts to
combat terrorism and drug trafficking and on disarmament and non-
proliferation, said visiting German State Secretary in the Federal
Foreign Office Wolfgang Ischinger said.
</P>
<P>
Both Ischinger and his Indian counterpart, Lalit Mansingh, said
such dialogue would take place biannually and alternately in the
two countries to demonstrate their intention to work more closely
in the bilateral and international spheres.
</P>
<P>
Ischinger called for intense negotiations on air traffic
between the two countries and the establishment of a "green card"
system to allow German businesses to hire highly qualified Indian
software engineers.
</P>
<P>
The German government was set to open its doors to Indian
information specialists and the German industry could absorb 10,
000 or even more Indian experts in the information technology (IT)
sector, said Ischinger.
</P>
<P>
The Indian authorities had assured him that the German need for
IT specialists could be easily met, he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing 2000 as a "German year in India," Ischinger said
India would be the first stop for the first-ever visit to Asia by
Germany's new Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer next month.
</P>
<P>
In September, German Federal President Johannes Rau will also
pay a state visit to India and open the first-ever German cultural
festival to be held in India, he added.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Insists on Probe on Tax Credit Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered that the investigation into a multi-billion-
peso tax credit scam should continue full-blast even if it would
implicate his friends in the case, Philippine News Agency said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora was quoted as saying
Wednesday that the president sees no reason to stop the
investigation, even with reports alleging that his friend Dane Tan
benefited from the tax credit scam.
</P>
<P>
"The president's instruction was to proceed with the probe
regardless of who is linked to it. He wants the probe to go on and
he wants results," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He said Task Force 156, which was created by the president to
investigate the anomalies involving the issuance of fake tax
credit certificates during the past administration, has so far
uncovered the involvement of former officials of the Department of
Finance and oil firms and other large corporations in the scam.
</P>
<P>
"We have so far confirmed 4.5 billion pesos (112 million U.S.
dollars) in anomalies. As can be gleaned from the documents with
us,perhaps the amount involved would reach 8 billion pesos (200
million dollars)," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Those who would eventually be implicated in the scam already
knew the risks they were taking and would have no one else to
blame, he added.

<HEADLINE> IMF: World Economy to Grow 4.2 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The world economy is expected
to grow 4.2 percent this year and slow to 3.9 percent in 2001, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, in its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, said
global growth is now estimated to have reached 3.3 percent in 1999
compared with a projection of only 2.2 percent prepared at the end
of 1998, at the height of financial market turbulence and the low
point in the associated confidence crisis.
</P>
<P>
"North America and the emerging market countries of Asia
account for much of the stronger growth picture but other regions
also contribute," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
It said the global downturn in the wake of the crises in Asia
and other emerging market countries since 1997 now appears to have
been relatively mild and brief.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence of a strong rebound in the global economy has
continued to accumulate in recent months and the momentum of the
recovery from the 1997-98 slowdown has proven much stronger than
anticipated," the IMF said.

<HEADLINE> (Updated With More Details) IMF Sees World Economy Growing 4.2 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, the IMF said global
growth is now estimated to have reached 3.3 percent in 1999
compared with a projection of only 2.2 percent prepared at the end
of 1998, at the height of financial market turbulence and the low
point in the associated confidence crisis.
</P>
<P>
The release of the IMF's economic outlook marked the start of
several days of preliminary events leading to the formal opening
of the IMF and World Bank's spring meetings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"North America and the emerging market countries of Asia
account for much of the stronger growth picture but other regions
also contribute," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
It said the global downturn in the wake of the crises in Asia
and other emerging market countries since 1997 now appears to have
been relatively mild and brief.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence of a strong rebound in the global economy has
continued to accumulate in recent months and the momentum of the
recovery from the 1997-98 slowdown has proven much stronger than
anticipated," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, which had been forced by the 1997-98 currency crisis
to consistently lower its forecasts, said it is now in the
pleasant position of boosting its estimates, largely because of
the continued unexpected strength in the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF cautioned that a sudden plunge in the U.S.
stock market and a "hard landing" for the U.S. economy is one of
the leading risks to its forecast.
</P>
<P>
It mentioned threats from a sudden plunge in the U.S. stock
market that would shake consumer confidence, and the country's
huge and growing trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Japan's recovery from its long recession was "tentative and
fragile" and Europe had to ensure it did not kill off an upturn
with unnecessary rate rises.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, noting that the dollar appeared overvalued against
Europe's single currency, the euro, also said it was worried about
"significant misalignments" of several key currencies and about "
very high stock market valuations."
</P>
<P>
External imbalances around the world were also a cause for
concern, primarily the wide U.S. current account deficit and
persistently large surpluses in Japan, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also said Britain and Canada would need to tighten
monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures.

<HEADLINE> BoE Chief Casts Doubt On Euro Timing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, has said that membership of the first wave of the
single currency would have put the UK's record-breaking economic
performance at risk.
</P>
<P>
It would be best for Britain to stay out until there was
greater convergence between the UK and the Euroland economy, he
told a business audience in Bradfor Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The governor said, "If we had joined EMU from the start and had
Eurozone interest rates over the past year or so, it is very
difficult to envisage how we could have avoided an inflationary
boom in this country."
</P>
<P>
He said there had been some disappointment but also
considerable relief at the decision since Britain "could have been
the elephant in the rowing boat."
</P>
<P>
His speech came as the European Commission admitted that the
euro will be a lame duck on the international exchanges for at
least two years
</P>
<P>
George also insisted that scrapping the pound was "
fundamentally a political rather than an economic issue" which
would mean giving up control over "important aspects of public
policy."
</P>
<P>
His view is significant because the government's tests for
assessing whether to join the euro after the next election,
expected in 2001 or 2002, require "sustainable convergence."
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the governor has appeared skeptical. In
December last year, he said the City of London had "thrived" since
the euro's launch.

MOSCOW, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military Wednesday
arrested a deputy commander of a federal troop division deployed
in the republic of Chechnya on charges of attempting to get five
militants to a safe place.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Savchenko had demanded the five militants -- three
Arabs and two Chechens -- to pay him 5,000 U.S. dollars each for
his assistance, the Interfax news agency citing the Russian
military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
When the vehicle carrying the officer and the five rebels was
stopped at a checkpoint by federal servicemen, the Arabs opened
fire, but they were killed in the subsequent fighting.
</P>
<P>
The two Chechens were taken into custody and Savchenko was
arrested.

<P>
OTTAWA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A Vancouver-based Canadian cable
and Internet company has reported a security breach to its
customer credit card and accounts, the country's National Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the breach, which was discovered on
Monday, involved as many as 1,300 customer accounts belonging to
Internet service provider -- idirect.com -- owned by Look
Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
Personal information on credit card numbers and users'
passwords were accessible on the Internet, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"They were all Canadian accounts and the company has taken
steps to shut down the leak," Al Finn, director of risk security
at Visa Canada, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Look Communications has called in Deloitte and Touche
consultants to assess the damage done to its business, Finn added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in the past two months that a Canadian
e-commerce company has reported a security breach.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an international police investigation led to the
arrests of two 18-year-old computer hackers in Wales, who were
found to have stolen information on 23,000 credit card holders
from web sites, including one belonging to a Toronto company, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Haider Arrives in Brussels for EU Committee Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Austrian far-right leader Joerg
Haider arrived here on Wednesday, amidst protests at the airport,
for a European Union (EU) regional committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Haider, whose party's integration into the Austrian coalition
government has sustained strong opposition from across the EU,
arrived three hours ahead of schedule to shun organized protests.
</P>
<P>
Haider is expected to attend the 33rd EU regional committee
meeting as governor of Austria's Carinthia State.
</P>
<P>
Austria has been isolated by its 14 EU partners since Wolfgang
Schuessel struck a power-sharing deal with Haider's Freedom Party
early February.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian authorities tightened security at the airport to
ensure that nothing should go wrong with Haider's arrival. Haider
canceled his trip to Brussels last month due to anti-facist
demonstrations around the Austrian embassy and the EU regional
committee headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Austria's EU partners agreed early February to isolate Austria,
refusing to promote or accept any bilateral official contacts with
it at political level and giving no support for Austrian
candidates seeking positions in international institutions; thus
Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals will only be received at a
technical level.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, one of several EU member states that strongly oppose
to the integration of Haider's far-right party into Austria's
coalition government, warned that the integration would be a
dangerous precedent to incorporate the extreme rightists into any
EU government.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, said it would follow carefully the development in Austria,
urging Austria to fully and properly apply all EU rules and laws.
</P>
<P>
Haider has resigned from the leadership of the Freedom Party
though some critics argued that he made the move in order to
advance in future toward the post of federal chancellor that is
now being held by Schuessel.

<HEADLINE> Key Interest Rates Raised by 0.25 Percent in Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian central bank
Wednesday raised its key interest rates for loans to commercial
banks by 0.25 percent to 5.75 percent in a bid to counter
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks also raised their day-to-day loan rate from 7.
5 to 7.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the Norges Bank has raised its key rates
since August 1998. The rates, staying as high as 8 percent in
January 1999, had been cut five times till September.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that this move is in response to a forecast on
economic growth higher than the previous one, which might bring
about more inflation.
</P>
<P>
In March, the central bank revised the projected economic
growth for this year to 1.5 percent, nearly doubling the previous
figure. The forecast inflation rate was also raised to 2.75
percent, 0.5 percent higher than the previous figure.

<HEADLINE> First South Summit Opens in Havana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The first South Summit opened on
Wednesday at the Havana International Conference Center in the
largest gathering of heads of state and government since the
establishment of the Group of 77 (G-77) in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The summit, scheduled to end on April 14, was held in
accordance with the decision adopted by the 21st Ministerial
Meeting of the G-77 in September 1997 at the United Nations
headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
Cuban President Fidel Castro and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, among other leaders, are to address the opening ceremony
chaired by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, whose country
holds the G-77 chairmanship for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, leaders will focus on the broad themes of
globalization, knowledge and technology, South-South cooperation
and North-North relations.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting opened following preparatory meetings of
senior officials and foreign ministers from 133 G-77 member states
in the developing South.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 heads of state or government, along with 70 foreign
ministers and other senior officials, including their respective
ambassador to Cuba, gathered in Havana for the summit.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that 122 member countries have sent delegations,
as had 34 non-member countries and 36 international organizations,
such as the United Nations and the Non-align Movement.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, head of the Chinese government
delegation, was present at the opening ceremony. China has long
been in close ties with G-77, and Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe
Perez Roque, at a press conference here on Monday, spoke highly of
China's support for the group.
</P>
<P>
From the South Summit will emerge two final documents -- the
Havana Declaration and the Program of Action. The forward-looking
declaration will set out a vision and broad strategy for the
future while the action-oriented program will clearly define
measures, targets and time frames for implementation, G-77
officials said.
</P>
<P>
G-77 was founded on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries in
Geneva. Although its current membership has increased to 133
countries, the original name was retained because of its historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, the organization provides means
for the developing world to articulate and promote its collective
economic interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on
all major international economic issues in the United Nations
system, and promote economic and technical cooperation among
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Russia's State Duma Blames PACE for Suspending Russia's Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma (lower house
of the parliament) on Wednesday condemned a resolution of the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) to suspend
Russia's membership.
</P>
<P>
A statement passed by 383 support votes, 3 against and one
abstention, said that "PACE sanctions, limitation of rights and
unilateral dictation toward Russia are unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The Russian parliamentarians said the "unfounded and unjust"
resolution was attempted to limit the Russian delegation's voting
power.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma said that the resumption of full-scale
cooperation between Russia and PACE is possible only after the
latter abandons the "discriminatory position" on Russia.
</P>
<P>
Last week, PACE voted for limiting the Russian delegation's
rights and initiating suspension proceedings against Russia's
membership in the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma also expressed its support for the position of
the Russian delegation at PACE's spring session, describing the
delegation's decision to withdraw from the session as "justified."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK Media Urged Not to Advocate "Taiwan Independence" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
stressed here Wednesday that Hong Kong media have the
responsibility to safeguard China's unity and territorial
integrity after Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong media should not spread and advocate the 'two
states' theory and 'independence of Taiwan'," said Wang Fengchao,
deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's
Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region at a
forum on the one-China principle and the Taiwan issue, sponsored
by the Hong Kong Association of Journalists.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with a Hong Kong cable TV station,
Annette Lu, a member of the Taiwan-based People Progressive Party,
openly advocated "Taiwan independence," which challenged the one-
China principle and stirred animosity between the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the issue of national unity is a cardinal one
of right and wrong, on which the media of Hong Kong should share a
common view. "It has nothing to do with freedom of press," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the media in Hong Kong to proceed from the unity of
the country, which is in the ultimate interest of the Chinese
nation. The separatist statements should not be treated as
ordinary news stories on different points of view, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The media should act cautiously on issues concerning national
interests," Wang said, adding that while maintaining an
independent policy of editing, the media should make decisions in
the interest of national unity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Slam Israeli Settlement Expansion on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday lashed out at an Israeli decision
to expand settlement on the Golan Heights as "a provocative act"
that will obstruct the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said in a statement that the construction of new
housing units on the strategic plateau that Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war "blocks the windows" of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel said on Tuesday that it had approved the building of 200
more homes on the Golan as it foresaw no early resumption of
negotiations with Damascus on the return of the heights.
</P>
<P>
"This new step is provocative and does not help in creating an
atmosphere of trust to restart the peace process in the region,"
the Arab League chief said.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed peace negotiations last December after
a break of around four years, but the talks were suspended in
January because of their dispute over the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal from the
plateau, while Israel rejects it. All efforts to revive the talks
have failed so far.
</P>
<P>
There are about 18,000 Jewish settlers on the heights.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid called on Russia, the United Nations and the United
States to play a more effective role in pressuring Israel to
respect the principles of peace.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Protest Nullifying of Election Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Iranian people held a
rally before the Interior Ministry in Tehran on Wednesday to
protest a decision made by the Guardians Council (GC) to nullify
certain votes of the sixth parliamentary elections held in
February.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who had traveled to Tehran from the northwestern
city of Khalkhal, were carrying placards denouncing the GC for
nullifying the votes of 21 ballot boxes, thereby changing the
election result in the constituency, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They called on the Interior Ministry to send a special team to
investigate the so-called vote rigging that is definitely
unfounded, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people have been jailed in Khalkhal following protests
by angry residents in the city since last Thursday, when the
conservative GC overturned results from city voting booths,
depriving a reformist candidate of victory and handing it to his
conservative rival.
</P>
<P>
Reformers supporting President Mohammad Khatami won more than 75
percent of the seats in the new parliament in a landslide victory
which humiliated the powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The election results have caused political tension in Iran. And
recent events, including the abortive assassination attempt against
prominent reformer, Saeed Hajjarian, and the summoning of famous
reformist journalists by the press court, make people worry about
the country's political future.
</P>
<P>
The GC, as the watchdog of the elections, has not yet approved
the soundness of the first-round election results in 28
constituencies involving some 60 candidates.
</P>
<P>
Those constituencies include the capital Tehran, where reformers
seized at least 29 of the 30 seats.

<HEADLINE> Peace Zone Declared in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) signed an agreement Wednesday
declaring an irrigation project area in Mindanao as a peace zone,
Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by President Joseph Estrada's special
emissary Roberto Aventajado and MILF chief Hashim Salamat in Camp
Abubakar, the rebel group's headquarters in Matanog, Maguindanao
Province.
</P>
<P>
Witnessing the signing were Edgardo Batenga, chairman of the
government peace panel, and Aleem Mimbantas, chairman of the MILF
peace panel.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to halt all hostilities in the project area in
order to ensure that the irrigation project is completed on time,"
Aventajado was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
When completed in 200l, the 1-billion-peso (25-million-U.S.
dollar)project will irrigate some 10,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, also chairman of the Presidential Committee on
Flagship Programs and Projects, stressed that development is the
key to peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Estrada endorsed the MILF Economic
Development Committee's plan to develop Muslim Mindanao,
particularly those places within MILF camps.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the conversion of the MILF camps into
special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
"President Estrada fully supports the MILF plan because he
believes that once the projects are realized, they will contribute
to the national government's efforts in the peace-building
initiatives in Mindanao," said Aventajado.

MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph

for implementing reforms in the country's educational system,
Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was quoted as saying that while he has approved the
recommendations contained in a report of the Presidential
Commission on Educational Reforms (PCER), some measures may be

</P>
<P>
"I approved the report's recommendations. I hope to make them
effective immediately, though some need the nod of Congress before
they can be implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also asked lawmakers to stop establishing new
state colleges and universities in their districts, saying this
dilutes limited government resources for basic education.
</P>
<P>
"Aside from the high costs, this lowers the quality of
education,"he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the PCER submitted to the president its
recommendations for improving the quality of education in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Union Urges New Survival Kit for Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing 10th Triennial
Delegates Conference of Singapore's National Trades Union Congress
emphasized the need to develop a new survival kit for the country'
s workers and help them find their ways through uncharted
territory.
</P>
<P>
In his work report to the conference Wednesday, the congress'
Secretary-General Lim Boon Heng said there will be more job
changes, shorter job tenure and more churn for workers in the new
economy, which will make some revel in this new environment and
others "confused,perplexed, unsure and scared."
</P>
<P>
He said the union should spend the time it has developing a new
survival kit for workers whose welfare in the new economy depends
less on employers and whose primary concern will be to have jobs
and to have the skills for the jobs.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the elements of this survival kit will include union
membership, skills, life-long learning and employment assistance,
portable medical benefits and personal savings for unemployment
and emergency rations.
</P>
<P>
"The new survival kit for workers in the new economy must
recognize that we are responsible for our own employability and
earning capacity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are responsible for seizing opportunities provided by
employers and government to upgrade our skills," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the social safety net should be based on '
portability' and "saving as we work."
</P>
<P>
"We should save-as-we-earn for medical coverage, for old age
and for the risk of unemployment," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 delegates from various trade unions in the country
are attending the two-day conference starting Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Singapore's acting Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong delivered a long speech on a number of issues closely
related to workers' interests and representatives from some
international and overseas national unions, including Vice-
Chairman of All-China Federation of Trade Unions Xu Xicheng,
delivered messages of congratulation to the conference.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India to Hold Talks on Railway Service  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani and Indian officials
have agreed to meet on April 14 at their border to discuss matters
relating the railway service connecting the two countries,
Pakistani officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Pakistan Railways Javed Ashraf disclosed this and
expressed his welcome to the agreement in an interview with the
state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) here.
</P>
<P>
He said senior officials of the two countries will be meeting
on Friday at Zero Line of the border in Wagha, 30 kilometers east
of Pakistan's second largest city, Lahore.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of satisfaction that Indian Railways
authorities have realized the need of strictly complying with the
1991 agreement between the two countries on the Samjhota Express,"
Ashraf said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in 1991, India and Pakistan agreed
to jointly operate the Samjhota Express, the only railway link
between the two South Asian neighbors, each for six months in a
year.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Railways discontinued its service in May 1994 on the
ground that smuggling and terrorism were carried out via the cross-
border railway service.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Samjhota Express has been running by Pakistan
Railways only,according to APP.
</P>
<P>
Recently Pakistan Railways, via the Pakistani Foreign Office,
informed India that it would also stop the service if India
refuses to discuss the matter before April 15, 2000.

NEW DELHI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Militants made an abortive
attempt to target an army convoy with a car bomb in Srinagar,
capital of India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, Wednesday, but the
explosion only seriously injured a passer-by, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
An India-made Maruti car packed with explosives was blown up by
militants with a remote control at the Rawalpora bypass in the

</P>

However, army personnel travelling in a fleet of vehicles had a
narrow escape from the explosion and only a passer-by was
seriously wounded by flying splinters, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
No militant outfit has claimed responsibility for this incident
so far, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in several separate encounters between the militants
and security forces in Kashmir since Tuesday evening, nine people,
including seven militants and a Border Security Force soldier,
were killed and five security personnel, one of them a senior

<HEADLINE> Row Erupts over Aid to India's Tiger Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Sun Huixia
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A report by wildlife experts has
 recommended that financial assistance to tiger conservation in
India be cut off unless the south Asian country shows it is
efficient in using money to protect the big cat.
</P>
<P>
Despite millions of dollars in aid, India's wild tiger
population is being heavily poached, apparently by gangs of
organized and well-funded hunters, according to a newly released
report by wildlife experts working for the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
However, Indian officials attending the CITES meeting said here
on Wednesday that the recommendation could do great harm to tiger
conservation in India, which hosts about half of the population.
</P>
<P>
"We need financial support in order to continue tiger
conservation. If financial aid is suspended, the team that
prepared the report will be responsible for the illegal killing of
tigers in the future," head of the Indian delegation Suresh Sharma
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sharma claimed that the report portrayed an unfairly bleak
picture of tiger conservation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have done what we can on the basis of the available
resources and our country has generally gone beyond what CITES has
recommended in protecting the big cat," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report will be discussed in the coming few days of the
CITES conference, which lasts from April 10 through 20.
</P>
<P>
Wild tigers are under severe threat from habitat loss and
poaching, plummeting from over 100,000 in the 19th century to just
5,000 to 7,000 now, ranging from India and Russia to China and
some southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups argue that one of the greatest threat to
the wild tiger is illegal hunting and the effective way to curb
poaching is to stop the use of tiger parts as medicine.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Ivory Stocks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe currently holds 24 tons
of ivory in stockpiles, which have been increasing since 1997,
according to a report available at the ongoing international
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by Zimbabwean Ministry of Mines,
Environment and Tourism and made available at the 11th meeting of
the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), highlights the sources of
the stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
The report reveals the country's ivory status from 1997 to
1999, saying that most of the stocks are under the Department of
National Parks and Wildlife Management.
</P>
<P>
It says that the increase of ivory stocks since 1997 is
attributed to " continuous increase of elephant population coupled
with a high rate of recovery of ivory from natural mortality."
</P>
<P>
The increase is also a result of problem animal control
recoveries, that is, elephants are shot because they pose a
problem when they invade communal land due to increased
population, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Other sources of ivory stocks include the confiscated poached
ivory and insignificant amount of legal hunting.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had an elephant population of 70,000 in 1999 as
against 43,000 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"With or without culling, ivory will continue to be produced
from well managed elephant herd in southern Africa and the
product has to be marketed to the best of the advantage of the
Range states." the reported added.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing CITES meeting, Zimbabwe, together with Botswana,
Namibia and South Africa, have proposed a further authorization
for trade in elephant products under strict conditions.
</P>
<P>
The CITES meeting, held in Zimbabwe's capital Harare in 1997,
agreed Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe could make a one-time and
highly-controlled experimental sale of their existing ivory
stocks to Japan.

<P>
Redman was quoted on Wednesday by South African Press

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is locked in a
new disagreement over wine with the European Union after the two
sides began to implement a trade and cooperation deal on January
1.
</P>
<P>
The director for bilateral trade relations in South African
department of trade, Tshediso Matona, said on Wednesday that South
Africa had expressed "strongest reservations" over the EU's
failure to implement a wine quota from that date.
</P>
<P>
He told a joint meeting of Parliament's trade, foreign affairs
and agriculture committees that an annex to the deal said the EU
would offer a quota once "the agreement" was reached.
</P>
<P>
Matona said there was an ambiguity, as the text did not specify
whether this meant the main agreement, or the separate wines and
spirits agreement, which has still to be concluded.
</P>
<P>
The EU claimed it will implement the quota only if the second
agreement was concluded.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to continue talking," Matona said.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Expand Cooperation With Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Wednesday called for joint efforts to expand the good-neighborly
and friendly relationship between China and Indonesia in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president made the call in a message to Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid on the eve of the 50th anniversary of
the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two Asian
countries, which falls on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China and Indonesia, as two major developing countries, are
both facing the tasks of revitalizing their economies and
safeguarding the interests of developing countries in a world
where profound changes are taking place, Jiang said, adding that
the two countries have broad prospects for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the progress made after Indonesia and China
resumed diplomatic ties a decade ago and particularly praised the
1999 visit to China by President Wahid as vital to pushing
bilateral relations by shaping future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, both countries reached consensus on
establishing a long-term cooperative relationship of good-
neighborliness and mutual trust, Jiang said in the message.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji also sent a message of
congratulation to President Wahid, hoping for expanded bilateral
cooperation in fields ranging from trade, science and technology
to culture and for coordinated efforts in dealing with
international affairs, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said in a message to his
Indonesian counterpart Alwi Shihab that President Wahid's China
trip last year has injected new vitality into the development of
bilateral ties, which he believes will further improve with
continued efforts and closer cooperation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Hails Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a telegram to Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the occasion
of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations between Indonesia and China, Wahid said Indonesia
attaches great importance to the friendship and cooperation
between his country and China.
</P>
<P>
Since the resumption of the diplomatic relations between
Indonesia and China in 1990, "the bonds of friendship and
cooperation between our two countries have considerably
strengthened in a way that has benefited our two peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian president said that the range of bilateral
cooperation has significantly expanded as China and Indonesia have
cooperated closely at both the international and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are many challenges ahead of China and
Indonesia in this new century and new millennium, I am confident
that together we will be able to overcome them and attain our
respective development goals while contributing to the shaping of
a more just, more prosperous world," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
In a telegram to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, Wahid said that
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Indonesia and
China in April 1950 was a watershed event in the history of the
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since then the relationship between our two countries has had
its share of vicissitudes. "Nevertheless we were eventually able
to overcome all obstacles to the growth of our friendship and
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries are now both fully committed to broadening
and strengthening their relationship. I am confident that our two
governments will persevere in their efforts to attain that
objective, which is also the clear desire of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab also
sent a telegram to Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, saying
that China and Indonesia are today contributing significantly to
the promotion of peace and stability so necessary for the social
and economic development of the countries in the region by working
together "closely and constantly" in the ASEAN dialogue process,
the ASEAN regional forum, APEC and the Asia-Europe Meeting.

<HEADLINE> France Has No Plan on Economic Sanctions Against Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- France said on Wednesday that it
will not impose economic sanctions against Myanmar or order the
withdrawal of the oil group TotalFina from the country.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) decided on Monday to prolong and add
new measures to the sanctions against Myanmar, which were imposed
in 1996, because of what it called "violation of human rights" by
the military government there.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the EU
sanctions do not comprise economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said
in Brussels that the EU should adopt "an intelligent and targeted
policy in the field of sanctions."
</P>
<P>
"The severity toward Myanmar should not ban us from making
contacts and having dialogue which are always useful," Agence
France-presse quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to British newspapers Times and Financial Times
published on Wednesday, the British government will ask the
Premier Oil, the biggest British investor in Myanmar, to pull out
of Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Further Participate in International Space Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia will continue to take part
in international space programs while pushing forward national
aerospace industry by every means, said Russian President-elect
Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Mir space station must be preserved and Russia will
further its participation in international space cooperation
programs and fulfill all its international commitments, Putin said
at a meeting with Russian cosmonauts and managers of the Russian
space industry in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
However, "the main accent" must be put on the Russian
manufacturers, he said. "The rocket and space industry
is not only a prestigious industrial branch which is making Russia
a great power, but is also an industry which deals with the most
daring and reasonable economic projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Russian Aerospace Agency Director Yuri
Koptev told the press that the Russian space programs in 2000 will
include manned flights and replacement of some satellites.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Space Program for 2001-2005 signed by Putin on
March 30 "recognizes our needs and potential," he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia's 110 satellites account for one fifth of all the
spacecraft now in orbit, Koptev said. "We make thorough use of
them. No other country has such a vast experience of space
exploration," he said.
</P>
<P>
April 12 is Russia's Cosmonautics Day marking the 39th
anniversary of the launch of Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into
space, the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
Putin congratulated Russian cosmonauts and leaders of the
Russian space industry on Cosmonautics Day, saying it is "a
legendary holiday not only for Russia, but also for the whole of
mankind."
</P>
<P>
He expressed thanks to "the outstanding people and outstanding
scientific and technical achievements."
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian Security Council is likely to consider the
development of the Russian space industry at one of its future
meetings.

<HEADLINE> China's Price Rebound Expected to Continue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The slight rebound in China's
price index at the beginning of the year is a signal that the
market is steadily regaining its vitality, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the pro-active financial policy of the government,
China's domestic demand is rising and the extended decline in
prices of both capital goods and consumer goods has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
The price level of capital goods in January increased 0.1
percent over last December, a growth in 46 months. In February,
the consumer price index climbed up 0.7 percent from a year
earlier to stop the drop in prices over the past 22 months.
</P>
<P>
Most people tend to believe that the decline of price index is
good news for consumers. But long-term decline of the price index
is very harmful to China's economy and will eventually cause
negative effects. It will also directly affect the profits of
enterprises, leaving a decrease in worker's income and a rising
number of laid-off workers. At the same time, the government will
not have enough financial revenue to support its social security
system.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the prices of farm products in the past two
years has greatly slowed down the growth of peasant's income and
the chain effect has extended to the industrial sector. Many
industrial enterprises have high debt ratio.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some economists pointed out that the slight rise of China's
price index is still unstable, attributing it to seasonal factors
and price rises in food and some services. Therefore the consumer
price index might still fluctuate in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts believe the negative growth in China's price
index will come to an end within this year as it has steadily
improved from -2.2 percent last April to -0.2 percent in January
this year.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring of enterprises in traditional industries has a
positive impact on the rise of the price index, and China's
economy has been growing steadily this year. While the world
economy is recovering from the Asian financial crisis, China's
exports are expected to increase dramatically.
</P>
<P>
All this will guarantee the healthy price rebound in China and
support sustainable economic growth, economists said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court Orders Eight More Lebanese Detainees Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Supreme Court Wednesday
ruled that eight of the 15 Lebanese detainees now held by Israel
should be freed immediately as Israel should not keep them as
bargaining chips for its missing soldiers.
</P>
<P>
These Lebanese hostages, who had been held in administrative
detention for years, would be transferred to Lebanon in the next
few days, court source said.
</P>
<P>
Israel uses these Lebanese detainees as bargaining cards for
information or return of missing Israeli servicemen, including Ron
Arad, an Israeli Air Force navigator who has been missing since 14
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Five Lebanese hostages were freed last December and two more
freed in January this year. Last week, another one was released by
Tel Aviv District Court on the basis of his deteriorating mental
health after long-time detention.
</P>
<P>
The seven other prisoners, including two most prominent figures
Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and Mustafa Dirani, are still being held
without a trial. It is still not clear whether they will be freed
at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Zvi Rish, the lawyer representing these detainees, asserted that
although the seven prisoners did not appeal for their release
currently, the ruling by a nine-judge panel of the Supreme Court
should also let them go in the future.
</P>
<P>
Obeid, spiritual leader of Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, was
kidnapped from his home in south Lebanon in 1989, and Dirani,
security chief of the Lebanese resistance militia Amal, was
captured by Israeli agents in a special operation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It was Dirani who held Arad after the Israeli navigator
parachuted from his hit Phantom fighter on Lebanese soils in
October 1986. Dirani reportedly traded Arad to either Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas or Iranian elements later.
</P>
<P>
In response to the court ruling, Israeli Chief of General Staff
Shaul Mofaz said the Israel Defense Forces have objected to the
release of Lebanese detainees due to its moral responsibility to
ensure the return of Arad and other captured Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Now, Mofaz said, the army would have to learn the details of the
closed-door decision reached by a 6-3 vote before taking any
actions.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to Arad's family that the defense establishment would
continue its efforts to get Arad back to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
Arad's mother Batia Arad condemned the court decision, saying
she felt betrayed by the court.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in India Triples in 1990s: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The flow of foreign direct
investment (FDI) into India tripled during the 1990s despite its
decrease in the Asia-Pacific region during the decade, a report by
the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While the Asia-Pacific region's share in the world's annual
average FDI flows dropped to 18 percent from 20 percent in the
past decade, India's share had tripled to 3.3 percent from 1.1
percent in 1991, the Press Trust of India quoted UNCTAD as saying
in its World Investment Directory 2000.
</P>
<P>
The annual average FDI flows to India in the 1990s expanded
more than six times, rising from 470 million U.S. dollars between
1991 and 1994 to 2.7 billion dollars between 1995 and 1998 and
reaching a peak of 3.6 billion dollars in 1997, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The flow of FDI slowed down once during the decade in 1998, in
the wake of that year's financial crisis in Asia, the document
said, adding that preliminary estimates for 1999 showed that
inflows had remained stable.
</P>
<P>
India enjoys even greater potential for higher FDI growth in
the near future, the document predicted.

<HEADLINE> India, Germany Start Strategic Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- India and Germany opened here
on Wednesday their first-ever "strategic dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The Indo-German strategic dialogue discussed at length some
major issues like the need for concerted international efforts to
combat terrorism and drug trafficking and on disarmament and non-

the bilateral and international spheres.
</P>
<P>
Ischinger called for intense negotiations on air traffic

000 or even more Indian experts in the information technology (IT)
sector, said Ischinger.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Displeased With Ishihara's Anti-Foreigner Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori on Wednesday expressed discomfort at Tokyo Governor Shintaro
Ishihara's use of a discriminatory term against people from Taiwan
and Korea and for suggesting that foreigners may riot after a
major quake.
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Ishihara... did indeed use the term as Tokyo governor,
it may have been inappropriate," Mori told reporters while
referring to Ishihara's use of the word "sankokujin," a derogatory
term mainly referring to people from Taiwan and Korea and their
descendants.
</P>
<P>
"Atrocious crimes have been committed again and again by
sankokujin and other foreigners. We can expect them to riot in the
event of a disastrous earthquake," Ishihara said Sunday while
addressing members of Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF).
</P>
<P>
Ishihara also called on the GSDF to control the possible riot
by foreigners following a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara came under fire from various fields including Japanese
government officials, opposition parties and the South Korean
government.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, some 40 people, mainly from local assemblies and
civil groups, held a rally in a yard in front of the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government building to protest Ishihara's remarks.
</P>
<P>
They handed metropolitan employees protest leaflets, in which
they demanded Ishihara retract his remarks or step down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of celebrities, including television
personality Dave Spector and businesswoman Shin Sugok, a third-
generation Korean resident, jointly held a press conference at the
metropolitan government building demanding that Ishihara resign
immediately over the remarks.
</P>
<P>
"Sankokujin" is a Japanese term that literally means "people
from third countries." Referring to people from former Japanese
colonies in Taiwan and the Korean peninsula, as well as their
descendants, the term gained currency after World War II. It is
now widely regarded as a derogatory term.

<HEADLINE> China Practices Psychological Treatment in Prisons (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yang said that due to their environment, many prisoners are
psychologically fragile. They are often freewheeling and easily
lose their tempers.
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, the prisoners are patients, for they show more
disfigurement of character than others," he said, "and our duty is
not only to keep them from escaping, but also to help them return
to the mainstream in the future."
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoyu, an official in charge of prisoners' education
affairs with the Ministry of Justice, said that psychological
problems occur when the prisoners face a strict and closed
environment in prison and feel pressure from their families.
</P>
<P>
She said that the security of the prison and reeducation would
then be affected if prisoners do not receive the appropriate
guidance to deal with their psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
Western psychology was introduced to reeducate prisoners, as
many committed crimes because of their psychological disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Most prisons in Beijing have individual psychological records
based on psychological tests given to the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"Some opinions of Western psychologists are scientific," Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1989, Chinese prisons officially began practicing
psychology in educating prisoners, and nearly 700 psychological
consultation rooms have been opened for prisoners over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the prisons across the country offer
psychological consultations, and people with a master's degree in
psychology are invited as consultants by some prisons.
</P>
<P>
"Many prison guards have received basic training in psychology,

<HEADLINE> China Practices Psychological Treatment in Prisons (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most important thing in building modern prisons is to
modernize ideas about supervision, said Professor Luo Dahua with
the China University of Political Science and Law.
</P>
<P>
When psychologists abroad visit prisons, they mainly aim to
treat apparent psychological diseases and to do scientific
research, according to Luo, a senior expert on criminal psychology.
</P>
<P>
Chinese psychologists aim at all the prisoners as a whole, and
try to improve the psychological quality of the whole group by
working on individual cases.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice has adopted psychological rectification
as a criterion when evaluating the performances of prison
administrations since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing Prison, each prisoner is responsible for taking care
of one pot of fresh flowers and one pet fish.
</P>
<P>
"These nice things in life should be able to arouse the
prisoners' awareness to become healthy and kind," said Yang Di,
head of the prison, pointing at blossoming plants and swimming
gold fish.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, four out of every 100 prisoners
released from Beijing Prison upon completion of a sentence commit
crimes again, and the national figure ranges from six to eight out
of 100.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of psychological treatment should not be
exaggerated," said Professor Luo, "it serves as an adjunct method
beyond all other major reeducation methods."
</P>
<P>
Prisons in China have seen quite a few experiences that have
proved to be very effective, said Luo.
</P>
<P>
Under the Ministry of Justice, Chinese experts on criminology
and psychology are jointly working on a set of psychological gages
focused on Chinese criminals, based on more than 8,000 questions
and six years of research, to be introduced into prisons next year.
</P>
<P>
"This decision means that all prisoners across the country will
receive strict and regulated psychological treatment beginning
next year," said Liu Guoyu.

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Niu Lishan dared not get on a bus,
fearing that he would lose his self-control; and if he stole
someone's purse, he would think that his own wallet had been
stolen.
</P>
<P>
Niu, 36, is serving a seven-year sentence as a hardened thief
in Liangxiang Prison on the outskirts of Beijing, the fifth time
he has been imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
Things that are "as easy as my eyes" to others are
insurmountable to Niu, who is, among other things, hot-tempered.
He was bothered by severs psychological problems, as were many
other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"It was a nightmare," said Niu, who was mired in desperation
and once swallowed a piece of saw blade in an attempt to confront
prison supervisors.
</P>
<P>
Niu's life was entirely changed by Yang Dongsheng, a policeman
who has a chrysanthemum-shaped mini-basket made of a plastic
bottle on the table in his office.
</P>
<P>
"It was made by Niu Lishan," said Yang, "I found the floral
basket in the garbage and took it back to my office."
</P>
<P>
Niu was shocked at the first sight of the basket when he was
called to Yang's office for a talk one day. He was told it was a
nice piece of craft work.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the two shrank in a second.
</P>
<P>
Yang Dongsheng decided to "suit the remedy to the case," and he
appointed a lonely Niu to join the cheering squad, a self-abased
Niu to learn computers, and an irascible Niu to practice
calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
"I finally won over myself, psychologically," said Niu, whose
term of imprisonment was reduced by 18 months for his good conduct.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in South China Combating Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Local government officials in
the city of Maoming in south China's Guangdong Province have been
mobilizing 250,000 people daily to help combat a serious drought
that hit the region since last year.
</P>
<P>
All sorts of equipment is being used to combat the drought, and
8.6 million yuan has been spent for the effort, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The city had only 77 mm of rainfall in the first three months
this year, which has led to a drastic drop in the volume of water
in local reservoirs, and the drying-up of a great number of small
reservoirs and ponds. As the drought continues, 51,700 hectares of
crops are being affected.
</P>
<P>
However, thanks to these drought-fighting efforts, 22,000
hectares of arable land are now being irrigated, which has
partially paved the way for spring ploughing and sowing.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities Facing Management Challenges: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese universities are now
facing the new challenges of management, said Peter West,
president of the Directing Group of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Program on Institutional
Management in Higher Education (IMHE).
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at the opening ceremony of the
International Seminar on Changing Patterns in University
Management here at Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
He said, in a very brief review of Chinese universities, that
he has seen several examples of areas where they already display
the characteristics of successful entrepreneurial universities.
</P>
<P>
"If the new era is a threat to some, it is an opportunity for
others, including the universities of China." A university must be
excellent at boundary scanning, reading the signals of new
developments in teaching and learning, in information technology,
in emerging fields of applied research, and in funding
opportunities from industry, international research programs, and
donations.
</P>
<P>
West said there is ample evidence that Chinese universities are
positioning themselves to play in the first division of this new
game.
</P>
<P>
He said the new relations established in the educational reform
between universities and their local governments will greatly
benefit the development of universities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education will
provide training to all middle and primary school teachers in
poverty-stricken ethnic minority areas in the coming three to five

<HEADLINE> Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party Condemns Annette Lu's Separatist Remarks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Chinese
Peasants and Workers Democratic Party (CPWDP), one the eight non-
Communist parties on the mainland, today refuted Annette Lu's
recent separatist remarks, saying that any attempt to seek Taiwan
independence is hopeless.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman condemned the stubborn pro-independence stance
taken by Lu, a member of the Taiwan-based Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), who in an interview with a Hong Kong cable TV
described the cross-straits relationship as similar to that shared
by "distant relatives and close neighbors" and referred to "two
Chinese nations."
</P>
<P>
"The remarks completely exposed Lu's disgraceful attempt to
foolishly challenge the one-China principle, betray the motherland,
and shamelessly advocate Taiwan independence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been an inalienable part of China's sacred territory,
politically, geographically, historically and culturally. The
highest status it has ever claimed is that of province; it has
never been a "nation."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is the legacy of a civil war between the
Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China. The change of
regional leaders in Taiwan will never alter the internationally-
recognized fact that Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui took power pretending to be an ardent advocate of
one China, but he was ultimately discredited when his pro-
independence position was exposed. And like Lee, Annette Lu's
involvement in separatist activities will come to no good end, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated the Chinese government's stance that
all issues are negotiable under the one-China Principle.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party Condemns Annette Lu's Separatist Remarks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pro-Taiwan independence elements like Lu are openly refusing
the one-China principle in an obvious attempt to hamper cross-
straits political negotiations on peaceful reunification,
challenge the principles of "peaceful reunification, and one
country, two systems," and force Taiwan people to support their
criminal schemes, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Lu's repeated "peaceful and friendly" shows
are tricks to gain sympathy and support from the international
community and Taiwan people, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the reunification of the motherland has been a great
cause for the Chinese nation, he said, stressing that those who
are engaged in Taiwan independence activities are going against
the historic trends of peaceful reunification, the fundamental
interests of the people living on the both sides of the Taiwan
Straits, especially for the majority of Taiwan people who want
peace, stability and development, and the international legal
norms.
</P>
<P>
The desire for reunification has never wavered in China's
history, and it has been a sacred mission for the Chinese people
across the Taiwan Straits to realize the reunification of the
motherland, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The CPWDP firmly supports the Chinese government's basic stance
of one China, he said, urging the new leader of the Taiwan region
to respect the interests of the Chinese nation, and the Taiwan
people as well, and to take concrete steps to improve and develop
the cross-straits relations.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Canada Sign Four Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid
and his Canadian counterpart Jean Chretien capped their talks on
Wednesday with the signing of four pacts.
</P>
<P>
Chretien arrived in Cairo Tuesday for a three-day visit to Egypt
as part of a regional tour, which also includes Syria, Lebanon,
Jordan, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
He went into a session of talks with Obeid Wednesday morning on
regional issues and bilateral economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Under one of the agreements, Canada will grant Egypt 5 million
U.S. dollars for updating its legislations and policies on small-
and medium-sized enterprises, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding called for expansion of
cooperation in technology transfer, environmental protection and
relevant services, with an emphasis on the role played by the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
A protocol is about Egypt's import of potato seeds from Canada.
</P>
<P>
A fourth agreement was signed between Egypt's Ministry of
Housing and Urban Communities and a Canadian company, concerning
117-million-dollar water projects.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the company will run two water plants and
build one plant in the northwest of the Suez Gulf, and build a 132-
kilometer pipeline to channel water from Cairo to Ain Sokhna port
on the Red Sea, which is now under construction.
</P>
<P>
The company was charged with supplying water to the northwest of
the Suez Gulf, which the Egyptian government has selected as the
site of an industrial development zone, over a period of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Obeid said at the signing ceremony that Egypt will enhance
cooperation with the Canadian postal authority in transferring
technology in postal services.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also seeks closer cooperation with Canada in landmines
removal, higher education and civil aviation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is estimated to have over 17 million landmines in the
Western Desert and the Sinai Desert left over from conflicts in the
World War II and the Arab-Israeli wars. It calls for international
help to remove the mines, which hinder national development.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Calls Stability Cornerstone of National Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Political, economic and
societal stability forms the cornerstone of Malaysia's national
policy, Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been consistent in its approach toward defense and
development by always placing development as its best and most
effective form of security, Najib said at a seminar on "War, Peace,
Globalization and Asian Security" held in conjunction with the on-
going Defense Services Asia (DSA 2000) Exhibition and Conference
here.
</P>
<P>
"By bringing development and prosperity, we have successfully
averted any real forms of domestic conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also believes in regional security, and to achieve
that it has maintained a whole array of security and defense
arrangements and mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, Five
Powers Defense Arrangement and numerous other bilateral exercises,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been pragmatic in looking at regional security, for we
have come to adopt an inclusive approach, where we are open to all
forms of cooperation, with any party that shows genuine interest
in forging peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on globalization, the minister said that while global
markets are being opened, local ones could be forced to shut down
and this could have a high social cost, subsequently leading to
domestic instability.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest challenge for all of us is to try and influence
the process of globalization," he said, adding that regionalism is
a viable option when it comes to dealing with the forces of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said that in a world of globalization, the line that
separates politics, economics and society and their implications
for security is fast thinning.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is a need to seriously consider the prudence
of forming regional multifaceted institutions, which could well
provide the basis for conflict management, conflict prevention and
eventually conflict resolution, he added.

Baker is expected to organize a meeting of all sides involved
in the conflict by the end of May, aimed at breaking the deadlock
of the process in organizing a self-determination referendum in
West Sahara.

Morocco, which annexed West Sahara in 1975, claims the right to
vote by the Saharans living in Morocco and the Moroccans living in
West Sahara, while the pro-independence Front Polisario wants to
limit the electoral body to the population registered in a census
in 1974 by Spain, the former colonial power there.
</P>
<P>
During his information-collecting tour, Baker has already
visited Spain, Morocco and Algeria, where the headquarters of the
Front Polisario is based.
</P>
<P>
He will fly back to New York on Wednesday to inform UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan of the possibility of organizing a
meeting of all the countries and parties concerned.

<HEADLINE> Motor Vehicle Theft Gang Busted in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing police recently cracked
the case of a motor vehicle theft ring, the largest one of its
kind since the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The police have detained 26 suspected criminal gang members who
confessed to 206 thefts. The authorities also recovered 36 stolen
vehicles, mobile phones, pagers, and tools used for the thefts.
</P>
<P>
The gang was mainly made up of farmers from Dingxing County in
north China's Hebei province, who stole vehicles in Beijing and
sold them in ten other provinces around the country, said Liu
Qunli, vice director of the Xuanwu branch of the Beijing Public
Security Bureau (BPSB).
</P>
<P>
Liu said that policemen with the Xuanwu branch of the BPSB
interrogated and examined two suspects as they patrolled the
street of Guanganmen in southwestern Beijing in February, and
eventually rounded up the rest of the gang.
</P>
<P>
The police work for this case took more than 40 days.
</P>
<P>
The thieves began stealing vehicles in 1997, mainly targeting
Santana 2000 cars, which are easily sold, and account for more
than 80 percent of the stolen vehicles, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were armed with modern communications gadgets such
as mobile phones and pagers, rare in such cases, according to
police.
</P>
<P>
The police reminded Beijing car owners to be even more cautious,
although most cars are equipped with electronic alarm systems to
prevent theft.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Year of IPO for Asian Internet Companies: Merrill Lynch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Year 2000 will be the year of
initial public offerings (IPO) for Asian Internet companies, Matei
Mihalca, vice president of Merrill Lynch (Asia Pacific) Ltd. said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Mihalca, who also heads Merrill
Lynch's Asia-Pacific Internet Research, said Asia's economic
revival will buoy emerging Internet businesses across the region.
</P>
<P>
He estimates that 30 to 50 Asian Internet companies may issue
their IPOs on Nasdaq and other markets this year to raise an
aggregate of two billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among these, he said five to 10 businesses will be from the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Mihalca disclosed that three Chinese Internet companies, sohu,
sina and netease, are currently preparing for IPOs, and that
Merrill Lynch is leading one of them.
</P>
<P>
He added that the recent slide in the prices of Internet stocks
on the Nasdaq market will not lead to Merrill Lynch's reduced
investment in Chinese Internet enterprises, which is based on a
long-term strategy.

<HEADLINE> China Ensuring Supply of Quality Seedlings to Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The China State Forestry
Administration today issued a circular, urging localities to take
concrete steps to provide farmers with quality seedlings in the
country's drive to turn farmland to forest in western China.
</P>
<P>
A SFA official said that the supply of seedlings is adequate
on the whole, however, the prices of some varieties have surged
due to strong demand.
</P>
<P>
The circular asks localities in the region to strengthen market
management and firmly stop the illegal raising of seedling prices
while setting a top limit on these prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, the seedlings needed in the planned
afforestation areas must be provided to farmers free of charge,
and state-allocated funds for this purpose will be withdrawn if
farmers do not get the seedlings.
</P>
<P>
Strong measures should be taken to eliminate sub-standard
seedlings, and if any institutions or individuals are found
selling such seedlings, they will be severely punished, the
circular stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has launched an ambitious drive to turn farmland to
forest in the west to improve the environment, and 340,000
hectares of farmland at the upper reaches of the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers will be turned to forest this year, while 430,00
hectares of wasteland and hills are afforested.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Publishes Article in Memory of Lenin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- "Seeking Truth", a theoretic
periodical of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), will publish a signed article in its April 17 edition
in memory of the 130th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Ilyich
Lenin (1870-1924), leader of the Bolshevik Revolution and founder
of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by Li Zhongjie, a professor with the Party
School of the Central Committee of the CPC, urges people to learn
from Lenin's though and spirit in a scientific manner.
</P>
<P>
Lenin is one of the best known and the most influential figures
of the 20th century, the article says. Neither history nor the
people will forget Lenin, a great man who pushed forward the
advancement of the 20th century, it says.
</P>
<P>
Lenin devoted all his life to the cause of emancipating the
proletarians and working people worldwide and building socialism
and communism, making an indelible contribution to the progress
and development of the human society in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Lenin led the Bolsheviks and the Russian people to end the
military, feudalist and imperialist dictatorship in Russia through
three revolutions, especially the October Revolution in 1917, and
founded the world's first socialist country ruled by proletarians,
which found a new way to resolve three major contradictions, and
opened up a new era in human history to evolve from capitalism to
socialism.
</P>
<P>
Lenin created the basic system of socialism, creatively probed
the road for underdeveloped nations to adopt socialism, displayed
the bright prospects of socialism to the people of the whole world,
and thus pushed forward the rise and development of socialist
trends in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Lenin played an active role in the world's socialist movement,
helped establish and develop communist parties in different
countries, and supported and promoted the struggles for the
emancipation of people in countries under colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Lenin combined Marxism with the international working class
movement and national liberation movement, as well as the reality
of the Russian revolution, which creatively utilized, enriched,
and developed Marxism.

<TEXT>
<P>
The article calls Lenin the teacher of the proletarians of the
world and a sincere friend of the Chinese people, adding that he
closely observed the social changes in China and the development
of the Chinese revolution. Lenin pinned high hopes on the social
development in China and China's contributions to the world,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people supported the Russian revolution in various
ways, and Lenin also considered the Chinese revolution to be
important and strategic.
</P>
<P>
The article denounces those who have denied Lenin's
achievements and Leninism, noting that the assessment of Lenin is
an assessment of the entire socialist cause in the 20th century.
Lenin made some mistakes, but so did some socialist countries
which encountered serious zigzags, and even tremendous changes and
breakups, which should be attributed to historic mistakes made by
those countries, not to Lenin.
</P>
<P>
Do not spill dirty water over Lenin, because denial of Lenin is
of course a denial of the entire history of Communists in the 20th
century, who fought boldly to found and build socialism.
</P>
<P>
Lenin's theory is a unique ideological and cultural system that
has been spread throughout the world and has cast profound impact
on the human spirit. According to UNESCO statistics, Lenin's works
once ranked first in the world in terms of circulation and
translated works.
</P>
<P>
The basic principles of Leninism, though a heritage from the
early 20th century, are guiding the current socialist construction
in China, and at the turn of this century, the Chinese people
still draw wisdom from Lenin's thought, especially in the
following aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- building a socialist economy;
</P>
<P>
-- developing a socialist democracy and legal system;
</P>
<P>
-- strengthening the socialist ruling party;
</P>
<P>
-- international relations and socialist foreign policies;
</P>
<P>
-- scientific methods of thinking.
</P>
<P>
The article makes the point that the most fundamental thing for
the Chinese Communists is to combine Marxism-Leninism with the
reality in China to consistently push forward the building of
socialism with China's own characteristics.

<HEADLINE> American Scholar Expects Macao to Boost IT Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- An American professor said at a
forum here Wednesday that Macao should boost the development of
its information technology to facilitate foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investment with better infrastructure based
on information technology, the government should provide financial
assistance in building low-cost and fast access to the Internet,
according to Eduardo da Costa, a professor with Harvard University
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Macao's advantage lies in the fact that phone bills are paid in
a fixed monthly sum and thus Internet surfers do not have to worry
much about the time they spend on the web, the professor said at
the Macao-Beijing International Business Forum which ended here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The forum will reopen in Beijing on Friday.

in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The summit of Turkey's ruling coalition to discuss
presidential candidates, scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed
because Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit got a cold.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the scheduled summit, Ecevit said "there will be a

fanatics in revenge for deaths of two British fans, who were
stabbed by Turkish hooligans in Istanbul last week during the
Galatasaray-Leeds United match.
</P>
<P>
Celik said that just because of his Turkish origin, he was
beaten. In Britain, some radicals threatened to launch an anti-
Turkish citizen campaign.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Business Summit Concludes in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The second ASEAN Business
Summit concluded here Wednesday with a call for Asia to enunciate
strategies for the working together amongst its constituent
members to counter-balance the globalization.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz made the call at the close of the two-day summit with the
theme "Asia 2000: Moving Forward."
</P>
<P>
She said that regionalism can be an effective counter-balance
mechanism for East Asia and Asia in minimizing the impact of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
In regionalism, she said, various economic buffers could be
instituted and regional economic strength be galvanized to face
the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister said that for Asia to move forward
beyond 2000, the region's political thinking must first move
beyond its present phase of minimum action.
</P>
<P>
"For Asia to move forward as a region successfully, there must
be the strong core of Asians at the political, planning,
management levels to think through and operationalize the Asian
initiatives,"Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
She said the Asian regional cooperation can only be realized
and be made to work, if there exists the necessary framework for
the process to happen.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that priority areas and economic
sectors can be identified and be the bases for economic
collaboration, including the financial and services sectors,
manufacturing and technology.
</P>
<P>
The next process would then begin where Pan-Asian policies and
measures would be evolved and established, allowing for effective
collaboration among private sector entities and result in
corporate mergers and tie-ups within the region, she said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the ensuring entities would be able to be global
players and integrate into the globalization process. Domestic
industries that have the capacity and potential could integrate
and synergize to evolve as Asian industries with strong regional
networks and capacity to make an impact in the global market,"
Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
She suggested that at the next meeting of Asian leaders and of
East Asian leaders special focus be given to concrete areas of
regional cooperation, particularly among trade and industrial
communities.
</P>
<P>
The summit was jointly organized by the National Chamber of
Commerce and Industry of Malaysia and the Asian Strategy
Leadership Institute under the auspices of the ASEAN Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar,the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
Representatives from all ASEAN members except for Cambodia and
Laos attended the summit.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania may face floods
between now and the end of May if heavy rains continue, Mohamed
Mhita, director general of the Meteorological Department, has
warned.
</P>
<P>
Floods were likely to occur if more heavy rains pounded the
country in the next 50 days, he told the Guardian newspaper on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mhita said the current rains in most parts of Tanzania would
continue up to the end of the next month. Though it will not fall
continuously, it is possible that some parts of the country will
have floods.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, such floods might not be similar to those
experienced throughout Tanzania in 1998 caused by the El-Nino
weather phenomenon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian will introduce African
culture to its schools' curricula, to stem moral decay in the
country, said the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources in the Presidency as saying that
President Olusegun Obasanjo had approved the teaching of the
subject as part of the new educational policy for both primary and
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
The subject to be taught under the program is tagged: "Back to
Basic African Culture Knowledge (B.A.C.K)." It is aimed at
acquainting school children with African traditional values as
well as monitoring and selecting foreign cultures to be imbibed by
children.
</P>
<P>
The presidency also expected that the B.A.C.K would also
contribute to the curbing of cultism in the society.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, when fully operational, children
wishing to enter into the university would have to produce
evidence of pass in cultural knowledge before they are granted
admission.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, it was gathered that African proverbs,
history and beliefs and mythology would be inculcated into school
children, aimed at breeding a new generation of Nigerians.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Bars 12 Angolans from Entering Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Twelve Angolans arriving at the
Lisbon Airport were prohibited from entering Portugal in a
retaliatory move by the Portuguese authorities, official news
agency Angop said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese assistant secretary of state for internal
administration Manuel Diogo, said that the Angolans, whose travel
documents were not in order, would be sent back to Luanda "as soon
as possible".
</P>
<P>
Diogo said the tightened immigration procedures represented "a
new stance" of "greater rigour" on the part of Portugal, which
would continue in response to Angola's recent treatment of
Portuguese travellers arriving in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the internal administration ministry announced
late Monday that Portuguese authorities would tighten screening of
Angolans in a tit-for-tat response to Luanda's recent barring of
many Portuguese travellers.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the stiffened immigration controls of
Angolans was based on "the principle of reciprocity".
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said Portugal
would respond with "total firmness" if it were determined that
Angola was acting outside "the good relations" between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic flap broke at the weekend when Angolan
authorities on two occasions barred entry to 27 Portuguese
arriving at Luanda airport. The official explanation was that the
Portuguese travellers were coming to work, but only carrying
tourist visas.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Build Holiday Inn Hotel to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will help
Tanzania build a high-grade Holiday Inn hotel with a total
investment of 13 million U.S. dollars in a bid to boost tourism,

</P>
<P>
Managing Director Peter Mwenguo of Tanzanian Tourist Board
(TTB) said Tuesday that a South African hotel group will start the

</P>
<P>
South Africa's Southern Sun Hotels, the largest hotel operator

the owner of the project.
</P>
<P>
Its Managing Director Helder Pereira said at a launching
ceremony here that the project is not only of bricks-and-mortar
development but also a catalyst for job creation and skills
development.
</P>
<P>
Pereira said that construction work will support jobs for 400
workers and over 200 hotel staff will be employed in the hotel
which includes 152 rooms, 10 executive rooms and modern
facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said Southern Sun already has a stake in Tanzania's tourist
infrastructure through a strategic investment in several game
lodges and camps.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian authorities said that presently Tanzania has 215
hotels with 7, 500 rooms and 13,400 beds to cater for more than
550,000 tourists visiting its attractions annually.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Ole Naikom, director of the Investment Promotion at

GENEVA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's governing body
UEFA has postponed a decision until Friday on whether Galatasaray

Leeds asked UEFA to ban the Turkish club's fans from the second
leg at Elland Road in the wake of the knifing to death of two
Leeds fans in Istanbul before the first leg last week.

<HEADLINE> Greater Effort Urged to Improve Environment Around Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Greater effort must be made to
improve the environment in areas around the Chinese capital of
Beijing, a senior Beijing official said in a recent interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"This brooks no delay," said Song Xiyou, director of the
Beijing Municipal Afforestation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Beijing belongs to the zone of continental monsoon climate,
featuring northwester in most cases in spring and autumn, Song
noted.
</P>
<P>
Dust storms that are formed in Beijing's windward areas such as
Hebei and Shanxi provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region where environmental improvement is relatively slow, still
pose a big threat to the capital's environment, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, what is more important in improving Beijing
's environment is to intensify the effort to improve the
environment in the windward areas of Beijing, and go all out to
plant trees and grass and turn the farmland reclaimed in recent
years into grassland and forests.
</P>
<P>
"It is far from enough to depend only on Beijing to improve its
environment by planting trees and grass," he added.
</P>
<P>
The capital city has been hit by six dust storms since the
beginning of this year and this is the worst case in recent years,
meteorologists say.
</P>
<P>
The worst dust storm several days ago forced 40 flights,
including one from Copenhagen to Beijing to land in the nearby
port city of Tianjin instead. Another 40 flights were unable to
take off due to poor visibility, excluding four flights were
forced to fly back and six canceled.
</P>
<P>
In north Beijing, the density of floating dust in the air in
some cases reached 1,000 mg per sq. m. and the visibility was just
100 to 200 meters, and pedestrians had to put on masks or wrap
their heads with gauze kerchiefs.
</P>
<P>
To do its part, Beijing has started building a 100-sq-km forest
belt around the city, which is scheduled to complete by the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
The central government also has allocated a total of about 120
million yuan (about 15 million U.S. dollars) for the capital city'
s afforestation drive.
</P>
<P>
Now, Beijing's vegetation rate has reached 35.2 percent,
averaging 8.5 sq. m per capita, ranking in the forefront among
major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The city will complete a total of 2,100 hectares of vegetation
this year, raising the vegetation rate to 43 percent, which is
equivalent to the total vegetation area completed in the last six
years.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Crops Threatened by Disease and Pests in Hebei Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 1 million hectares of
wheat fields have been affected by diseases and insect pests in
north China's Hebei Province, one of the country's main gain
producers.
</P>
<P>
Specialists estimate that the affected fields will increase to
1,400,000 ha, accounting for more than half of the province's
wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that due to temperature and humidity some diseases
such as blight and wheat aphid were found in February and spread
rampantly in early March.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of disease surpassed 20 percent, and hit 90
percent in some places. Experts predict that some diseases may be
spread more widely.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has taken emergency measures to limit
losses, and related departments are striving to help farmers with

<HEADLINE> East China to Get More Electricity From West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Along with an ambitious drive to
develop western China, the country is trying to tap the huge power
resources of the region in a bid to provide more electricity for
energy-short eastern China.
</P>
<P>
China's west comprises 10 provinces, autonomous regions, and
one centrally-administered municipality, all very rich in
hydropower resources as well as other renewable energy resources,
said Zhang Guobao, vice-minister in charge of the State
Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the just-concluded seminar on transmitting
electricity from west to east, the senior official expects the
recoverable hydropower resources in west China to top 270 million
kw, accounting for about 72 percent of the country's total. In
addition, the region has abundant resources of coal, petroleum,
and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The official said the strategy of transmitting electricity from
west to east is of significance for improving the country's
energy structure and ecological environment, and is good for the
development of both western and eastern China.
</P>
<P>
Also, it will help reduce environmental pollution and sharply
cut electricity production costs.
</P>
<P>
The official urged provinces and cities in east China to
provide more markets for electricity transmitted from the west by
speeding up the readjustment of energy structure, closing down
small thermal power plants, and prohibiting construction of
conventional coal-fueled thermal plants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the west should improve its investment environment
in order to attract more funds from outside and optimize power
development plans to ensure a power supply to the east, the
official added.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Immunization Cooperation Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The governments of China and
Japan have agreed to join hands in expanding vaccination services
in five Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
The five-year cooperation project, beginning this June, will
begin in Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, and then open in Qinghai,
Gansu, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, it was announced
here today at an agreement-signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Called the Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI), the project
will mainly focus on introducing safe injections while improving
the local accesses to and the quality of vaccination services.
</P>
<P>
Japanese specialists will come to China to provide technical
instructions and some facilities.
</P>
<P>
Vice Health Minister Yin Dakui said the EPI will play an
important role in safeguarding the health of new generations in
the west, which is implementing an ambitious development program
launched by the central government this year.
</P>
<P>
However, health officials fear that backward health care
facilities could hinder the overall development of the region.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, immunization work in some areas has suffered setbacks
due to insufficient government investment, lack of EPI services
among the migrant population, a shortage of professionals, and
other reasons," acknowledged Wang Zhao, director of the Department
of Disease Control under the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
In some western provinces, the vaccination rate has even
dropped to 40 percent, compared with more than 90 percent in major
cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, she added.
</P>
<P>
Annual national EPI activities could cover some 11 million
infants, or about half of the newborns across the country each
year.
</P>
<P>
"Without the shelter of vaccination, infectious diseases such
as polio, measles, and hepatitis B may spread and endanger the
health of our children again," Wang Zhao warned.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Prudent on US Firm's DNA Decoding Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts involved in
mapping the human genetic code have disputed a private company's
claim that it has already achieved the goal.
</P>
<P>
Celera Genomics, an American company based in the state of
Maryland in the United States, announced last week that it had
finished the decoding phase of one person's genetic code,
according to Science Times.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Zhang Meng of the Human Genome Research Center of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences said that the announcement may only be
of an advertising nature, which could bring more profits to the
company.
</P>
<P>
"A piece of news may mean nothing serious for scientific
research," the paper quoted Shen Yan, a research fellow from the
North China Human Genome Research Center. He said he will not make
any comments until more details are released about the company's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
The company' decoding claim only refers to the first step
toward the final drafting of the human genome map, said Chen
Runsheng, a researcher with the CAS's Institute of Biophysics.
</P>
<P>
He said there is still a major task facing the company, which
is to assemble the genetic fragments to form a complete picture of
the human genome. So far, the announced achievement does not
appear to be very significant, he said.

Servcorp has so far provided business center facilities and
virtual offices to over 30,000 clients ranging from multinational
organizations to small businesses in over 522 locations throughout

Servcorp provides facilities to companies which are driven by
the continuing trend for outsourcing and technological
developments in areas such as networking and communications, the
general manager said.
</P>
<P>
"In a long run, Servcorp's business scope in China's mainland
is unlimited, but right now the operation in Hong Kong is more
profitable," Moufarrige said, adding that Servcorp will set up its
third business center in Beijing soon.

<HEADLINE> Women Group Demands Review of Sexual Assault Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A women group in Hong Kong has
demanded a review of the sexual assault law because sexual
violence could be happening seven times frequently than the
official figures.
</P>
<P>
In a 35-page action plan issued Tuesday to legislators, the
women group, the Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against
Women, recommended a change to what they called the discriminatory
and outdated definition of rape, which they said failed to count
men as victims or specify martial rape as an offense.
</P>
<P>
The group also recommended the age of a person liable for
prosecution for sexual offenses be lowered from 14 to seven, the
same age applied to other serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
Security Bureau figures put the annual number of reported
indecent assault and rape cases over the past seven years at
between 1,133 and 1,304. But the women group said the official
figures, which suggested there was a sexual attack every sevens
hours, did not give a true picture.
</P>
<P>
The women group's survey found that 85 percent of victims did
not go to the police.

<HEADLINE> Drilon Steps Into Philippine Senate Helm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate majority leader
Franklin Drilon assumed the Senate presidency Wednesday afternoon
in place of the outgoing Senate President Blas Ople, the ABS-CBN
news channel reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presidency turnover ceremony, Drilon said that
as the new Senate chief, he would work hard to help maintain the"
stability of the government."
</P>
<P>
The leadership change is in line with a "gentlemen's agreement"
that Ople and Drilon signed in the presence of President Joseph
Estrada in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Ople, who was elected as Senate president
on July 26 last year, agreed with Drilon to divide between
themselves the remaining two-year tenure following the death of
former Senate President Marcelo Fernan.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada himself brokered the "term-sharing agreement"
as a leadership war threatened to divide the ruling party last
year and impair the government's legislative thrust.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is the titular head of the ruling party LAMP. Both Ople
and Drilon are LAMP's founding members.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the assumption, Drilon told reporters that there
would be no changes in the composition of committee chairmanships,
except for the two key positions, the Senate secretariat and
Commission on Appointment secretary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Drilon pledged to protect the Senate's integrity as
an independent institution. But he also assured President Estrada
of the passage of his administration's urgent legislative
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Becoming Senate president -- the 7th since 1987 -- is the apex
of Drilon's 14 years of public service since he served in the
former President Corazon Aquino's administration as its deputy
minister for labor.
</P>
<P>
Later, he became Mrs. Aquino's justice secretary and then
executive secretary. In the administration of former President
Fidel Ramos,Drilon also served as justice secretary.
</P>
<P>
Drilon, who earned his law degree in 1969, brought his
expertise in judicial and labor matters when he ran and won a
Senate seat in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He chaired various committees in the 7th Congress, including
the Senate blue ribbon and the committee on bans, financial
institutions and currencies.
</P>
<P>
In the present Congress, Drilon was majority leader. He said it
was during this experience as Senate majority leader that he
aspired for the top Senate post.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Prefers Controlled Inflow of Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore acting Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong Wednesday reaffirmed that his government tries to
manage a controlled inflow of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 10th Triennial Delegates Conference of the
National Trades Union Congress, Lee made the point to more than 1,
000 delegates to the two-day conference in response to workers'
worries about foreign talents taking top jobs in Singapore and
their greater worries about skilled and semi-skilled foreign
workers competing Singaporeans for jobs.
</P>
<P>
The acting prime minister said the Singapore government
requires local companies to maintain a minimum Singapore to
foreign worker ratio in their employment of workers and uses the
Foreign Worker Levy to moderate demand for foreign workers and to
prevent foreign workers from depressing wages of Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
The levy is higher for unskilled workers than for skilled
workers because the skilled workers make a greater economic
contribution and the unskilled workers will be paid less, he added.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's total workforce is just over 2 million and of these
Singaporeans account for 1.4 million and foreigners about 600,000.
Companies in this city state employ foreign workers as a measure
to reduce costs because foreign workers are paid much less
compared with Singaporean workers.
</P>
<P>
Last year about 60,000 new jobs were created and more than
three quarters of these were taken by Singaporeans, moving down
the country's unemployment rate to 2.9 percent at the end of 1999
from 4.4 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lee said, "If we had sent home the 600,000 foreign workers
during the crisis, far from the economy recovering and creating
new jobs, it would have nosedived."
</P>
<P>
"The way to help them (the unemployed workers) is not to keep
out foreign workers, It is to create more new jobs and to prepare
them for the new jobs through training and skills development
programs," the acting prime minister concluded.

<HEADLINE> Symposium Focuses on Sending Power From West to East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A symposium focusing on the
transmission of the rich energy resources in western China to the
economically developed east was held in Beijing from April 11 to
12.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guobao, a vice-minister of the State Development Planning
Commission, said developing rich energy resources in the western
regions and transmitting them to the east is an inevitable choice
for China and a win-win strategy for both the western and eastern
regions.
</P>
<P>
China has potential hydropower resources of 378 million
kilowatts in installed capacity. However, 70 percent of the
resources are in the remote western regions.
</P>
<P>
China has already three major areas through which power in the
west is transmitted to the east. In the north, power is
transmitted from Shanxi and Inner Mongolia to Beijing, Tianjin and
Tangshan. In the south, electricity is transmitted from Guizhou to
Guangdong province and electricity produced by the Gezhouba Power
Station in Hubei Province is transmitted to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials and top legislators have recently called for
greater efforts to develop hydropower in the west and transmit
such power to the east.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the symposium suggested that the government
should accelerate reforms of the electricity administration system
and optimize the distribution of electricity.

ABU DHABI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Omani Foreign Ministry denied
that it had signed a defense agreement with Iran, terming reports
about such an agreement as "groundless," a newspaper of the United
Arab Emirates reported Wednesday.
</P>

as saying that "the mission of the Omani military delegation, which
has just ended its visit to Tehran, was only within the technical
context."

Commander of Omani Air Force Mohamed Bin Mahfouz has just
returned from a five-day visit to Iran, during which he held talks
with his Iranian counterpart with a view to improve military
relations between the two countries, the official said, noting that
Mahfouz did not sign any defense accords during the visit.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas are preparing the ground in
Lebanese refugee camps for Palestinian terrorist groups to attack
Israel, a senior IDF intelligence officer told the Knesset
(parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is not just working with religious fundamentalists,
but has established several new secular groups among the 300,000
Palestinian refugees, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The officer also expressed concern about recent statements by
Syria, some Lebanese government officials and Hezbollah concerning
a potential increase in violence along Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- By mid-2000, there will be some 3.2 million Palestinians with
53 percent of them under the age of 18, according to a report
issued by the Palestinian National Authority's Central Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 3.2 million Palestinians, 63 percent live in
Gaza and 36.1 percent in the West Bank, said Hassan Libedh, chief
of the Palestinian CBS.
</P>
<P>
Some 37.2 percent of Gaza children and 16.1 percent of West Bank
children live in poverty, it added. The situation in refugee camps
is particularly difficult, with some 37.3 percent of the children
there living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- United States President Bill Clinton Tuesday welcomed Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's plan to pull Israeli troops out of
southern Lebanon this July, and urged him to make faster headway
with the Palestinians on a West Bank withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Tuesday night that the outlook for success on the
Israeli-Syrian peace track is "no bleaker" than it was before his
failed Geneva summit with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad last
month, but here is "a lot more hope for rapid movement" on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Barak, in Washington on a fast-paced 18-hour visit, met with U.
S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.S. Mideast Special
Envoy Dennis Ross before heading into a meeting with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Tuesday sent a special
message from Washington to American scholar Deborah Lipstadt, who
was vindicated in a libel suit brought against her in a London
Court by controversial historian David Iving.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the "name of the Israeli people and the Jewish
people," Barak told Lipstadt that her struggle and victory is a
triumph for free people against "dark forces which want humanity's
lowest point to be forgotten."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the British High Court exonerated Lipstadt, professor
of history at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, of all the main
charges stemming from her 1994 book, Denying the Holocaust: the
Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge in Tokyo, Nikkei Hits 40-Month Closing High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply in Tokyo
Wednesday on the back of gains in domestic demand-related issues,
with the benchmark Nikkei index hitting a 40-month closing high.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 310.69 points, or 1.51
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 20,833.21, the highest
close since December 5, 1996, when it finished at 20,943.90.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 5.25 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,706.
34.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 682.13 million
shares from Tuesday's 586.82 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
After opening, the Nikkei rose on gains made by domestically
oriented issues following an improved economic assessment issued
by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), traders said.
</P>
<P>
Real estate firms, banks attracted active buying, while
warehousing firms, construction firms and nonlife insurers saw
large gains.
</P>
<P>
However, uncertainty over the course of high-tech issues in New
York dampened information and technology issues in Tokyo, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
Brokerage houses, wholesalers and nonferrous metal makers also
faced selling, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered
losers 790 to 483, with 119 issues closing unchanged.

opening Benson &AMP; hedges Malaysian Open, will be present at the
Macao Open.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past two years we have been very fortunate to watch

Davidoff Tour.
</P>

"Macao is a wonderful destination for golfers and I am sure
that Mark, like the stars who have played here before, will give
it his seal of approval when he arrives here next month," Manuel
Silverio said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has abolished 21 toll gates on its highways so far this year as
part of a national drive to end illegal highways charges.
</P>
<P>
The toll gates were set up on national highways No.104 and No.
302, accounting for about 20 percent of Zhejiang's total, and
doing away with them will save more than 200 million yuan (24
million US dollars) in fees for vehicles passing along the
highways annually, according to local transport authorities.
</P>
<P>
The highways are now operating smoothly without the toll gates,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The province has since 1992 invested a total of 38.8 billion
yuan, which would be used to rebuild and upgrade 3,447 kilometers
of highways.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Warned of Tourism Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The China Consumers' Association
(CCA) has offered tips to tourists on choosing travel agencies to
help prevent agency scams, according to today's "Economic Daily".
</P>
<P>
The CAA has advised consumers to choose reputable and
registered travel agencies. "China has more than 1,000 tourist
agencies and only 67 of them are officially approved to offer
services for overseas tour groups," said an official with CCA.
</P>
<P>
Representative offices of registered travel agencies in China
are not allowed to organize or receive travel groups, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cheap tour packages offered by some small travel agencies only
charge travel expenses and entrance fees to scenic spots. These
seemingly attractive offers turn out to be scams when tour groups
organized by some agencies take tourists to over-priced gift
stores and make a commission from sales, the official warned.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are also advised to carefully study contracts they
sign with travel agencies and buy travel insurance.
</P>
<P>
CCA handled some 5,330 complaints about travel agencies last
year, up 41 percent from the previous year. The majority of
complaints involved tours to Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Madagascar Guests (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Hu Jintao said
here today that China is pleased with the growth of its relations
with Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remark
during a meeting with a delegation of the Party of Action for
Madagascar's Renaissance led by its National Secretary Pierrot
Rajaonarivelo.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to the delegation on behalf of the CPC, Hu,
who visited Madagascar in early 1999, said he became acquainted
with Rajaonarivelo and other friends at hand, and was very happy
to meet Rajaonarivelo again in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bilateral relations have been developing
continuously since the forging of diplomatic ties in 1972, and
that an exchange of high-level visits have been frequent, while
bilateral cooperation in a variety of areas has been expanding.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations based on sincere friendship, equality, and
mutual benefit have had a steady momentum for development and
China was delighted over this, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu went on to say that the CPC places great importance on its
relations with the Party of Action for Madagascar's Renaissance,
because both parties are in power, the growing exchanges and the
learning between the two are conducive to the growth of their
respective parties and countries, and also helps to promote the
further growth of bilateral relations.

Rajaonarivelo, who is also Madagascar's deputy prime minister,
said he and other members of his delegation have during the visit
felt the firm leadership of the CPC and witnessed for themselves
the achievements China has made in its reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
This proves Madagascar's correctness in adhering to the one
China policy, he said, noting that there is only one China, and
Taiwan is a province of China. He also congratulated the Chinese
government on the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao in late December last year.
</P>
<P>
China's development experience proves that the viewpoint of
China, and of a large number of developing countries, that human
rights are first the right to subsistence and development, is
correct, he said. Madagascar will continue to support China in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of China's efforts to promote Sino-African
friendship and Sino-Madagascar cooperation, he said that China's
assistance to his nation in recent years has set a good example
for South-to-South cooperation, which was initiated by China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said Madagascar wishes to see even greater
development of South-to-South cooperation, and he expressed his
belief that Sino-Madagascar cooperation will be further expanded.

<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China has recently set up its
first advanced temporary storage for nuclear wastes discharged
from civilian-use reactors in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The storage is built by the Nuclear Power Research and Design
Institute of China to hold solid nuclear waste and other
radioactive waste materials. Some of the waste will be disposed of
permanently by burying it deep underground, an official with the
State Environmental Protection Administration of China (SEPA) said
today.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear waste storage will be capable of handling and
disposing 1,000 barrels of nuclear waste each year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are a total of 27 smaller temporary storage
facilities in major cities across China for discarded radioactive
wastes, which are discharged from hospitals and other medical
institutions.

<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- "The title of our report is '
analysis of the regulating effect of the coliform bacteria HU
albumen at the beginning of duplication process of bacteriophage
DNA'," 13-year-old Chen Xiaoyan told more than 100 listeners, and
could not conceal his childishness.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Fang Zhou, co-author of the report attended a
scientific seminar for youngsters in Beijing last weekend. The
seminar, sponsored by the Chinese Association for Science and
Technology (CAST), drew students from 12 middle schools.
</P>
<P>
With the help of CAST, Chen and Fang started their research in
the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS) last year.
</P>
<P>
Other lecturers explained their studies in basic research
fields including biotherapy on tumors, trans-genic animals, and
control of blue algae pollution.
</P>
<P>
Besides these abstruse reports, some students expanded their
research from sex education among youngsters to nutrition among
Chinese schoolchildren, which were more understandable to the
student listeners.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion period after every report, boys and girls
would raise some pointless questions, and the young lecturers
answered them nervously.
</P>
<P>
An organizer of the seminar from CAST said, "We select some
middle school students with high interest in science and help them
do research in their spare time in the institutes and labs of CAS
or Beijing University or Qinghua University."
</P>
<P>
"It is part of our plan to train talent in the life sciences,
and the training will be expanded to other research fields in the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The most outstanding reports selected by experts will be
submitted to the national science and technology innovation
contest for youngsters, which is expected to be held in east China
's Anhui Province in August.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Zengyi, an official with the Ministry of Education, said
scientific research classes will be set up in the high schools in
some provinces this autumn to stimulate student interest in
science.

SHANGHAI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- "In the beginning, it was merely
a house, but now it is our home," Francisco Guerra says, sitting
in his residence in the Pudong New Area, Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
To work in China had been a dream for this Philippine man who
is now vice chairman of the S.C. Johnson and Son, Inc., USA and
executive chairman of Shanghai Johnson Ltd..
</P>
<P>
Like many of the 25,000 foreign nationals working in Pudong, Mr.
Guerra and his family have found a comfortable home in this 10-
year old development zone, since they sold their old house in the
United States four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Even my son often tells his classmates he is Shanghainese,"
says the father. His son is studying at the Shanghai American
School in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Marketing in China is somewhat harder than he thought, but Mr.
Guerra says he likes China best. His Chinese colleagues call him "
Gaile", which sounds like "great" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Guerra is fond of reading and swimming in his spare time.
Sometimes, the couple take a stroll along commercial streets,
local markets that sells flowers and birds, or some other places
of interests in Pudong. "Nobody knows we are foreigners until we
open our mouth," says the husband.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Grant Amnesty to 12,500 Prisoners in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's public security
department is considering a list of over 12,500 prisoners for the
first batch of the special amnesty in 2000, Vietnam News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Advisory Council for Special Amnesties (CACSA) of
the country said a list of eligible inmates will be sent to State
President Tran Duc Luong for endorsement.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners will be released on the occasion of the 25th
anniversary of the country's liberation of the South and national
reunification (April 30),
</P>
<P>
According to Pham Duc Chan, Deputy Director of the Department
for Detention Camp Management under the Ministry of Public
Security, his department had received by April 11 nearly 13,000
applications for early release by prisoners from detention camps
throughout the country without any complaint about amnesty
considerations by detention camps' officials.
</P>
<P>
He added that nine inter-branch expert groups under the CACSA
began examining the records of prisoners proposed for special
amnesty in nine regions across the country on March 17, nearly one
month after President Tran Duc Luong signed Decision on special
amnesty in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 of 13,000 amnesty applicants failed to meet the
required conditions, Chan said.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Eradication Remains Tanzania's Long-term Goal: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian government
official has said that poverty eradication was still a long
standing goal in the country despite the debt relief.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Guardian newspaper on Wednesday,
the government has told donor countries that a two billion U.S.
dollar debt relief for Tanzania under the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) initiative was still not enough to free the
cash-strapped country from the shackles of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of State in the Vice-President's Office
Edward Lowassa urged the donor community to cancel all debts
outright, reduce conditions attached to aid and review the
practice of restricting aid.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is in charge of poverty alleviation issues,
made the remarks while speaking to visiting ministers for
International Development from Germany, the Netherlands, Norway
and Britain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More was still needed to be done to promote broad-based growth
in the country where half of the population are still living below
the poverty line of the 0.65 U.S. dollar daily income.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund announced
last week that they will halve Tanzania's debt servicing bill for
2001-2003 and reduce it by a third in future years.
</P>
<P>
They pledged that it will create room for additional
expenditures on poverty reduction.

<HEADLINE> World Community Urged to Offer Emergency Relief Food to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of United
Nations bodies in Ethiopia have appealed to the international
community to step up food aid to drought affected people in the
Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from the World Food Program (WFP), the
World health Organization (WHO), The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and
the World Bank made the appeal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the relief food offered so far by the international
 community was not adequate, the representatives said that the
world community should continue food assistance to stem the famine
in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
WHO country representative Michel Janclos said although WHO has
 distributed food among the drought-affected people, the supplies
were not sufficient compared with the gravity of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF representative said the body has appealed for 7.7
million U.S. dollars to provide clean water as well as health and
emergency education services to the drought afflicted people.
</P>
<P>
However, UNICEF has received to date only 500,000 U.S. dollars,
 according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Large part of Ethiopia has been reportedly suffering from
drought since late last year with more than eight million people
facing starvation.

About 19,600 Congolese refugees were at Mwange in Northern

way her sister did last year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Australian Swimming Rules out Bodysuit Ban at Olympic Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Swimming will allow
swimmers to wear the controversial neck-to-ankle bodysuits at the
Australian Olympic trials despite threats the suits will spark
protests, according to reports from Brisbane, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Australian Swimming president Terry Gathercole said the May 13-
20 trials would comply with regulations set down by FINA, the
world swimming federation, which had already sanctioned the Speedo
swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Olympic Committee is seeking a ruling from the
Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) to determine if the
swimsuits comply with FINA regulations, which prohibit "any device
that may aid (a swimmer's) speed, buoyancy and endurance during a
competition."
</P>
<P>
The CAS appointed Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to take
submissions and make an advisory opinion.
</P>
<P>
Gathercole said the CAS decision was not binding on FINA or
Australian Swimming because arbitrator McLaren had been asked only
to provide an opinion.
</P>
<P>
Speedo Wednesday said a bodysuit would be available to every
swimmer participating in the Australian selection trials.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Regatta Course Laden with Weeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite a massive cleanup
campaign by the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), the rowing
and kayaking venue for the Sydney Olympic Games was still laden
with weeds and unfit for competition, Australian rowing coach
Brian Richardson said in Sydney on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Working under floodlights, OCA staff had trolled the regatta
center at Penrith scraping weeds off the course in the buildup to
heats of the national selection trials Wednesday but competitors
still complained about being hindered by weeds.
</P>
<P>
On assurances from the OCA that a new harvester combined with a
special herbicide would ensure weeds were eradicated, Canoeing
officials agreed to return the kayak trials to Penrith later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the situation had improved in the last week but
the problem had not been solved.
</P>
<P>
An OCA spokesman said aquatic plants in the lake system would
also continue to be closely monitored and, if necessary, cleared.

KAMPALA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said that poverty in his country is largely caused by the fact
that the largest part of the population are engaged in agriculture
whose progress is slow.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments while addressing a public rally in Luweero
in central Uganda on Tuesday, according to a press release
available here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president assured those present at the rally that his
ruling National Resistance Movement is trying to tackle the
problems facing the country and will meet the remaining challenges
with vigor and courage.
</P>
<P>
Modernization of agriculture and industrial development were
ways the government has found to lead the country out of poverty,
Museveni added.

<P>
More than 46 percent of the population in the east African
country are still living under the poverty line and over 80
percent of the Ugandan people are farmers. Poor infrastructure
and unpredictable weather changes are very often blamed for the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China should set up a fund to
accelerate the development of China's western region, the China
Economic Times has reported.
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds has long been a bottleneck for economic
development in the western China.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a fund should use both the governmental
and regional finance. Other provinces should also provide
financial aid to the best of their ability and solicit the support
and help of international organizations and foreign governments in
raising funds.
</P>
<P>
These funds will also compensate transportation and
environmental costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
The fund will concentrate on building infrastructure projects
and other key enterprises such as agriculture, water conservancy
and high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, loans worth 1.57 trillion yuan were directed to the
western region, 16.1 percent higher than the previous year, and
the growth rate was 1.5 percentage points higher than other
regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, credit risk of loans is still high as compared to that
of some developed regions. Commercial banks are encouraged to
offer credit services in western regions.
</P>
<P>
Due to the development of capital-intensive enterprises in the
western region, the number of laid-off workers has increased
dramatically each year. Thus funds will help subsidize labor costs
according to job opportunities. Only when a surplus labor force
decreases, will social stability be guaranteed. Subsidies will be
provided by the government for companies that help people in poor
areas in the western regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 12 (Xinhua) - Sri Lanka's trade deficit widened
to some 300 million U.S. dollars in the first two months of this
year, an 117 percent increase over the same period a year earlier,
the Central Bank said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its weekly economic report that the ever-
increasing deficit was due to a sharp surge in imports, including
the importation of aircraft and intermediate goods.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew by 14.7 percent in the January-February 2000
period to 758.6 million dollars from 661.6 million dollars in the
same period of 1999, it said. However, imports were up 32.4
percent at 1.059 billion dollars during the period, it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank said agricultural exports increased by 14.1 percent to
153.5 million dollars from 134.5 million dollars in the first two
months of 1999. Industrial exports, especially those of food and
beverage and petroleum products, were up 15.2 percent at 580.5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rise in imports was reflected mainly in two of the three
main categories -- consumer goods, intermediate goods and
investment goods, with imports rising by 4.8 percent, 35.5 percent
and 49.3 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Higher World Cereal Output Forecasted in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- World cereal production this year
is predicted higher to 1890 million tonnes, some 1 percent above
1999, according to a report of the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reaching Xinhua News
Agency Bangkok Bureau Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report forecasts that output of wheat in the world this
year is going to reach 595 million tonnes, 1 percent up from last
year, while that of coarse grains will rise nearly 3 percent to
900 million tonnes. The rice crop (milled-based) is tentatively
forecasted to fall by 1 percent to 395 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The FAO's latest forecast of world cereal trade in 1999-2000
period is 222 million tonnes, some 4 percent above the previous
year's volume.
</P>
<P>
While early forecasts predict to higher cereal output in 2000,
the report warned that the production will not be sufficient to
meet expected demands during 2000-2001 period, and may result in
the shrinking of global cereal reserves.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that food emergencies will persist in 34
countries around the world, and unfavorable prospects in several
other countries could lead to localized food supply difficulties.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Tech-Share Tumble Not to Derail Asia's Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The recent plunge of U.S.
technology stocks has prompted sharp declines in Asia's tech-
shares in the past weeks, but the volatile New Economy stocks are
unlikely to derail Asia's economic recovery process.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, although Dow Jones industrial average advanced, the
Nasdaq composite index tumbled for the second consecutive day by
132.30 to 4,055.90, following a fall of 258.25 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index is now lower for the year and is nearly 20
percent below its record closing high of 5,048.62 points on March
10.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Nasdaq's 5.8 percent plunge Monday, Seoul took
one of the hardest hits Tuesday, with the 8.1 percent drop on the
tech-heavy Kosdaq Index. Hong Kong suffered as well, with the Hang
Seng Index dropping 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's selling focused on technology stocks. Internet
investor Hikari Tsushin tumbled 6.6 percent in Tokyo, South Korean
telephone-service provider Dacom sunk 8.3 percent, and China
Telecom fell 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, Hong Kong's top Internet stock, Pacific
Century Cyber-Works Ltd, is down 33 percent, while Hikari Tsushin
Inc., a Japanese Internet incubator, is more than 60 percent lower
on the Tokyo exchange.
</P>
<P>
The continuos fall in New Economy stocks has raised the
question:Do the volatile tech-stocks affect Asia's economic
recovery process?
</P>
<P>
Analysts said if tech-shares in the United States and Asia
tumble further, Asia's recovery process could slow down with
weaker consumer confidence, which may affect Asia's exports to the
United States and touch off a possible pullback of new equity
capital in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, the process is unlikely to be derailed because the
region's economic fundamentals remain sound, they said.
</P>
<P>
"A bursting of the (tech-stock) bubble might impact the rate of
growth, but it probably wouldn't push growth into negative
territory,"said Tim Condon, chief regional economist for ING
Barings.
</P>
<P>
The United States is a big market for Asian products. The
possible reduction in U.S. imports from Asia due to lower consumer
confidence will definitely have an impact on the region' economy.
</P>
<P>
But, since intraregional trade accounts for about two-thirds of
Asia's exports, the region's trade will not collapse because of
less imports by the United States. In recent months, most Asian
countries have increased their exports and imports with the
quicker pace of economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
In February, South Korea's customs-cleared exports rose 37
percent while imports rose 58 percent, reflecting improved
business and consumer sentiment in the country. Even in Indonesia,
February exports grew 44.3 percent from a year ago, while imports
increased 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the main engine of the region's economic development, Asia's
export growth, and the intraregional trade in particular, would
help the recovery process continue, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, except South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, New Economy
in other Asian economies is still at the stage of evolution. Asia'
s limited exposure to the Internet games will prevent the region
from being hit hard by a potential bursting of the bubble in the
Internet and technology shares.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the recent tumble in tech-shares is just "a correction,
"and might not continue for too long and affect the region's
recovery,experts said.
</P>
<P>
For the last year and a half, the stock market has become a
market of extremes: extremely high valuations for the New Economy
and extremely low valuations for the Old Economy -- the
traditional sectors,economists said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they said, the market has tried to correct those
extremes in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"This is a transitional period when investors are looking for
value and trying to reduce some of their exposure to the
technology sector or to New Economy stocks," said Terrence Alford,
fund manager for Dresdner RCM Global Investors.
</P>
<P>
"But as we move into the latter part of the second quarter and
into the third quarter, investors will focus on the technology (
again)," he said.

<HEADLINE> Import Ban on Three-Wheelers Proposed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Environment and
Forest has proposed a total ban on the import of three-wheel motor
vehicles having two-stroke engines to check the air pollution in
Dhaka and other cities, The Independent newspaper reported here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the National Board of Revenue (NBR) Tuesday,
the ministry made an alternative proposal to impose a 300 percent
duty on such vehicles to discourage the import. The present duty
on two-stroke engine vehicles is 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also proposed a similar ban on the import of motor
vehicles having four-stroke diesel engines or imposition of 300
present duty since these vehicles are equally responsible for the
air pollution in the city.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the ministry proposed zero tariff on import of
motor vehicles operated by compressed natural gas which are
environment-friendly.
</P>
<P>
The ministry maintained that the ban on import of leaded fuel
should remain since the measure proved helpful in improving the
environmental condition.
</P>
<P>
Petrol-driven motor cars to be imported in the future must have
catalytic converters to keep the air free from any kind of
pollution,the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Environment Secretary Syed Marghub Murshid who signed the
letter said that inclusion of these measures in the next year's
budget would help improve the environment of the country to a
large extent.
</P>
<P>
He requested the Chairman of NBR to consider the proposals
while preparing the budget for the coming fiscal 2000-2001.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, UNPKF Sign MOU on Security in Border  Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) on how to handle incidents
in the border regions and the repatriation of East Timorese
refugees was signed on Tuesday in Dili, capital of East Timor by
the Udayana Military Commander Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri and UNPKF
Chief Let. Gen.Jaime S De Los Santos, Antara news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It said that both sides considered the agreement as a
significant step forward for the efforts of both sides for
cooperation in maintaining security in the borders regions.
</P>
<P>
"With the signing of the MOU, I hope as of now, every problem
in the border regions could be solved by me and general Santos.
There is no need to politize such a problem," Syahnakri was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor (UNTAET)
led by Peter Galbraith has recently voiced their disappointment to
Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab and Minister of Defense
Juwono Sudarsono in Jakarta over 16 incidents in the border line,
including the intrusion of villagers into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the TNI has since October 1999 noted the
occurrence of 25 cases of incidents in the border regions
including 17 defence and security cases.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 East Timorese became refugees in East Nusa
Tenggara following violence in East Timor after the overwhelming
vote for independence during the U.N.-sponsored ballot on August
30 last year.While more than 100,000 East Timorese have been
repatriated in recent months, but around 140,000 others still
remain in refugee camps in the western half of the Timor island
because they have no home or job to return to.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Former PDI Chief Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Former chief of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) Soerjadi was arrested over his alleged
involvement in a bloodshed in July 1996, local leading newspapers
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Soerjadi, who is also a member of the Supreme Advisory Council(
DPA), one of the country's high state institution, was
interrogated by the police for 10 hours on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Minister of Home Affairs Syarwan Hamid is
expected to be questioned too, over his alleged role in the same
incident which sparked by a forcible takeover of the party's
headquarters in July 27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the incident, those who claimed to be loyal to Soerjadi
took over the party's office in Central Jakarta which at that time
was occupied by supporters of the legitimate chairperson Megawati
Soekarnoputeri (now Vice President) activists.
</P>
<P>
A government-back, controversial party congress in early 1996
appointed Soerjadi as PDI chairman. Megawati's staunch backers,
however did not recognize Soerjadi's leadership and refused to
leave the headquarters, and then the bloodshed happened.
</P>
<P>
The National Commission on Human Right (Komnas HAM) announced
in September 1996 that at least five people died, 149 injured,
while 23 were still missing during the riots.
</P>
<P>
Many believed that elements of the Indonesian Military (TNI)
and the central government officials were involved in the attack,
including former Chief of Sociopolitical Affairs of the TNI, Let.
Gen.Syarwan Hamid who was then minister of home affairs under
Habibie Administration.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Pieter's statement, Spokesman of the police,
Brig. Gen. Dadang Garnida said that his office "is now well-
prepared to summon a number of military officers including several
generals."

<HEADLINE> Peru's Opposition Not to Accept Fujimori's Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Peru's presidential candidate
Alejandro Toledo warned Tuesday that the opposition parties won't
accept any result from the National Organization of Electoral
Processes (NOEP) declaring President Alberto Fujimori the winner.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated the parties won't make concessions on their
democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed Tuesday that with 90.82 percent of
the ballots counted, Fujimori had won 49.79 percent, compared to
Toledo's 40.39 percent.
</P>
<P>
The parties accused NOEP of manipulating the elections to make
Fujimori the absolute winner.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be stubborn in defense of the transparency of
presidential elections", Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, 61, who came to power in 1990 and won a re-election
in 1995, denied any fraud at a news conference Monday night,
saying the elections are "clean, free and fair".
</P>
<P>
Toledo also urged the president to meet with the opposition in
order to prevent political crisis which might occur as results of
an increase in recession and poverty, as well as an escape of
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"I'm asking you, Mr. President, not to think about your current
leadership, nor only about NOEP results. I'm also asking you not
to polarize and put Peruvians face to face," he said.

HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
arrived in the Cuban capital of Havana Tuesday night for the South
Summit, the first and largest gathering of heads of state and
government since the establishment of the Group of 77 (G-77) in
June 1964.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Havana airport, Chavez was greeted by
Jose Ramon Fernandez Alvarez, vice chairman of the Cuban Council
of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Chavez is among some 60 heads of state or government in Havana
to attend the opening ceremony of the Summit on Wednesday morning,
along with scores of foreign ministers and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
A total of 122 member countries, 34 non-member countries and 35
international organizations have sent delegations here.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, headed by Vice Premier Li Lanqing,
arrived in Havana Tuesday afternoon. China has for some time had
close ties with G-77. Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Peraz Roque,
at a press conference Monday, spoke highly of China's support for
the 133-member group.
</P>
<P>
Although the group, founded by 77 developing countries on June
15, 1964 in Geneva, has seen its membership grow to 133 countries,
the original name was retained because of its historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest grouping in the South, G-77 provides the means
for the developing world to articulate and promote its collective
economic interests, enhance its joint negotiating capacity on
major international economic issues, and promote economic and
technical cooperation among developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Myanmar Falls Sharply in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar absorbed a total of 49.
553 million U.S. dollars of foreign investment in 1999, 79.94
percent less than the 247 million dollars drawn in 1998, according
to the latest figures issued by the country's Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
These investment came from eight countries and regions with
Thailand injecting in 16.5 million dollars, Britain 15 million
dollars, Japan 5.095 million dollars, India 4.5 million dollars,
Singapore 3.261 million dollars, China's Hong Kong 2.5 million
dollars, Indonesia 1.377 million dollars and South Korea 1.32
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The investments covered four sectors of mining, manufacturing,
hotels and tourism, and fishery.
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop of foreign investment is attributed mainly to
the impact of the Asian financial crisis which, the Myanmar
authorities admitted, has brought about a reduction of 70 percent
of direct investment from member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, since Myanmar opened to
foreign investment in late 1988, the country had drawn from 24
countries and regions a total of 7.1 billion dollars of the
investment as of the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Leading foreign investors lined up as Singapore, Britain,
Thailand, Malaysia and France.

<HEADLINE> Number of Undernourished People Goes Down: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of people
undernourished in the world goes down by a little over 40 million
during the last three years, according to an FAO study.
</P>
<P>
The study, released Tuesday in Merida, Yucatan, southeastern
Mexico, said that until 1996 there were 800 million undernourished
in the developing countries and in countries with transition
economies.
</P>
<P>
"The rhythm of progress hasn't been enough to reach the
objective of 400 million with undernourishment for year 2015,"
said the report.
</P>
<P>
If the current tendency keeps on, if the number of
undernourished people goes down around eight million per year, the
total in 2015 would be 638 million, it said.

<HEADLINE> OPEC to Review Effects of Oil Output Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Energy Minister Ali
Rodriguez said on Tuesday that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) will review the effects of the oil
output increase decided by the organization in March.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC ministers will hold an extraordinary meeting on June
21 in Vienna "to make a balance of the decisions taken in relation
to production, and the market will be analyzed to know its
performance," said Rodriguez in a communique of the Venezuelan
Ministry of Energy.
</P>
<P>
OPEC, which dominates 42 percent of the world oil market,
decided last month to increase their output by an estimated 1.4
million barrels per day to stabilize the oil prices that had risen
to a nine-year high of more than 30 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
This organization, consisting of eleven members, and of which
Venezuela is the third largest producer, cut its output in 1998 to
raise prices which at the beginning of 1999 sank to their lowest
levels in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said this consecutive lows in oil prices over past
weeks on the world market are due to the coming summer season and
the added offer of oil in the world market.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports, OPEC's oil price has fallen by
seven dollars per barrel since the organization decided to
increase its output.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's oil was selling last week at 24.32 dollars per
barrel, 75 cents lower than its last week price, according to the
Minister of Energy.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Congress Rejects Access of U.S. Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan Congress Tuesday
rejected the entry of U.S. troops into Guatemala to help control
drug traffic and forest fires in the north, said news reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
With the rejection of the opposition parties, especially the
Avanzada Nacional Party (PAN), the ruling Guatemalan Republican
Front (GRF), which holds 63 of the 113 seats in Congress, failed
to obtain 14 more votes needed to pass a law that would allow U.S.
soldiers to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
PAN, which was in power from 1996 to 2000, dismissed the U.S.
military presence as a violation of Guatemala's national
sovereignty, and an indication of ineptitude by the country's
security forces and armies in fighting drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, presented to Congress by President
Alfonso Portillo in March, U.S. cooperation would be part of the
"Maya-Jaguar" narcotics control plan to intercept dealers in the
air, land and water.
</P>
<P>
Portillo asked Guatemalans to show appreciation rather than
criticism of the U.S. military presence, saying that next month he
would personally thank the chief of the U.S. South Command General
Charles Wilhelm for the help they have given his country in
controlling the nearly 180 fires in the northern Peten Forest.

BRASILIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's exports of electronic
products surged 69 percent to 590 million U.S. dollars during the
first two months this year, compared to the same period last year,
said Brazil's Electronic and Electrical Industry Association

The drastic rise was pushed by brisk exports of

The association said that it will review its forecasts for
exports of the largest economy in Latin America this year. At the
start of this year, it predicted that Brazil's exports would grow
10 percent from the more than 3.2 billion dollars recorded last
year, but now, it is forecasting a 15 to 20 percent export hike.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Try and Salvage Mideast Peace Negotiations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton,
anxious to secure peace in the Mideast to enhance his eight-year
term at the White House, said Tuesday he would do what he could to
salvage stalled peace negotiations between Israeli-Palestinian and
Israeli-Syrian fronts.
</P>
<P>
"We will do what we can to help," he said on the White House's
south lawn with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak by his side.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of hope for rapid movement on the Palestinian
front," he told reporters, adding that the next few weeks would be
critical for progress.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
before her meeting with Barak that the United States hoped the
Israeli-Palestinian talks might move faster.
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue that needs to be done as soon as possible,"
she said, referring to Israel's further pull-out of the West Bank
in June.
</P>
<P>
Hasan Abdel Rahman, the PLO's representative in Washington,
said, however, that there were still "no results" regarding
current negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians at
Bolling Air Force Base near Washington. "Let's hope that will
change," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said the Palestinians wanted Clinton to make clear to
Barak, who was summoned by Clinton to Washington for hasty talks
on the stalled negotiations, that the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations must be concluded successfully by September 13, a
deadline set by the United States, Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
As for Israel's negotiations with Syria, which broke down in
mid-January because of a dispute over the Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights, Clinton would not rule that those prospects
were dead.
</P>
<P>
"There are still differences," he said. "What we've got to do
is to figure out where we go from here."
</P>
<P>
The difference on the withdrawal was in how much land Israel
would cede in the Golan Heights. Israel agrees to turn over
virtually almost all the territory of the strategic plateau
captured in the 1967 six-day war, except the strip along the
northeast edge of the Sea of Galilee, so it would have full
control of precious water resources. But Syria insists that Israel
must relinquish all the territory extending to the shore of the
lake before the two countries discuss normalization. No compromise
is in sight.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he had "a variety of ideas" to take up with Clinton
about how "to give new momentum and energy to the Palestinian
track" in order to meet the September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Clinton, Barak has met with U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, Albright and National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
Albright praised Barak at a news conference for planning to
pull Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon in July, pledging that
the United States stands behind Barak's move on that front.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiangers Bury Dead Under Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- People in east China's Zhejiang
Province have decided to do without the fanfare of traditional
Chinese burials and instead deposit the ashes of their dear
departed under trees.
</P>
<P>
At Anxian Cemetery Tuesday, Zhao Ziyan, a worker from the
Hangzhou Mold Factory, planted his mother's ashes under a southern
magnolia, becoming the first citizen in the province to
participate in the region's reform of burial practices.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it doesn't violate custom and "saves a lot
of money."
</P>
<P>
His wife, Song Shuping, added, "Whenever we see the tree
growing, we see the continuing of the life of our dead relatives."
Both say they want to be buried under trees.
</P>
<P>
Too many tombs have popped up in Zhejiang cemeteries in recent
years, prompting the provincial government to take action to stop
the overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
Vice-governor Zhang Mengjin said that the province's cremation
rate has exceeded 70 percent, adding that more and more people are
expected to take advantage of the space-saving, cost-effective
burial alternative.
</P>
<P>
"This can save land, and beautify the environment," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Local citizens will be charged about 600 yuan (about 72.28 U.S.
dollars) per tree per burial. Cemetery workers are responsible for
watering and pruning the trees.

<HEADLINE> China Foresees Larger Sales of Textile Machinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's home-made textile
machinery will be more popular this year, with sales climbing to
12 billion yuan (145 million U.S.dollars) and exports hitting 200
million U.S. dollars, according to "China Materials News."
</P>
<P>
Gao Tong, vice chairman of China Textile Industry Association,
expected the sales of textile machinery to resume its peak in the
1993-94 period, basing his forecast on orders received by
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry, which has been declining in recent
years, is upgrading its technology.
</P>
<P>
The exports of Chinese textile machinery is also undergoing
rapid growth with an estimated increase of 20 percent thanks to
the state's taxation policies and improved production.
</P>
<P>
Gao called for greater attention of the government to
development of new products as well as more favorable taxation
policies in view of the sustained growth of the textile machinery
industry.

<HEADLINE> Quick Response Smoothes Beijing's Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The quick response method adopted
by traffic police has helped to smooth traffic in this capital
city, famous for its slow traffic over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
To change the situation, the municipal traffic administration
bureau last year adopted the drastic reform of quick response.
</P>
<P>
This method demands that police arrive at the scene in less
than four minutes after receiving a call and complete their work
in an average of five minutes.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, 43,559 accidents were handled with the
method, greatly reducing the traffic jams in the city, which now
has over 1.5 million motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that 80 percent of the traffic
accidents in Beijing are minor ones.
</P>
<P>
Before this new method, the city's traffic police usually took
an average of 30 minutes to deal with a single minor incident.

<HEADLINE> Galatasaray: We Want to Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Galatasaray said they have no
plans to boycott next week's UEFA Cup semi-final tie against Leeds,
even if their fans are banned from the second-leg clash.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side will discover on Wednesday whether Leeds can
guarantee the safety of Turkish fans travelling to Elland Road,
following the murder of two English fans in Istanbul last week.
</P>
<P>
Five Turkish youths have since been held in connection with the
murders.
</P>
<P>
Galatasaray president Faruk Suren dismissed suggestions his
club were seeking to qualify for the final without kicking a ball.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Suren said: "While we think it is
unfair that this matter carries on and that Turkish supporters
should not be allowed to travel, we will come and play without our
supporters if that is what Uefa decide.
</P>
<P>
"It is within their rules to forbid them to come if they so
wish. All I would ask is that Uefa and Leeds will be able to
guarantee the security of the team before, during and after the
match."
</P>
<P>
Suren said the apparent insensitivity of the Galatasaray
players not to wear black armbands in last Thursday's match had
stemmed from a UEFA ruling and not from him.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that we are seeking to make the final without
kicking another ball. To play on that and try and put the blame on
Galatasaray is not fair. Let Turkish justice take care of the
matter and I hope they will hand out the justified sentences to
those who are guilty," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Joins EU Players Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is joining the debate
about limiting the number of foreign players in the English
leagues.
</P>
<P>
He will be heading to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on
Wednesday, together with Michel Platini and Gerhard Aigner of UEFA
for talks along with FIFA and European Union officials.
</P>
<P>
There are concerns that national teams, including England,
cannot compete well at international level because of a lack of
homegrown talent due to the amount of foreign players in the
leagues.
</P>
<P>
UEFA believe up to six players who are eligible for the club's
national squad should be in a team.
</P>
<P>
The move would affect a number of top continental clubs,
including Chelsea, who recently fielded a non-English team in two
crucial games.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said: "There will be an on-going discussion into
different issues regarding the Bosman ruling and foreign players
in the game. Sir Alex Ferguson, Michel Platini and Gerhard Aigner
will be attending along with representatives from FIFA and the EU.
"
</P>
<P>
The footballing hierarchies want to debate a number of issues
including a limit on the number of foreign players in EU countries
and the Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said there will be no final decision on the day but want
change quickly.
</P>
<P>
It would be designed to counter the trend of rich European
clubs lining up mostly foreign players.
</P>
<P>
In a 1995 ruling, the EU's highest court backed Belgian player
Jean-Marc Bosman in a labour contract dispute, effectively ending
limits on EU foreigners and bringing free agency to European
leagues.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA said the Bosman decision was made for economic reasons
and football should be exempt.
</P>
<P>
Another negative aspect of the Bosman ruling has been the
decline in youth training, since small clubs no longer can sell
prodigies at high prices to rich clubs when youngsters are out of
contract.

<HEADLINE> Campbell: Red Tape Ruin Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Tottenham Hotspur captain Sol Campbell has hit out at the club's
hierarchy for a lack of silverware.
</P>
<P>
Campbell insists manager George Graham is not to blame for
Tottenham's absence of trophies and instead points the finger at
the White Hart Lane hierarchy for holding back the club.
</P>
<P>
During Graham's first season Spurs won the Worthington Cup but
this season the team has been poor in the league and the cup
competitions.
</P>
<P>
And many Spurs fans have turned on Graham for his failure to
sign any proven international-class players.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said: "It's pretty much out of the manager's hands.
</P>
<P>
"The managerial system is split. It's in the hands of different
people and different departments. There's a lot of red tape. I
don't know if it's finances or certain people's attitudes that are
holding us back. I just hope the right people wake up and realize,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The England defender has been linked with a move to Manchester
United, but is still willing to negotiate an extension to his
contract, which is due to end in the summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to talk again at the end of the season. I've said
that from day one and kept my side of the bargain," said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
"I want this club to do well but there's a gap between us and
the top sides. We need to close it not let it open up further. It'
s within the club's capabilities but attitudes must change," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Khannouchi Sets Sights on London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- World marathon record holder
Khalid Khannouchi, the only man on the planet to have run below
two hours six minutes for the event, had set his sights on Olympic
glory for the United States in Sydney in October.
</P>
<P>
But the Moroccan exile's hopes of gaining US citizenship - he
moved to New York in 1993 after becoming disillusioned from the
lack of backing from his own countries federation - and a place in
the US team have been dashed by a delay in his application.
</P>
<P>
Had it passed through in time he would have had to miss London
in order to contest the American marathon trial in Pittsburg on
May 7.
</P>
<P>
It seems he may well have to wait until Athens in four years
time to realize his dream of winning a gold medal, and the world's
best-ever marathon field assembled for London could face the
backlash.
</P>
<P>
Khannouchi said: "London is an important race to win and that's
what I want to do for all my friends and supporters. Yes, it is
one of the greatest marathons in the world but you cannot compare
it with an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"That is my biggest ambition. It would be something to cherish
and a gold medal can never be taken away from you."
</P>
<P>
Khannouchi could still yet run at the Olympics for Morocco, but
when asked about his country of birth, he countered: "I don't want
to talk about Morocco. It is the blame of the Federation. They do
things differently and make me angry."

The Israeli president said Israel and China have many
similarities, which should be used in a better way by learning from
each other in many aspects.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that Jiang's visit will further
promote the development of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Weizman asked Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen and
Israeli Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister David Levy, who
signed the communique for the establishment of diplomatic relations
in 1992, to gave their opinions.
</P>
<P>
Levy said remarkable progress has been made in bilateral ties
since the diplomatic relations were forged, and the two sides are
satisfied with the achievements.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a historic day to Israel because of Chinese
president's first visit," Levy said, adding that Israeli people
appreciate China's long history and Chinese people's splendid
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the signing in Beijing of the communique on diplomatic
relations turned a new page in the relations between China and
Israel. President Weizman's visit last year and President Jiang's
ongoing visit have pushed the Sino-Israeli relations to new
heights, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that there is even broader prospect for
the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two presidents attended the signing
ceremony of two bilateral agreements on industrial technology
research and development, as well as on education.
</P>
<P>
They also talked with Chinese and foreign press after the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived here earlier Wednesday on a state
visit to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Tightens Measures to Tackle Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government Wednesday
announced new measures to save water as the tiny island is faced
with a severe water shortage problem due to dry weather.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Cyprus News Agency, those measures
include redistribution of water resources in cities and possible
import of water from Greece, said Minister of Agriculture, Natural
Resources and Environment Costas Themistocleous after a cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall in Cyprus this year is about 60 percent of the normal
precipitation and the island's reservoirs hold 42 million cubic
metres of water, compared to 62 million the year before, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"This is the sixth driest year of this century and unfortunately
we have to continue imposing restrictions in the water supply for
drinking as well as for agriculture," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's water resources available can cover only
75 percent of household and industrial water needs, and agriculture
needs will only be met by about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total water supplies on the island are about 57 million cubic
metres but the total needs are about 138 million cubic metres, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Nicosia, Limassol and Larnaca, the three largest cities
in Cyprus, will get water in proportion to their population.
</P>
<P>
Special water saving equipment will be installed in government-
run buildings such as schools, offices and army camps.
</P>
<P>
Water supply cuts have been in force for the past few years in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government is in touch with Greece to discuss the
possibility of importing water and is also examining other options
in order to meet the country's water needs in the summer months, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Israel Opens First Arabic Ministerial Website </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ministry of Industry and
Trade on Wednesday launched the Arabic-language version of its
Internet site, the first of its kind for an Israeli ministry.
</P>
<P>
The site, http://www.israel-industry-trade.gov.il/arabic, is to
provide information in Arabic about projects, training programs
under the authority of the ministry, and industrial regulations in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The site could serve as a hi-tech aid for potential investors
and businessmen who speak Arabic.
</P>
<P>
It is viewed as a mini-breakthrough for the equality between
Jews and Arabs in Israeli society, at least in the cyberspace. The
minister Ran Cohen, a dovish political figure of the left-wing
Meretz party, reportedly played a role behind the decision.
</P>
<P>
Although Arabic is one of the two official languages in Israel
and used by nearly one-fifth of its population, it was ignored by
the majority Jews for a long time.
</P>
<P>
For example, Israeli airports, seaports, border crossings and
railway stations were not obligated to have Arabic signs until
recently.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from Arab groups which threatened to appeal to
Israel's Supreme Court, the Airports Authority agreed last month
that signs in Arabic would be installed at all Ben-Gurion
International Airport terminals and the issue would be studied for
implementation at the country's airfields.
</P>
<P>
Over one million Israeli Arab citizens live in self-contained
towns and villages in Israel, with a growing sense of bitterness
and frustration toward the Jews-dominated society.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll conducted by Givat Haviva's Institute for Peace
Research found that Israeli Arabs are beginning to see themselves
more as Palestinians living in Israel than as a full-fledged
Israeli citizen.
</P>
<P>
Local Arab communities also blamed the government for not paying
enough attention to their social and economic development. Their
leaders have organized several demonstrations since February to
force the government to allocate more funds for their communities.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang's Speech at Welcoming Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of the speech made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the
welcoming dinner hosted by Israeli President Ezer Weizman here
Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
It is a great honor for me to visit your beautiful country as
the new century and the new millennium are dawning upon human
civilization. May I begin by thanking you, Mr. President and Mrs.
Weizman, on behalf of my wife and my colleagues and in my own name,
for hosting this grand welcoming dinner for us and for your kind
remarks. I also wish to take this opportunity to extend my cordial
greetings and good wishes to the friendly people of Israel and to
pay high tribute to the Jewish nation that has produced such giants
as Karl Marx and Albert Einstein.
</P>
<P>
"Take history as a mirror, and one knows why dynasties changed."
Both the Chinese and Jewish nations have a long history and a
splendid culture and both have made outstanding contributions to
the progress of human civilization. And both had misfortunes in the
past. The long evolution our two nations have gone through and the
unyielding struggles we have waged amidst hardships and miseries
not only attest to our national identity, i.e. persistence in self-
improvement, but also represent the trend of the times - the human
society is bound to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and
press ahead towards a bright future. Eventually, backwardness,
ignorance and evils in all forms will be conquered and progress,
science and justice will prevail. This is an irresistible law of
history.
</P>
<P>
Mankind has created hitherto unknown material and spiritual
wealth in the 20th century, but has also been subjected to the
scourge of wars and the threat of war. In the Middle East, ethnic
conflicts, territorial disputes and endless flames of war have over
the years taken countless lives and displaced numerous people. That
has severely dampened the economic and social development of the
region and affected world peace and stability. At the time when the
Old Testament was written over 2,000 years ago on this fertile
land, our forefathers in China advanced the doctrine that "harmony
is the best option." Many stories of "burying hatchet" have been
handed down in the Chinese history. Having gone through the long
years, people have come to understand more than ever before how
important this doctrine is and how precious peace can be.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Middle East is at a historic turning point.
Peace, stability and development have become a strong and common
aspiration of all the peoples in the region. Due to reasons of
history and the realities, there is no easy solution to the Middle
East question which involves complicated contradictions.
Nevertheless, to settle the question at an early date is the
unshirkable historical responsibility of the people of all
countries in the region as well as all the peace-loving and
progressive people in the world. The settlement lies in peaceful
negotiations rather than force, in cooperation rather than
confrontation, and in mutual understanding rather than mutual
exclusion. This has increasingly become a consensus drawn from past
experience and lessons. Now thanks to the joint efforts of all the
parties concerned, much progress has been made in the Middle East
peace process. The relevant U.N. resolutions and the "land-for-
peace" principle have become the basis for negotiations among the
parties. It is gratifying and encouraging to note that leaders of
the Middle East countries, with the vision and courage of
statesmen, in a historical perspective and bearing in mind the
greater interests of peace and development, are working hard for an
early settlement of the Middle East question.

<HEADLINE> Poor Countries Pay for Rich Countries' Mistakes: G-77 Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the Group of 77 (G-
77), Nigerian leader Olusegun Obasanjo said on Wednesday here
that poor countries pay for the mistakes of the rich world,
despite the fact that "we are all in the same boat."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who opened the South Summit, said that the developing
world is stranded because the developed countries are not
enforcing measures that guarantee poor nation's access to
technology.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries' heavy foreign debt is endangering their
future, and that South-South cooperation agreements up to now are
only "dead letter", he said.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, changes that will make the world a fairest
place, should be based upon principles like the reform of
financial institutions, thus a new architecture should be erected,
besides a reduction or even an elimination of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
As regards to South-South cooperation, he set the Economic
Organization for Western African Countries (ECOWAS) as an example.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Draw up Strategy for Prevention of Natural, Ecological Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Supreme Defense
Council(CSAT) decided at its Wednesday's meeting that the
executive would present, by the end of May, a medium and long-term
strategy concerning the prevention of the negative effects of
natural and ecological disasters.
</P>
<P>
CSAT, the country's highest institution in charge of issues of
national security, held on Wednesday an emergency meeting to
discuss the risks posed to national security by recent floods and
ecological accidents. A series of measures are to be taken to
fight the effects of the mentioned disasters.
</P>
<P>
According to Romanian President Emil Constantinescu who
presided the meeting, the authorities would supply material,
financial help and other first necessity products for all the
afflicted persons in the recent floods and give temporary shelter
to those whose houses were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Immediate measures will be taken to protect the localities and
the public property against new flash floods, the head of the
state said, adding that the Executive is going to take necessary
steps for the evaluation, in two weeks, of the needs of materials
for repair and the offering of new lodgings for the affected
families,the repairing of the infrastructure and of the public
utilities affected.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rainfall and the rapid melting of snow in the first
few days of April caused floods in most regions of the country,
with the center, the northwest and the southwest of Romania being
the most affected. The damage caused is considered as the heaviest
in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures released on Wednesday, as many as
9,502 homes were inundated in 465 towns and villages between April
4-11. More than 87,950 hectares of farmland were covered by waters;
floods damaged 575 bridges, 65 social and economic units,and 65
hydrotechnical constructions.

<HEADLINE> Non-Aligned Countries Call for Development System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The President of the Non-Aligned
Movement Countries Organization, South African leader Thabo Mbeki,
made a call on Wednesday at Havana, for a world development system
centered on man.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 122 delegations present at the first South
Summit, which started on Monday and will be over on April 14,
Mbeki said that such a system must be part of world solidarity,
and "a sense of world citizenship which must transcend
cosmopolitanism."
</P>
<P>
He reminded that the chief of the International Monetary Fund (
IMF), Michel Camdessus, favored this point of view during a recent
participation in Washington, where he pledged for a global
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki quoted Camdessus as saying that traditional power
structures and interests of rich countries have to be challenged
in order to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
The Non-Aligned Movement leader set as an example the lack of
this world citizenship, the case of Mozambique, where not so long
ago violent floods ravaged the country.
</P>
<P>
Western countries, he said, went to help Mozambique, but did
not do what was really needed for a country within such
circumstances, that is eliminating its foreign debt. "Having done
so would have been against their national policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following, he highlighted the coincidences of criteria between
the G-77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, whose main objectives are
getting closer, in search of a further interaction and
concentration of positions.
</P>
<P>
Together we have to look for the elimination of poverty and the
raising of quality of life level in our countries, as well as the
defense of national identities and community cohesion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki thanked the G-77 and China for having given him the
possibility to speak at the forum, and recognized Cuba's people
and government for the effective organization of the Summit.

<HEADLINE> Reno Travels to Miami to Settle Dispute on Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said that Reno is
planning to work out a resolution, trying to meet with the parties
concerned to seek a cooperative settlement in this case.
</P>
<P>
Marlin said Reno would meet with the Miami relatives who is
taking care of Elian and community leaders in Miami, where angry
Cuban exiles have vowed to prevent the boy's return to his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the father indicated in a meeting with the
Rev. Joan Brown Campbell that he was through with negotiating and
is going to simply ask now that the attorney general issue a court
order and that the boy be returned immediately to him.
</P>
<P>
Carole Florman, a spokeswoman of the Justice Department said
earlier in the day the department plans to send a letter later on
Wednesday on transferring Elian to his father from his Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to encourage that the adults meet. At the same
time, we are moving forward with finalizing the letter which we
expect we will send by early afternoon unless other events make it
unnecessary," Florman said.
</P>
<P>
However, she added that even if the Justice Department sends
the letter instructing that the transfer occur at a specific date
and time, it could be changed later if the father and the boy's
Miami relatives reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are not backing off the position that a transfer needs to
happen quickly," she said, stressing that a meeting between the
boy's Miami relatives and his father would be "desirable" if a
resolution can be reached.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year after his mother and
other 11 people died when their boat capsized in the Atlantic off
Florida. His relatives in Miami then took custody of him.
</P>
<P>
The relatives insists that the boy should remain in the United
States even after the boy's father came to the U.S. to pick up his
son.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department ruled earlier this year that the
boy belongs to his father and should be returned to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Castro Sees Globalization Affects Rich, Poor Differently </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
Wednesday said that the globalization, a result of the formidable
scientific and technological advancement, affects peoples in the
South and the North in a different way.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his speech at the opening ceremony of the South
Summit of the Group of 77 (G-77), Castro, who put on suit for the
historic event, described the globalization as a vessel in which
people were traveling in different conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is an objective reality underlining the fact
that we are all passengers on the same vessel, that is, this
planet where we all live," he said. "But, passengers on this
vessel are traveling in very different conditions."
</P>
<P>
"Overwhelming and hurting majorities are traveling in
conditions that resemble the terrible slave trade from Africa in
our colonial past, " he said, "That is, 85 percent of the
passengers on this ship are crowed together in its dirty hold
suffering hunger, disease and helplessness."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this vessel is carrying too much injustice to
remain afloat and it pursues such an irrational and senseless
route that it cannot call on a safe port," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This vessel seems destined to clash with an iceberg," he said.
"If that happened, we would all sink with it."
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has been held tight by the patterns of
neoliberalism; thus, it is not development that goes but poverty;
it is not respect for the national sovereignty of our states but
the violation of that respect; it is not solidarity amongst our
peoples but 'sauve-qui-peut' in the unequal competition prevailing
in the marketplace," he said.
</P>
<P>
 "Two decades of so-called neoliberal structural adjustment
have left behind economic failure and social disaster," he said.
</P>
<P>
Globalization is one of the four themes top on the agenda of
the Summit, which attracts some 60 heads of state and government.
</P>
<P>
 "Crises, instability, turmoil and uncertainty have been the
most common words used in the last two years to describe the world
economic order," he said.

<HEADLINE> Castro Supports South-South Oil Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There should be a solution that benefits all of us," the
Cuban leader said while speaking to South Summit's plenary
meeting on Wednesday in Havana.
</P>
<P>
Castro said that as an expression of the South-South
cooperation, a different prices oil system could become a real
instrument for the Third World development.
</P>
<P>
"Third World solidarity within itself cannot continue allowing
its countries to pay for the oil, same prices rich countries pay,
for they even waste it, whereas poor countries barely use it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Castro said that the San Jose Agreement created 20 years ago by
Mexico and Venezuela for oil exports to Central America and the
Caribbean in preferential conditions is a good precedent of what
developing countries can do.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the need to establish a different price system
that turns into a concrete reality South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that no developing country should pay over 20 dollars
per oil barrel, and some not even 10 dollars, while industrialized
countries would more easily pay for the 30 dollars, oil price
reached during the last months.

<HEADLINE> Canada Allocates Millions of Dollars to Improve Rail System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of Canada
announced an allocation of 401.9 million Canadian dollars (about
277.3 million U.S. dollars) Wednesday to improve the country's
rail system.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Transport Minister David Collenett said the government
will give Via Rail the money over the next five years to buy new
rail cars, modernize signal systems and fix up the line between
Quebec City and Windsor in southern Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The new money will also boost Via's ability to clean up
stations and treat waste.
</P>
<P>
"We are putting an end to the deterioration of Canada's
passenger rail system," the minister said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The allocation came as Via was reported to lose a yearly 190
million Canadian dollars (about 131 million U.S. dollars) while
receiving 170 million (about 117 million U.S. dollars) in public
money in management to keep the trains running.
</P>
<P>
Collenette said subsidies are at the core of passenger rail
everywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
Via is a Crown corporation of the country that serves 3.8
million passengers and 450 communities.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees U.S. Economy Slowing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The IMF, in its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, said the U.
S. economy would likely ease to a "soft landing." But it cautioned
there was no evidence that growth, boosted by rising stock prices,
would slow on its own.
</P>
<P>
An alternative -- less likely -- scenario assumed a pickup in
global growth and inflation, followed by higher interest rates, a
25 percent correction in highly valued U.S. equity prices and a 20
percent slump in the dollar in response to a reversal of capital
flows, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
This would virtually bring U.S. growth to a halt and knock
almost a full percentage point off economic growth in the world
outlook next year, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The IMF recommended that the U.S. Federal Reserve probably need
to continue to move progressively but prudently to a tighter
monetary stance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speaking at a press conference Wednesday, IMF chief
economist Michael Mussa said the U.S. economy, the largest in the
world, will grow more strongly than expected in coming months,
forcing the Federal Reserve to move so aggressively to increase
interest rates that it could push the United States into a mild
recession starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Mussa said the IMF believes the most likely outcome is not a "
hard landing" and recession in the United States but a "soft
landing" in which the Federal Reserve is successful in slowing the
economy to a more sustainable pace that keeps inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
"The stock market, in addition to a number of other indicators,
is suggesting growing imbalances in the U.S. economy that make it
appropriate for monetary policy here to move to a somewhat tighter
stance," Mussa said.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised its funds
overnight bank lending rate five times. It has bumped up the rate
by a quarter-percentage point each time to try to slow down demand
to a point where it no longer exceeds the economy's potential to
produce -- so far with little apparent success.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising rates at
its next two or three meetings, but few in financial markets think
it will move to a more aggressive policy of half-point rate rises -
- a strategy that would be difficult to defend absent a
significant rise in still-dormant consumer price inflation.

together for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) dissolution and
the establishment of a new financial order based upon democracy
and equity.
</P>
<P>
For the Third World it is important to make this sinister
organization and the philosophy it represents disappear, said the
Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he proposed the creation of a regulatory organ for
international finances to work under a democratic basis, without
any sort of veto power by anyone.
</P>
<P>
While addressing his words during the opening of the Group of
77 South Summit, Castro denounced the United States for having
veto power on IMF decisions, and accused this organization for
having clumsily managed the last Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
If Cuba has advanced in education, health and other social
sectors, it is because it is not part of the IMF and has not had
to submit to its rulings, he said.
</P>
<P>
In relation to the IMF, Castro said that it is time for the
Third World to demand de destruction of this organism which does
not offer a world economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, because it works not to give preventive funds for
debtors and this way prevent them to have liquidity problems, but
to protect and rescue creditors, said the Cuban president.

Under-Secretary-General for Peace-keeping Operations Bernard Miyet
said the adoption on April 8 of a plan to disengage the
belligerent forces from their current confrontation lines has
added urgency to the MONUC deployment.
</P>
<P>
In February, the Council authorized the expansion of the MONUC,
mandated to monitor the cease-fire process to 5,537 military
personnel, but currently it has only about 100 unarmed military
liaison officers, U.N. figures show.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian situation in the eastern DRC has deteriorated
rapidly since the start of the year, with some 550,000 internally
displaced people caught up in the war, Miyet said.

<HEADLINE> Castro Demands Political Solution for Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign debt is nowadays one of the most serious obstacles to
develop, and another bomb, ready to explode under the foundation
of world economy during any economic crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Castro was one of the speakers at the opening ceremony of the
Group of 77 South Summit which brought together at Havana over 50
heads of State.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the initiative for the debt reduction of poor
highly indebted countries, he said that it is a ridiculous measure
since it will only alleviate 8 percent of the total debt in these
countries.
</P>
<P>
 Almost four years after that proposal, he said, only four out
of the 33 poorest countries have made it through this complicated
process, and everything to condone an insignificant amount of 2.7
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Third World's total debt amounts to 2.5 trillion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"As we have said in many occasions, with sincere realism, said
the Cuban leader, Third World's foreign debt is un-payable and un-
collectable."

<HEADLINE> Poor Countries' Debt Problem Is Political Issue, Castro Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the South Summit of the
Group of 77 (G-77), Castro, who wears a suit to represent the host
country, said "Today, it is clear than ever that the debt is not
an economic but a political issue, therefore, it demands a
political solution."
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to continue overlooking the fact that the
solution to this problem must basically come from those with
resources and power, that is, the wealthy countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The underdeveloped nations external debt is amazing not only
because it is terrible but also due to its outrageous mechanism of
subjugation and exploitation and the absurd formula offered by the
developed countries to cope with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Debt issue is one of the major concerns for the leaders from
developing countries who are here to attend the South Summit, the
largest gathering of heads of state and government since the G-77
founding in 1964.
</P>
<P>
That debt already exceeds 2.5 trillion U.S. dollars and in the
present decade it has been increasing more dangerously than in the
1970s. A large part of that new debt can easily change hands in
the secondary markets; it is more dispersed now and more difficult
to reschedule.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The debt continues to feed on itself in a vicious
circle where money is borrowed to pay its interests."
</P>
<P>
"The so-called Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Reduction
Initiative exhibits a long name but poor results," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It can only be described as a ridiculous attempt at
alleviating 8.3 percent of the South countries total debt; but
almost four years after its implementation only four countries
among the poorest 33 have reached the complicated process simply
to condone the negligible figure of 2.7 billion U.S. dollars,
which is 33 percent of what the United States spends on cosmetics
every year," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the external debt is one of the greatest obstacles to
development and a bomb ready to blow up the foundations of the
world economy at any time during an economic crisis," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police head General
Rosso Jose Serrano Cadena, said Wednesday that in the past hours
the number of captured in "Milenio dos" operation has gone up to
49.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's National Police and General Attorney with support
from U.S. Antidrug Agency(DEA), took apart at dawn Wednesday the
largest drug cartel of heroin traffic in the world and initially
held 46 people, among them four heads of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The operation took place by way of 65 searches in Bogota,
Medellin, Cali, Cucuta, Popayan, Buenaventura and three
municipalities of Cauca department.
</P>
<P>
Among those held are Nicolas Alberto de San Cayetano Urquijo
Gaviria, cousin of deceased Medellin cartel leader, Pablo Escobar,
who perished in a confrontation with police in 1993.
</P>
<P>
General Rosso Jose Serrano, and DEA director in Colombia, Leo
Arregwi, traveled to Cali, capital of Valle del Cauca department,
to present those held before the press.

special equipment.
</P>
<P>
Urquijo Gaviria, captured in Medellin, is seen as the most
important head of this organization, taken apart Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another three "high rank" heads of this heroin cartel fell

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Support Debt Relief for Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund announced Wednesday that they have
agreed to support a comprehensive debt reduction package for
Mozambique under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (
HIPC) Initiative.
</P>
<P>
Total relief from all of Mozambique's creditors under the
enhanced framework equals 600 million U.S. dollars, or 254 million
dollars in net present value terms (NPV).
</P>
<P>
This new amount is in addition to relief committed under the
original Initiative, worth 3.7 billion dollars. In total, this is
equivalent to about 72 percent of the NPV of Mozambique's total
debt outstanding at end-1998 after the full use of traditional
debt relief mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's assistance under the enhanced Initiative
amounts to 67 million dollars, of which close to 10 million
dollars in interim relief. Combined with about 975 million dollars
of assistance under the original Initiative, the World Bank is
delivering to Mozambique over 1 billion dollars in debt service
relief.
</P>
<P>
The additional assistance committed by the IMF under the
enhanced Initiative amounts to 19 million dollars, including 3
million dollars in interim relief. This is in addition to 152
million dollars of assistance delivered under the original
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
In response to the emergency brought on by the recent floods,
both the World Bank and the IMF decided to accelerate the debt
relief by forgiving 100 percent of the debt service owed by
Mozambique in the next 12 months, so that Mozambique will not have
to pay any debt service to either institution during this period.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club also granted a deferral of debt service until
Mozambique reaches its completion point under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative, which would be followed by a debt reduction under
Cologne terms at the completion point. Several Paris Club creditor
countries also announced their intention to provide voluntary
forgiveness of debt in addition to the HIPC Initiative assistance.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has received the bulk of the assistance under the
original HIPC Initiative at the completion point reached in June
1999, and started to receive interim assistance under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative immediately after the decision point.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique will receive the full amount of assistance under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative when it satisfies the requirements for a
floating completion point, including adoption of a participatory
poverty reduction strategy paper, the World Bank and IMF said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Announces New Contribution to Drought-stricken Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Maria Minna, Canada's Minister for
International Cooperation, announced an additional 1.5 million
Canadian dollars (about 1 million U.S. dollars) in emergency aid
to drought-stricken Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Canada's new contribution has brought the country's assistance
to Ethiopia since April 5 to 7.75 million dollars (about 5.35
million U.S. dollars), which are being delivered through the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).
</P>
<P>
"These funds will be used to deliver essential emergency
supplies to the victims of the drought and famine," Minister Minna
said in her announcement.
</P>
<P>
"Approximately 8 million Ethiopians, at least half of whom are
children, will starve to death unless there is a rapid deployment
of the food, water and emergency resources," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Poor rainfall over the past three years has caused drought,
crop failures and the disappearance of grazing land in many areas
of Ethiopia, where recurring drought has plagued more than 80
percent of its 60 million people over the past three decades.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Leader Fails to Promise to Speed Up Plan Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am supportive of the Colombian aid package. I feel very
strongly that it will be completed in May or early June," Lott
told reporters after meeting with Pastrana in the Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
Lott said he was eager to include the aid as part of the normal
appropriations process,hopefully within the next three months, but
not as emergency legislation.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana started his two-day visit to the United States on
Tuesday in order to persuade the Senate to approve the
administration's Plan Colombia worth 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton proposed the emergency aid package for
Colombia earlier this year to help Colombians build security, halt
the production of illegal drugs and the proposal easily sailed
through the House last month but faces a delay in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Wednesday, Pastrana said that his country will eradicate half of
crops of cocaine or poppy in his country in five years.
</P>
<P>
"I think that if we really want to avoid the growing of these
type of crops or cocaine or poppy in Colombia, we need the money
because we need to invest, not only in the eradication program,
but also investing in the alternative development programs,"
Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why you would think that not only would the resources
for promoting alternative development but also the resources to
support the police and the army in the fight against drugs will be
very important for us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Albright renewed the administration's call for rapid action by
the Senate to approve the plan.
</P>
<P>
"Four-fifths of the cocaine entering our country either comes
from Colombia or is transported through it. Most of Colombia's
heroin production also ends up here. Throughout the Americas,
drug-related activities fuel crime and corruption, aggravates
social problems and retard economic progress," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright also praised the plan by Pastrana. "Only Colombians
can devise a solution for Colombia's ills, and President Pastrana
has put forward a bold plan for doing just that."
</P>
<P>
"It's urgent that we support him not with the promise of help,
but with its reality; not eventually, but now," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate indefinitely postpones votes scheduled by the Senate
Appropriations Committee on a spending package that includes Plan
Colombia. The House has approved the aid.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Compensate Workers Exposed to Radiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the compensation plan announced by Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, which would have to be approved by Congress, nuclear
workers who got sick would receive payments for past medical bills
and lost pay. Those with certain cancers would be eligible for
compensation beginning at 100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said after some start-up costs in fiscal 2001 the
Energy Department would seek 120 million dollars a year for three
years and then another 70 million dollars after that.
</P>
<P>
The production of 70,000 nuclear weapons over 50 years employed
more than 600,000 people at 16 major sites and dozens of smaller
ones.
</P>
<P>
Workers testified in a series of recent hearings that they were
frequently exposed to high levels of radiation as well as
hazardous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Clinton administration confirmed for the first
time that nuclear weapons workers exposed to radiation and
chemicals experienced higher-than-expected cancer rates, reversing
years in which the government minimized the dangers of exposure to
radiation.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Ruling Party to Continue With Its Policies After Referendum: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said here Wednesday that the National Resistance Movement (NRM),
the ruling party of the country, would continue with its policies
if it wins in the forthcoming referendum.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing a public rally on his
second referendum campaign day in Nakasongola District, according
to a press release from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that the people of Uganda can continue building
on the gains they have made since the advent of the NRM system if
they vote for the ruling party in the referendum scheduled for
the coming June.
</P>
<P>
The future plans by the NRM include modernization of
agriculture, attracting more foreign investment and constructing
more secondary schools to absorb the products of the Universal
Primary Education program launched in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is the NRM that brought together people of different groups
and brought political stability and economic development to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Under Uganda's 1995 Constitution, a referendum is to be held in
June to decide on the country's future political system. The
ruling party is widely believed to come out the winner.

<P>
KAMPALA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has spent over 20 million
U.S. dollars on construction of barracks since 1986 when the
National Resistance Movement came to power, a senior official said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma told a parliamentary
committee on security and defense that the expenditure on barrack
construction has accounted for some 60 percent of the total sum
his ministry has spent over the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Responding to queries about the accountability of the fund, the
minister said that the auditor-general has appointed a team to
audit the related spending and would come up with a final report
on that.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's defense budget accounts for roughly two percent of the
country' s gross domestic product over the past few years. Quite a
few bilateral and multilateral donors have let out a loud outcry
for reduction of this budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The technology stocks on Wall
Street tumbled Wednesday in the third straight session, dragging
the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index below the 4,000
milestone.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Nasdaq index fell 286.27 or 7.1
percent at 3,769.63, adding to the losses of 132.30 points Tuesday
and 258.25 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 161.95 at 11,125.13 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 33.42 at 1,467.17.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq plunged after Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund
cut his revenue estimate for Microsoft to 5.75 billion U.S.
dollars from 5.95 billion dollars in the last quarter. The revised
estimate gave a heavy blew to the broad tech market. Dell, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard as well as Microsoft were sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
The composite fell today after hitting the record closing high
of 5,048.62 points on March 10 and eliminated all the gains this
year. The index is now down more than 4 percent in the year to
date.
</P>
<P>
Rules against Microsoft in an antitrust case early last week
sparked a big selloff for Microsoft and other technology stocks.
The Nasdaq composite fell 349.15 points on April 3 and 574.57
points in the session on the following day.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index trended downward in the late session from the
positive territory as investors sell blue chips to raise cash in

<P>
Bouteflika, who presides the African Unity Organization (AUO),

</P>
<P>
He said that market forces have to be regulated in order not
to provoke further unbalance and destruction in Third World
countries.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika said that in Africa, foreign capital investments are
ridiculous and one of its causes, he said, is that local markets
have shrunk due to prevailing inequality.
</P>
<P>
Finally, he asked an alleviation in the foreign debt load
affecting the Third World, saying that difficult conditions

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Share Potential with Developing World: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- With its economic potential, one
of the strongest in Africa, South Africa expects to make a notable
contribution to South-South cooperation in the southern part of
the continent, said here the Presidency Minister, Essop Pahad.
</P>
<P>
In declarations to the press at the South Summit at this
capital, Pahad said that these expectations will concentrate in a
Free Trade Zone (FTZ) in Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
This zone will be completed during the next months as part of
one of the most important issue of the summit of the Group of 77 (
G-77): South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
For Pahad, the road to this kind of exchange has to determine
first what nations have the highest development levels, like
Argentina or India who are actually investing in other nations of
the South.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to his country, Essop Pahad said that it is
developing a series of projects, with particular attention to the
mining sector, but at the same time is stimulating internal
business to invest in other nations of the South.
</P>
<P>
He said that this summit, instead of adding more new ideas on
globalization and relations with the North, should pay more
attention to the application of the dispositions already agreed
upon during the past Non-Aligned Movement countries summit at
Durban, in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said that another important aspiration
that his country shares with what has already been expressed by
Cuba, is the creation of a common front of developing countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
This is something that would "allow us to face immense problems
we have as developing countries and in our relations with the
North."

<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A greater percentage of
people have access to the Internet on the West Coast than anywhere
else in the United States, according to survey results released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Four of the top five local markets with the largest Internet
penetration for the month of February were on the West Coast,
showed the results announced by Nielsen/NetRatings, an Internet
measurement service. The top five are San Francisco, Seattle,
Portland, San Diego and Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
As a comparison, 61 percent of the people in San Francisco had
access to the Internet. Los Angeles ranked tenth with 43.9 percent
penetration, and the last of the 20 cities surveyed, Cleveland,
had a penetration of 36.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Markets that are well known technology centers lead the pack
in terms of Web penetration," NetRatings said. "The various '
Alleys' and 'Valleys' across the U.S. appear to have the largest
concentration of early Internet adopters."
</P>
<P>
The top five Internet penetration markets are also ranked in
the top ten local television markets. "Knowing where Web
penetration is high sheds light on areas likely to lead the move
to TV-Internet convergence, and could help technology and media
companies, who are setting their sights on new multimedia content
services, understand the markets that could provide them the
largest initial opportunities," said Nielsen/NetRating.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the market with the largest unique
Internet audience (individual users counted only once) during
February was New York (4.3 million), followed by Los Angeles (3.6
million), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose (2.2 million), and
Chicago (2.1 million).
</P>
<P>
San Diego, California, had the highest average time spent
online per person for February. Users in the city spent an average
of more than 11 hours online during the month.

Portland, San Diego and Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
As a comparison, 61 percent of the people in San Francisco had
access to the Internet. Los Angeles ranked tenth with 43.9 percent
penetration, and the last of the 20 cities surveyed, Cleveland,
had a penetration of 36.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Markets that are well known technology centers lead the pack
in terms of Web penetration," NetRatings said. "The various '
Alleys' and 'Valleys' across the U.S. appear to have the largest
concentration of early Internet adopters."
</P>
<P>
The top five Internet penetration markets are also ranked in
the top ten local television markets. "Knowing where Web
penetration is high sheds light on areas likely to lead the move
to TV-Internet convergence, and could help technology and media
companies, who are setting their sights on new multimedia content
services, understand the markets that could provide them the
largest initial opportunities," said Nielsen/NetRating.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the market with the largest unique
Internet audience (individual users counted only once) during
February was New York (4.3 million), followed by Los Angeles (3.6
million), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose (2.2 million), and
Chicago (2.1 million).
</P>
<P>
San Diego, California, had the highest average time spent
online per person for February. Users in the city spent an average
of more than 11 hours online during the month.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Presidents Calls for Ending Armed Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma
exhorted on Wednesday in a statement pronounced at the South
Summit, to put an end to every armed conflict in Third World
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also made a call to the countries of the Group of 77 (G-77)
to face together the globalization challenges since only this way,
a true solidarity, he said, "we will be able to incorporate
ourselves to a globalized economy."
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said that with the enormous natural resources existing
in the countries of the South, it is possible to achieve economic
development, but "the existence of an unfair international order
is an obstacle to reach it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He refuted those who claim that no democratic government has to
fear globalization, arguing that if the world order is neither
democratic nor just, then there are reasons to fight for
substantial changes.
</P>
<P>
With globalization, the President of Namibia said, having the
challenge to reach a just economic order, it is important to
remain united and in peace.

<HEADLINE> Ending Foreign Debt not Enough: Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique declared on Wednesday
before the 122 delegations present at the South Summit at this
capital, that it is not enough to eliminate foreign debt affecting
the poorest countries future, for they also need further help for
development.
</P>
<P>
Official Development Assistance alone, in combination with
foreign debt elimination will allow us to celebrate the advances
and benefits of globalization, said the President of Mozambique,
Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the southern African nation is one of the 42
heads of state present during the South Summit's meeting, the
first summit since the Group of 77 (G-77) was founded at Geneva,
Switzerland in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The countries of the South, said Chissano, have never benefited
with globalization, for until now they have not been but subject
to the process, always directed by the industrialized world'
nations.
</P>
<P>
We must revert our condition of globalized countries we have
acquired, designing for that, strategies that change such a
situation and have a more active role, according to the interests
of our peoples.
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, the benefits originated by globalization
more often are going to the North, which is widening the space
between both blocks.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the challenge that poor nations face
against external forces unleashed by finances and trade
globalization.
</P>
<P>
We still live in an unfair context, little democratic and
unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
The Summit at Havana started last April 10 and will finish next
April 14, when the Action Program and the final Havana Declaration
are to be completed.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Any Linkages to PNTR, Ambassador Li Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China, despite its efforts
for joining in the World Trade Organization, is strongly opposed
to linking its trade status with such issues as cross-strait
relations, human rights and arms proliferation, said Li Zhao-xing,
Chinese Ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement on China's accession to the WTO reached by China
and the United States is really a win-win situation. It is good
for both countries. It is also good for the rest of the world and
for the WTO itself," Li told a AmCham China Washington Doorknock
delegation here in the Chinese embassy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li said that granting normal trade status with each
other should be taken for granted as an obligation among the WTO
members, and therefore the United States should in no way regard
PNTR as a favor bestowed to China.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the WTO serves the interests of the United
States and China. "However, America may forgo possible benefits if
there is no PNTR (for China)," Ambassador Li told the 30 delegates
from over 20 American enterprises now functioning in China.
</P>
<P>
The AmCham China delegates, who arrived here in the past few
days, have started a week-long uphill battle in lobbying on the
Capitol Hill for granting China PNTR.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li pointed out that some Americans here have been
trying to link PNTR with such issues as Taiwan, human rights and
proliferation. These things are "irrelevant" to China's trade
status, and it is "groundless" to mix them up, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li said that the recent election in Taiwan has
neither altered the fact that there is only one China in the world
and Taiwan is part of China, nor that Taiwan issue is the internal
affair of China which brooks no foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
He criticized "a handful of American politicians" for making
use of PNTR to press China into concessions on the Taiwan issue. "
This is an interference with China's internal affairs, and the
Chinese people will never bow to the pressure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Timothy P. Stratford, Chairman of AmCham China, told Xinhua
that China's entry into the WTO will provide American businesses
with a rare chance to further open the largest potential market in
the world, and bring about a greater mount of jobs for American
workers.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed any linkage between PNTR and such issues as Taiwan,
human rights and proliferation as "unwise," because if the PNTR
bill fails to pass Congress, America will not be able to benefit
from China's further opening of its market, and its own national
interests will be undermined.
</P>
<P>
James Patrick Gradoville, VP and Regional Director of Asia/
Pacific Government Relations of Motorola, said, "we have been
talking with members of Congress about the importance of having a
clean bill, a bill that does not add any conditions at all to
China's entry into the WTO."
</P>
<P>
Gradoville predicted "a close vote" on PNTR in Congress, which
is scheduled to take place in the week of May 22. "We have to be
confident," and "I think it (the PNTR bill) will pass if we work
very, very hard," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Contributes 77 Million U.S. Dollars to HIPC Trust Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The government of Canada has
completed an agreement with the World Bank to contribute 77
million U.S. dollars to the Trust Fund for the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC), the World Bank announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This amount, which is in addition to earlier contributions by
Canada of 27 million dollars, is an important step forward in a
concerted international effort to mobilize resources needed to
assist multilateral creditors with the implementation of the HIPC
Initiative, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Trust Fund is an instrument which allows bilateral
creditors to contribute financing to help cover the costs of
multilateral organizations under the HIPC Initiative. To date, the
Trust Fund has raised more than 2.4 billion dollars in pledges and
paid-in contributions from bilateral donors.
</P>
<P>
So far, nine countries have qualified for some 14 billion
dollars in debt service relief. Five countries, Bolivia,
Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda, have qualified under
the enhanced framework. When completed, the HIPC Initiative is
scheduled to deliver approximately 50 billion dollars in debt
service relief to more than 30 eligible countries.

HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro said
on Wednesday that the member countries to the Group of 77 (G-77),
have the duty to fight for a change in the direction of the world
economy to avoid an unprecedented crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader told the developing countries' heads of state
who are meeting at Havana during April 12-14.
</P>
<P>
"The chiefs of state who are now meeting here, representing 85
percent of world population, have not just the right, but the
obligation to change the direction we are heading to," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
He said that globalization showed all of mankind's exposure to
the same dangers, but with a difference: a small part of it enjoys
of the advances and the rest suffers from misery and backwardness,
like in times of slavery.
</P>
<P>
"A Nuremberg is needed to put to trial the economic order we
have been imposed with," Castro said, and also accused the
neoliberal policy followed by many governments during the last 20
years, as the main responsible of poverty and inequality that
exist in the world.
</P>
<P>
To the G-77, this is not a moment of begging developed
countries, of internal divisions, submission or defeatism, but of
rescuing our fighting spirit, of unity and cohesion regarding our
demands.

Arafat is present at the summit along with delegates of 122

discuss ways to cooperate among themselves, ways to have access to
up-to-date technology and their relations with the advanced North.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the situation in the Middle East, Arafat said that
peace and stability in the region depend on peace of the
territories under his authority, Gaza, the West Bank and East
Jerusalem, held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there will be no peace, until the Palestinian
rights to freedom and independence become a reality, as well as
the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories, and the
birth of an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

<P>
The leader of the Palestine Liberation Front wished the Havana
Declaration and the Program of Action resulting from the Summit, "

<HEADLINE> Romania's 2000 Budget Marks Non-Inflationary Economic Growth: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Romania's budget for 2000 will
mark a re-start of the non-inflationary economic growth and the
country's regaining credibility, the Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu
told parliamentarians at a meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Parliament on Wednesday started debating in both
chambers the draft state budget for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting, the prime minister said, in his opening
speech, that the government had proposed, in the draft budget, an
economic growth of 1.3 percent, a drop in the inflation rate by a
half to 27 percent and a budget deficit of 3 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product(GDP).
</P>
<P>
"Romania will have an economic growth and an inflation drop
that stimulates the effectiveness and creates an appropriate
business environment", he said, stressing that the planned
economic growth was based on an increase in the exports and
investments and less on the stimulation of revenues.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Romania's foreign debt, Mugur Isarescu pointed out
that Romania's public debt had not gone up in the past three years
and said that the public debt, at 35 percent of the GDP, is well
beyond the maximum limit of 60 percent stipulated in the
Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said that Romania was re-gaining credibility "with proofs,
figures and economic developments that cannot be disputed".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister cautioned that "re-build of credibility
should start from inside the country, through our belief that we
have the capacity to restart the economy".
</P>
<P>
Isarescu said that in the second half of this would be
stabilized, following a sped-up economic growth. According to him,
beginning the year 2001, Romania will have an economic growth of 4-
5 percent per year.

Meanwhile, he voiced his hopes for a successful peace process
in The Middle East and Palestine's willingness to honor the

<HEADLINE> Kenya Supports Savings and Investment Bank Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is promoting a savings and
investment bank project for Africa, an effort within the frame of
South-South cooperation initiatives announced these days at Havana,
where the Group of 77 (G-77) meets.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Foreign Minister Bonaya Adhis Godana told the press
that his country is not bearing any individual claim in this event,
for it sees its future closely linked to developing countries
around the world.
</P>
<P>
But as part of this conglomerate, represented at Havana by 122
delegations, the African country considers that it can do a lot,
like participating in the creation of this bank which would be
headquartered in his territory.
</P>
<P>
"We are linked also to the regional solidarity promotion
through the Common Market for the South of Africa and the search
of an world economic authority," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"We aspire every organization come together under a single
entity, that gives way to the new and just world order we need,"
added the official.
</P>
<P>
Godana also said it would be important that the countries of G-
77 acquire new compromises, reaffirmation and be conscious of the
need of a real world solidarity in a world where we run the risk
of being totally marginalized, Africa in particular.
</P>
<P>
As for specific preoccupation that his country wanted to
discuss at the Summit, the official referred to the need of
developing countries' products to have access to rich countries'
markets.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the need of a more democratic United
Nations system, and of international organizations like the World
Trade Organization generating a more just exchange between
developed and developing countries.
