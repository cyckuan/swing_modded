NEW DIRECTOR MAY SHAKE UP MEETING OF MATTEL'S BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the embattled board of Mattel Inc. meets Thursday, its
agenda is likely to include the company's depressed stock price,
the so-far unsuccessful search for a new chief executive and any
further problems that might be lurking at the Learning Co.,
Mattel's troubled computer software subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting in El Segundo, Calif., will also have a couple
of new elements. One is Ralph V. Whitworth, managing member of
Relational Investors, a private investment fund that owns 4.2
million Mattel shares. Whitworth, known as a straight talker who is
often brought in to clean up management messes, may shake up the
sleepy Mattel board. He will be making his first appearance at a
board meeting since being appointed a director on March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is the reappearance of an old court case. A civil
lawsuit filed in 1995 by Michelle Greenwald, a former Mattel
executive who contended she was wrongfully terminated, has been
given new life by the California appeals court. Mattel, which has
said the suit is baseless, will now have to battle in court.
</P>
<P>
   In her case, Greenwald says Mattel fired her because she blew
the whistle on what she considered accounting irregularities at the
company. As a result, what emerges in the court battle could prove
interesting to unhappy shareholders who have recently brought their
own suit against Mattel citing mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Feb. 3 resignation of Jill E. Barad, Mattel's chief
executive, the company has been rudderless. It is being run by
William D. Rollnick, a board member who is acting chairman, and
Ronald M. Loeb, also a board member who is acting chief executive.
Ned Mansour, president of Mattel, resigned March 24. The company's
shares have barely budged since Barad's departure and closed
yesterday at $10.375.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth's ascension to the Mattel board could stir up the
close-knit directors. In a speech Tuesday at a conference sponsored
by the Council of Institutional Investors in Washington, Whitworth
said that Mattel needed fresh blood and that the dynamics on the
board were not healthy. In an interview Wednesday, Whitworth
declined to say more about what he has found at Mattel. But he is
an involved investor who considered a proxy fight to try to get
Mattel back on track.
</P>
<P>
   The March 27 decision in the California Court of Appeal in the
Greenwald matter may also have long-term ramifications for Mattel.
Greenwald, who was hired as a senior vice president in 1992,
contends that Mattel fired her in July 1995 because she alerted her
superior, James Eskridge, then Mattel's president, of her concern
that the company might not have accounted properly for a royalty
payment it had persuaded the Walt Disney Co. to defer from 1994
into 1995. Greenwald had primary responsibility for Disney-licensed
products.
</P>
<P>
   The case, filed in 1995, was dismissed on summary judgment in
December 1997. The judge in the case said Greenwald had not
objected vigorously enough.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 review of Greenwald's accusations by the law firm Davis
Polk &AMP; Wardwell and the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young concluded
that there was no evidence that the company's accounting was
``inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in its 1998 annual report, Mattel stated that
during 1996, the company received comments from the Securities and
Exchange Commission regarding ``its accounting for certain
royalties and participation fees in prior periods.'' Therefore, the
company ``recognized a catch-up adjustment in the amount of $21.8
million before taxes in the fourth quarter of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justices Mildred Lillie, Earl Johnson Jr. and Norvell
Frederick Woods Jr. unanimously reversed the dismissal. Stuart B.
Esner, who argued the case for Greenwald, said: ``This opinion
demonstrates in fact that her lawsuit is not baseless. It is also
worth noting that this decision does not blaze new trails expanding
liability for corporations or employers. The court really has ruled
based on settled principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel declined to comment on the case.

MRS. CLINTON AND GIULIANI MAY FACE MINEFIELD IN MINOR PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani find
themselves confronting a series of decisions in their U.S. Senate
campaigns over the next two months that might be as important as
any they make between now and Election Day: how to pick their way
through a maze of six independent parties listed on the New York
state ballot, each clamoring for a role in a contest in which
third-party endorsements could make a crucial difference.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the small-party dynamic in New York amounted to the
Liberal Party backing the Democratic candidate and the
Conservatives cross-endorsing the Republican. But Giuliani's
alliance with the Liberal Party during his three mayoral campaigns
has rewritten the way that third-party politics are played. What is
more, three more independent parties have joined the ballot this
year. Along with the long-existing Liberals, Conservatives and the
Right to Life Party, they are maneuvering to play an influential
role in the contest by either endorsing Clinton or Giuliani, or
running candidates of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The result of these competing forces is a political landscape of
unusual complexity. It has left aides to Giuliani and Clinton
struggling with forces that could very well determine the outcome,
yet are largely beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, both Clinton and Giuliani seem inclined to seek
the support of the Liberal Party and, perhaps, the more problematic
Independence Party, which is the New York incarnation of Ross
Perot's division-wracked Reform Party. But leaders of the Right to
Life and Conservative parties said Wednesday they were likely to
run their own candidate in November, which appeared to be unwelcome
news for Giuliani, given that Republican candidates have needed
their support to win statewide.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The questions of what the minor parties will do and how the
major party candidates would deal with them have become more
pressing with the approach of a June 6 deadline for naming their
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reaching out to a number of the smaller parties,'' said
Bill de Blasio, the manager of Clinton's campaign, echoing an
interest expressed by Giuliani's advisers. ``We think they will
play an important role in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, the chairman of the state Conservative Party, said
the third parties' role would ultimately be very significant. ``If
you look at the polls,'' he said, ``51 percent of the people say
they don't want either of these candidates. I believe the minor
parties are going to have an awful lot to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering comes amidst what is, in fact, much debate about
the actual value of third-party endorsement, as well as concern
about the cost of being aligned with parties that often take
positions outside the mainstream of political thought.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of mathematics, aides to Giuliani and Clinton are
wary of candidates who could drain support away. What is more,
advisers to both major candidates are looking for any advantage, no
matter how slight, that might come with having their candidate's
name appear on an extra line. That said, the parties that Giuliani
and Clinton choose in the months ahead could help shape voters'
ideological views of them, or allow their opponents to portray them
as extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accepted the support over the weekend of the Working
Families Party, a liberal-leaning party organized by labor and
community activists. The ballot line-up has become a subject of
increasing interest in recent days. Leaders of the Conservative
Party and the Right to Life Party spent an afternoon last week
interviewing Joseph L. DioGuardia, a former Republican Party member
of Congress, from Westchester County, about running as the
candidate of both parties. DioGuardia said in an interview later
that he might be interested in making the race.
</P>
<P>
   Ray B. Harding, the head of the state Liberal Party, said
Wednesday that he would soon convene his policy committee to
interview any candidates interested in his party's endorsement.
Harding is apparently focusing only on Giuliani, his old friend,
and Clinton: he has told associates that he would not leave his
party's ballot line blank or run a minor candidate to siphon votes
away from Clinton as a way of helping Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case things were not complicated enough, Kathleen
Healey, the chairwoman of the Green Party, said Wednesday that Al
Lewis, an actor who appeared in ``The Munsters'' television show in
the 1960s, who received 52,500 votes when he ran for governor in
1998, might run for the Senate. That could be an irritant to
Clinton, because the Green Party's presidential candidate is
expected to be Ralph Nader, and the party seems likely to take
votes away from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani ends up winning the Liberal Party endorsement, he
would share a line with Al Gore, the Democratic candidate for
president, a cause of some discomfort for both Gore and Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party would seem, on the face of it, to be
highly attractive, given the fact that it drew 364,000 votes in
1998. However, if Clinton or Giuliani got the party's support, they
might find themselves sharing a line with Patrick J. Buchanan, who
is running for president. For Giuliani in particular, who is trying
to present himself as a moderate, Buchanan might be one person to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The area most in flux, however, involves the Liberal and
Conservative parties. A Liberal Party endorsement of Giuliani could
be particularly valuable in this race, since it might make it
easier for him to draw more Democratic votes from Clinton if they
are able to vote for him on the Liberal rather than the Republican
line, which is why Giuliani is likely to seek it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Long, the Conservative Party leader, has said he would not
support Giuliani if he ran on the Liberal Party line. But the
Conservative Party drew 348,000 votes in 1998, and some of
Giuliani's associates said, given the size of that bloc, that they
might go around Long and appeal to the party's rank and file at the
convention.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Some pets had close calls, a few were still
missing, and at least one was found dead after Tuesday's tornado,
but most survived unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only had a few calls for lost dogs; it's kind of
surprising,'' said Mike Pugliese, kennel manager at the Arlington
Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents in southeast Arlington said they put their dogs
inside their houses or garages before the tornado hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people were aware because there was an eerie feeling
just prior to the storm,'' said Don Brandon, 45. ``We took
precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   Precautions didn't help a teen-ager who took his dog inside a
house on Sandalwood Lane. The tornado hit the house hard. The boy
survived unharmed, but a police canine sniffed out the dog dead
under debris, Arlington police said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents were away from home, leaving the pets to fend for
themselves. Most pets did fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised they survived,'' Marcus Brown, 33, said of his
two mixed-breed dogs, Budweiser and Butch.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and his family were in Dallas when the storm hit
Arlington. By the time they returned to their house on Waxwing
Drive, the roof was missing and the privacy fence around their back
yard was gone. Worried about his dogs, Brown ran around to the back
yard. He saw a thick tree broken in two and noticed that his
trampoline had blown away.
</P>
<P>
   He called out for his dogs, and they scampered out of a nearby
lightweight doghouse that had somehow been spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out wagging their tails,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Diamond, 45, was eating dinner with his family on Glenwillow
Drive, unaware that a tornado was about to touch down. When the
wind suddenly picked up, the family looked out a window and saw
their dachshund's doghouse spinning four feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog was spinning around inside the doghouse,'' Diamond
said. ``It was like a Toto moment. My wife started hollering at me,
like it was my fault we had a tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   She told Diamond and the couple's son, Chris, 14, to save the
dog, Max. But they took a look at the doghouse in the air, a
lawnmower flying by and a crumbling fence and decided to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get out there, but we couldn't because it was like
a wind tunnel,'' the teen-ager said.
</P>
<P>
   When the doghouse hit the ground, Max took off. He returned home
an hour later, shaken but uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Carrillo and his family were out of town when the storm
hit. When they returned home at 1 a.m. Wednesday, their fence was
scattered and their German shepherd, Rusty, was missing. Carrillo's
daughter, Alex, 5, was distraught.
</P>
<P>
   A wee-hour search for Rusty was fruitless. When the sun came up,
Alex refused to get ready for school, saying they had to search
again for Rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sad and scared because he was gone,'' she said. ``I love
my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor eventually found the dog, called the number on his
dog tag and took him home.

IRAN AGREES TO INCREASE OIL PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (REMOVES reference to U.N. limits on Iraq in 4th graf) 
 (See also CLINTON-OPEC) 
(js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Just hours after Iran angrily broke ranks with
all other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, its leaders reversed themselves and announced that they
would, after all, try to raise production in line with the rest of
the oil-producing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to keep and preserve our market share,'' said
Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili. ``Beyond that, we
will see what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's quick reversal Wednesday morning added to the drama that
has surrounded the meeting of oil ministers, which ended here early
Wednesday when nine of the 11 members of OPEC decided to raise
production quotas by 1.45 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   If Iran continued to pump in line with its share of the market,
the cartel's production limit would rise by 1.7 million barrels a
day beginning next month, or about 7 percent. Iraq is the only
other OPEC member not a party to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's reluctant acceptance reflected OPEC's continued ability
to enforce a unified pricing strategy. Despite the messy process
here, economic analysts said there was little danger that the group
would dissolve into the bickering _ and erratic production _ that
occurred years ago when prices plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Oil markets Wednesday interpreted the agreement as a sign that
production would indeed rise and prices fell moderately in
commodity trading around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Wednesday, oil prices fell 64 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $26.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
level since Jan. 12. Since a nine-year peak of $34.37 a barrel
three weeks ago, prices have fallen 23 percent mostly because
traders had anticipated that oil cartel members would raise their
production quotas here.
</P>
<P>
   One OPEC official predicted that by May oil prices will have
declined further and Iraq's oil minister, Amer Mohammed Rasheed,
told reporters here that he was ``pessimistic'' about the oil price
outlook over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   But lower prices at gasoline pumps in the United States are
probably months away, experts said, especially with inventories low
and demand for fuel likely to rise in the summer. Also, the
increased production is not so sizable that it is expected to
substantially reduce prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the total OPEC increase will be much smaller
because several members are already overshooting quotas by 1.2
million barrels a day. Analysts estimate that, after the quotas are
raised, most of this cheating will simply be absorbed into the new
limits.
</P>
<P>
   As for crude oil prices, analysts predict that they could start
climbing again by this winter, because demand is likely to remain
strong, the world's oil inventories are low and will not be fully
replenished.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, several OPEC countries have little excess capacity
and would not be able to further exceed their production limits
even if they wanted to.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday night when Iran refused to participate in the agreement,
several analysts worried that it could set off a frenzy of cheating
by a few OPEC members. But Wednesday, Iran's grudging compliance
suggested that Saudi Arabia has enough power to enforce the pricing
and production regime in the face of objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excess capacity is unevenly distributed,'' said Irene
King, senior oil economist at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. ``Seventy percent
of the excess capacity is in three countries _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and Abu Dhabi.'' Those countries, she added, are the ones most
interested in preserving OPEC's grip on the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a fierce feud with Saudi Arabia, Iranian officials initially
argued here that any significant increase could send prices
plunging and would be a capitulation to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Iranian officials also knew that if they insisted on holding
the line on oil production it would be both futile and costly. On
the one hand, their refusal to pump more crude would do little to
keep oil prices high. On the other, Iran would lose sales as
countries like Saudi Arabia simply filled the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the real point Iran wanted to make Wednesday was to
attack the United States and its aggressive lobbying campaign for
higher production.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question about influence,'' said Ardebili Wednesday,
asserting that Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, had
telephoned OPEC's president, Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela just as the
OPEC oil ministers were meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 40-year history of OPEC there has never been a case of
the Secretary of Energy calling OPEC ministers in the middle of a
meeting,'' Ardebili complained. ``We are very upset and
disappointed at the external pressure. We don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the increase in oil production quotas did not live
up to the 2 million barrels a day that the United States had
sought.
</P>
<P>
   However, the OPEC agreement will probably be supplemented by
several hundred thousand additional barrels from Mexico and Norway,
non-OPEC countries that participated in last year's cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City Wednesday, the energy minister announced that the
country would raise production by 150,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, exhausted oil ministers described the marathon
battles that were over ideology as much as money.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the conservative kingdom whose enormous oil
reserves overshadow those of any other OPEC member, was determined
to increase production enough to bring oil prices down to about
$25.
</P>
<P>
   Why seek a lower price at all? Analysts say Saudi officials were
worried about jeopardizing the United States. At $30 a barrel or
higher, Saudi officials feared that demand would eventually
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a stable market, we want a well-supplied market and we
want a market that will be in equilibrium all the time,'' Ali
Naimi, the Saudi minister, said
</P>
<P>
   But Iran's Ardebili wanted to keep prices high and worried that
OPEC risked repeating the blunder at a meeting in Jakarta in 1997,
when Saudi Arabia pushed through a production increase only to see
prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC leaders have always wanted to present a unified front and
even the Saudis had preached about the need for unanimous
consensus. But after hours of fruitless wrangling, Naimi decided to
ignore Iranian opposition and go ahead without them.

   NEW YORK _ Three weeks after winning a presidential primary that
exposed new fissures in New York's Republican Party, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas returned to the state Wednesday, attending a
fund-raiser with a party establishment that tried to demonstrate
that it had put its bickering behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who before the
primary had publicly disagreed over the Bush campaign's strategy in
New York, took the stage at a Manhattan hotel to praise Bush and
one another. Bush, always fond of nicknames, christened Pataki
``George East'' and hailed their ``long and steadfast'' friendship.
It was Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue who called them George East and
George West, and Bush picked up on it. The Texas governor said he
appreciated the ``reform-minded agenda'' of Giuliani, who is
running for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the three men did not pose for the customary
hands-clasped-together-in-solidarity photo at the fund-raiser. In
fact, they did not appear together on stage during the event, which
raised roughly $500,000 for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush visited a charter school in Newark,
N.J., with New Jersey's governor, Christie Whitman. He was asked at
a news conference whether he could choose a running mate who, like
Whitman, backed abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   He responded that he was not yet focusing on the makeup of the
ticket. But, he added: ``Good people can disagree on the issue, and
I understand that. I mean, I'm standing up here with a friend of
mine. We disagree on some aspects of the issue. That doesn't mean
we can't be pulling for the same thing _ being on the same team.
And I respect Governor Whitman's views and I respect her as a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani showed fealty to Bush, the mayor gave no
indication that he wanted Bush's help in the Senate race in New
York, which tends to skew Democratic in presidential contests.
Giuliani is to campaign next month with Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who lost in the primaries to Bush, suggesting that
Giuliani believes that he has more to gain aligning himself with
the acknowledged loser than the putative standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, appears
to consider Bush a liability for Giuliani, and she is trying to
link the two in her attacks on the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York primary, Giuliani endorsed Bush, but he
criticized Pataki, who led the Bush campaign in New York, for
running negative commercials against McCain. Polls show that McCain
was relatively popular with Democrats and independents, who could
not vote in the New York primary but obviously can in November.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the fund-raiser about Bush, Giuliani's campaign
manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, said: ``The mayor was with John
McCain last night in Washington. He was with Governor Bush today in
New York, and of course looks forward to campaigning with Senator
McCain and Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush declined to get entangled in the Senate race
beyond expressing his general support for Giuliani. At the news
conference in Newark, he was asked about Giuliani's criticism that
Clinton has not adequately reimbursed the federal government for
her campaign travel aboard government planes. ``I don't have an
opinion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, Bush, besides a few lines about Pataki,
Giuliani and other state Republicans, offered his standard stump
speech without tailoring it to the state. ``I will proudly wave our
banner of compassionate conservatism all across the land,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was one unexpected bit of local color: A few death-penalty
protesters briefly interrupted his speech before being removed by
security officers. Bush staunchly favors the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his day with a breakfast with Archbishop Theodore
McCarrick of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark. Bush has
sought to court Catholic voters in the wake of controversy over his
South Carolina visit to Bob Jones University, whose leaders have
espoused anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then visited the Newark charter school, the North Star
Academy, which has a predominantly black student body. Bush, who
believes the federal government should help create more charter
schools, said the academy represented the kind of local innovation
he hoped to foster. ``Had we tried to invent North Star at the
federal government, they'd still be in committee hearings,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   He took questions from students, which led to an awkward moment.
A seventh grader asked him whether he had heard of Amadou Diallo,
the unarmed African immigrant killed last year by undercover police
officers in the Bronx. Bush said he had not.
</P>
<P>
   When the student noted that Diallo had been killed by the
police, Bush quickly added: ``Oh, I have heard, yes, I beg your
pardon. I have, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bush's aides later said he had trouble making out the
question).

PRESIDENT ENTERS DEBATE ON NEW YORK POLICE SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton waded ever so gently into the
raging battle over police shootings in New York City by suggesting
Wednesday that better training of recruits might reduce such
shootings without sacrificing public safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now ample evidence that the crime rate can go down
and the tenor of community-police relations can go up,'' Clinton
said in a news conference at the White House on Wednesday in
response to a question about whether the New York Police Department
has a racial problem. ``It's largely a matter of the right sort of
training, the right sort of policies and consistent effort there.''
</P>
<P>
   Four unarmed men have been shot and killed by New York City
police officers in the last 13 months, with the most recent
shooting, of Patrick Dorismond, igniting angry protests and calls
for federal oversight of the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who is an adviser to the Dorismond family,
and a group of Haitian community leaders from New York met
Wednesday with about 20 House Democrats, most of them members of
the Congressional Black Caucus, to ask for help in pressuring the
Department of Justice to investigate Dorismond's death.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's group said it also wanted the Justice Department to
bring federal civil rights charges against the police officers
recently acquitted of criminal charges in the shooting of Amadou
Diallo and to petition a federal judge to appoint a monitor to
oversee the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Their requests were warmly received by the members of Congress,
many of whom used the event to lash out at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
``The mayor is really polarizing the community against the
police,'' said Rep. Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at City Hall on Wednesday, the mayor, who
is running for the Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, suggested
that such criticisms were politically motivated. He defended the
Police Department as ``one of the most restrained'' in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Sharpton filed a lawsuit in U.S. District
Court in Washington accusing Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the
Republican National Committee, of defamation, libel and slander for
remarks he made in a letter to The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   In that letter, Nicholson asserted that Sharpton had incited
riots that led to deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Nicholson refused to back down. ``Al Sharpton is no
civil rights leader,'' he said. ``He is a hate-monger, an
anti-Semite and a racist.'' He called on Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore to repudiate Sharpton.

MIAMI BEACH NIGHTCLUB OWNER FREED ON BAIL IN N.Y. MOB CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A wealthy Miami Beach nightclub impresario, who has
been charged with murder and accused of being part of a vicious
Brooklyn Mafia crew, was released from federal custody Wednesday on
$15 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   But as the suspect, Chris Paciello, walked out of U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn, he nearly got away from the private security
guards who had been hired by the government to watch him. There
were two identical black Lincoln Town Cars waiting at the curb, and
Paciello got into one as the guards accidentally got into the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris, wrong car!'' said a security guard, Jim Woods, who
realized his prisoner was not in the correct back seat and plucked
Paciello from the wrong Lincoln just as he was closing the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said a black car,'' Paciello responded, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors contend that Paciello, who owns a string of
South Beach night spots in Miami Beach, took part in the murder of
a Staten Island woman in 1993. The government said that he was then
a member of what was called the Bath Avenue Crew, a group of street
toughs who reported to the Bonanno crime family. He has also been
charged with robbing a Staten Island bank in 1992. Since his arrest
Dec. 1, he has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bail agreement, Paciello will be under house arrest at
his mother's home on Staten Island near the Fresh Kills landfill
and guarded round the clock by two $25-an-hour security guards, who
work for Lawn, Mullen &AMP; Good, a private security consulting firm.
Their fees are to be paid by Paciello.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Freeman, a partner in the security firm and one of the men
who escorted Paciello from the courthouse Wednesday, said the
guards would follow their prisoner around the house and sometimes
do errands for him. .
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he develops a taste for chili dogs,'' Freeman said,
adding that the guards might occasionally have to cook for their
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Town Car mix-up Wednesday was perhaps a result of the
half-dozen or so reporters who swarmed around Paciello as he was
walking out of court.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was unlikely Paciello could have used the Lincoln
as a getaway car. It had already been hired to pick up another man
accused of being a mobster _ Joseph Burger, who was arrested
earlier this month on charges of using extortion to attract
customers to a scrap metal empire run by Carmine Agnello, the
son-in-law of John J. Gotti, the former Gambino boss.

EDITORIAL: AFTER THE SYRIAN SETBACK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 30:
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago there seemed a good chance that Israel and Syria
might soon resume negotiations and move rapidly toward a formal
peace treaty. Instead the two countries remain deadlocked, and
there is even a danger that they could drift into armed conflict
after Israel withdraws its troops from Lebanon in July.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of this impasse is Syria's president, Hafez Assad, who
refused to show any flexibility when he met with President Clinton
in Geneva last Sunday. He continues to insist, unreasonably, that
Israel withdraw from the entire Golan Heights down to the shoreline
of the Sea of Galilee before he will even discuss issues vital to
Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea of Galilee is Israel's main source of fresh water.
Israel fears that the Syrians might deliberately or accidentally
contaminate the sea or claim a portion of the Galilee for their own
use. The Israelis are reportedly willing to offer Syria additional
territory elsewhere in exchange for a shoreline buffer strip, but
Damascus has shown no interest in such a swap.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis fear that if there is no negotiating breakthrough
with Syria by the time of Israel's planned withdrawal from southern
Lebanon, Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, with the approval of
Damascus, will move their rocket launchers to the border and shell
northern Israeli villages. Israel would probably retaliate with
airstrikes against Lebanese power stations and other targets. If
the rocket attacks persisted, Israel might consider airstrikes
against Syria itself. Even the remote possibility of such a
development underscores the danger of continued stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the negotiating breakdown with Syria has not
infected Israel's talks with the Palestinians, which are moving
ahead slowly. Both sides show a growing willingness to compromise,
and the outlines of a possible agreement are visible. It would
involve Israel handing over much of the West Bank and accepting
some form of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Formulas are being explored that would expand the territory of
greater Jerusalem so that some area outside the present city limits
might become a Palestinian administrative capital. In return, the
Palestinians would accept continued Israeli authority over most
existing West Bank settlements, Israeli military control over the
Jordan River Valley and an agreement on refugees that would settle
most of them in the areas where they now reside. Refining these
broad formulas will be difficult. But with good will on both sides
it may be possible by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is essential that neither Prime Minister Ehud Barak nor the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, be distracted by Assad's
intransigence. The next building block of a durable Middle East
peace is a permanent settlement between Israel and the
Palestinians. For now, peace with Syria may not be possible, but
Assad and Barak must guard against escalating tensions over
Lebanon. Syria in recent years has restrained Lebanese guerrillas
from attacking Israeli territory. That must continue after Israel's
July withdrawal.

PROPOSITION BB MANAGEMENT FEES OUT OF CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By DAVID R. BAKER AND GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Unified School District wasted as
much as $51.3 million on management fees that could have gone to
school repairs or construction, the district's inspector general
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A two-month investigation by Inspector General Don Mullinax
found that fees paid to manage school repairs under the $2.4
billion Proposition BB bond issue far outstripped those paid by
other districts nationwide. The management fees consumed between
18.5 percent and 20.7 percent of all the money spent, more than
twice the percentage recommended by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not reasonable,'' said Mullinax. ``What we're paying
here in Los Angeles is definitely higher than elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   His report placed the blame for the excessive costs on the
company hired to manage the overall program, the proposition's
oversight committee and the district itself. He urged all three to
stop their recent squabbling and work out ways to lower the
program's management costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On all of these contracts, they need to get in there and scrub
the numbers closely and see why the numbers are so high,'' Mullinax
said.
</P>
<P>
   District officials said the excessive management costs were one
reason why the program, which had spent about $632 million by the
end of 1999, faces a projected $316.4 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly shows that Proposition BB money has been wasted
in the past,'' board member Caprice Young said. ``Because we know
this now, we can take corrective actions before we move forward
with major expenditures like building new schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The hefty, 142-page report capped months of feuding among the
district, the Proposition BB oversight committee and
3D/International-O'Brien Kreitzberg, the firm responsible for
managing the immense repair and construction project, approved by
voters in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax's audit was ordered by the new reform school board
after the oversight committee and management firm disputed Chief
Operating Officer Howard Miller's assertion that fees were running
out of control and demanded the replacement of several company
employees working on the project.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute effort Wednesday by 3D/I-OBK to block release of
the audit was rejected by a Superior Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   The firm threatened to sue for defamation if Mullinax went
forward but its rhetoric cooled considerably after the report's
release.
</P>
<P>
   Company representatives withdrew a separate court action seeking
damages for business 3D/I-OBK claimed to have lost due to the
district's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoral candidate Steven Soboroff, who had defended 3D/I-OBK's
performance as head of the Proposition BB oversight committee,
criticized Mullinax's methodology and some of his figures, but
agreed with many of the report's basic points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by Mullinax on this,'' Soboroff said. ``Communication
has got to get better. We need honesty, integrity, and everything
has to see the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for 3D/I-OBK disputed some of the findings, but
said the report's final version was a vast improvement over a draft
they had seen earlier. The company would not have gone to court if
it had seen the final version first, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a chance to take a preliminary look at it and
frankly we are considerably relieved,'' said Tom Bishop, executive
vice president of O'Brien Kreitzberg.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conciliatory talk, the report could still lead to
further conflict between the company and the school district.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mullinax specifically avoided recommending punitive
action against 3D/I-OBK or that any of the 10 project managers
working on Proposition BB be fired, Miller left open that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly one of the options we have an obligation to
look at,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that 3D/I-OBK's current job might be cut as part of a
massive reorganization at the school district. The district could
use its own staff to manage the overall Proposition BB program
while hiring private companies to oversee projects in different
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that:
</P>
<P>
   Determining the exact amount spent was complicated by the
district's lack of a single, unified financial records system.
</P>
<P>
   The district repeatedly changed the Proposition BB project's
administration, sometimes assigning more work to the project
management companies, at other times assigning more to district
staffers. The changes wasted money and effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Proposition BB oversight committee and 3D/I-OBK warned the
district about cost overruns on Proposition BB projects, to little
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight committee tracked the amount spent on projects,
but neither the committee nor the district checked the
cost-effectiveness of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Had Los Angeles Unified spent 4 percent on management - the
least spent by other large, urban districts - it would have saved
as much as $51.3 million. Had it spent 11 percent on management -
the most other districts paid - it would have saved $25.9 million.
The different numbers come from two different estimates Mullinax
provided on the total construction costs for projects under the
program manager's control.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Proposition BB committee argued that their
volunteer group operates without overhead or staff and is therefore
limited in the work it can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters did not give us the resources to do anything other
than authorize audits and be a watchdog,'' Soboroff said. ``If the
district doesn't give us information, hides things, red-lines
reports and doesn't follow our recommendations, it makes our job
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said the report released Wednesday differed substantially
from the draft his company reviewed last week. After reviewing the
draft, a lawyer for the joint venture sent an 83-page rebuttal of
many of the draft's findings, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the project manager argued in its March 23
correspondence that the LAUSD's former facilities administrators
``repeatedly ignored recommendations from the program manager that
would have resulted in a more cost-effective and efficient
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the former LAUSD administrators authorized projects
that exceeded the scope of work authorized under the bond and
awarded projects that exceeded the bond budget, wrote attorney John
W. Rakow.

CHINA BARS BASKETBALL STAR FROM U.S. EVENT 
</HEADLINE>

 (ATTN: Ind.)  (duplication notice: also sent with `i' code)

</P>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China has barred a young basketball star from
taking part this weekend in the Nike Hoop Summit in Indianapolis,
an exhibition event meant to showcase the world's best young
players and introduce them to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The player, Yao Ming, 19, is a 7-foot-6 center for the Shanghai
Sharks, a professional team, and has long been viewed as a possible
future player in the NBA, which has had very few players his size.
He had hoped to display his skills at the Nike games, which fall
during the NCAA's Final Four playoffs and are closely watched by
agents and coaches looking to recruit international talent.
</P>
<P>
   But China's basketball bureaucrats have decided that Yao should
stay home. ``Yao Ming has been chosen for China's national Olympic
team and must start intensive training in Beijing on April 1,''
said Xu Minfeng, director of the Chinese Basketball Association's
general office.
</P>
<P>
   Xu said the ``second reason'' that Yao was not allowed to leave
is that he ``has played a lot of games in the past year, feels very
tired and needs time to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Yao apparently does not have any choice. The basketball
association, a government agency, said Yao ``must abide by the
decision.'' Questions were referred to the State Sports General
Administration's propaganda department, which could not be reached.
Yao left Shanghai for Beijing on Wednesday and was unavailable for
comment. His father, reached by telephone, declined to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   China's decision is a stark reminder that despite advances in
the country's economy, its people are not necessarily free to
travel abroad at will and remain subject to the whims of the
central government bureaucracy. The ban is reminiscent of the Cold
War era, when many Soviet athletes were prevented from traveling
abroad or, when they did, defected to freer societies in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It also darkens Yao's NBA dreams, which would bring him millions
of dollars if realized, compared with the $8,000 a year his team
managers say he earns now.
</P>
<P>
   The Jinan Times, the newspaper in Shandong province that
reported the travel ban, said Yao had hoped that this weekend's
games would have shown that he ranked among the top international
players. Basketball executives say the games were to have been
Yao's ``coming-out party,'' and would have helped him decide
whether to put himself into the NBA draft this year. Players under
22 must declare their desire to participate in the draft to the
NBA, in writing, by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shame!'' the Shandong newspaper quoted Yao as saying.
``What a big shame! This is my last chance.'' He will not be
eligible for the games next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Jinan Times report was picked up by several Chinese-language
Web sites and word of the government's decision spread quickly
through the sporting community.
</P>
<P>
   China is counting on Yao and another player, Wang Zhizhi, for a
chance at winning a gold medal at this summer's Olympics, a hugely
prestigious prize for a country obsessed with its standing in
international forums. Wang was prevented from going to the United
States last year after he was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks, and
many people believe his value as an Olympic player was a primary
reason.
</P>
<P>
   China remains sensitive to what it considers a history of
foreign exploitation, and that extends to sports. The country's
fledgling basketball league is also reluctant to let the United
States begin poaching its best players, even though a Chinese
player in the NBA would undoubtedly increase interest in the sport
at home. ``We need Yao Ming here,'' said the Shanghai Sharks'
general manager, Li Yaomin, in a recent interview.
</P>

GREENE RELEASED, CLEMENTE ACQUIRED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The Anaheim Angels traded two-minor leaguers _
outfielder Norm Hutchins and catcher Jason Dewey _ for Colorado
Rockies outfielder Edgard Clemente on Wednesday, and made room for
Clemente on the roster by releasing catcher/DH Todd Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Clemente, the nephew of Roberto Clemente, gives
the Angels five outfielders on their roster. Some believe the trade
will trigger yet another trade involving an outfielder, and rumors
of a deal for Minnesota Twins ace Brad Radke already are surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   A move to Minnesota would put left fielder Darin Erstad close to
his winter home in Fargo, N.D. Center fielder Garret Anderson, like
Radke, is a free agent after the 2000 season. Erstad's contract is
up after 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente, 24, split last season between Triple-A Colorado
Springs (.304, 16 homers, 59 RBI in 75 games) and the Rockies
(.253, eight homers, 25 RBI in 57 games).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got tools,'' Angels general manager Bill Stoneman said.
``He's a good outfielder with speed. He can play all three outfield
positions well.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Stoneman said, was that the club will have more
use for a reserve outfielder than a third-string catcher/part-time
DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no denying Greenie's bat,'' Stoneman said. ``He's got
a power bat. Somebody's going to be happy to have him. He's going
to have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, like Jim Edmonds a week ago, was in tears as he left the
clubhouse Wednesday. Greene had spent his entire career in the
Angels organization since being drafted in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hard part,'' Greene said of saying goodbye to his
former teammates. ''I'm sad I'm leaving these players. But it's
part of the game. Todd Greene doesn't change. He's still the same,
he still can play. Just not with those guys and that's the hard
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Any team can claim Greene off waivers for 48 hours following his
release but would be responsible for his $650,000 salary. If Greene
is not claimed, he is free to sign with any team. He also is
considering playing in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rotation set: Scioscia announced his starting rotation to
start the season _ joining Ken Hill, Kent Bottenfield, Jason
Dickson and Ramon Ortiz will be Scott Schoeneweis, who won the
final spot over Kent Mercker. Mercker will begin the season in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker admitted to being disappointed, especially considering
his spring numbers (3-0, 3.78 ERA) compared to Schoeneweis' numbers
(2-2, 7.54 ERA). It came down to Mercker being better suited to
pitch out of the bullpen. Schoeneweis pitched in the bullpen last
season, but the Angels told him at the beginning of camp he would
be a starter only.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just too good, too versatile,'' Mercker joked. ''I know in
Atlanta they kept me in the pen. I was not good enough for the
rotation and too good to trade. But I got to three World Series.''

CHINA BARS BASKETBALL STAR FROM U.S. EVENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China has barred a young basketball star from
taking part this weekend in the Nike Hoop Summit in Indianapolis,
an exhibition event meant to showcase the world's best young
players and introduce them to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The player, Yao Ming, 19, is a 7-foot-6 center for the Shanghai
Sharks, a professional team, and has long been viewed as a possible
future player in the NBA, which has had very few players his size.
He had hoped to display his skills at the Nike games, which fall
during the NCAA's Final Four playoffs and are closely watched by
agents and coaches looking to recruit international talent.
</P>
<P>
   But China's basketball bureaucrats have decided that Yao should
stay home. ``Yao Ming has been chosen for China's national Olympic
team and must start intensive training in Beijing on April 1,''
said Xu Minfeng, director of the Chinese Basketball Association's
general office.
</P>
<P>
   Xu said the ``second reason'' that Yao was not allowed to leave
is that he ``has played a lot of games in the past year, feels very
tired and needs time to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Yao apparently does not have any choice. The basketball
association, a government agency, said Yao ``must abide by the
decision.'' Questions were referred to the State Sports General
Administration's propaganda department, which could not be reached.
Yao left Shanghai for Beijing on Wednesday and was unavailable for
comment. His father, reached by telephone, declined to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   China's decision is a stark reminder that despite advances in
the country's economy, its people are not necessarily free to
travel abroad at will and remain subject to the whims of the
central government bureaucracy. The ban is reminiscent of the Cold
War era, when many Soviet athletes were prevented from traveling
abroad or, when they did, defected to freer societies in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It also darkens Yao's NBA dreams, which would bring him millions
of dollars if realized, compared with the $8,000 a year his team
managers say he earns now.
</P>
<P>
   The Jinan Times, the newspaper in Shandong province that
reported the travel ban, said Yao had hoped that this weekend's
games would have shown that he ranked among the top international
players. Basketball executives say the games were to have been
Yao's ``coming-out party,'' and would have helped him decide
whether to put himself into the NBA draft this year. Players under
22 must declare their desire to participate in the draft to the
NBA, in writing, by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shame!'' the Shandong newspaper quoted Yao as saying.
``What a big shame! This is my last chance.'' He will not be
eligible for the games next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Jinan Times report was picked up by several Chinese-language
Web sites and word of the government's decision spread quickly
through the sporting community.
</P>
<P>
   China is counting on Yao and another player, Wang Zhizhi, for a
chance at winning a gold medal at this summer's Olympics, a hugely
prestigious prize for a country obsessed with its standing in
international forums. Wang was prevented from going to the United
States last year after he was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks, and
many people believe his value as an Olympic player was a primary
reason.
</P>
<P>
   China remains sensitive to what it considers a history of
foreign exploitation, and that extends to sports. The country's
fledgling basketball league is also reluctant to let the United
States begin poaching its best players, even though a Chinese
player in the NBA would undoubtedly increase interest in the sport
at home. ``We need Yao Ming here,'' said the Shanghai Sharks'
general manager, Li Yaomin, in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, provided that Yao is not injured, he will remain an
attractive NBA. candidate for years, giving him time to wait for
China to change its attitude.

STATE'S ECONOMIC GROWTH TO CONTINUE TILL AT LEAST '02
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By   CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Propelled by strong job growth and increased
exports to Asia, California's robust economy will continue
expanding through 2002 but at a slightly more moderate pace,
according to a UCLA survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly forecast by the Anderson School at the University
of California, Los Angeles, said neither a volatile stock market
nor higher interest rates on business and personal loans could slow
the state's growth. It predicts nonfarm jobs will increase 3.5
percent this year, up from 3.1 percent in 1999. It'll slow to 2.6
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers show the California economy is still very
promising ... and is one of the fastest-growing states in the
nation,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist with Bank of America
Asset Management Group in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The strong export gains of last year should continue through
2002, according to Tom K. Lieser, executive director of the
Anderson Business Forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Exports grew by 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999,
compared with the same period in 1998. According to the survey,
Mexico remains the leading destination for California exports. For
the year, export sales to Mexico increased 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan was the second-largest destination for California exports,
while Canada was third, followed by South Korea and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Trade with Asia should continue to grow as Japan's economy
continues its recovery and tensions between Taiwan and China begin
to subside following Taiwan's elections earlier this month, said
Reaser.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California's economic growth was led by Riverside and
San Bernardino counties, which increased 5.8 percent last year,
compared with 4.8 percent in 1998, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County grew by 4.2 percent, Orange County by 3.5 percent
and Los Angeles County by 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the forecast noted some gray clouds on the horizon. The
region's economy is being slowed by ``widespread shortages of
labor,'' Lieser said, and quickly spiraling home prices are
threatening to scare away new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates will also put some limits on borrowing of
both households and businesses, he said. Which, of course, is what
the Federal Reserve intended when it ratcheted up the rate charged
to banks by the Fed in an attempt to cool the economy's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will higher interest rates and gas prices work in tandem to
slow the economy? That would definitely please the Federal
Reserve,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of higher gas prices and interest rates ``is
going to take some of the bloom off the spending rose,'' said
Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   Although new residential construction in California has
increased considerably, further gains may be hindered because of
existing obstacles to large-scale development combined with
less-favorable financing conditions this year and next, Lieser
said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey forecasts new residential permits of 150,000 units
this year, decreasing to 143,000 in 2001, before rising to 157,000
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are still insufficient to meet the demand (for
housing) we have in California,'' said Kathy Fairbanks, vice
president of the California Chamber of Commerce in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nonresidential construction was the highest ever in
the fourth quarter, increasing by 21.5 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   With limited new housing coming to market, prices continue to
increase. In Los Angeles County, the average price of a home should
increase by 3.5 percent this year, down from 6.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, home prices were expected to increase 3.4 percent
followed by a 3.8 percent increase in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The high price and lack of housing could be a ``significant
barrier to job growth and California's continued economic
prosperity,'' said Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   While home prices continue to outpace construction, the survey
also found that consumer confidence, recently at record levels in
California, has driven consumer spending to the strongest gains in
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lieser said California will enjoy a 7.1 percent increase in
taxable sales this year, followed by slower gains of 6.4 percent in
2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot predict when the bull market and its associated
wealth effects will recede,'' wrote Lieser, ``but the higher
interest rates in this forecast should take at least a small bite
from this source later this year and in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also predicts that total immigration will average
240,000 people annually through 2002 and the overall population
should grow by 1.6 percent per year for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is still very promising, which should make
California one of the nation's fastest-growing states this year,
said Reaser.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent estimates for the jobless rate show an economy
in California that is approaching full employment.
</P>
<P>
   February's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.6
percent, the lowest since 1959. The rate was only 0.5 percent
higher than the national jobless rate of 4.1 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   The main drag on the state's rate is the agriculture-driven
Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have the Central Valley, our unemployment rate
would be below the national rate,'' Reaser said.
</P>

SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY TO BE TAKEN PRIVATE IN INTRICATE BUYOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a complex $19 billion deal, Seagate
Technology, the world's largest disk drive company, will be taken
private by an investor group led by Silver Lake Partners, Seagate
executives and the Texas Pacific Group.
</P>
<P>
   The nonoperating assets of Seagate, primarily a one-third stake
in Veritas Software, would be acquired by Veritas and redistributed
to Seagate's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, which was managed by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
Veritas would acquire all of its shares that are currently held by
Seagate, as well as cash and Seagate's smaller equity stakes in
several other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The investor group would acquire Seagate's disk drive business
for $2 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate shareholders would get about $77.50 a share for each
share of Seagate common stock, consisting of 0.467 Veritas share
and approximately $5 in cash based on closing prices Tuesday. The
price represents about a 24 percent premium to Wednesday's closing
price for Seagate of $62.75. Seagate shares have traded as low as
$25.125 the last 52 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Veritas shares, which closed down $12.4375, at $142.50 on the
Nasdaq on Wednesday, traded as high as $160.375 after hours.
Seagate, off $4.50 at the close of trading, moved as high as $76
after hours.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reflects the divergent fortunes of Seagate and Veritas,
which became intertwined in October 1998, when Seagate sold its
software unit to Veritas and in return received about 35 percent of
the company. Despite being the dominant supplier of disk drives,
Seagate struggled to maintain profits in a competitive market.
Veritas, on the other hand, flourished as the growth of the
Internet bolstered demand for its software, which manages data
storage and backup tasks across networks.
</P>
<P>
   With Veritas' market valuation at about $55 billion and
Seagate's at $13 billion, Seagate was valued at less than its stake
in Veritas was worth. Seagate management had been seeking a way to
realize the value of its assets but was unable to distribute the
Veritas stake to its own shareholders without setting off a
substantial tax liability for them.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Seagate's market leadership in disk drives, no buyer
had emerged for that business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the speculation in the past 30 days, the stock traded
at a huge discount to the underlying assets,'' said Steve Luczo,
Seagate's president and chief executive, in a telephone interview.
The disk drive business is ``probably the most disliked business in
technology by public investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, you have a kind of pressure that is short term in
nature. We now align ourselves with an investor group that has a
long-term perspective and a belief in the importance of storage
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   A key to making the deal tax free was the involvement of
Veritas. Because Seagate's Veritas shares were the same class of
stock as Veritas' freely trading shares, Veritas could retire them
to its treasury and distribute new shares tax free. Because of the
spread between the Veritas and Seagate market capitalizations,
Veritas could actually distribute fewer shares than it had
acquired, so the deal would immediately increase earnings per
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fulcrum of the transaction, the thing that makes it
possible, is we own the same shares,'' said Mark Leslie, Veritas'
chairman and chief executive. He noted that his company's float, or
the percentage of shares available to trade, increases from 67
percent to 99 percent, and Veritas gains almost $3 billion in cash.
But Veritas did not want to own a disk drive company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Silver Lake Partners, a buyout firm formed last year to
invest in technology companies. Although recognizing the volatility
and competitiveness of the disk drive business, Silver Lake's
investors liked Seagate for its market leadership, said Roger
McNamee, Silver Lake's co-founder and managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a true growth investment,'' McNamee said. ``Seagate,
properly capitalized, has a chance to really break away from the
pack.''
</P>
<P>
   After the buyout, Silver Lake would be the largest shareholder
in Seagate, followed by Texas Pacific. Luczo said Seagate
management and employees would own about a third of the new
company.

FOX, GEORGE GET CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ The Lakers arrived in Canada without their
third-leading scorer, but coach Phil Jackson viewed Glen Rice's
illness as an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   With Rice at home in L.A. nursing a stomach virus Wednesday, the
Lakers were forced to start Rick Fox and lean more on rookie Devean
George _ the former fighting through a shooting slump, the latter
fighting just to get some minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the team and for us to have some different
personnel in,'' Jackson said. ``Even though I don't want it to
happen, it's OK with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such situations have been rare for the Lakers, who haven't
needed to change the starting lineup or fiddle much with the
rotation in months. No starter had missed a game since Dec. 12, the
last time Rice was ill.
</P>
<P>
   With the playoffs just a few weeks away, Jackson figured Fox
could benefit from the extended minutes against Vancouver. In the
prior nine games, Fox made just 8 of 33 shots (24.2 percent) from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it creates a return to some more opportunities to get a
rhythm, that will only help us down the road,'' said Fox, who got
his first start of the season, in his native country. ``The most
important thing is we get a win some way without (Rice), and if out
of that comes an opportunity to get into a rhythm that carries
over, that would be nice too.''
</P>
<P>
   With Fox focusing on his role as a defensive stopper and a setup
man for Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, his shooting has been a
secondary concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing Shaquille score 40 points on a consistent basis,
our emphasis is then getting him the ball, and he's obviously been
doing the job that's been unstoppable of late,'' Fox said. ``So the
focus hasn't been on a lot of perimeter play, other than Kobe
creating opportunities, which he always does, and Glen feeding off
of those guys. So if I can go in and be an asset defensively and
not turn the ball over and still take the shots that are there, I
honestly have the confidence that they'll start to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also used Bryant at small forward some but said he
prefers not to play him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lusts after playing that position,'' Jackson said. ``(But)
it's really a scorer's position and he's a playmaker now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Oh, Canada: Selections are not official yet, but Fox figures
to be playing for the Canadian national team in this summer's
Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of when to get in there with enough time to
prepare ourselves as a whole team,'' he said. ``Hopefully, the goal
is to stretch this (the Lakers' season) out until June, and there
needs to be a period where I spend some time with the family, rest
a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Slow down: Jackson wants to start cutting back on starters'
minutes, especially O'Neal's, to prepare for the playoffs, but
won't do so right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts when we clinch (No. 1 seed in the West) really. If
we have an opportunity to clinch in the next few games, that would
be a pattern I'd like to see,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: NUDE DANCING AND FREE EXPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 30:
</P>
<P>
   A case concerning nude dancing at an Erie, Pa., night spot
occasioned a disappointing 6-3 Supreme Court opinion Wednesday that
unduly broadened the government's authority to regulate expressive
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was an Erie ordinance banning public nudity and
requiring dancers in adult clubs to don at least pasties and a
G-string before appearing on stage. Two years ago Pennsylvania's
top court struck down the ordinance, rejecting the city's argument
that the nude-dancing ban was justified to combat crime.
</P>
<P>
   In reversing that decision Wednesday, the court endorsed a
perilous change in legal doctrine. In the past the court has
allowed localities to regulate the location of X-rated
establishments in an effort to reduce crime and other adverse
``secondary effects'' on neighborhoods. Indeed, New York City
relied on those precedents to justify its recent rezoning of adult
establishments. But Wednesday Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's main
opinion used the ``secondary effects'' rationale to justify a total
ban on one type of erotic message that even the majority concedes
falls within the ambit of the First Amendment, albeit ``the outer
ambit.'' Dancing in the nude, like other forms of dance, is an
expressive activity that conveys a distinct artistic message
warranting free-speech protection.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rightly criticized the majority for
blindly accepting the law's crime-fighting rationale. ``To believe
that the mandatory addition of pasties and a G-string will have any
kind of noticeable impact on secondary effects requires nothing
short of a titanic surrender to the implausible,'' Stevens wrote.
The court upheld a similar nude dancing ban in 1991 in a badly
splintered decision that left the grounds for a ban murky.
Wednesday it made matters worse by giving localities more leeway
than necessary to protect neighborhoods and inflicting damage on
First Amendment principles.

EDITORIAL: THE PRIME MINISTER'S LABOR PAINS
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 30:
</P>
<P>
   With the birth of his fourth child due in May, Prime Minister
Tony Blair of Britain has been presented with a perfect chance to
lend new authority to his support for paternity leave. He should
take some time off and help his wife with the wee one. It would
make a point politically and score a point or two at home. Or, as
the Mirror tabloid aptly advised recently in billboard-size type,
``Show new dads the way, Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some wage-earning fathers, Blair cannot argue the
disadvantages of helping with child care. The Blairs' living
quarters are conveniently attached to Blair's working quarters. The
help situation is fairly accommodating, ranging from household
staff to an assortment of Cabinet ministers. For a thoroughly
modern prime minister, this would seem to be an easy call.
</P>
<P>
   Under new regulations in the European Union, parents are
entitled to 13 weeks of unpaid time off during the first five years
of a child's life. Many working fathers have apparently resisted
taking parental time off, protesting that they are too busy or
worrying that if they change too many diapers they might also be
forced to change jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, Blair has said he is worried about
making sure the country is ``properly run.'' But the idea of the
head man staying with a new tot is understandably popular with
women, an important voting bloc for Blair and his Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   One particular working mum, however, may have a more substantial
sway in this matter _ the prime minister's wife, Cherie. A
high-powered barrister who practices law under the name Cherie
Booth, Blair last week praised the prime minister of Finland, Paavo
Lipponen, who has taken time off for the birth of his children.
Blair's advisers are suggesting that he could take a week or so on
his holiday schedule, meaning that he would work only four hours a
day. That way he would be easily within reach for any emergencies
in the government as well as any mishaps at home.

EXPECT PALFFY FOR FIRST ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ziggy Palffy's sprained right shoulder continues
to improve and he should be back in two weeks for the first round
of the playoffs. The news on winger Nelson Emerson isn't so
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, who suffered a badly broken left index finger just 11
days after he was acquired from Atlanta at the March 14 trade
deadline, probably will not be ready for the opening round of the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson was injured on a slash by Philadelphia's Daymond Langkow
that broke the finger just above the left knuckle. His left arm was
placed in a cast up to the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson is spending this week in Atlanta to put his house on the
market. He will be reexamined Monday and the team orthopedist might
have to insert a pin surgically to stabilize the finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors say we could be looking at a lengthy time frame,''
general manager Dave Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The range of motion in Palffy's shoulder has improved and he
could be back in a week to 10 days. Right, now, Palffy is
undergoing hot and cold treatment and electronic stimulation to the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings would like to have Palffy play the final
regular-season games to prepare for the first round.
</P>
<P>
   __ Line shifts: Emerson originally replaced Palffy on the Kings'
first unit, but now the line is composed of Jozef Stumpel, Glen
Murray and Craig Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, who had two goals and four assists on the Kings'
three-game East Coast trip, assisted on both goals by Murray on
Saturday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The two broke in the same season (1991-92) with the Bruins and
played in Boston together for four seasons. Murray was traded to
Pittsburgh in 1995 then onto the Kings two years later. Stumpel was
traded to the Kings in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stumpy and I go back a long way,'' said Murray, who has played
most of the season with Bryan Smolinski's second line. ``We know
each other very well. We've picked it up pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings actually have several former Bruins on their roster.
Smolinski broke in with Boston fulltime in 1993-94 and scored a
career-high 31 goals his rookie year. Defenseman Garry Galley
played 3 seasons in Boston from 1988-91.

STARS LOSE ZUBOV, CLAIM PACIFIC TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ The Pacific Division became the official
property of the Stars last night.
</P>
<P>
   They, of course, celebrated with their seasonlong sidekicks: ice
bags, black eyes and an another injury _ this one to the only Stars
player who hadn't missed a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   With 13:30 remaining in the Stars' 4-1 victory against the
Florida Panthers, defenseman Sergei Zubov went down after taking a
hit from Panthers defenseman Bret Hedican. He lay on the ice for a
couple of minutes before being helped off. He has a strained right
knee and is scheduled to be evaluated tomorrow to determine whether
he'll play in any of the Stars' five remaining regular-season
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an ACL tear, so he's certainly going to be back for
the playoffs,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said, putting on his best
happy face.
</P>
<P>
   He, like his team, has been here before.
</P>
<P>
   Rare has the game been in which the Stars haven't seen one of
their best players with his arms draped over two teammates
shoulders, being helped off the ice. They're almost used to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just play,'' Hitchcock said. ``You just go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   They've done it all year. They'll, no doubt, do it again. But
they were starting to play so well. Just ask Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The second line that Hitchcock has been so worried about? Scored
three goals.
</P>
<P>
   The toughness that the Stars supposedly lacked? Got in four
fights.
</P>
<P>
   The strain that playing in three games in four nights might have
on goalie Ed Belfour? Stopped 36 of 37 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to do my job, and that's what I have to do,
come up with those saves,'' said Belfour, who has played in every
game since a weeklong hiatus following his March 8 arrest. He's
4-1-1 with an overtime loss, allowing 11 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers winger Pavel Bure prevented Belfour from getting his
50th shutout, scoring his NHL-leading 55th goal of the season at
8:46 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pavel Bure show was upstaged by the Scott Thornton
comeback tour.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in his first game back after a three-game suspension for
a high stick to San Jose's Marco Sturm, Thornton scored two goals,
had four shots and got into a fight while playing on the second
line with Joe Nieuwendyk and Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nieuwendyk's line really stepped up big-time. They were really
good,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think Thornton helped a lot, but I
think the other two guys were very good players tonight. They were
involved physically. Both guys really looked like workers out
there, and they had scoring chances because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock has been pleading from production from his second line
ever since Nieuwendyk returned from a separated shoulder three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk scored at 2:42 of the first period on a pretty wrist
shot from the bottom of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I still have to get playing a little bit better
here,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``Mentally, it has been more tough than
physically. Physically, I am starting to come around. Mentally, it
has been difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   After a goal by Stars center Guy Carbonneau at 12:34 of the
second period, his second goal in as many nights, the Thornton show
started. For a guy not brought in to score goals, he's sure scoring
them.
</P>
<P>
   He scored at 13:23 of the second period on a pass from Hull, one
of Hull's three assists on the night. The other came at 4:32 of the
third, when he punched in a rebound of a Hull shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying. Like I've been saying, I thought we were playing
pretty well together before I got suspended,'' Thornton said of the
line. ``I was a little surprised with how good I felt with this
time off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars don't usually have that many in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had heard before game these guys wanted to use us as a
measuring stick,'' Thornton said. ``So, for us, that was a little
bit of a challenge so we came out and answered the bell.'' ] All in
all not a bad night, if it weren't for the whole losing Zubov
thing. Zubov has been one of the Stars' best, most-consistent and
most-versatile players. When Stars captain Derian Hatcher missed
nine weeks with a lacerated calf earlier this season, Zubov filled
in as part of the shutdown pair with Richard Matvichuk. In addition
to quarterbacking the power play, he's also No. 3 on the team in
scoring with nine goals and 33 assists. In his four seasons with
the Stars, Zubov has missed 14 games. If he doesn't play Sunday, it
will be 15. ``Well, you know, what can you say,'' Belfour said.
``Zubie, he's a great player. Anytime you lose a player like that
out of your lineup you are going to miss him.'' nn

<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE newspaper, yellowing with age, is still thumbtacked to the
cluttered wall of greater Kissimmee's most beloved watering hole,
which is mentioned in a column as the site of a wee-hours
conversation between a ballplayer-turned-sportscaster and a couple
of sportswriters regarding the finest young pitching phenom the
former had seen come along in ages.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Larry Dierker knew something about young pitching
phenoms, having been one himself a generation earlier. When you
have struck out Willie Mays in your first big-league start at the
age of 18, as Dierker had, you are fully qualified to pass judgment
on the likes of Dwight Gooden, who was about to embark on the most
precocious Cy Young Award-winning season ever.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was barely 20, but it hadn't required the consumption of
a single Big Bamboo cocktail _ the near-lethal house specialty _
for any of the parties in this long-ago, beer-fueled bull session
to conclude that Baby Doc was fast-tracking his way to a place in
Cooperstown. It was Dierker's contention that Gooden had all the
requisite tools to become the reference standard for power pitchers
in the modern age.
</P>
<P>
   And for an all-too-brief time, he lived up to Dierk's
expectations. Gooden's first three seasons, through the Mets'
world-championship year of 1986, stack up nicely against anybody's
in the latter half of the 20th century. His next four weren't
shabby either, although the demons that would nearly destroy him
had begun to dog his every celebrated step.
</P>
<P>
   As we now know, Gooden wouldn't handle fame and fortune in the
New York fishbowl well. Drugs became his crutch, his escape from
the pressures of his high profile. He took to living as fast as he
threw a baseball _ way north of 90 mph back then _ and that's how
he wound up where he is today at 35, determined, perhaps desperate
even, to script an end to his career remotely worthy of its
original boundless promise.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden won't go to the Hall of Fame. He won't win 300 games or
strike out 3,000 hitters. But as an Astro, pitching for Dierker, he
can make peace with himself. And in the process, he gets to claim a
small piece of Houston baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   In Enron Field's inaugural game tonight, shortly after 7:05
p.m., Gooden will throw the first pitch of baseball's new era in
Houston to native son Chuck Knoblauch of the world champion
Yankees, the team that gave Doc his first second chance after the
cross-town Mets had had their fill of him.
</P>
<P>
   And even in these pitching-depleted times, the Astros may
represent his last second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to it,'' Doc said of the Enron
opener. ``I've had a lot of things happen to me in my career, but
this will be a new experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final Florida start Saturday, he was supposed to work six
innings against the Expos. But he lasted only three after
experiencing numbness in the tip of a finger when Hideki Irabu
clipped him as he squared up to bunt on a squeeze play. He stayed
in the game after being examined by trainer Dave Labossiere and
went one more inning before catcher Paul Bako warned the Astros'
brain trust that he believed Doc was altering his mechanics
slightly to compensate for his diminished feel for the ball. Still,
the abbreviated outing would be his third in the Grapefruit League
in which he didn't surrender a run.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden's ERA is a sparkling 2.37 after 19 exhibition innings. He
has given up 10 hits and walked six while striking out 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged,'' he said afterward. ``The Astros offered
me a chance to prove myself, and I think I have. It's been a good
situation for me, being here, just being back in the National
League. I like the National League game better, and I like to hit
except for maybe today.''
</P>
<P>
   He should like it. His eight home runs rank first among active
major-league pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   As for his forte, though, Gooden is only 31-22 since he was
suspended for the entire 1995 season for repeatedly violating the
provisions of his drug-rehab program. And battling a shoulder
strain much of the season, he went 3-4 with a 6.26 ERA for
Cleveland a year ago, in what many felt would surely be his last
major-league gasp.
</P>
<P>
   But Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker was with the Mets
when Gooden was Doctor K, and he deemed him worthy of a look-see _
certainly since Houston had a sudden crying need for a stopgap
starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton was gone, ironically, to the Mets, and Scott
Elarton was coming off rotator-cuff surgery. If Gooden could bring
anything at all, he would have a spot, at least short-term.
</P>
<P>
   Well?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything that discourages me,'' Dierker said,
speaking cautiously so as to not overburden Gooden with fan
expectations. ``I've seen what I'd hoped I'd see, a veteran who
can't overpower hitters anymore but who can get them out because he
knows how to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consideration was given to inserting Gooden in the rotation
behind Shane Reynolds, Jose Lima and Chris Holt, but Dierker
decided not to subject him to the pressure of having to pitch the
Astros' regular-season Enron opener a week from Friday night
against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid that might be asking a little too much of him,''
the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros _ more irony _ will instead ask it of Octavio Dotel,
the 24-year-old ascendant star acquired from the Mets as part of
the Hampton trade. Dotel, who was touted in New York as a possible
second coming of the Doc, showed Gooden-esque flashes as a
flame-throwing Mets rookie in 1999, although at 8-3 with a 5.38
ERA, his numbers were hardly ballpark with the teen-age Gooden's
remarkable 17-6, 2.60 and 276 K's in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   No, Dotel is not the Doc. But all things considered, maybe
that's for the best.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
When the Astros pursued Roger Clemens prior to last season, they
envisioned the five-time Cy Young Award winner on the mound for the
first game at their new downtown ballpark.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They'll get their wish _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will be wearing pinstripes when he walks to the mound
tonight in the inaugural game at Enron Field, but it has nothing to
do with the Astros' change of uniform. He'll be pitching for the
defending World Series champion New York Yankees, who also helped
the Astros open the Astrodome 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited for Houston, as someone who lives there,'' said
Clemens, a product of Spring Woods. ``I hope it does for our
downtown what it's done for some of these other downtowns, like
Cleveland and Baltimore. You see the effect these stadiums have on
the cities that build them. I just hope Houston has the same thing
happen. That downtown is starting to come together, and this could
be just what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   During his Hall of Fame career _ which includes 247 victories
and 3,316 strikeouts in 15 major-league seasons _ Clemens has
pitched in his hometown just once. He was the American League's
starting pitcher in the 1986 All-Star Game, played at the
Astrodome, and threw three perfect innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, also known as ``the Rocket,'' came close to returning
home when he demanded a trade from the Toronto Blue Jays after the
1998 season. The Astros expressed their desire to acquire Clemens,
but when his Houston-based representatives, Alan and Randy
Hendricks, requested a $27 million contract extension, general
manager Gerry Hunsicker publicly criticized the agents. Clemens
vowed never to play for the Astros, and a few months later he was
dealt to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, Clemens lives with his wife, Deb, and
their four sons _ Koby, 13; Kory, 11; Kacy, 5; and Kody, 3 _ 20
minutes from downtown. He has purchased 200 tickets to tonight's
game for family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the name he has, I think it's going to be real neat for
the city to see him pitch,'' said Yankees lefthander Andy Pettitte,
who played at Deer Park. ``That's going to be special. It's special
for the town. I know it'll be special for Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   It will also be special for the Houston-area contingent on the
Yankees' roster, which includes Clemens, Pettitte, second baseman
Chuck Knoblauch (Bellaire) and relievers Mike Stanton (Alvin
Community College) and Jason Grimsley (Cleveland).
</P>
<P>
   ``Revitalization isn't the right word. It would be a
vitalization,'' Stanton said. ``Downtown has never been a big place
for Houston. You see other places like Cleveland, Baltimore, places
like that. In those cities, business is pretty much concentrated
and done downtown. In Houston, business is done everywhere.
Downtown's got an OK skyline, but that's it.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
After hearing about it for months, the newest tenants at the
6.5-acre property at the corner of Texas Avenue and Crawford Street
finally walked around their new home Wednesday afternoon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging by the wide-eyed, awe-struck look on the faces of Astros
players, coaches and personnel, the two-year construction of Enron
Field was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw pictures of the stadium, so we had an idea. But you
never really get the full effect until you see it for yourself,''
infielder Bill Spiers said. ``I think everybody is like a young kid
in a candy store walking around this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon their midday arrival at Bush Intercontinental Airport, the
Astros were given a police escort for the 30-minute drive downtown.
The Astros left their spring-training site in Kissimmee, Fla., a
day early to allow players a glimpse of their new home before
tonight's Enron-opening exhibition with the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all excited to be here and be a part of it,'' Spiers
said. ``This is definitely worth the wait. You could see the
excitement in the guys when we landed, got on the bus and had a
police escort for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Once at the ballpark, players went on a tour of the clubhouse
before walking through the dugout tunnels and onto the grassy
playing field, a view of Union Station and part of the Houston
skyline directly in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bogar, looking like a tourist with a camera in his hand,
immediately began taking pictures. Billy Wagner and Jay Powell
walked to the home team's bullpen area in right-center field. Craig
Biggio checked out the infield dirt and chatted briefly with head
groundskeeper Luke Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima pointed to the short 315-foot line in left field. ``I
may even go deep this season,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around at the 42,000 seats that will be filled for
tonight's game against the defending World Series champions, most
of the Astros were speechless, calling the picturesque setting
``breathtaking and unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incredible,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said.
``It's hard to believe. You knew it was coming; you watched it go
up. But until you really come out and see the finished product,
it's just like it's almost surreal. I find myself asking the
questions, `Is this really happening? Is this really ours?' This is
going to be very special for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a fan walking around, step by step, admiring every
section of this new ballpark. You're not going to forget the first
time you walked into this place.''
</P>
<P>
   So what part of the ballpark drew the most attention?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the 1850s-era locomotive beyond left field or the
three-section retractable roof that cast a partial shadow in the
outfield Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it the cozy yet spacious clubhouse?
</P>
<P>
   How about the gigantic scoreboard in the upper reaches of right
field?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' Biggio said. ``It's a beautiful facility. It's a
beautiful ballpark. They did an excellent job. After playing 12
years in an old building, to open a new house is exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lima was mesmerized with the left-field porch, outfielder
Roger Cedeno was busy inspecting center field, which includes a
30-degree slope up to the wall and a flagpole in fair territory.
Standing 435 feet from home plate, the center-field wall is the
deepest in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three days to figure it out and make adjustments,''
Cedeno said. ``It's a long way. I don't think a lot of balls are
going to be hit there. That's why I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best reviews were saved for the Bermuda grass _ a
welcome replacement for the Astrodome's turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the greenest grass I've seen in a long time,'' Bogar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden, a former Yankee, made his first career start in
the Astrodome while with the New York Mets, and he'll pitch the
first game at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've been in the right place at the right time,'' said
Gooden, who briefly threw with reliever Mike Maddux in left field
after most of his teammates were long gone. ``I couldn't be in a
better situation, especially going against the Yankees in a new
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Hometown icon Roger Clemens, winner of five Cy Young Awards,
will start for New York. The Yankees played in the first game in
the Astrodome in 1965, a 2-1 Astros exhibition victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won't take batting practice or test the field until
prior to today's exhibition. But after Wednesday's visit, they felt
a new chapter had officially begun in Houston baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``After playing in the Dome and all the tradition there, coming
here and starting your own tradition and your new brand of baseball
is exciting,'' Wagner said. ``I think the fans are in for a real
treat.''
</P>
<P>
   The most eager person in the organization to officially open
Enron Field, Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr., was still deciding
how he would spend the eve of the grand opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might not go to bed,'' McLane said.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FOR the second time in 35 years, the Houston Astros will open a
magnificent new stadium against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   What? Again?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these are not your father's Yankees who will provide
the opposition when the Astros dedicate Enron Field, the downtown
jewel of what was once Houston's dreary east end. In 1965, the
Yankees still had Mickey Mantle, Tony Kubek and Whitey Ford, but
they were not the defending world champions, as these Bronx Bombers
are.
</P>
<P>
   They finished second to the St. Louis Cardinals in the '64 World
Series, a loss that cost Yogi Berra his job as manager. He was
replaced by Johnny Keane, who made his home in Houston. A proud
man, Keane resigned his job as Cardinals manager after the Series.
He had led them to a comeback so remarkable that it embarrassed the
ownership. St. Louis won the pennant on the last day of the season,
after the club had negotiated with Leo Durocher to be the next
year's field leader.
</P>
<P>
   You got all that?
</P>
<P>
   No such intrigue, no blood on the ground, surrounds the teams as
they plunge into this year's pageantry. In the Year of the
Astrodome, the Astros were destined to finish ninth, still seeking
their first winning season, a mere seven years away.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Yankees have a clue that their great run was over
and that hard times were coming. They were as awe-struck as the
Astros by the grandeur of the world's first indoor ballpark. Mantle
and Joe Pepitone boasted proudly of their achievements in the Dome,
Mick blasting the first home run and Pepitone making the first
error by an Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, it was only a preseason game, but, oh, what it
seemed to be. You can expect the same blizzard of first recorded
moments.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros inspected Enron Field for the first time Wednesday,
shortly after their arrival from the sun-soaked shores of Florida.
They loved what they saw, being careful not to step too hard on the
newly planted grass or muck up the smoothly brushed red clay of the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing smug about the way they conducted this visit,
none of that ``the Astros are here and checking it out'' attitude.
They were looking at the angles of the field and testing the
pattern of the wind and whether the fences are friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to paint those bricks out there,'' said
Craig Biggio, pointing to a light beige patch on the wall beneath
the terrace in center field. This is the kind of detail that can
cause a hitter to lose the ball in that background as it leaves the
pitcher's hand. You sense that by 7:05 tonight, the bricks will be
green, matching the rest of the backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Craig was asked jokingly what he thought of the ambience.
``Nice,'' he said. ``It looks like a ballpark.'' He was standing in
the outfield, about 10 feet behind second base, his work station.
Owner Drayton McLane Jr. was beside him, and slightly beside
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever think,'' he asked a reporter, ``that you would
see the Astros in a stadium with real grass and the sun shining on
your face?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' said the reporter, ``I was pretty content with old
Colt Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Drayton pointed to his corner offices on the top floor of Union
Station, overlooking left field. ``It's about 422 feet from home
plate to my window,'' he said, turning to Biggio. ``Would you hit a
home run for me through there?''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran grinned and said, ``If you let me hit it from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the distance, the ball would have to achieve a
height of around 40 feet. It was remarked offhand that the glass
must be of the non-breakable variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' Drayton replied. ``I insisted on breakable glass. I
want to hear the glass shatter. I want to hear a lot of noise.
We'll just keep buying new windows.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Astros won't need sound effects to recreate the
clatter once associated with Rosie Roswell, an old-time broadcaster
with the Pirates. ``He would recreate the games using Western
Union,'' recalled Milo Hamilton. ``When a Pirate hit one out,
they'd cue up the record of breaking glass and Rosie would say,
`Watch out, Aunt Minnie, another one is coming through.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Vern Ruhle pointed to the fence in right-center,
just short of the power alley. ``How far is it to there?'' he
asked. He was given an estimate of 355 feet. ``Man, that looks
close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large the Houston pitchers, accustomed to the luxury
of the wide-open spaces in the Astrodome, were encouraged by what
their eyes told them. The Enron roof was open, and the day was warm
and muggy. ``The ball might not carry as much as we thought,''
decided Ruhle.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner, the bullpen ace whose fastball has been known to
cause powder burns, stopped by to share the latest inside
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to two of the construction workers,'' he
reported, ``and they said the wind usually blows in from right
field and then moves in circles.''
</P>
<P>
   So much to learn, so many to please, so little time.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Joan Donovan remembers a night in 1980 when she couldn't sleep and
got up to go to the kitchen at 2 a.m. She walked by the bedroom of
her son, Billy, but he wasn't there. The bed was empty.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She woke up her husband, William, frantic that their 14-year-old
son was gone. William Donovan was much calmer about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' he said. ``I'm sure you will find him up at the
gym.''
</P>
<P>
   William Donovan was right. His son was shooting baskets at St.
Agnes High School while the rest of the Long Island community of
Rockville Centre, N.Y., was under the covers.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Billy Donovan continues to make the extra
effort to get to where he wants to be. That relentless
determination and drive to be the best has his Florida Gators two
games away from a national championship, making Donovan one of the
youngest coaches ever to reach the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I get too caught up in it sometimes, but I've always
been passionate about basketball,'' Donovan said. ``I always tried
to learn and get better as a player, and now I'm trying to learn
and get better as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   They call him ``Billy the Kid,'' a moniker pinned on him by his
mentor Rick Pitino when Donovan's quick shot release at Providence
almost was fast enough to keep up with the speed of his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, 34, can rattle off sentences in his New York accent
faster than most people can process what he's saying. And he has a
lot to say these days about his young team, which has reached the
promised land of college basketball faster than virtually anyone
believed it could.
</P>
<P>
   The running Gators have four freshmen and three sophomores among
the 10-man rotation, which employs a full-court press that leaves
most opponents gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told all our freshmen when they got here that they needed
to be humble,'' Donovan said. ``They needed to understand that they
don't have all the answers. Guys had to understand their role. We
have strength in numbers, which is why our depth is so important.
We can't have guys play 33 or 34 minutes a game in our style of
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't going to tell them that we weren't that good yet,
that we were too young or were probably a year away. I wanted our
players to dream of going to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth season at Florida, Donovan has helped his players
make that dream come true after inheriting a team that won only 12
games the year before Donovan arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But Donovan has done more than win games. He has made basketball
a happening on the Florida campus, where football always has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 23 years at Florida, everybody told me we never would be
a basketball school,'' Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley said.
``I've heard that a thousand times. But Billy has changed all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida had basketball success under former coach Lon Kruger,
reaching the Final Four in 1994. But the Gators never captured the
heart of the fans the way they have since Donovan arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The simple truth is these Gators are fun to watch. They run,
they gun, and they have the talent to make highlight reel plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing that sent me to Florida more than anything
else,'' sophomore center Udonis Haslem said. ``I wanted to get up
and down the floor. That's the only thing that was promised to me,
that we would press and run the floor, and that appealed to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of basketball Donovan believes in and one of the
reasons he was hired to coach the team when he was only 30, after
two years as head coach at Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of following the pattern we always had followed of
hiring a coach with a proven record, we wanted to find an
up-and-comer,'' Foley said. ``I wanted someone who was looking to
make his mark. I wanted someone with a lot of energy, passion and
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also were looking for a style of play that would bring fans
to the arena. Billy's style of play was important, and his pedigree
was important. But once I met him, I knew he was the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's pedigree includes a trip to the Final Four as a player
for Pitino at Providence and as an assistant coach under Pitino at
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino took the job at Providence before Donovan's junior year.
Donovan rode the bench his first two seasons, but Pitino gave him a
chance to start.
</P>
<P>
   He told Donovan to lose 15 pounds over the summer and come back
ready to play. Donovan averaged 15 points a game as a junior and 21
points a game as senior point guard and team captain for Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   After one year in the NBA with the New York Knicks and one year
as a stockbroker on Wall Street, Donovan joined Pitino at Kentucky
as a graduate assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk a lot, but the biggest thing I learned from Rick was to
listen,'' Donovan said. ``A lot of times as a head coach you can
think you have all the answers, but your assistants may view things
differently than you. You may think you have a pulse on things, but
you don't always.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick wants feedback constantly. He squashes egos and gets guys
to buy into the team and the system. He also is extremely
innovative and not afraid to take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan adopted the pressing defense from Pitino, and he has
stuck with it when people said he should be more conservative. He
proved his point when Florida defeated top-ranked Duke 77-65 in the
East Regional semifinals last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said we shouldn't press Duke,'' Donovan said. ``They
said Duke would eat us alive if we did, but we wouldn't have won
the game without pressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said it is Donovan's boundless energy more than his style
of play that has made him successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy always has kept the boy alive in him,'' Pitino said.
``He refuses to grow up. That type of enthusiasm is difficult to
find, but he has it and it's infectious. And no one will outwork
him in recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's recruiting success at Florida has landed him four
McDonald's All-Americans in the last two years _ guards Teddy Dupay
and Brett Nelson and forwards Mike Miller and Donnell Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the court, (Donovan) is energetic and crazy because of his
youth,'' Miller said. ``But on the court, he has the wisdom of a
guy who has been around the game a long time. It surprised me when
I got here how much he knew about the game. In every situation, he
knows what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Dupay are sophomores; Nelson and Harvey are freshmen.
No school in history ever had signed multiple McDonald's
All-Americans in back-to-back years.
</P>
<P>
   It raised some eyebrows and brought accusations of impropriety
from other coaches, including Roy Williams of Kansas and Eddie
Fogler of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was furious when Miller, a South Dakota product, turned
down the Jayhawks to sign with Florida. Williams publicly
questioned Donovan's tactics, but an NCAA investigation showed no
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy and I have talked, and we've agreed to disagree,'' Donovan
said. ``I have tremendous respect for him as a coach, but I did not
like the way he handled that situation. People don't understand how
much work we put in on recruiting. We spent 24 straight days with
Mike Miller. We're aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are coaches who don't want to spend as much time on this
as we do. They don't want to work as hard. Some coaches think a
two-hour home visit is enough, but don't criticize me for taking
advantage of every single minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan has been taking advantage of every minute since his days
back on Long Island, shooting baskets at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the doors to the school gym were locked, but Donovan
cured that problem. He took a bolt cutter and cut off the key lock,
then put on his own combination lock and told the custodian the
necessary numbers. At that point, the custodian just gave Donovan a
key to reach his destination.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan still is working overtime and hoping he has a key to
another destination _ a national championship.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Will this be the year Cal State Northridge finally
returns to the NCAA golf tournament?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Bracken thinks it might be, even if he's had to limit
his optimism to baby steps with the most talented team he has
fielded since the former Division II-powerhouse Matadors jumped to
Division I in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just a field-filler anymore,'' said Bracken, whose
team has often finished in the upper half of collegiate tournaments
this year, topped by a second-place finish at San Diego and a fifth
at UC Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat a lot of good teams at Santa Barbara,'' he said. ``We
played so-so at Irvine (16th of 21 teams Tuesday, 30 strokes behind
winner Washington) but we've been starting to play better. We've
just had a little inconsistency.''
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistency, which he says has infected the entire team in
varying degrees, has sometimes produced dramatic consecutive-round
swings _ and not only toward a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bashian, the Matadors' talented freshman from Birmingham
High _ a state amateur finalist last summer _ soared to an 87 in a
Northridge tournament bid at difficult La Purisima, then shot
1-over-par 73 in the next round.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of players like Bashian, who has alternated at No. 5
with Lance Dombroski, Chuck Ruiz and Carlos Robledo, and of the
Northridge top four of Anthony Marciano, Paul D'Ambra, Manny Hayes
and Tim Wren (another former State Amateur finalist) keeps Bracken
confident his alma mater will break through to get back to the
playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made it to the Division I regionals yet, and we
were there every year in Division II,'' said Bracken, whose Div. I
recruiting efforts were made difficult for much of the 1990s by
constant rumors that the golf program would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But Bracken, who has been associated as a player or coach with
almost every top player or team the Matadors have produced in golf,
got a recruiting boost two years ago with the school's decision to
retain the golf program.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits could show this season. The Matadors _ last in the
Big Sky Conference last year _ are considered one of the teams to
beat for the Big Sky tournament title, which is accompanied by an
automatic berth to the NCAA West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think we might be favored,'' said Bracken, whose team
has split in four meetings with defending conference champion
Sacramento State and will have at least a traveling advantage for
the Big Sky tournament, since that May 1-3 event will be played at
River Ridge in Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, he'll try to help coax a little more consistency out
of a Northridge team that has had some moments of brilliance,
including top-10 tournament finishes by D'Ambra and Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have a lot of talent,'' Bracken said. ``I keep
telling them, `The difference between you guys and some of the
nation's ranked teams is just a little inconsistency.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard sometimes, when they're going bad. You just try to
keep them calm and stop the bleeding, tell them to just not make
the mental mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bracken is looking forward to the end-of-the-season Division
I playoff push by the latest edition of a program that produced
Division II team and individual champions and sent Bob Burns on to
the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get together in conference and get to regionals and
play to our ability there, we could surprise some teams.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fore the record: UCLA coach Brad Sherfy of Camarillo is
listed by the Southern California Golf Association as record-holder
at two courses _ De Bell in Burbank (61) and Spanish Hills in
Camarillo (a share at 65).
</P>
<P>
   The SCGA, in its March/April edition of Fore Magazine, includes
a list of record-holders at most Southern California courses, and
many area golfers were named.
</P>
<P>
   Former CSUN players Gary Finneran (his 64 shares the mark at El
Cariso), Patrick Boyd (62 for a share at Porter Valley and 65 at
Steele Canyon), Vic Wilk (61 at Balboa) and Jeff Sanday (62 at SCGA
Members Club, 65 at Primm Valley Desert course and 64 for a share
at Coyote Hills) made the list.
</P>
<P>
   So did former Alemany High standout David Berganio (a share of
the 62 at Porter Valley) and former Granada Hills star Darren Angel
(63 for a share at Knollwood). Agoura Hills resident Matthew Lane
(61 at Braemar East and 63 at Calabasas) and longtime area
instructor Paul Holtby (62 at Braemar West) were among the many
other area golfers on a list that continues to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   __ Drive, putt and chip: The Golf Channel's Drive, Putt and Chip
competition for kids ages 7-12 will be held Wednesday at David L.
Baker Memorial GC in Fountain Valley. The event is open to the
first 120 players who register at the course (10410 Edinger Ave.,
Fountain Valley) on or before Friday. Competition will be in age
groups 7-8, 9-10 and 11-12. Winners have the opportunity to advance
to regional and national events. Information: (714) 418-2152.
</P>
<P>
   __ Names in the game: Former Westlake High star Brandon DiTullio
won this week's Spaulding/Anteater Invitational at Coto de Caza,
shooting 67-76-70 _ 213 for the only subpar total (3 under) of the
tournament to help the Bruins finish third. UCLA freshman J.T.
Kohut, another former Westlake standout, was the Bruins' No. 4
scorer at Coto de Caza.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Contreras, teaching pro at Verdugo Hills GC (where Kohut
holds the course record with the 11-under-par 43 he shot as an
11-year-old), is coaching the Village Christian high school team

MAJOR CRIMES DOWN 50% SINCE 1994
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Staff writers Greg Botonis, Cecilia Chan, Joseph Giordono and
Orith Goldberg contributed to this story) 
By   LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Serious crime plunged across Los Angeles County
and the Greater San Fernando Valley in 1999, continuing a six-year
trend that has yielded a 50 percent drop in crime since 1994,
according to figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dramatic decreases overall, violent crime was up in
Burbank, the Van Nuys Division had more homicides, and the Van Nuys
and Devonshire divisions logged more rapes, according to statistics
compiled by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, crime including homicide, assault and rape was down
8.8 percent, with an even more dramatic decline of 10.5 percent in
the Valley, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police cited tougher gun laws, a strong economy and particularly
the cooperation of residents as a key to the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley has a very strong Neighborhood Watch, and the
involvement in the community has led to numerous arrests. They're
taking back their streets,'' said LAPD Cmdr. Val Paniccia of the
Valley Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics, covering cities with populations of at least
100,000, show a 13.2 percent decline in crime statewide. Some of
the numbers have been reported previously, including the rise in
homicides in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must continue to fight for more and better prevention plans
that work and that can steer our young people away from delinquency
and crime careers,'' said Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
</P>
<P>
   In Burbank, aggravated assaults rose 15.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank police spokesman Lt. Robert Giles said he is not alarmed
by the rise. ``I saw the increase in the numbers last month,
dismissed it and filed the paperwork appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles said crime has declined steadily in the city, but it's
just a matter of time before ``the pendulum swings the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show property crimes declined in Burbank by 11
percent and larceny and thefts were down 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley's Devonshire Division, rapes were up 21 percent,
with 93 reports last year, vs. 77 in 1998. In Van Nuys, rapes
increased 20 percent, with 84 in 1999 and 70 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Police attribute the increase largely to their efforts to
encourage people to report rapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing acquaintance-type rapes that we hadn't seen
previously,'' said Lt. Joe Eddy, in charge of detectives at the
Devonshire Division.
</P>
<P>
   Devonshire's figures might also be skewed because the division
acquired a 1.4-square-mile area of Panorama City in 1999 that Van
Nuys previously handled.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Jim Rahm, in charge of the sex crimes section at Van
Nuys, said that recently he has taken more rape reports from women
who accepted rides with men they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what your mother told you when you were a child: You
don't get into a stranger's car. The same thing applies to adults.
This is a big city and not everybody is a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, people report being raped by their spouses, Rahm
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Van Nuys, the number of homicides increased - with 11 in
1999, compared with seven in 1998, said Lt. Ann Young, in charge of
detectives at Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them were acquaintance homicides where the victims
knew their attackers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Foothill Division in the northeast San Fernando Valley
showed the most significant decrease in crime at 19 percent, with
reported rapes decreasing 30percent, burglaries by 29 percent and
homicides by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other large decreases were Devonshire's homicides,
with 11 in 1999 vs. 17 the year before - a 35 percent decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, violent crimes, which includes homicides, rapes,
robberies and aggravated assaults, decreased 4.8 percent in 1999
over 1998. Authorities attribute the decline to tough sentencing
laws, more LAPD officers in the past six years, the booming economy
and record low unemployment and innovative crime prevention
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, all crimes are down, with motor vehicle thefts
taking the biggest plunge at 14.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian attributes the
decrease, in part, to programs such as Community Police
PartnerShip, in which officers broadcast safety tips and inform the
public via local access cable channels. Officers advise residents
on preventive measures, such as buying car alarms, parking on
well-lit streets and locking their garages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage residents to be our eyes and ears and, through
Neighborhood Watch groups or Business Watch groups, whenever they
see suspicious activity, to report it immediately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of crimes reported in Simi Valley dropped nearly 6
percent, with the largest decrease - more than 28 percent - coming
in the category of aggravated assaults, according to figures
released by the Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks reported an 8.1 percent drop in overall crime,
with statistics reflecting a 17.8 percent decline in burglaries,
the report shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very encouraged by the numbers,'' Simi Valley Police
Chief Randy Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   While arson and robberies increased in the Santa Clarita Valley,
serious crimes have gone down.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities linked the arson increase to a surge in car thefts
regionwide - with the thieves dumping cars in remote areas of Santa
Clarita and torching them to destroy evidence. An increase in the
number of small arson incidents by minors in the Canyon Country
area also played a role in the jump, said Los Angeles County
sheriff's Lt. Tim Peters.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in robberies has been a little more baffling, with
a 13 percent rise in the Santa Clarita Valley and a 33 percent rise
within city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Serious crimes in Lancaster dropped from 5,405 in 1998 to 4,155
in 1999, down 23.1 percent, and from 4,836 to 3,906 in Palmdale,
down 19.2 percent.

CELLULAR PHONES FEED OUT HANG_UPS

   LOS ANGELES _ Hold those calls!
</P>
<P>
   On the leading edge of a cellular phone backlash, Los Angeles
County supervisors voted Tuesday to silence cell phones in their
board room, joining churches, colleges, theaters and restaurants
that are sick of the incessant chirping, beeping and ringing.
</P>
<P>
   Movie theaters now run warnings against cell phone use, some
restaurants have cell phone sections, and one London anti-cell
phone group has gone as far as smashing people's phones and
displaying its exploits on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It has even been suggested that motorists caught with cell phone
in hand be charged with driving under the affluence.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, exasperated supervisors said the ringing and
chatting has been drowning out their meetings, so they voted
unanimously to require cell phones and pagers to be set on vibrate
mode or be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many people with cell phones today, they should give
us the courtesy to turn them off during the hearing,'' said
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who sponsored the motion. It
will only get worse. The number of people with wireless telephones
has gone from 283,600 in 1985 to 76 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While cell phone abuse irritates some people, many are finding
these devices of convenience and security really are modern torture
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get away from people,'' said Ken Sereno, associate
professor of communications at the Annenberg School of
Communications at the University of Southern California. ``I feel
that way. That's why I'm reluctant to give people my cell phone
number. I think that supports the idea that it's intrusive and
prevents you from getting away.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sereno said cell phones have many obvious advantages,
among them giving ready access to 911.
</P>
<P>
   Don Slater, a Kirkland, Wash., resident in Los Angeles on
business, uses a cellular phone but only when he has to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a meeting, they're just annoying,'' the
53-year-old said. ``I don't consider anything in life so important
that I need my cell phone on all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He might be the exception to the rule, however. In many ways,
cell phone abuse is a symptom of a technology moving too quickly
for society's rules of etiquette and civility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much communications happening too quickly,'' said A.
Michael Noll, a USC communications professor.
</P>
<P>
   Like cowboys of the Old West, Noll said, it could get to the
point where ``we have to park our guns outside. Only instead of a
gun rack, people will park their cell phones in a cell phone
rack.''
</P>
<P>
   Many cell phones have vibrating modes, but that can be a
problem, particularly for women who don't wear their phone on their
belt.
</P>
<P>
   A Pacific Bell Wireless spokesman said the vibrating mode and
voice mail are designed specifically to defuse some of the
complaints now surfacing about cell phone abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage our customers to use the technology and features
of their phones to enhance convenience, safety and courtesy when
using the phones in public,'' said Brian Brokowski, a PacBell
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some cell phone users apparently don't care about their
intrusion, and some might even enjoy it, according to one expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called Self-Imposed Importance, or SIP,'' said Nancy
Friedman, president of Telephone Doctor, a St. Louis, Mo.-based
training company specializing in customer service and telephone
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disease that people get. It says, 'Hello, I'm
important. I have a cell phone.' The frustration with annoying cell
phone users is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   At California State University, Northridge, students in a
journalism class are asked to vote on whether a classmate should be
marked absent for the day if her or his cell phone or beeper goes
off. So far no one has been sent home.
</P>
<P>
   At Valley Beth Shalom in the Los Angeles suburb of Encino, board
chairman Avery Greenburg said the synagogue put up signs a few
months ago asking people to turn off their cell phones and pagers
to ``be respectful of the services.''
</P>
<P>
   One of a growing number of restaurants in Southern California
that have banned cell phones is Millie's in Silver Lake, where the
staff will chant ``No phones, no phones'' to anyone who breaks the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never allowed cell phones in the eight years I've owned
this place,'' owner Patti Peck said. ``We're an old-fashioned
place. We like people to enjoy their food. You can't legislate
courtesy, but in our case we have the right to say, not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants in Hong Kong have ``cell phone'' and ``noncell
phone'' sections, said Sereno.
</P>
<P>
   And some Los Angeles County judges hold attorneys in contempt if
their phones ring in the courtroom. Court officials say they
haven't heard of the rule being enforced yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been occasions when a person's cell phone rings and
it's kept until the court is out of session for the day,'' said Los
Angeles Superior Court spokeswoman Jerrianne Hayslett.
</P>
<P>
   On area golf courses, those teeing up have become teed off by
rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a recreational golfer, it's a slight annoyance,''
said Westlake Golf Course professional Ted Lehmann. ``But if you
are a serious golfer, it could disrupt your shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Thomas, spokesman for the Southern California Golf
Association, said cell phone abuse is penalized on some courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Etiquette doesn't happen without teaching people the rules of
etiquette. The way we do that is to penalize them when they break
the rules.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ As the relatives of Elian Gonzalez continued to defy
immigration officials, and politicians here seemed to side with
them against the federal government, President Fidel Castro of Cuba
announced Wednesday night that the boy's father was preparing to
come to the United States to reclaim him.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Cuban television, Castro said Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez ``is ready to immediately'' go to Florida with a
large group of relatives if the U.S. government committed itself to
turning the boy over to him.
</P>
<P>
   But adding to the confusion of the day, a State Department
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said U.S.
officials had been caught off guard by Castro's speech.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Elian's father had not yet asked for
permission to enter the United States and that there was no
expectation that, should he do so, he would be accompanied by
others. The United States has always made clear, however, that
Elian's father would be welcome to come.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, tensions flared once again over the custody
case of the 6-year-old boy. The Cuban president's remarks came
after warnings from local authorities in South Florida that Miami
could erupt in violence if federal agents tried to forcibly take
the boy from his great-uncle's house in Little Havana and send him
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not lend our respective resources, whether they be in
the form of police officers or any other resources, to assist the
federal government in any way, shape or form to inappropriately
repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba,'' said Alex Penelas, mayor of
Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle and temporary guardian,
continued to refuse a demand from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service that he agree to hand the child over to
immigration officials if the Miami relatives lose a fight to keep
him when the case is heard in May in the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't cooperate in anything,'' Gonzalez told a
Spanish-language television station. ``The boy lives in my house,
and they'll have to go find him there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with Elian's relatives here that lasted well
into the night, the INS chose to extend by a day a 9 a.m. Thursday
deadline to sign the agreement, and immigration officials said they
would meet with the family again before deciding how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban Interest Section in
Washington, said Cuban officials and State Department officials
would also meet Thursday morning. The interest section is the de
facto Cuban Embassy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With the new negotiating sessions scheduled, immigration
officials said they would not follow through on their threat
earlier this week to remove Elian on Thursday morning, even if his
Miami relatives continued to refuse to sign the agreement the INS
sought. The agency had said it would revoke Elian's permission to
stay in the United States, clearing the way for his return.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments in Havana, Castro said that Elian's father would
be accompanied by other family members from Cuba, some of the boy's
former classmates and teachers, and psychiatric experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the perfect formula for reinserting Elian,'' Castro
said. He also said that the group would be willing to wait as long
as it takes to bring the boy back.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, asked by phone Wednesday
night whether the State Department had given Elian's father any
assurances of official help in reclaiming his son, said, ``I'm not
going to answer any questions on Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on Castro's announcement, a Justice Department
spokesman said, ``Certainly it changes things. How it changes
things is a little hard to say at this point. If the father shows
up in Miami and decides to go and ring the doorbell of his
relatives and find his son, well the family in Miami is on record
as saying they would turn over Elian to him. Whether they actually
do this remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for Elian's father, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been clear that Juan Miguel Gonzalez would come
to the United States if he were assured that by coming he could
take custody of his son. I think all that has happened tonight is
that the president of Cuba has said that there is no Cuban
government impediment to him coming and remaining here as long as
it takes to exhaust the appeals, if by coming he can take custody
of Elian. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel will come here, his absence is not an issue, he
will come here to the U.S., if by coming he is given custody of
Elian.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``there are two other players in that. The
relatives in Miami have said they won't release Elian. And the INS
and the government of the United States have not said, `Yes, that
if you come, we will arrange for you to have Elian's custody.'
Those two hurdles have not yet been overcome. The conversations
that are going on right now in Miami hold the key.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, where many people see the return of the boy to
Cuba as delivering him to the hated Fidel Castro and communism more
than as returning a 6-year-old boy to his father, mayors and other
elected officials held a news conference to show solidarity not
with the federal government but with the family here. Their message
was that if federal officials want to take Elian away in what
threatens to be a violent confrontation with demonstrators, they
are on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the responsibility of the Miami Police Department to
snatch Elian Gonzalez from his Miami family and be sent back to a
communist regime,'' said Joe Carollo, the mayor of Miami. ``Local
police should not be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelas, the mayor Miami-Dade County, said, ``If their continued
provocation, in the form of unjustified threats to revoke the boy's
parole, leads to civil unrest and violence, we are holding the
federal government responsible and, specifically, Janet Reno and
the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Immigration experts said the mayors' comments were frightening,
and amounted to what seemed to be defiance of a federal agency
while presenting the possibility of a breakdown of law and order.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very disturbing,'' said Max Castro, a senior research
associate for the Dante B. Fascell North-South Center of the
University of Miami, and an expert on Cuban issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If federal officers backed by Janet Reno and federal court
attempt to carry out a lawful order, the local authorities will not
intervene?'' asked Castro. ``It borders on the irresponsible. It's
a defiance of legal authority. It almost gives people more
encouragement'' to defy federal agents when they arrive here.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials called the comments troubling.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not respond with strong language to the
mayors' decision to side with the family, saying that ``whatever
the law is, whatever the decision that is ultimately made, the rest
of us ought to obey it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the mayors' comments had circulated on news wires and
television, Penelas said he did not mean to say that the police
here would not enforce the law if illegal demonstrations take
place.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration experts said the city's politicians are trying
to have it both ways, and wondered what would happen if an illegal
demonstration broke out at the house or some other location between
federal officials and people who want to keep Elian here.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas said the police would ``keep public order.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he warned, that might not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are provoking this community to an extent that I nor
anyone else can control,'' said Penelas, of the government's
handling of the case. ``If blood is shed on the streets,'' he said,
``yes, I will hold them responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day that brought many surprises in the Elian story, Mayor
Carollo of Miami said he had information that federal officials
were mobilizing in South Florida to take the boy home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 48 hours the federal government has had federal
agents in the area of the old Homestead Air Force Base,'' he said.
``There were federal agents scouting and observing the area to see
what would be the best way of bringing the father in and taking
Elian out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not deny that this is being considered,'' he said of
his discussions with federal officials. ``I am strongly advising
that this not be done. This is not going to be in the best interest
of our government of Miami and against the best interests of Elian
Gonzalez.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had spoken with Jeffrey Weiss, director of the asylum
division and international affairs for the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that he knew of no plan by the Defense Department
to provide facilities for a reunion of Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-Americans make up almost 800,000 of Miami-Dade
County's 2.1 million people. As Elian's Miami relatives continued
to negotiate with federal officials, leaders in the exile community
practiced ways to prevent the boy's repatriation. Some drilled in
the street, linking arms and marching to a cadence called by their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, demonstrators formed a human cross on
Southwest Eighth Street, holding candles and flashlights aloft. The
police blocked off traffic for them.

 JEWISH REFORM RABBIS VOTE IN FAVOR OF SAME-SEX CEREMONIES  By DON &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Backers of gay and lesbian marriage won a major moral victory
Wednesday when the rabbis of the Jewish Reform movement
overwhelmingly voted to support same-sex ceremonies in their
synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Greensboro, N.C., the Central Conference of American
Rabbis adopted a resolution stating that ``a Jewish same gender
couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish
ritual.'' The statement directs the conference to produce
educational materials and a new liturgy for same-sex ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Individual rabbis and congregations in the 1.5 million-member
Reform movement are free to perform the ceremonies or not,
depending on their individual conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The vote makes the Reform movement the third major religious
denomination to adopt a national policy allowing same-sex
ceremonies, following the Unitarian Universalist Association and
the United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   At the local level, many Reform rabbis are already conducting
same-sex ceremonies in their synagogues. Nevertheless, Wednesday's
vote puts the nation's largest _ and most liberal _ rabbinic
organization on record as supporting them.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Eric Weiss, one of three national coordinators of the Gay
and Lesbian Rabbinic Network, said Wednesday's vote was a welcome
relief after the passage of Proposition 22, the California ballot
measure that limits civil marriage rights to heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an undercurrent in that campaign of people in the
religious community saying our unions were not worthy of
sanctification,'' said Weiss, the executive director of the Bay
Area Jewish Healing Center in San Francisco. ``This vote is a
prophetic call for other religious denominations to follow as a
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Other religious denominations will soon have that chance.
Between May and July, national policy-making conventions of
Methodists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians will address the
hot-button issue of homosexual marriage. Gay and lesbian activists
are expected to face much tougher opposition in those Christian
venues.
</P>
<P>
   While the gay marriage proposal was overwhelmingly approved by
the Reform rabbis, more conservative Jewish leaders were dismayed
by the vote, saying it would further isolate the Reform movement
from Orthodox Judaism in Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of RABBIS30 (80351 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``I'm saddened by it,'' said Rabbi Jacob Traub of Adath Israel,
an Orthodox synagogue in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Traub said he did not believe the Jewish marriage ceremony
should be ``lightly adopted'' to conform to ever-changing moral
views.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Jewish marriage to homosexuals, Traub said, will
certainly not help the Reform rabbis in Israel, where they have
been struggling to establish themselves in a religious world
dominated by Orthodox Judaism. ``They're shooting themselves in the
foot,'' Traub said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Stephen Pearce of Congregation Emanu-El, the largest
Reform movement synagogue in San Francisco, said the American
Jewish clergy shouldn't worry about how their actions will play in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned with what they think,'' Pearce said.
``Nothing short of donning black hats and observing Orthodox
rituals day in and day out will satisfy them.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, the Reform movement has charted its own
Jewish course, allowing the ordination of women in 1973 and voting
in 1990 to open their rabbinic ranks to gay and lesbian clergy.
They have also separated themselves from Orthodox Jews by
proclaiming that Jewishness is passed on by either the mother and
the father. Orthodox Judaism believes only in matrilineal descent.
</P>
<P>
   Women rabbis led the campaign for same-sex ceremonies in Reform
movement synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Shira Stern, co-president of the Women's Rabbinic Network,
which first proposed the resolution two years ago, said Wednesday's
vote is ``as much a civil rights issue as it is a religious
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will strengthen Jewish families by recognizing the sacred
relationship between two Jews,'' she said, ``whether they be
homosexual or heterosexual.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christians opposed to gay marriage in their
churches often cite the Old Testament's condemnation of homosexual
intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Allen Bennett of Temple Israel, a Reform synagogue in
Alameda, said his colleagues do not believe the Hebrew Bible
condemns homosexuality as it is understood in modern society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many other things we have decided are no longer
applicable in Scripture,'' said Bennett, who is gay. ``There's a
passage in the Bible that says a child who disobeys should be
stoned to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said he has conducted at least three dozen gay marriage
ceremonies over the past 10 years, but none at his Alameda
synagogue, where he has served for 31/2 years. ``I haven't been
asked to do one at the synagogue,'' he said.
</P>

   At Congregational Emanu-El, Pearce estimates that he performs
five or six homosexual marriages a year. He said he'd probably do
more, but many gays and lesbians in San Francisco go to
Congregation Sha'ar Zahav, a Reform movement synagogue with a
special outreach to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered Jews.

FINGER LENGTH POINTS TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ In a study sure to provoke a lot of
self-examination, a University of California at Berkeley team has
found that differences in the lengths of one's fingers may yield
clues about sexual orientation.
<P>
   Lesbians on average turned out to have more ``masculine'' hands
than heterosexual women _ with the index finger significantly
shorter than the ring finger. There was no such difference in the
hands of gay and straight men, however.
</P>
<P>
   A brief summary of the study, led by Berkeley psychologist S.
Marc Breedlove and undergraduates Terrance J. Williams and Michelle
E. Pepitone, appeared Wednesday in the science journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results may seem a bit puzzling, experts said it's
only the latest of several studies that suggest hormones in the
womb have a powerful affect on sexual orientation and behavior
throughout life.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has found certain differences in brain
structures as well as other anatomical distinctions between gays
and straights.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is mixed, however, and nobody claimed the latest
findings will settle the debate over how sexual orientation is
shaped by biology versus environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can finger lengths be used as a reliable guide to very much
of anything, although it's long been known that men tend to have
longer fingers than women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences are subtle,'' said Raymond Blanchard, a
pioneer in gender and sexuality studies at the University of
Toronto's Center for Addiction and Mental Health. ``There's no way
anybody could use this to screen a date.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest study was based on the fact, which was already
apparent to scientists, that males tend to have a different pattern
of finger lengths than females.
</P>
<P>
   In men, the index finger tends to be a bit shorter than the ring
finger. These same two fingers on women are typically about the
same length. The male-female difference tends to be more pronounced
on the right hand, for reasons experts cannot explain, regardless
of whether the person is left- or right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   These gender differences can be picked up in very young
children, strongly suggesting they arise because of prenatal
influences. Based on a host of animal studies and other research,
it's almost certainly a product of androgen levels _ testosterone
and other male hormones _ in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists now suspect that finger lengths may be a marker of
how much a fetus was exposed to these masculinizing sex hormones.
The same prenatal influences may affect behavior and sexual
identity throughout life.
</P>
<P>
   Breedlove and his Berkeley colleagues appear to be the first
academic researchers to bother checking whether there is any
appreciable difference in finger-length ratios linked to sexual
orientation in adults.
</P>
<P>
   They set up booths last summer at a gay pride event in Oakland,
the annual Solano Stroll in Berkeley and at the Castro Street Fair
in San Francisco. Fairgoers were offered a free $1 lottery ticket
in exchange for having their hands photocopied and filling out a
detailed questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the hands of 720 adults, Breedlove's team
discovered that the average finger-length pattern for lesbians
closely resembled that of males. That is, the index fingers on
lesbians who were surveyed was judged to be significantly shorter
than the ring finger.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers concluded that ``at least some homosexual women were
exposed to greater levels of fetal androgen than heterosexual
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand patterns between gay men and heterosexual men revealed no
such difference. But the surveys yielded other intriguing clues.
</P>
<P>
   It was already known that men with more than one older brother
are slightly more apt to grow up to be homosexual than are
firstborn males.
</P>
<P>
   The new study suggested that males with older brothers are
subjected to higher levels of androgens in the womb than are eldest
sons.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the study says, men with more than one older
brother have a significantly more masculine right hand than men
without older brothers. That is, the right index finger is more
often shorter than the ring finger on the same hand.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such effect in men with older sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Breedlove said it's a complete mystery as to how a mother's body
could ``remember'' how many male children she had borne, where this
signal was kept and how it could influence hormone levels of a
later-born child.
</P>
<P>
   He also cautioned against making too much of the differences in
the hands of gay and straight women, noting it's an extremely
subtle distinction that holds true only when large numbers of hands
are averaged and compared.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use this to classify people,'' he said. ``If it were
that obvious, it probably would have been written about by
Aristotle a long time ago.''

   COUPLAND-TOTEMS (Chicago) _ It was a Sunday and the novelist
Douglas Coupland, chronicler of disaffected youth, was trawling for
mid-century American ceramics. He bought one piece after another,
never inquiring who made them or so much as glancing at the prices.
What he didn't tell storeowners (``I don't have the heart'') is
that the vases aren't going to be vases much longer. ``They're an
art supply,'' said Coupland, who studied sculpture before taking up
writing. Back home in Vancouver, Coupland will sand the finishes
off the vases, stiffen them with plaster, then join them with metal
rods and an adhesive he called ``shoe-goo'' into Brancusi-like
columns (totems, he calls them), with which he is currently filling
his 1960 post-and-beam house to the point of overcrowding. By Fred
Bernstein.

   PRESIDIO (San Francisco) _ The bugles are silent now. But in
secluded vales of eucalpytus and along once-dusty parade grounds
lined with red-brick Victorians, history still stands watch over
the Presidio, the windswept 1480-acre former Army base wrapped by
the headlands of the Golden Gate Bridge. Since 1994, when this
National Historic Landmark _ about twice the size of Central Park _
became a national park, a novel and controversial experiment in
park planning and historic preservation has been underway at this
200-year-old military garrison that, though part of the city, still

 DAVIS WANTS TO SIGN SMOG-FEE REFUND CHECKS  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis proposed spending millions more
than is necessary to give refunds to motorists who paid illegal
smog impact fees so that his administration _ and not the state
controller's office _ can mail the checks, sources have told The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The action is the latest jab by Davis in his long-running feud
with Controller Kathleen Connell, a fellow Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   At Davis' request, the two bills authorizing the refund for 1.7
million Californians who paid the $300 fee since 1990 would give
the Department of Motor Vehicles nearly $11 million to administer
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bustamante, Davis' press secretary, said the chance for
gubernatorial publicity never even played into Davis' decision to
transfer the check-cutting task to the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most cost-effective way to get it done. There's
less hands involved. That means less costs,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft breakdown of the department's estimated
costs, that $11 million includes 77 employees at a cost of $5.2
million over two years and operating costs of $5.6 million _
$976,519 of which is postage.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative budget writers say the task of mailing out refund
checks is better handled _ at far less cost _ by the state
controller's office, whose primary job is mailing out state checks.
</P>
<P>
   According to controller's office records, it costs that office
about 40 cents to process a claim check. That includes labor,
printing, stuffing, mailing and postage.
</P>
<P>
   Mailing checks to the potential smog-fee refund recipients who
registered out-of-state cars with the DMV after moving to
California would cost the controller $680,000.
</P>
<P>
   The independent legislative analyst's office believes the checks
should be sent out by the controller's office, ``given that
office's expertise in reviewing claims and disbursing revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   The DMV counters that much of its expense is finding the people
eligible for a refund and that operating costs will probably be
lower than estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (cost estimates) are very preliminary. We've already cut
those by more than $750,000 in one area alone,'' said Evan Nossoff,
a DMV spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Davis decided in November to refund the money, plus interest,
and has allocated $665 million in his proposed budget to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The move came a few weeks after an appeals court ruled
unconstitutional the $300 fee that must be paid by people who move
to California and register their out-of-state automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The bill containing the funds, AB809, is scheduled to be heard
by the Senate Appropriations Committee Thursday. The two bills that
implement the return of the fee are expected to be on Davis' desk
by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping the job of refunding the fees within his
administration, Davis would be able to sign the checks, a
responsibility usually reserved for the controller.
</P>
<P>
   Among the department's proposed expenditures is a $223,106 media
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may have sold the car. They may have changed addresses.
We need to get the word out to these people,'' Nossoff said.
</P>
<P>
   A new database will also have to be created, at a cost of
$499,999, the department estimates. Paper costs for the computers
is pegged at $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Connell have been at odds since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A performance audit Connell commissioned when she became
controller found that her predecessor, Davis, had committed some
questionable acts, including one on his last day on the job _
allowing a major developer to postpone making a lease payment to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, on the final night of the legislative session, Davis
tried to win passage of bill that would strip Connell of her seat
on the Franchise Tax Board. The bill failed.
</P>
<P>
   After a ``60 Minutes'' segment on fraud within Medi-Cal, the
state's health program for the poor, featured extensive footage of
Connell, Davis proposed in January a major increase in his
administration's Medi-Cal fraud investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Connell had sought more personnel to do the same thing.

KINGS SETTLE FOR TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The sellout crowd Wednesday wasn't sold.
</P>
<P>
   They came to see the Los Angeles Kings move closer to just their
second playoff appearance in seven years and did get a listless 1-1
tie against the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, the Kings would have beaten the Sharks, then
clinched the postseason Saturday against the Mighty Ducks. Instead,
the Staples Center crowd of 18,118 was quiet and so were the Kings
(36-30-11).
</P>
<P>
   The tie gave them 87 points and did move them closer to the
playoffs. If the season ended today, they would finish fifth in the
Western Conference and open the first round against the Detroit Red
Wings.
</P>
<P>
   But what was more surprising was the way the Sharks, who are
clinging to the eighth and final spot, didn't show more fire.
Captain Owen Nolan, who has five goals this season against the
Kings, had just one shot the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, who entered the game third in the league with 85 points
and second in goals (44), was struck in the mouth two games ago
against Vancouver. He has continued to play, he just hasn't scored,
going without a goal for the third straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Kings went 2-0-1 on their recent East Coast
trip, they rarely played inspired after last Thursday's 3-2
overtime victory in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   They came back two days later in Boston and needed three
third-period goals to tie the Bruins. They closed out the trip with
a 4-1 victory against the expansion Atlanta Thrashers, who were
winless in their previous 16 home games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings are playing without Ziggy Palffy and Nelson
Emerson, two of their better offensive threats who could be
sidelined for the final two weeks of the regular season with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy (sprained right shoulder) could be back next week for a
playoff tuneup, but Emerson, who scored one goal in four games
since coming over from Atlanta, might miss the first round with a
broken left index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Without them, the Kings didn't have much offense. Leading scorer
Luc Robitaille, who has 36 goals for the season and three in his
last three games, had just one shot in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rob Blake had the Kings' best scoring chance in
overtime when he skated in on Sharks goaltender Steve Shields and
took a slap shot from in close.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose (32-35-10) had the better of OT, getting five of its 25
shots in the extra session. The best chance was a breakaway by
Vincent Damphousse with 2:30 left.
</P>
<P>
   He intercepted a pass from Bryan Smolinski intended for Blake,
but his shot on Stephane Fiset sailed wide.
</P>
<P>
   A listless first period ended with a flurry when Kelly
Buchberger scored his first goal as a King at 19:18.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Sean O'Donnell set up behind the San Jose net and
pushed a pass in front, where Buchberger beat Shields.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks tied the game midway though the second period on a
goal by Niklas Sundstrom.
</P>
<P>
   With Steve McKenna off for hooking, San Jose pressured Fiset.
Mike Ricci fired from the point and Sundstrom poked in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had a chance to take the lead in the final minute of
the second period. Glen Murray, who had two goals in the comeback
against Boston, made a slick cross-ice pass. Jozef Stumpel was
waiting and fired, but Shields made the stop.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel was at the center of another scoring opportunity early
in the third. Craig Johnson, who has joined Murray on the
reconfigured first line, took a shot that was stopped by the
sprawling Shields.
</P>
<P>
   The puck popped to Stumpel, who was looking at nothing but net.
Shields' only defense was his stick across the goalmouth and he
somehow managed to stop Stumpel's shot on goal.

REPUBLICANS CRITICIZE HILLARY FOR VISIT TO WOMEN'S EVENT IN S.F.
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton came to San
Francisco Wednesday for a women's high-tech event _ but took sharp
criticism from Republicans who charged that her California visits
disguise a glut of taxpayer-funded political fund raising for her
U.S. Senate bid.
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to appear in her official function as
first lady at an event for the San Francisco Women's Technology
Cluster, a high-tech ``incubator'' for female entrepreneurs. But
her three-day California trip was top-heavy with eight political
fund-raisers to benefit her Senate campaign _ all of them out of
the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area alone, she was the guest of honor at two
fund-raisers in private homes Wednesday _ one at the home of Apple
Computer founder Steve Jobs _ both off-limits to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong and unfair of her to use taxpayer money to go
around the country raising funds for her campaign,'' said Clifford
May, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, who called
the practice ``unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Senate campaign staff was decidedly reluctant to
discuss her fund-raising activities this week. It did not return
numerous phone calls from The Chronicle requesting information on
Clinton's campaign events in California.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Dunn, a campaign spokeswoman reached Wednesday, insisted
her office had no idea how many fund raisers Clinton had attended
here _ or what they expected to raise.
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady's own White House schedule listed a nonstop
schedule of such events in such tony California communities as
Beverly Hills and La Jolla after her arrival late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the New York Senate race heating up _ and Clinton appearing
to catch up in the polls with GOP challenger Rudolph Guiliani _ the
apparent reluctance to be forthcoming about her fund-raising
activities could present a thorny problem for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, still under fire for
past fund-raising activities, has attempted to seize the campaign
finance reform issue from Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the California trip underscored the often fuzzy line between
Clinton's official role as first lady and her status as a
candidate. And it illustrated how _ like her husband, President
Clinton _ she has found the nation's most populous state to be a
gold mine of campaign donation checks.
</P>
<P>
   Federal elections records show that the first lady has raised
more than $316,000 from California donors during the current
election cycle. That is almost half as much as U.S. Rep. Tom
Campbell, the South Bay Republican campaigning to unseat California
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has picked up $674,450 from
individual donors in California.
</P>
<P>
   Guiliani has also turned to California as a source of
contributions, raising more than $380,000 from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour roundtable session Wednesday, Clinton met with
top female CEOS to discuss issues of women and technology
Wednesday, among them, Lavonne Luquis of Latino.com, Tiffany Bass
Bukow of Ms.Money.com and Cate Muther of the Women's Technology
Cluster.
</P>
<P>
   As first lady, Clinton dutifully asked about the problems of
business startups, financial challenges and the biases they
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also assured the women she would take their feedback
and ideas ``back to Silicon Alley'' _ a reference to the New York
high-tech industry. And she got a laugh when she asked Kim Fisher,
the CEO of AudioBasket, how to use her product if ``I'm interested
in New York state politics, just to pick a topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Some attendees were even more aggressive in using the
opportunity to push her campaign. ``I'm looking forward to all of
us ensuring her a seat in the Senate as soon as November 2000,''
Mayor Willie Brown told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say such events keenly illustrate how Clinton has
used her first lady status to unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason in the world why she couldn't charter a
campaign plane like other candidates do and pay for it by funds
contributed by willing donors _ rather than taxpayers who have no
choice,'' said May of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in San Francisco Wednesday on an Air Force
plane, but ``she flies on that for security reasons everywhere she
goes,'' said a White House spokeswoman Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's longtime friends and supporters say the GOP criticism
is just the latest example of unfair singling out of the first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be ashamed of themselves. If nothing else, they
should afford respect to the first lady of the United States. She's
doing what she ought to be doing, according to the Secret Service,
to protect her security,'' said Martha Whetstone, a longtime
Democratic activist and family friend of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Chairwa, associate counsel for the president, said that on
a trip that involves campaign activity, the law requires
reimbursement by the campaign at a first-class rate for the first
lady as well as for her staff. She said that would include a trip,
such as the one to San Francisco, which involved both fund raising
and official first lady events.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are being increasingly vocal on the issue,
dubbing her junkets ``Air Hillary,'' and releasing a recent RNC
noting that _ according to the Air Force's own estimates _ it costs
taxpayers as much as $3,705 an hour for the trips.

BRYANT'S 28 POINTS LEAD LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ The ever-streaking Lakers are piling up
victories behind power and grit more than quickness, but it was
their speed that was on display Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   From zero to 60, in just 72 games.
</P>
<P>
   Before the last two days of March could even be crossed off the
wall calendar, the Lakers recorded their 60th win, with a 108-99
victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies at GM Place.
</P>
<P>
   The victory got them to that cherished plateau faster than any
team in franchise history but one _ the 1971-72 Lakers, who did it
in 71 games, and went on to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really happy to have 60 wins this fast,'' said Derek
Fisher. ``I mean, we've won 60 games before, but it seems we've had
to throw in everything and the kitchen sink to get to that point.
And this season it really seems, even though we've really worked
hard, that it came rather easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Never easier than this win, as the Lakers had a 14-point lead by
halftime and never looked back as they swept the season series from
the lowly Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   In the more pressing foot race, the Lakers are close to lapping
the field _ they reduced their magic number for clinching top seed
in the West to four. Any combination of Lakers wins and Portland
losses adding up to four will give the Lakers the prized home-court
advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also won their seventh in a row and their 26th in
their past 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it without one member of their scoring trio, as
Glen Rice stayed home with a stomach virus. But Kobe Bryant's 28
points led six Lakers in double figures, and they overcame one of
their less-memorable defensive showings of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Behind 30 points from Shareef Abdur-Rahim, the Grizzlies shot 54
percent, becoming only the fourth Lakers opponent this season to
hit more than half of its field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just kind of closing down the season. It's hard not to
coast a little bit at this time of the year,'' coach Phil Jackson
said, noting the Lakers' withering magic number. ``It makes it hard
to keep pushing these guys to the limit. They have the confidence
to win and they know how to do the job, and yet we don't feel like
we're playing as well as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a less-than-perfect win gave Jackson a chance to ease
up on Shaquille O'Neal, who played a mere 37 minutes, and in a
subdued performance, finished with 19 points, eight assists and a
four rebounds, matching his season low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was chilling out tonight,'' O'Neal said. ``I was looking to
pass a lot and get everybody else involved. I didn't do too much on
the boards or point-wise, but my teammates, they stuck up for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper scored 13 points and the Lakers got 12 apiece from
Rick Fox (starting in place of Rice) and A.C. Green, playing his
NBA record-extending 1,100th consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Milestones have come and gone quickly this season for the
Lakers, so the 60-win mark passed without much talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to maybe win 65 or maybe even win 70,''
O'Neal said, ``but our main goal is much higher than that. We just
want to do excellent and end up in the playoffs. We're just
preparing ourselves for that now.''
</P>
<P>
   That preparation will include resting O'Neal as much as
possible, resting the other starters and probably putting Harper on
the injured list. But first things first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy we got to 60 wins,'' Jackson said. ``There's
no doubt about the fact we're pleased that we were able to reach
that number. But the concept now is to eliminate Portland as
quickly as possible and move into a space where we can generate,
moderate the time and the effort by each player as he goes out and
plays every night and maintain kind of a level here until the end
of the season.''

BRYANT'S 28 POINTS LEAD LAKERS
</HEADLINE>

By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ The ever-streaking Lakers are piling up
victories behind power and grit more than quickness, but it was
their speed that was on display Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   From zero to 60, in just 72 games.
</P>
<P>
   Before the last two days of March could even be crossed off the
wall calendar, the Lakers recorded their 60th win, with a 108-99
victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies at GM Place.
</P>
<P>
   The victory got them to that cherished plateau faster than any
team in franchise history but one _ the 1971-72 Lakers, who did it
in 71 games, and went on to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really happy to have 60 wins this fast,'' said Derek
Fisher. ``I mean, we've won 60 games before, but it seems we've had
to throw in everything and the kitchen sink to get to that point.
And this season it really seems, even though we've really worked
hard, that it came rather easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Never easier than this win, as the Lakers had a 14-point lead by
halftime and never looked back as they swept the season series from
the lowly Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   In the more pressing foot race, the Lakers are close to lapping
the field _ they reduced their magic number for clinching top seed
in the West to four. Any combination of Lakers wins and Portland
losses adding up to four will give the Lakers the prized home-court
advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also won their seventh in a row and their 26th in
their past 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it without one member of their scoring trio, as
Glen Rice stayed home with a stomach virus. But Kobe Bryant's 28
points led six Lakers in double figures, and they overcame one of
their less-memorable defensive showings of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Behind 30 points from Shareef Abdur-Rahim, the Grizzlies shot 54
percent, becoming only the fourth Lakers opponent this season to
hit more than half of its field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just kind of closing down the season. It's hard not to
coast a little bit at this time of the year,'' coach Phil Jackson
said, noting the Lakers' withering magic number. ``It makes it hard
to keep pushing these guys to the limit. They have the confidence
to win and they know how to do the job, and yet we don't feel like
we're playing as well as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a less-than-perfect win gave Jackson a chance to ease
up on Shaquille O'Neal, who played a mere 37 minutes, and in a
subdued performance, finished with 19 points, eight assists and a
four rebounds, matching his season low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was chilling out tonight,'' O'Neal said. ``I was looking to
pass a lot and get everybody else involved. I didn't do too much on
the boards or point-wise, but my teammates, they stuck up for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper scored 13 points and the Lakers got 12 apiece from
Rick Fox (starting in place of Rice) and A.C. Green, playing his
NBA record-extending 1,100th consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Milestones have come and gone quickly this season for the
Lakers, so the 60-win mark passed without much talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to maybe win 65 or maybe even win 70,''
O'Neal said, ``but our main goal is much higher than that. We just
want to do excellent and end up in the playoffs. We're just
preparing ourselves for that now.''
</P>
<P>
   That preparation will include resting O'Neal as much as
possible, resting the other starters and probably putting Harper on
the injured list. But first things first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy we got to 60 wins,'' Jackson said. ``There's
no doubt about the fact we're pleased that we were able to reach
that number. But the concept now is to eliminate Portland as
quickly as possible and move into a space where we can generate,
moderate the time and the effort by each player as he goes out and
plays every night and maintain kind of a level here until the end
of the season.''

SONICS' THEME: ESCAPE FROM THE 8-HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As the regular season, like the fan base, dwindles, it
is still possible to find something upon which the rare Sonics fan
can hang a hat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only a gerbil hat. But take the rewards as they are
found. Beats ducking a TV remote control.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sonics reach 45 wins, they will have the best record in
the 17-year history of eighth seeds in the NBA postseason
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Yee. Hah.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's not the sort of thing that shuts down Fifth Avenue
for ticker tape (although we could throw a spectacular
concrete-dust parade).
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible that 45 wins would get them the No. 7 spot,
and thus avoid wasting an otherwise lovely spring week banging
around in the armpits of Shaquille O'Neal, a hell whose foulness
defies even Dante and his inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics coach Paul Westphal, normally a man of reticence when it
comes to even harmless candor, owned up to the obvious wretched
fate awaiting a first-round match-up against the top-seeded Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make the playoffs, so we're fighting for
positioning,'' Westphal said after Monday's loss to San Antonio.
``We're like everybody else. We'd rather not play the Lakers.
That's a tall order.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing as No. 8 already is free of gratuitous prestige _ only
nine of the previous 32 eighth seeds have had winning records, the
best being the 44 mark of the 1997 Washington Bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Then to draw what might be the most formidable Western team
since the late-'80s Lakers of Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
and James Worthy, well, the question of pointlessness is hard to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Westphal and president Wally Walker guaranteed in the
preseason the Sonics would return to the playoffs, and they will
(cue up concrete-dust parade, again). Even if Vernon Maxwell hits
Horace Grant with a sofa, there's no way the Sonics fall to No. 9,
their finish last year.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Other than a single home playoff game's ticket
revenues, how much difference is there between missing the playoffs
and going 0-3 in the first round?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Sonics owe it to whomever cares that they claw
their way out of the 8-hole as if it were a pit of vipers and they
are Indiana Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Already visible at nearly every KeyArena home game is the
vacant-seat damage attributable at least in part to a single season
without a playoff win. Two consecutive years of no postseason
victories after six seasons as a Western power represents a decay
beyond the reach of the nation's dentists.
</P>
<P>
   By getting to the seventh or sixth seed, the Sonics draw one
among Utah, San Antonio and suddenly vulnerable Portland. The
Sonics split the four-game season series with the Jazz and Spurs,
and although they are 0-3 against the Blazers, they are still the
Blazers, with the rich tradition of postseason evaporation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, forecasting a No. 7 or No. 6 berth would appear to be a
clutch at straws, given recent evidence. Prior to Wednesday night's
blowout loss to the Knicks, in the last four games against
playoff-bound San Antonio, Utah, Detroit and Portland, the Sonics
led in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They blew all the leads, and the games. At home.
</P>
<P>
   As Westphal put it after the Monday loss, ``We ran out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Acute NBA observers will suggest this is not a good sign,
especially within three weeks of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a lack of depth and previous injuries, Grant, 34, the
Sonics' only forceful big man, is worn down. Gary Payton (aka the
Boxing Glove) is wearing down. The standard opponent defensive
trick is to double-team Payton, the league leader in minutes
played, in the late stages and dare someone else to win the game.
No one has lately.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Spurs, Payton was shut down late, the Sonics missed
14 of 20 field goal attempts in the final period and finished with
a season-low five free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Grant had not been injured playing the referee's
role in Sonic Smackdown Sunday, the result might have been
different. And if the Sonics miss the No. 7 spot by a game, your
search for the single most unnecessary loss of the season might
start with that contest.
</P>
<P>
   The spin out of the Sonic camp is that the Payton-Maxwell dustup
may well have some perversely tonic effect from here on out. The
problem with that theory is if true, by mid-April, Sonics practices
will graduate to dope-slapping sessions broken up by turnbuckle
smashes and airborne TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the final 11 games, starting with current No. 7
seed Sacramento Friday, the Sonics have to find a more functional
way out of the 8-hole, and get to a playoff series where they have
a chance to salvage a little something.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, local hoops fans face an entire off-season of stories
explaining, defending and apologizing for Payton's, ahem,
eccentrism.
</P>
<P>
   I'd prefer a concrete-dust parade.

HOME ACHE CONTINUES FOR LISTLESS SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONADL TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Hanging over Horace Grant's locker was a yellow piece
of paper with big, bold type.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' veteran center had been preaching all week about the
team's sagging disposition. Wednesday, he borrowed a quote by
Charles Swindoll to amplify his point with a sign that partly read:
``Attitude ... is more than the past, more than money, more than
circumstances. ... Life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90
percent how I react.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thing to adapt,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   As profound and somewhat effective as the message was, it was no
antidote for the Sonics, who looked jury-rigged in a 110-95 loss to
the New York Knicks Wednesday night at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' reconditioned posture lasted about four minutes at
the start of the game. New York used the next 44 minutes to hammer
the Sonics into their fifth consecutive loss _ all at home. This is
the first time the Sonics have staggered on such a skid since the
1984-85 season when they dropped six in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest back-breakers was the discrepancy in
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   New York grabbed 57. The Sonics collected just 30 _ one shy of
their season low. In essence, the Sonics, who have been beaten
every way imaginable lately, found another way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   This loss prompted Sonics coach Paul Westphal to tell his team,
``If you're not going to put forth a better effort than that, stay
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Absentee players would only decrease the team's sagging and
increasingly unsympatheic crowd. This was the sixth time in the
past seven games the Sonics fell at KeyArena. Half the crowd
cheered the Knicks, which added to the list of disheartening facts
about the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Sonics brace themselves for the Sacramento Kings, who
visit KeyArena Friday. The Sonics already have lost twice to the
Kings and are 1{ games behind them in eighth place of the Western
Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we gave up. It was effort. There was no
effort,'' Grant said. ``We've got to stop being selfish. Early in
the season when we were moving the ball, we were winning. Now, it's
me, me, me. And that's not going to work around here. If you put
yourself before the team, the team's going to lose. So if we stop
doing that, we might be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, the team in Orlando is not talented. We're a more
talented team. But that team has more heart and determination. Even
when they're down, they play hard. I haven't seen this (lack of
energy) in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup guard Vernon Maxwell, who went 3-for-8 in 15 minutes,
admitted he needed an attitude adjustment and the onus doesn't stop
at his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs to look in the mirror,'' Maxwell said. ``The
effort level could be a lot better than the way we've been playing.
We need to channel our energy in another direction instead of
worrying about shots and minutes. I'm pointing the finger at
myself. I've got to get myself right.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sonics started the game with fire a day after what
was described as the most spirited practice of the season. They
jumped on the Knicks with a 15-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   However, the early blaze burned out like a match. New York
doused the Sonics' fast start with a 12-0 offensive spurt, and the
first quarter ended in a 30-30 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks slowly overpowered the Sonics from there.
</P>
<P>
   New York held a 28-18 rebounding edge by halftime and dominated
the offensive glass. Overall, the Knicks had 18 offensive rebounds.
They shot 43 of 82 (52 percent), and essentially recovered almost
half their misses.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby provided spark off the Knicks' bench with 18 points
and a career-high 19 boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' starting frontline amassed just 11 rebounds. Grant
and Vin Baker each had four. Ruben Patterson finished with three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do our job,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 59-49 at halftime, the Sonics seemed
anxious.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took an 84-71 advantage into the final frame. A pair
of Rashard Lewis 3-pointers got the Sonics within 85-79. But New
York never lost control and eventually led 102-82 with 4:18 left in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown we can win games,'' said Westphal, referring to
the Sonics' 40-31 record. ``We've just got to find a formula to
make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of a couch.

TIE PUTS KINGS ONE STEP CLOSER
</HEADLINE>
 ... WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Success is measured this time of year by cut lips
and missing teeth. Ties bring smiles. So does a good forecheck.
</P>
<P>
   Fans shouldn't feel let down by the Kings' 1-1 tie with the San
Jose Sharks on Wednesday night at Staples Center. If they do it
again Saturday afternoon against the Mighty Ducks, the Kings will
be in the playoffs for just the second time in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Kings have two losses and two ties against the
Ducks and were 1-5 a year ago. But this time, a repeat of
Wednesday's game will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the way it is at this point in the season,''
defenseman Mattias Norstrom said. ``Nothing fancy. Nobody wants to
be the one that messes up with so much at stake. We feel we are
getting close, but we are taking nothing for granted. The little
things will get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The little things Wednesday were strong defense and a first-
period goal by newcomer Kelly Buchberger, brought here from Atlanta
to direct traffic in heavy-handed games like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why we got him,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``And
tonight we had 19 other Buchbergers playing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as important was the close watch the Kings put on
Sharks captain Owen Nolan, who had five goals against them this
season. Nolan, second in the league with 44 goals, had just one
shot before leaving in the second period with an injured left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the kind of game played in the middle of the ice,''
Buchberger's linemate, Bob Corkum, said. ``It was a very
tight-checking game. There are five games left and that is the way
it is going to be the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Kings went 2-0-1 on their recent East Coast
trip, it has become clear that offense is at a premium, especially
without Ziggy Palffy and the other Kings newcomer, Nelson Emerson,
both out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy (sprained right shoulder) could be back next week for a
playoff tuneup, but Emerson, who scored one goal in four games
since coming over from Atlanta, might miss the first round with a
broken left index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Without them, the Kings don't have much firepower. Leading
scorer Luc Robitaille, who has 36 goals for the season and three in
his last three games, had just two shots in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rob Blake had the Kings' best scoring chance in
overtime when he skated in on Sharks goaltender Steve Shields just
20 seconds in and took a slap shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose (32-35-10), which has the eighth and final playoff spot
in the West, had the better of OT, getting five of its 25 shots in
the extra session. The Sharks' best chance was a breakaway by
Vincent Damphousse with 2:30 left. He intercepted a pass from Bryan
Smolinski intended for Blake, but his shot on Stephane Fiset sailed
wide.
</P>
<P>
   A listless first period ended with a flurry when Buchberger
scored his first goal as a King at 19:18.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Sean O'Donnell set up behind the San Jose net and
pushed a pass in front, where Buchberger beat Shields.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks tied the game midway though the second period on a
goal by Niklas Sundstrom. With Steve McKenna off for hooking, San
Jose pressured Fiset. Mike Ricci fired from the point and Sundstrom
poked in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had a chance to take the lead in the final minute of
the second period. Glen Murray, who had two goals in Saturday's
comeback against Boston, made a slick cross-ice pass. Jozef Stumpel
was waiting and fired, but Shields made the stop.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel was at the center of another scoring opportunity early
in the third. Craig Johnson, who has joined Murray on the
reconfigured first line, took a shot that was stopped by the
sprawling Shields.
</P>
<P>
   The puck popped to Stumpel, who was looking at nothing but net.
Shields' only defense was his stick across the goalmouth and he
somehow managed to stop Stumpel's shot on goal.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Bronski watched sales of his first book wither to 75
copies a year, kept alive only by a few protective editors who
refused to let the bottom line overtake the written word.
</P>
<P>
   But just as ``Culture Clash'' was poised to go out of print
anyway, a new technology, called Publishing On Demand, came along
and offered the Cambridge, Mass. author every writer's dream:
immortality.
</P>
<P>
   In its incarnation, ``Culture Clash,'' which first appeared in
1984, now has no cover, no pages, and appears in no bookshops. In
fact, it's just a series of ones and zeroes in a computer that sits
in a warehouse outside Nashville. Today, the book is available
solely through Internet bookstores, and reenters the physical world
only when a customer orders it, at which time the computer prints
it, binds it, and ships it out.
</P>
<P>
   Bronski calls the new ``POD'' technology a ``godsend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When on-demand publishing came along, it was wonderful,''
Bronski said. ``It created a middle ground where books that are
perceived to have some worth and some faint hope of future selling
power can remain available.''
</P>
<P>
   Megabestseller Stephen King made headlines this month by
publishing his latest work in electronic form, with computer and
Palm Pilot users gobbling it up. But for the majority of authors,
the foot soldiers of publishing, POD is blunting the edge of one of
capitalism's most cutthroat industries, even as some critics
express concern that it will flood the market with lousy books.
</P>
<P>
   Half literary cryogenics and half editorial life-support, POD is
being called ``revolutionary'' by everyone from bookstore
executives to editors, unknown authors to bibliophiles because it
allows publishers to store and print books for a fraction of what
it once cost.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, POD has opened a promising new route for
aspiring authors to gain fame, by allowing them to self-publish
quickly and cheaply, then sell their volumes at popular Internet
bookstores such as Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   But if POD is changing the literary landscape, it is doing so in
wildly unpredictable fashion. Some publishers and authors _ never
the best of friends to begin with _ now accuse one another of
taking unfair advantage of the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Others complain that POD books are substandard. Still others
complain that POD will subvert a useful process in which critics
and publishers weeded out substandard works and guided readers to
works of quality.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many are debating whether the brave new future will
be as rosy as the good old days of sell or die.
</P>
<P>
   For Bronski, there's no debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to overstate my case, but there is nothing more
thrilling than knowing my book will be available for readers
throughout the foreseeable future,'' Bronski said. ``That's not how
things go in publishing. Only Agatha Christie and Stephen King got
that treatment before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronski was not exaggerating the dire odds most authors face. Of
the 61,000 new titles published in the United States annually,
50,000 of them, both paperbacks and tomes, end up in the literary
graveyard, victims of weak sales, a lack of promotion, and
sometimes, bad writing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the estimated 10,000 books that have gone POD in recent
years _ with another 1,500 being added monthly _ several are works
by ``important'' authors. Victor Navasky's ``Kennedy Justice,'' a
profile of Robert F. Kennedy's years as US attorney general and a
National Book Award nominee, is one of them. Others include volumes
by Mary McCarthy and Thornton Wilder, as well as bestsellers by
one-hit wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Still more POD books are the forgotten novels and textbooks that
sociologists, historians, and anthropologists rely on, works that
open a window into the era from which they emerged. Another trend
in POD: university presses are embracing the technology en masse,
saying it allows them to continue producing works of limited
interest that otherwise would have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear about what POD can do, it's thrilling,'' says
Paul Aiken, executive director of the Authors Guild, which
represents more than 8,000 writers.
</P>
<P>
   The Authors Guild has been at the forefront of the POD
revolution. In the next few weeks, 100 books that had gone out of
print will come back to life, thanks to the guild's
Backinprint.com, which is helping authors or their estates revive
forgotten works. Another 300 titles will follow shortly afterward,
Aiken said.
</P>
<P>
   But if many books in the burgeoning POD library make a good
argument for the technology, others do the opposite. In the past
few months, hundreds of unknown authors, with questionable writing
talent, have gone to fledgling POD publishers such as iuniverse.com
and 1stbooks.com, handed them several hundred dollars, and created
``books.'' Unlike the so-called vanity presses of old, the POD
publishers offer unknown authors something never before available:
a spot on the virtual shelves of Internet bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Azzolina, a former bank executive who lives in
Charlestown, recently published a mystery novel called ``Suicide
Inc.'' with 1stbooks, one of the most popular POD houses. Although
``Suicide Inc.'' ranks 1,784,179th on Amazon.com's list, the fact
that his book is available at all shows POD is a sure thing,
Azzolina said. Readers will judge for themselves if the book is a
good one, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had three agents and been close to sales with Putnam,
Viking, and Mysterious Press; I've paid my dues with the big
boys,'' Azzolina said. ``This is not an industry willing to take
chances and bring new authors along. If we as authors are going to
make things happen, we have to do it ourselves. POD, if done
properly, is the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   How readers will ever find ``Suicide Inc.'' in the sea of
available reading, no one knows. Book critics still regard
self-published books with skepticism, if not contempt, and the new
POD phenomenon has done little to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional publishing route seems like a good
gatekeeper,'' said Charles McGrath, editor of the New York Times
Book Review. McGrath said the Times, as well as most major sources
of reviews, avoid self-published books for two reasons: lack of
quality and lack of availability.
</P>
<P>
   The latter reason, McGrath said, may no longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't known this was going on,'' McGrath said of the
partnerships between Internet booksellers and POD publishers. ``It
seems one of our rationales is eroding.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say POD may erode the power structure of publishing as
well. Traditionally, the rights to a book have reverted back to
authors when a book went out of print. Thanks to POD, however,
several publishers are now creating digital versions of books, and
refusing to return them.
</P>
<P>
   While many publishers are now rewriting contracts to
specifically address the POD issue, thousands of authors who signed
contracts in the past several years are now finding that they may
never regain the rights to their books.
</P>
<P>
   That has authors crying foul. Recently, the National Writers
Union warned its members that POD poses ``a serious threat to the
rights of authors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two-edged sword,'' said Frank Romano, a professor of
digital printing at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
``On-demand publishing makes it easier for publishers to not give
up books. But at the same time, it makes it easier for authors to
avoid publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who wins the power struggle, few argue that POD
books have a long way to go before they resemble those created by
more traditional printing methods. Right now, POD books come only
in soft-cover, and photos can only be reproduced in black and
white. Cover art, too, seems to have lost its cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give my POD copies to business acquaintances,'' Brodski
says.
</P>
<P>
   As the technology gets better, though, there's a good chance
that the peculiar social dilemma Brodski now endures will be a
thing of the past. Steve Riggio, vice chairman of
BarnesandNoble.com, says he foresees a day when every bookshop in
America will have a small, POD machine, so customers will never
have to leave the store empty-handed because their favorite book
was out of stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is the democratization of publishing,'' Riggio
said. ``When something is that important, the quality follows.''

 Medical Data in a Doctor's Palm  
 By Benny Evangelista   
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last week, a young patient came to Dr. Charles
Shaefer with a miserable cold and heavy congestion. Shaefer was
about to prescribe an antibiotic but then remembered the young
man's dermatologist had prescribed acne medicine that might not
react well with the antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   So to check, the veteran Georgia physician reached into his
pocket for a Palm loaded with a prescription drug reference program
made by ePocrates Inc. of San Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lo and behold, the drug I was going to give him could have
caused increased pressure on the brain, not the kind of thing you
want when you're trying to treat a cold,'' Shaefer said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaefer, like many physicians, is not easily won over by new
gadgets. But in the past three months, Shaefer says he has come to
think of ePocrates and his stethoscope as his two most
indispensable medical tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to two or three times a day, I feel like I have made better
decisions because I have consulted the ePocrates program,'' said
Shaefer, an internal and critical care medicine specialist for
University Hospital in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old ePocrates Inc. has spent only about $3,000 for
marketing so far. But an estimated 34,000 people, about 70 percent
of whom are doctors, have downloaded the free program since
ePocrates made it available on its Internet site in October. The
firm is gaining about 2,000 new users a week by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've recommended it to 10 other physicians,'' said Dr. Joshua
Rassen, co-founder of Brown and Toland Medical Group in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a delegate at a California Medical Association meeting
and I showed it to three of the other delegates, and the reaction
was pretty much the same: `That's cool, where'd you get it?'''
</P>
<P>
   EPocrates is one of more than a dozen companies trying to
develop and market wireless technology that gives doctors access to
prescription drug data and electronic prescription writing using
devices like a Palm, handheld PC, notebook or smart pager.
</P>
<P>
   Public pressure is building to reduce the number of prescription
errors. The national Institute of Medicine released a study last
year that said there were 7,000 deaths annually from medication
errors. The institute and the Clinton administration have called on
the health care industry to slash the number of errors.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like iScribe Inc. of San Mateo, ePhysicians Inc. in
Mountain View and Allscripts Inc. of Libertyville, Ill., are making
handheld prescription drug reference and writing systems. They have
become ``a hot area within the health care industry,'' said analyst
Richard Lee, managing director for Wit Soundview in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But none so far has the number of users claimed by ePocrates in
such a short time. For example, Allscripts says it has about 10,000
physicians at 3,000 sites in the United States using its system,
which works on a Hewlett-Packard Journada or Windows CE device. And
ePhysician said the 120 physicians using its system have written
12,000 electronic prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said ePocrates seems to be gaining acceptance
because it has taken a different tack by not trying to convince
doctors to scrap their centuries-old practice of writing
prescriptions on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians are a notoriously tough bunch to get to switch
their work (habits),'' said Claudine Singer, a senior analyst with
the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ePocrates is trying to build a large network of doctors
by luring them with an easy Palm program that provides background
information, dosage levels and potential problems for 1,500
commonly prescribed drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The program is downloaded from the Internet and transferred into
a standard Palm. The data can be updated daily with new information
about existing drugs or about new drugs that are constantly coming
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors like Shaefer and Rassen say the program allows them to
spend more time with patients and less time leafing through the
small type in a standard drug reference book like the Physicians'
Desk Reference. The 1999 edition of the book is 3,477 pages and
about 4 inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a fairly high volume, about four patients an hour,''
said Rassen. ``Anything that saves one or two or three minutes is
enormously valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 26 years as a physician, Rassen resisted using gadgets
like a Palm until he learned about ePocrates from his son in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can't quite see doing without it,'' Rassen said. ``It's
become something of a necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, doctors who are using ePocrates are reporting
to the company that they are making fewer prescription errors and
providing better patient care, said Dr. Thomas Lee, a co-founder of
ePocrates who edits the drug database.
</P>
<P>
   The 130 doctors surveyed by the company said they were each
making about 1.2 fewer errors in dosage per week and slightly under
one error per week for side effects and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who has all but given up a medical practice to devote his
time to ePocrates, admits those numbers are unscientific and that
there has yet to be a formal study of ePocrates' effectiveness. But
he found it significant that the doctors were admitting they were
avoiding any errors at all.
</P>
<P>
   Co-founder Dr. Richard Fiedotin, who also switched from medicine
to business, said the company hopes to build a network of loyal
users and then gradually introduce them to other services, such as
electronic prescription writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take them up the technology ladder one rung at a time,''
Fiedotin said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiedotin said the company hopes to make money through partners
who will sponsor distribution of hardware and software, but did not
want to reveal what kinds of new services the firm plans to roll
out in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the competition is just starting to heat up. About
30,000 doctors have registered their interest in subscribing to
ePhysician's Palm-based services, which the company began selling
last week after eight months of tests, said company founder Dr.
Stuart Weisman.
</P>
<P>
   For $20 a month, doctors can, for example, use a Palm to check
drug doses and patient information. The doctor can then send an
electronic prescription through a standard Internet browser to the
patient's pharmacy with a couple of taps on his Palm, eliminating
the age-old problem of bad physician handwriting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman said interest in ePhysician is strong. For example,
Weisman said he signed up 268 doctors in five hours last week at a
cardiologists' convention where surveys showed 98 percent of the
attendees already owned Palms.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jupiter's Singer called ePocrates' early success
impressive, she said it is too early to proclaim anyone a leader in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all so nascent, the landscape is so unformed that I'm not
entirely convinced any player you list won't be blown out of the
water by another player that has yet to show its hand,'' Singer
said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said it is only a matter of time before the majority of
the nation's 600,000 physicians start using drug prescription
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The movement may be fed by the current crop of medical students
who are downloading programs like ePocrates into their Palm units.
</P>
<P>
   Shaefer, also an associate professor at the Medical College of
Georgia in Augusta, learned of ePocrates from one of his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had several other Palm-based medical programs that purported
to do a variety of things, from math calculations to keeping track
of patient records and so forth,'' Shaefer said. ``All of those
things were interesting, but they really didn't do anything that I
didn't already do in some other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But now his pocket-size drug reference is ``prodding me to
practice a higher standard of care,'' he said.

RESEARCH TEAM CREATING NEW COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Racing ahead of the most optimistic projections, a team of
American computer researchers and chemists have quietly formed a
company trying to open a new era of digital electronics by creating
immensely powerful computing circuits based on trillions of
individual building blocks, each no larger than a single molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The potential commercialization of the technology _ thought to
have vast potential, but generally believed to be at least a half a
decade or decade in the future _ has surprised computer industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Molecular Electronics Corp., was incorporated in
December and opened its first office in Chicago in January. Its
founding scientists are some of the leading researchers in a still
immature field that might someday replace today's
multibillion-dollar chip manufacturing factories with pure chemical
processes growing tiny electronic circuits into vast arrays that
make huge memory systems and perhaps powerful parallel computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Silicon Valley view this as off the fringe,'' said
James Ellen, a molecular electronics researcher at Mitre Corp.
While he did not have detailed knowledge of the progress made by
the Molecular Electronics team, he said, researchers in the field
have been making significant progress in recent years, and he would
not be shocked by early commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   The founding scientists of the new company include three
chemists, a theoretical physicist and an electrical engineer from
some of the nation's most prestigious universities and research
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The company has obtained substantial initial financing from
private investors and has hired a chief executive, Harvey Plotnick.
In interviews this week the company's executives said that while
they had still not built a working prototype, they believed they
had solved all of the difficult research obstacles and would be
able to create working models in 18 to 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already achieved initial results, and we'll move from
there and show people these are really doable things,'' said Mark
Reed, co-founder and chief technology officer of the new company.
Reed is chairman of the electrical engineering department of Yale
University and said he planned to continue in his academic
position.
</P>
<P>
   He was also an author of a November 1999 article in Science
magazine with a Rice University chemistry professor, James Tour,
that described the creation of a single molecule switch, a basic
component of any future system that might be created using chemical
processes known as self-assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Tour is a co-founder of the new company. The group also includes
chemists at Pennsylvania State University, who have done pioneering
work in self-assembly and the creation of so-called nanowires, and
Brosl Hasslacher, a theoretical physicist.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group has refused to say what its first product or
prototype might be, the inclusion of Hasslacher, who has done
pioneering work in parallel computing, suggests that it might be
aiming higher than simply creating ultrahigh-capacity computer
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to the company said that the first
prototypes would be memory devices and that Molecular Electronics
researchers had already succeeded in the laboratory in creating
arrays of molecule-sized switches from which information can be
stored and retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   This achievement, if it has indeed occurred, has not been
publicly announced.
</P>
<P>
   The molecular computing technology, which has been given the
name moletronics by a Pentagon official, is based on a radically
different manufacturing technique from the one used to build
today's semiconductor chips.
</P>
<P>
   A principal obstacle to Moore's Law, which states that the the
number of transistors that can be etched on a sliver of silicon
doubles every 18 months, is the exponential increase in the cost of
new factories. Currently Intel Corp., the world's largest
chipmaker, is spending more than $2 billion for each new factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working with laboratory beakers,'' Hasslacher said.
Molecular Electronics researchers are making the molecular
structures relatively inexpensively inside a laboratory. Such a
huge cost saving could give the products of the fledgling industry
a chance against the powerful semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the researchers' optimism, all those involved in the
start-up acknowledge major challenges. One is that molecular
memories and other computing systems are likely to have far more
faulty components than today's semiconductors. Thus, ways must be
found to map out bad circuits and at the same time take advantage
of billions of circuits that function correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Molecular Electronics is not the first company to try to
commercialize the new technology. In 1997, California Molecular
Electronics Corp. was created to pursue similar efforts in the
field. Last year the company received a National Science Foundation
grant to pursue the development of components of a molecular-scale
switching device. In February, California Molecular issued a $6
million direct public offering via the Internet.

WEB SITES FOR THE SIMPLE-MINDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOE QUEENAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On O2Simplify, a Web site devoted to streamlining daily life,
there is a guide to planning a New Year's Eve Party that contains
62 tips, not one of them ``Buy more tequila.'' There is also a
guide to starting a rock band that includes 18 hints like: ``Obtain
your instrument, learn the basics and don't forget tuning!''
Clearly, the online simplification industry has a ways to go before
it is ready to offer the public a truly indispensable product.
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity has evolved into a secular religion for affluent
Americans in recent years, making a likable but neurotic class of
people feel even more uncomfortable with themselves. At heart,
simplicity buffs yearn for an earlier, simpler time when people did
not have BMWs, villas in Tuscany and 401K retirement plans, because
they had simplified their lives by being poor. Since no one these
days actually wants to give up the villas in Tuscany or be poor,
the alternative is to read books and magazine articles about how
simple life would be if only it weren't so complicated. Clinically,
this is best described as vicarious Shakerism.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophically, the simplicity movement derives from the belief
that if one could only reduce paperwork, one's children would be
less annoying. Because the simplicity movement seeks to quell an
appetite that can only be sated by doing less eating, and proceeds
from the flawed assumption that material supplied by journalists
can help simplify anything, it is probably doomed. But before it
fizzles, it will almost certainly manage to support a number of
content-driven, advertising-laden Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Two addresses worthy of attention are RealSimple.com and
O2Simplify.com, a feature provided by Oxygen, the Web site devoted
to women and those who think like them. RealSimple.com is the
official Web site of the magazine with the name Real Simple. As
such, it will offer not only sample articles from the magazine, but
it will also operate chat rooms where les nouveaux simples can talk
about simple things in a simple way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, RealSimple.com, the Web page, explains that Real
Simple, the magazine, will show how to ``create family rituals that
make lasting memories.'' In the past, this might have meant eating
together or going to Chip's lacrosse game. But now it seems the
whole family might want to log on to the RealSimple.com chat room
every evening and talk with other people about reducing clutter and
creating ``islands of calm.'' When the kids grow up they can
reminisce about family rituals like e-mailing complete strangers
with the toll-free numbers of credit card companies that do not
charge annual fees.
</P>
<P>
   O2Simplify is a more complicated simplification tool, consisting
of innumerable lists. Also, there is a certain class bias. For
example, in a section devoted to hiring a nanny, O2Simplify
suggests buying surveillance equipment, but it never once mentions
learning a foreign language so one might actually be able to chat
with the person who is raising your kids. And 02Simplify totally
ignores the nanny's needs, perhaps assuming that nannies who wish
to simplify their own lives can visit Oxygen4Nannies.com, which,
alas, does not yet exist.
</P>
<P>
   None of the foregoing is meant to suggest that simplicity sites
are useless, trendy or foolish. O2Simplify's iconoclastic guide to
simplifying St. Patrick's Day (no booze) is a welcome addition to
the science of streamlining, and RealSimple.com, the Web site,
enables visitors to send friends gift subscriptions to Real Simple,
the magazine, always a nice surprise for anyone expecting another
three years of Industry Week in her Christmas stocking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that online simplicity remains so complicated
that a few navigational guides are needed. Here then are 10 ways to
simplify the use of simplicity Web sites:
</P>
<P>
   1) Get rid of all but one of your credit cards so you won't have
to read any more articles online about getting rid of all but one
of your credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   2) Stop being fat; simplicity and pudginess are mutually
exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   3) Stop having parties, thereby saving eight weeks a year not
reading articles online about how to throw a party.
</P>
<P>
   4) Get better-looking. A considerable amount of online
simplification material is devoted to improving your looks, which
you wouldn't have to read about if you weren't so plain.
</P>
<P>
   5) Hire a nanny to raise your kids, eliminating the need to read
online articles about child rearing. Tell your nanny to e-mail you
reports of the kids' progress, preferably in a language you speak.
</P>
<P>
   6) If a guide to simplifying something contains more than 60
helpful hints, accept the fact that some things cannot be
simplified.
</P>
<P>
   7) Unless you are, in fact, ``quirky,'' never click on links to
quirky materials.
</P>
<P>
   8) Get rid of half your friends, creating more time to visit
simplicity Web sites. Tell your ex-friends to do the same. If
everyone in America had fewer friends, life would be much simpler.
</P>
<P>
   9) Move to Nebraska. You can read the article in Real Simple,
the magazine, about why you should move to Nebraska later. But if
you really want to simplify your life now, just pack up and go.
</P>
<P>
   10) Hire a college student or impoverished senior to visit
simplicity Web sites during the day and prepare a precis of all the
ways you can make your life simpler. Better yet, let the nanny do
it.

Yearning to become one with a computer 
By Jay Bookman  
c.2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kevin Warwick wants to connect with his computer. And
he thinks that other people will want that connection as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sort of feel it in this century,'' says Warwick, a
professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading in England.
``There's a buzz about it and a willingness to accept this kind of
thing that you wouldn't have seen if people had read about it 10
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection that Warwick yearns for is physical. Sometime
next year, surgeons will implant a glass-enclosed, 1-inch computer
circuit in Warwick's upper left arm. The circuit will be tied
directly into the nerve bundle that runs from Warwick's brain into
his arm and down to his left hand. In effect, the implanted circuit
will act as a wiretap, monitoring his body's electric signals and
transmitting them wirelessly to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The new implant will be a more sophisticated version of a chip
that was implanted in Warwick's arm for nine days in 1998. Warwick
expects to keep the second implant for as long as two weeks, and he
has ambitious research plans to pursue. For example, he wants to
give himself a sixth sense: sonar, the navigational system employed
by bats, porpoises and submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Warwick, 46, plans to carry a portable sonar system on his chest
and allow the system to send electric signals to the chip implanted
in his arm. The chip will in turn relay those sonar signals to
Warwick's brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll feel that electronic signal in my body somewhere,
although I'm not sure how,'' he predicts. ``So when I look around
and see something in front of me, I will also be feeling the data
input from the sonar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I will train myself how to interpret that data, so
that when I have my eyes closed, people will be able to put things
in front of me and I'll be able to tell if anything is there, just
as a bat can. It will be like adding an extra sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Warwick's wife, Irena, may also be equipped with a wireless
implant, allowing the two to exchange bodily data via the Internet.
Since emotions also are expressed in electric currents in the body,
Warwick expects the implants to pick up pain, boredom, joy, sexual
arousal and other feelings and to communicate that data from one
spouse to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can change who you are and who you think you are,'' he says
of the implants. ``We will not be merely human, but something
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic implants are finding other applications, with
apparently willing human subjects. Gen-Etics, an Italian company,
offers to implant a special computer chip in the bodies of
celebrities, business people and others who might be targets of
kidnapping. When activated, the chip becomes a human version of the
Lojack system for recovery of stolen cars. The kidnap victim's
location can be pinpointed by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   According to company spokesmen, the technology was developed by
Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. They claim that more than
40 people have been equipped with the chip, although they decline
for security reasons to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers, meanwhile, are implanting special monitors
in patients who are prone to congestive heart failure. Once the
system is operational, information about the heart's performance
will be sent daily from the patient's body through the Internet to
a doctor's office, where the data will be monitored for
abnormalities. Other researchers are implanting a form of
electronic pacemaker in human brains to help treat epilepsy.
Similar brain implants also are being tested as a way to treat
severe depression.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such scenarios have raised concerns about
privacy and about the eventual use of implanted chips by
governments and others to monitor individuals. For example, law
enforcement officials could use implanted chips to monitor sexual
arousal in those previously convicted of sex crimes. Warwick
himself has warned that a direct link between brain and computer
could lead to computer control of human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that concern, Warwick plans an experiment that would
give a computer temporary control over his fingers
</P>
<P>
   ``When I move my hand or finger, the implant will pick up those
electric signals and send them straight away to the computer,''
where they'll be recorded, Warwick notes. Later, he plans to see
what happens when the computer replays that recorded signal into
his central nervous system. He expects that the signal sent by the
computer will cause his hand or fingers to move involuntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we link up more and more closely with technology,'' Warwick
says, ``we will see a conflict between those who are human and
those who have become superhuman. Some of us will have extra
senses, a superior ability to communicate, access to far greater
processing power, the ability to think part machine, part human.
Your power will come with being a node in a computer network,
rather than the individual that we are.''

Meld of mind, machine may transform our lives 
By Jay Bookman  
c.2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The future has many birthplaces. Part of it is
taking shape in the cramped and cluttered laboratory of John
Chapin.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin and his team wired the brains of lab rats directly to a
computer, giving the animals an ability unknown to human beings.
</P>
<P>
   When the rats got thirsty, they would use a robotic arm to bring
them water. That kind of task has become almost second nature to
lab rats, but these particular animals did it with flair. They
operated the device with their minds alone, moving it merely by
thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people first heard about this work, I'd get e-mails
wondering whether people could use a mind-controlled robot to mow
their lawns,'' jokes Chapin, a neurobiologist. ``But my mind worked
differently. I was thinking about a robot that could bring me a
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   By physically linking a living brain to a computer and then
allowing the two to communicate, Chapin has broken down an
important barrier between the animate and inanimate worlds. In a
step that sounds like something out of science fiction, he also has
given a living mind the power to directly affect the outside world
without having to use the body in which it is housed.
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly a lone researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of scientists around the world, working quietly in
fields as varied as linguistics, biology, chaos and robotics, are
in their own ways blurring the boundaries that once separated
``wetware'' _ the living brain _ from the hardware of silicon-based
computers. At the furthest frontier, some scientists are even
building computers out of living brain cells, literally fusing
silicon with life itself.
</P>
<P>
   Their research represents a looming revolution, the next
world-changing generation in computer science. It promises to
produce computers that seem much more human and lifelike, and less
like machines. It also will transform the relationship between
human beings and computers. They won't be tools that we operate
with our hands, as we do a hammer or a car. Instead they will
become almost a part of us, intimately linked to our minds and
bodies and greatly augmenting human abilities to think and
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   At Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, for example, the
military's Alternative Control Technology Laboratory has
experimented with systems that allow pilots to ``fly by thought.''
By controlling their brain waves, human subjects at the laboratory
can steer a flight simulator left or right, up or down, a skill
that most people at the lab master in only an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Kevin Warwick, a cybernetics professor at the
University of Reading, had a computer chip surgically implanted in
his left arm two years ago. The chip communicated by radio waves
with the computer that runs Warwick's office building and in
essence made Warwick a living node in the computer's network. The
computer monitored the professor's passage into and around the
building, opening doors for him, turning on his computer as he
approached, even greeting him by name as he walked through the
front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (experience) changed my mind-set quite a bit,'' Warwick
says. ``I felt as if the computer became a part of me, and I became
a part of the computer. And I was quite comfortable with that.
There was an affinity there.''
</P>
<P>
   When the implant was removed after nine days, Warwick recalls
feeling an odd sense of disappointment at being disconnected from
the network. He is planning to repeat the experiment next year,
this time with a more sophisticated implant capable of a wider
range of communications. Among other things, he plans to use the
device to give himself a sixth sense, in addition to the five given
him by nature.
</P>

   With a computer chip in his arm, Warwick refers to himself as a
cyborg. The term was coined in the '60s by NASA scientists and has
since become a staple of science fiction novels and movies. In a
cyborg, computer hardware has become so much a part of a human
being that it creates a new species _ part machine, part human _
with impressive new powers. The title character of the movie
``RoboCop''would fit that definition, as would the Borgs in the
``Star Trek'' TV series.
</P>
<P>
   However, some theorists in computer science argue that cyborgs
are not some sci-fi fantasy and already walk among us by the
millions. They believe that a person with a cell phone and beeper
on his belt and a Palm Pilot in his hand has attained cyborg
status.
</P>
<P>
   To many others, that's still a stretch. They see their
electronic gizmos as tools, not as an integral part of themselves.
But the cyborg description will become far less strained if
researchers in the growing field of wearable computing are proven
right. They are trying to tear down the second major barrier
between human beings and their electronic assistants: the size and
weight of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first modern computer _ ENIAC, for the Electronic
Numerical Integrator and Computer _ was built in 1946 just a few
miles south of Chapin's lab in Philadelphia. ENIAC consisted of
almost 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 30 tons and took up 1,800
square feet. Since then, computers have gotten a lot smaller,
lighter and more powerful. IBM's Thinkpad laptop is 30,000 times
faster than ENIAC; at barely 6 pounds, it is also 10,000 times
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   As that trend continues, computers will become extremely
portable and powerful. Human beings won't need a computer chip
implanted in their body to experience the intimate relationship
with computers described by Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, every morning they would don a lightweight, unobtrusive
computer just as they now slip on a wristwatch or tuck a wallet in
their pocket. That computer would give them full-time wireless
access to the Internet and to other human beings equipped with
wearables, as well as to e-mail, cell phone and other services. At
no waking moment would they be disconnected. Like Warwick in his
office building, they would become individual nodes connected full
time to a vast computer network, but in this case the network would
be shared by millions of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Wearables are already used in the military and industry. Through
its high-tech Land Warrior program, the U.S. Army will equip a
platoon of soldiers with wearable systems for war-fighting
exercises this summer. It plans to deploy 34,000 units in the field
within the next few years. Businesses are buying wearables to let
employees who are out of the office or on the factory floor have
fast, easy access to a computer database or the Internet. As the
wearable product is refined through research and experience,
companies hope to eventually produce the units for sale and use as
a consumer product.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mann, a pioneer in wearable computing and a professor at
the University of Toronto, has been building and using his own
wearable computers since he was a high school student in Canada.
Like Warwick, he calls himself a cyborg. In fact, Mann says that in
the 20 years he has worn computers, he has experienced a powerful
synergy between human being and silicon, which he calls
``humanistic intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, the human being and computer become elements
of each other's feedback loop,'' Mann explains. ``They support and
extend each other and create something new.''
</P>
<P>
   If cyborgs such as Mann represent the human being augmented with
machinelike powers, they have a close counterpart in the inanimate
world _ the machine equipped with humanlike powers. That's the
third major barrier now under attack: making computers more like
people.
</P>
<P>
   To some researchers, giving computers a more human ``feel'' is a
way to make the computers friendlier and less intimidating to
users. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are
working on ``affective computing'' _ computing that uses human
emotion as a tool. If the computer senses its human user getting
exasperated or angry, for example, it might employ the same
frustration-reducing tactics that a human co-worker would use. It
might apologize or suggest that the user take a break for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, software engineers are creating humanlike characters
that are capable of interacting with human beings, asking and
answering questions, commenting on the weather, even flirting. They
are like robots, but without physical bodies. Instead of operating
in the physical world, they will live and work on the Internet,
serving as guides and hosts on commercial Web sites. The characters
are programmed to have personal histories and individual quirks,
just like human beings, and according to their creators are
``emotionally and socially intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, that illusion of humanity is still crude. Steer
the conversation away from a software creature's programming and
its artificial nature quickly becomes apparent. The irony is, it
probably doesn't matter. The human subconscious turns out to be
easily fooled by anything that seems the slightest bit human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that people relate with the computer is fundamentally
social,'' says Clifford Nass of Stanford University, who has
conducted considerable research in human-computer interaction. ``We
treat computers as if they were people. Everyone knows it's a
machine. No one thinks a computer is a person. But subconsciously
they can't help treating the computer as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Nass says even computer experts who know better fall prey to the
illusion that the computer is human. It seems that millions of
years of evolution did not equip us to distinguish between what's
human and what isn't, at least on a subconscious level. It just
wasn't a necessary skill because, until now, anything that seemed
human actually was. As a result, our subconscious is easily fooled.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to project human thoughts and emotions onto
inanimate objects will become even more pronounced as scientists
move closer to building a computer with humanlike intelligence.
That task has long been the Holy Grail of computer science, and
many experts still believe it's unattainable, at least by
traditional means.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of that task may be hard to accept in an era when
computers are unlocking the secrets of the human genetic code and
trouncing Garry Kasparov, acclaimed as the greatest human chess
player in history. So aren't computers already smarter than human
beings?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, not even close. Although a computer can
multiply 427 by 62 far faster than any human, even the most
powerful supercomputers have a hard time with mundane tasks that
human beings perform instinctively, without struggle. The classic
example is pattern recognition, the ability to pick out an object
from a crowded visual field.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, my desk right now is very cluttered,'' explains
Joel Davis of the U.S. Office of Naval Research, based in
Arlington, Va. ``I could take this pencil here in my hand, lay it
on my desk and mix things up a bit, so that it's partially hidden
under some papers. Now, a Cray (supercomputer) couldn't find that
pencil, but my 4-year-old daughter, she could find it easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that the key to human intelligence _ the
difference between Davis' daughter and the Cray _ lies in
architecture. The human brain is a network of as many as 100
billion neurons, with any single neuron connected to as many as
10,000 other neurons, and with each connection varying in
intensity. The number of possible combinations within that tangled
neural network is immense, which makes the human mind very
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   A Cray supercomputer, on the other hand, has a far simpler
architecture. It solves a problem by a rigid step-by-step process
that precludes creativity and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So Davis and others at the frontiers of computer science are
trying to use nature as a model. That approach has many
subspecialties and many names: bioengineering, biomimicry,
biomechanics. They all assume that the way to make computers and
other machines more powerful is to make them more lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that you can make an airplane fly faster
by gluing feathers on its wings,'' Davis says. ``But I do believe
that biology can do things that we can't do yet electronically, and
that's where the answer lies.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of that approach, scientists are building artificial
neural networks and teaching them to operate as real neural
networks do in the human brain. A few scientists are even taking
that approach to its most far out and literal extension: Instead of
building computers that act like living brain cells, they are
building computers out of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ditto, a Georgia Tech researcher in neurosilicon computing,
leads a team that has built a simple adding machine out of the
neurons of a leech. In five years, he predicts, his team will have
built a much more complex machine out of living rat neurons grown
on a sheet of silicon. Such a computer might be taught to think as
living brains do.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like something out of Mary Shelley's
``Frankenstein,'' but Ditto rushes to reject the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're building something out of living body
parts,'' Ditto says. ``Well, OK, actually it is. It is a little
Frankensteiny, I admit. But we're not trying to create a new life
form that's going to go out and do evil. We just want to build a
living computer.''

TIME TO TRADE IN TIRED EXPLORER

 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: The small lettering on my Web pages displayed
with Internet Explorer is very hard to read. The same pages with
Netscape are easy to read. I noticed with Netscape that you can
adjust the lettering size, but no size is listed with Internet
Explorer. _ Going Blind
</P>
<P>
   Dear Going: Either you've got an ancient version of IE or you're
just not looking in the right place. I'm guessing your browser is
showing its age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's OK with some kinds of software. I've used the same
word-processing program for 17 years because all I need it to do is
save my work as a simple text file, and it does that nicely without
trying to rearrange my paragraphs or criticize my spelling and
grammar. After all, that's what copy editors are for. Yes, I
purposely ended that sentence with a preposition.
</P>
<P>
   Browser technology and Web design, on the other hand, change
daily. As soon as some new feature is included in a browser, you
can bet 10 million Poindexters are staying up late at night, trying
to take advantage of it on their sites. And, if your browser lacks
the capability to display the newest stuff, you're never going to
be treated to all those dancing, singing hamsters or whatever it is
some nerd thought would be totally cool.
</P>
<P>
   There's an added incentive to upgrading IE: Microsoft includes
improvements to the Windows operating system with each release of
Explorer. Nobody's forcing you to use IE _ at least, Bill Gates
hasn't worked out a totally reliable way to do that yet _ but you
miss out on some nifty stuff like easier-to-use dial-up networking
if you never upgrade. Don't worry. You can still use Netscape.
Nobody will tell Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've installed IE 5.01, go to the View menu and select
Text Size, where you'll have five font sizes to choose from. If
you've got a mouse that has that little wheel between the two
buttons, you can hold down the Control key and roll it up or down
to change text size. Let's see Netscape do that.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing: Stop using the default text size when you
design a Web page. It's too small for us old-timers to read. Have
some pity and throw a plus-1 or plus-2 into your FONT commands.
That ratchets the viewing size up.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Many greetings. I am from Greece, and I want to
start hacking. I want you to tell me how it could be. _ Wannabe
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wannabe: I've always said there aren't enough hackers in
the world. First, abandon all personal hygiene. Drop all interests
but computing. Don't even try to interact with other people, or you
won't be able to let your sense of values warp beyond all
recognition. Now, develop an unreasonable hatred for society.
Remember: It's not your fault you're a total loser with no friends,
marketable skills or future. Those multinational corporations and
government agencies are the ones to blame. Target them with the
only weapon you have in your pitiful arsenal: not your vote, not
your ideas, not your faith, not your inspiration, but your childish
belief that jamming somebody's Web page for a couple of hours will
make the world finally recognize how truly awesome you are. Trust
me: We'll all be really impressed. Oh, and you should have a really
cool nickname, too. Your cellmate will like that.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In June 1975, a solitary computer hacker
slipped quietly into a van in the parking lot of a local hotel,
Rickey's Hyatt House, and ``borrowed'' a copy of Microsoft BASIC,
the first commercial program from a tiny Albuquerque, N.M., company
started by two other young hackers, William H. Gates and Paul G.
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The van was on a nationwide tour to show off the MITS Altair
8800, one of the world's first personal computers. The program _
stored as a set of punched holes in a long paper tape _ was
``liberated'' to be shared by a rag-tag group of Silicon Valley
computer hobbyists who had banded together only four months earlier
as the Homebrew Computer Club.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was handed to Dan Sokol, then 31, a semiconductor
engineering manager who did what he thought was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made convenient copies for the members of the Homebrew Club,
because I was the only one who had easy access to a paper tape
reader,'' Sokol recalled recently.
</P>
<P>
   The act outraged Gates, of the company then spelled as
Micro-Soft, who saw nothing but outright theft in the stunt. He
wrote an angry letter to the computer hobbyists. ``As the majority
of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software,'' the
letter said. ``Hardware must be paid for, but software is something
to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?''
</P>
<P>
   This initial confrontation between Gates, then 20, who was to
become the most powerful figure in the computer industry and the
world's richest man, and an anarchic cadre of programmers and
hardware tinkerers was the forge of a basic tension that is still
shaping the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the PC as the ubiquitous tool of the
information age had its roots in the Homebrew Club. A central value
of its founders _ the free sharing of information _ has until
recently been submerged in the Silicon Valley gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the argument has returned as a battle cry in a range
of confrontations, from the challenge of the free Linux operating
system to the patent protection and copyright issues facing the
music industry and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the valley has long been motivated by what the
author Michael S. Malone called ``The Big Score'' _ or more simply
put, greed. Indeed, it was not long after the Homebrew Club's first
meeting in Menlo Park that it began spawning companies _ with names
like Apple, Osborne, Cromemco and Northstar _ owing their roots,
directly or indirectly, to the enthusiasm that was captured in the
initial club meetings.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the valley also continues to be driven by a
more ethereal and in many ways purer motive _ what the author has
called ``the hacker ethic,'' a reference to the values of
passionate programmers (and not, in the more modern definition of
``hacker,'' to an outlaw subculture).
</P>
<P>
   The ethos, which finds its clearest expression today in Linux
software and in the commitment of the so-called open source
movement to the shared ownership and development of computing
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, which now has about a 25 percent share of the computer
server market and the backing of big companies like IBM, is a
freely available operating system that has been developed and
supported by volunteer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The PC industry ``began with people who had a passion for
computers,'' said Paul Freiberger, co-author of ``Fire in the
Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer'' (McGraw Hill, 1999)
``They were followed by people who had a passion for money. It's
the mixture of those passions that defines Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy night 25 years ago, it was the original hacker spirit
that captivated a small group of young men who were drawn early on
to the potential of powerful personal computers. One of them, a
Hewlett-Packard technician named Stephen Wozniak, has long
maintained that he had no intention of creating a company when he
built his first computer, but that he rather was intent on building
a machine he could show off to the members of the Homebrew Club.
</P>
<P>
   By happenstance, Sokol sat next to Wozniak at an early club
meeting. ``He bemoaned the fact that he couldn't get any parts to
make his computer from H-P,'' Sokol remembered. ``So I told him to
come by my company and I found a shoe box full of parts that became
the components used in the first Apple I computer.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no initial-public-offering gleam in either man's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were interested in playing with toys,'' Sokol said.
``People looked at our hand-wired computers and laughed at us and
asked, `What are you going to do with it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two people showed up at the first meeting after a peace
activist named Frederick Moore Jr. rode his bicycle around Palo
Alto and Menlo Park, tacking up small 3-by-5-inch notices on
bulletin boards and telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slipped Fred $5 and he went to the copy store and printed up
a bunch of fliers,'' recalled Gordon French, an engineer who along
with Moore is considered a co-founder of the group and who held the
first club meetings in his Palo Alto garage.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny flier read in part: ``Are you building your own
computer? Terminal? TV Typewriter? I/O device? or some other
digital black magic box? Or are you buying time on a time-sharing
service? If so, you might like to come to a gather of people with
like-minded interests. Exchange information, swap ideas, help work
on a project, whatever ...''
</P>
<P>
   One person who saw the flier on a telephone pole was Alan Baum,
who became an early employee of Apple Computer. He called his
friend Wozniak, and the two agreed to attend.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wozniak had already heard about the meeting from
another friend, John Draper, even then a legendary figure in the
Bay Area. Draper had been nicknamed ``Cap'n Crunch'' after he
discovered that the whistle prize in the cereal box would unlock
the AT&AMP;T long-distance system by generating a specific tone; he was
considered a pioneer ``phone phreak,'' part of a subculture of
hobbyists who explored the inner workings of the telephone network
in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Wozniak and his friend Steven P. Jobs had met Draper several
years earlier, in Wozniak's dormitory room at the University of
California at Berkeley. From him, they learned about devices called
blue boxes that could be used to gain free telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, Wozniak and Jobs sold blue boxes. But after Jobs
realized from the Homebrew Club meetings that there might be an
enthusiastic market for PCs, the two men founded Apple Computer.

A PLAN TO WIRE AN ENTIRE GEORGIA TOWN WITH THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to La Grange. The small Georgia city 60 miles southwest
of Atlanta, already the regional home of several Fortune 500
corporations, now intends to become the largest entirely wired town
so far in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to a plan announced last week, every household,
school, government office and retail store in town will be
connected to one giant high-speed network. The system is being
created by combining the town's existing fiber-optic network with
coaxial cable from Charter Communications, the local cable
provider. The system, to be paid for by the municipal government,
is to be fully in place by fall.
</P>
<P>
   Households and businesses will receive free installation, which
includes a cable modem for Internet access. And for at least the
first year, Internet service is to be provided free to each user.
</P>
<P>
   Any home without a personal computer will receive an access
device and keyboard to attach to the television set, said the
mayor, Jeff Lukken. The city, which has a population of 27,000,
will provide Internet access through WorldGate Communications,
which specializes in interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted the project, called the La Grange Internet TV
Initiative?
</P>
<P>
   Lukken said one big motivation was La Grange's role as home to
the regional operations of Fortune 500 companies, including
Caterpillar, Kimberly-Clark and Georgia-Pacific. The network,
Lukken said, should help the town attract and keep big employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have a work force with the right skills, the
ones that meet the standards that information technology companies
command,'' Lukken said.
</P>
<P>
   The network will also let teachers communicate more easily with
parents, and enable more students to use the Internet at home, he
said. Retailers in town will be able to open online stores to help
them compete on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The network and equipment will cost the city roughly $300,000,
mostly to wire those households that do not already receive basic
cable television service _ about 2,200 of La Grange's 11,000 homes
_ and to supply the necessary set-top hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing set-top Internet-access devices for those
households without PCs, the city plans to send technicians into
homes to train people unfamiliar with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Grange is a very progressive city,'' said Jerry Kent, chief
executive of Charter. ``But like all communities, they are afraid
of falling behind. This helps them attract businesses and people to
the town.''

TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE SOME PEOPLE MONEY, BUT IS THAT ALL THERE IS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once heard the technology pundit and historian Paul Saffo say,
``Never mistake a clear view for a short distance'' _ a witty
caveat that surely must be the understatement of the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   It was a truth that struck close to the bone while I was
preparing to write this, my last Digital Commerce column. (I'm
starting a nonprofit research venture.)
</P>
<P>
   While browsing through my archives, more than 15 years' worth of
articles and speeches and commentary for various publications and
venues, I recalled the days when telling people that you wrote
about technology was like dropping a stink bomb at a political
rally. You could clear the place in 10 seconds flat.
</P>
<P>
   Then I came across the first piece I wrote that detailed the
enormous challenge facing copyright law as digital media gained
commercial ascendancy. The year was 1990. But only now is the
battle fully engaged between copyright holders and citizens who
demand their legal right to copy. The pieces I wrote describing the
challenges of online privacy and censorship were even longer ago,
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Never mistake a clear view for a short distance, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of technology's new exposure and celebrity, many
executives and other industry experts are increasingly and deeply
troubled by the turn the Internet industry, in particular, has
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and business strategists like John Doerr, the venture
capitalist, who by this point has nearly the name-brand recognition
of Coke, once saw in digital technology _ and particularly the
Internet _ a universe of bankable ideas. It was a fertile breeding
ground that could both change the world and make a ton of money.
</P>
<P>
   The result, as we have heard Doerr say so many times the last
five years, has been the greatest legal creation of wealth in
history.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, investors knew that a company's successful
public stock offering only signaled a promising start, not the
final bell. A company that lasted was the real proof of their
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the only vision required to make zillions of dollars in
the Internet economy is nearsightedness. The stock market remains
so irrationally exuberant that almost every me-too dot-com company
can pick up $10 million or so in venture funding and make a bundle
either on a quick initial public offering or acquisition, with nary
a glance toward long-term viability _ or long-term investors, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the focus on money, money, money that we encounter
daily in the Internet economy is almost impossible to discuss
rationally in most quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Try telling someone hit by the money truck (or waiting to be),
that the making of millions overnight does not justify the present
means _ like poor business practices, rejection of even sensible
government oversight and early profit-taking _ that leaves the
dregs of dot-com reality for the public to deal with. Say that out
loud and you, too, can live the experience of clearing a room in 10
seconds flat.
</P>
<P>
   But even to my somewhat jaundiced eye, it appears that something
is shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Venture investors, the rocket fuel of the Internet economy, have
started to question the path that so many Internet companies have
taken _ despite the tremendous profit they make from the present
state of affairs. In fact, at a recent conference, Doerr apologized
to the assembled crowd for his ``legal creation of wealth'' remark,
saying that he never expected everyone to focus on the money, to
the exclusion of creating substantial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He credits some of his new perspective to a book he has been
brandishing in public the last couple of months. ``The Monk and the
Riddle: The Education of a Silicon Valley Entrepreneur'' (Harvard
Business School Press, 2000) was written by Randy Komisar, a
longtime player in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Komisar, in fact, has seen the game from nearly every angle _
lawyer, co-founder of the Claris Corp., chief executive of
LucasArts Entertainment and Crystal Dynamics _ and has been
increasingly dismayed by the focus on the getting of money at any
personal cost. His book is a ``stop the madness'' cry from someone
who has not only seen how the sausage is made, but has stuffed a
few casings himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving toward the toxic extreme of capitalism,'' Komisar
said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism works better than any other market structure that has
been devised, he added, because it harnesses man's ``absolute base
instincts _ greed and aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   But a focus on money, to the exclusion of substance and human
relationships, he said, will ultimately fail, perhaps
spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the ``digital
divide,'' which lately has been given a lot of lip service but not
much else, does not involve only the issue of which people have
computers and which people do not. It also has to do with the
attitude of those who hit the jackpot in our new casino economy and
who are completely comfortable with pressing their advantage _
behaving with staggering hubris because they believe that merely
having money entitles them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 60s it was all about `wait until the revolution
comes,''' Komisar said. ``Well, guess what? If you take your
billions and flaunt them in front of people who don't have enough
to eat, ultimately you will get your revolution. You can't keep
that toxic edge. It's not sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are also planting flags for common sense and ethics.
Another book, ``The Cluetrain Manifesto,'' (Perseus Books, 2000)
makes the case, as does Komisar's work, that Internet companies
that ignore the people behind the computers are going to fail.
</P>
<P>
   The manifesto, which states unequivocally that the Internet
changes the way people interact with businesses, profoundly and
forever, has become a best seller. Doc Searls, a longtime marketing
executive who is one of the manifesto's four authors, sees such a
positive response as a source of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The change, he says, is in the balance of power _ from supply to
demand, from the institution to the consumer _ and some investors
are now starting to get the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the crumbling ivory towers of old Fort Business
are missing the fact that the real action in the marketplace
consists of conversations that people are interested in,'' Searls
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, companies will be successful to the degree that they
open up to their customers and unsuccessful to the degree that they
close down. ``You either contribute or you don't,'' he adds.
``That's how conversations work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the last couple of months, Doerr, the venture capitalist,
has been redefining success from an even broader perspective. In
public forums, he has been encouraging a shift in focus from
``mercenary'' to ``missionary,'' asking executives to think about
starting companies and building products that they believe will
change the world, rather than merely amassing wealth.
</P>
<P>
   This is not much of a choice: zealotry rarely serves anyone
besides the zealots. But if the metaphor jump-starts people into
thinking about their actions and motivations, the overstatement may
be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am seeing the first signs of consciousness,'' Komisar said.
``People are engaging in the discussion'' about learning to be
human in the context of what they do for a living. ``There's a bit
more introspection, at least from a significant group of people who
have already made it. They have gone through the process and found
themselves wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Few have yet gone so far as to reorder their priorities, he
said. ``I'm not expecting a radical change in my lifetime, but we
have to back off from the brink.''

CISCO TAKES INTERNET PHONES TO NEXT STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a year ago that John T. Chambers, chief executive of
Cisco Systems, said he wanted the traditional telephone on his desk
to be gone in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened; the old phone is still there. But Monday,
Cisco intends to announce an office telephone system based on
Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which transmits voice calls in the electronic
language of the Internet, could push the company to the top of the
budding Internet-telephone market. Proponents say such systems
bring new convenience, efficiency and cost-savings to corporate
communications.
</P>
<P>
   While North America's traditional office telephone powerhouses,
Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks of Canada, are also
developing Internet phone systems for offices, Cisco may have the
early edge.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch intends to make Cisco's the main phone system at a
new campus in Hopewell, N.J., with 5,000 of the new phones to be
installed over 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Texas Instruments is experimenting with about 500
of the new phones in an international test. Executives from both
companies are giving the new Cisco system positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the ways in which technology has changed how people
live and how companies do business, the final frontier of the first
Internet revolution will probably be the humble telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Many communications companies are promoting so-called Internet
telephony as a low-cost long-distance alternative for consumers.
But the sound quality of phone calls over the public Internet is
generally inferior to that of calls over traditional telephone
systems. The technologies and systems are not yet in place to allow
the Internet to reliably transmit high-quality phone calls for
millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Office networks, however, are in some ways much more stable than
the public Internet, perhaps making them more amenable to early
Internet telephone efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Most offices now have two communications networks, one for
computers and another for telephones. Many companies maintain
separate staffs for each. Cisco's vision is to allow companies to
use a common Internet-based network for both computers and
telephones internally, reducing cost and complexity and adding new
functions to the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks that can't do data, voice and video are
dinosaurs,'' Chambers said in an interview last Friday. ``We're
going to see open standards for any new telecommunications or
computer product to connect to one network. This is the first
gauntlet thrown down in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's new Internet phones connect to an office's Ethernet data
network using a jack like those on the back of a standard office
computer. One of the most attractive features of the system is that
the phone can identify itself to a corporate network regardless of
its location. A worker from New York, for instance, could take his
or her phone to a corporate office in San Francisco and be reached
as easily as in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can plug the phone into any connection, and it will keep
the same number you had,'' Brian J. Bonner, chief information
officer and a vice president at Texas Instruments, said. ``You can
take your phone and plug it in at a TI office in Germany, for
instance, and I can dial your number, which looks like Dallas, and
it rings in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   When a worker changes offices at a company that uses a
traditional phone system, a technician must generally reconfigure
the phone system so that the worker's old phone operates correctly
at the new location. An Internet phone system can eliminate that
effort and cost, leading some of Cisco's customers to believe that
the Internet system would be much cheaper to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very compelling economics associated with IP
phones relative to traditional phones,'' said John A. McKinley,
chief technology officer and an executive vice president at Merrill
Lynch, referring to Internet protocol, the language of cyberspace.
``Ultimately, I think this represents the next stage in growth for
Cisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers must think so, too. The traditional phone by his desk
shares space with one of his company's new creations.

POLAROID GIRDS FOR NEW ERA IN INSTANT PHOTOGRAPHY

 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a paradox here somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Polaroid not only outsold its competitors in the
digital camera field, it even turned a slim profit on those sales.
Since analysts say that no one else is making money on digital
cameras, it was a coup.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to Polaroid executives and they shrug off digital
cameras as simply Polaroid's way of marking time. They expect that
a few years down the road, people will be snapping pictures with
cell phones, Palm Pilots and the like _ and, they hope, printing
them out on wireless Polaroid printers. ``The cameras are just
another way of capturing images, many of which we hope people will
want to print,'' said Gary T. DiCamillo, Polaroid's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy of this forecast could determine Polaroid's chances
for survival in a digital world.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has always sold cameras pretty much at cost, and made
its money from chemical-and-paper film that develops itself in a
minute or two. Since digital photography is essentially an
electronic form of instant pictures, Polaroid is either in a unique
position to move into this field _ or uniquely suited to be
rendered obsolete by it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Polaroid executives stress the opportunities. ``I
laugh when people are surprised we're doing well in digital
cameras,'' said Brian D. Poggi, senior vice president for North
America. ``After all, they're really the same as instant cameras:
They provide an affordable and immediate picture.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry experts wonder whether the similarity will
translate to sales. Many note that, even as film sales shrink,
companies like Fuji and Kodak can still do a thriving business in
sales of coated papers, which can be used to make high-quality
prints of digital photos. But a Polaroid customer who switches to
digital photography is lost to the market for the company's
self-developing film _ unless those customers use Polaroid printers
or hybrid digital/instant cameras to make prints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear to me what long-term digital strategy can
really replace what they are generating from film-based instant
prints,'' said Steve Hoffenberg, a digital photography market
analyst with Lyra Research Inc. in Newtonville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has similar concerns. Eastman Kodak and Polaroid
have both had earnings problems that have driven their stock prices
down in recent years. Kodak's stock remains mired in the $50s _
well below the nearly $70 it traded at a year ago. But many
analysts say the company has cleaned up its digital portfolio and
brought its costs under control, making its stock a good buy right
now. Few are as upbeat about Polaroid, even though that company's
stock closed at $25.1875 on Friday _ nowhere near the price of
$60.25 it reached in July 1997, but a nice rebound from its low of
$17.25 in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital cameras, scanners, picture CDs, Web sites, they are
all geared toward one thing _ driving output,'' said Jonathan
Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``And the
competitive picture for Polaroid in a digital world is a lot less
clear than it is for Kodak.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as the only instant photography company in the
country, competition is not something Polaroid is used to. (Fuji
Photo Film Co. sells instant cameras and film overseas, but when
Kodak tried to do so here, the courts upheld Polaroid's patents.)
But as the digital revolution is wooing many people from the 35-mm
film camp, Polaroid could grab customers long loyal either to Fuji
or Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be the only show in town for people who wanted
instant gratification on their pictures, and yes, we've lost
that,'' said Paul E. Lambert, Polaroid's senior vice president for
research and development. ``But for the first time, we can really
tap into the conventional photography market.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to capture a high-end digital market _ the
strategy that Fuji and Kodak have pursued _ Polaroid has farmed its
production out to overseas manufacturers, which make
Polaroid-branded cameras that sell for as little as $99 and rarely
top $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital cameras are just their mechanism for building shelf
space,'' said Michael Ellmann, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   True to its mass-market roots, Polaroid already is spewing forth
products to fill those shelves. There is a portable scanner that
can upload images to the Web. There is a digital camera with a
built-in modem that can send pictures via the Web to Polaroid for
transfer to prints, T-shirts or other items.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Polaroid announced an alliance with PictureWorks
Technology, a software company, to develop more Internet-related
products. One on the drawing boards is a product to help
dermatologists keep a digital-image record of a patient's progress
during treatments for skin disorders and plug the pictures into
insurance claims forms.
</P>
<P>
   On the wireless front, Polaroid recently demonstrated a wireless
printer that can receive images transmitted by radio waves from up
to 50 feet away. ``This makes the process truly portable, because
digital cameras are no longer tethered to PCs,'' said Ulysses
Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman &AMP; Reid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of Polaroid's planned digital cameras will double
as makeshift printers. The company already sells a combination
instant-print and digital camera, aimed at teen-agers, that is
little more than two cameras glued together; the user cannot
instantly print an image captured digitally. Within a year, though,
Polaroid intends to introduce a hybrid camera that will collect
images electronically, but will also generate an instant print with
the press of a button.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's chemists are working on a new type of paper
for printing pictures that they claim will yield the same quality
as the silver halide films that Fuji, Kodak and Polaroid now use,
but at a much lower cost. By now, many inkjet printers can yield
high-resolution 8{-by-11-inch prints on photo-quality paper for
less than a dollar each. Although conventional Polaroid instant
film could be modified for use in a desktop printer, prints would
cost several dollars apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Polaroid's attempts to reduce costs were hamstrung
by the need for a chemically treated paper that can both capture an
image and print it; now, digital cameras take care of that first
step. ``If we don't have to worry about capturing the image, we can
optimize how we print it out,'' Lambert said.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid is divulging few details about its research, and its
new paper is at least two years from market. Still, what has leaked
out excites analysts. ``They're talking a few cents per print,''
Yannas said, ``so they could capture a big share of the home print
market.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That market promises to be huge. Indeed, photo processors
already say that digital cameras have increased, not decimated,
their business. ``Digital photography has created a whole new
customer base for us,'' said Mitchell B. Goldstone, who owns 30
Minute Photo in Irvine, Calif. ``People use less film, but they
make more prints and enlargements.''
</P>
<P>
   But the conventional photography companies will not give up
market share without a fight. Kodak is also researching
non-silver-halide media for making prints. Last week, Kodak said it
would soon begin selling lower-priced digital cameras. And it
recently introduced a digital camera that can snap onto a Palm
Pilot and transfer images to the device's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak also has a prototype digital camera that can e-mail images
via a mobile phone. ``The person receiving that e-mail image is
likely to print it out, or send it to Kodak via the Internet to get
prints,'' said Willy C. Shih, president of Kodak's digital imaging
business.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji, meanwhile, has been selling to photo processing labs a
printing method that uses lasers and heat, rather than a wet
process, to transfer images to paper. The company is now
introducing a similar, scaled-down, dry-process photographic
printer for home use. Unlike Polaroid and Kodak, Fuji is
manufacturing its own digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital imaging is an industry unto itself, and we want to
provide a cradle-to-grave solution in that space,'' said Manny
Almeida, general manager of digital imaging at Fuji Photo Film USA.
</P>
<P>
   There are still opportunities that no photography company has
yet nailed down. B. Alexander Henderson, who covers the
photographic industry for Prudential Securities, contends that all
the photography companies should be touting their corporate Web
sites as places where customers can store their electronic
photographs, with an eye toward making prints in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuji, Kodak, Polaroid _ they could all generate repeat
business in prints, and enough traffic to generate advertising
revenue on their Web sites,'' he said. ``The holy grail of the
Internet is controlling content, yet none of them are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, all of the companies do have breathing space to get
their digital acts together. Conventional photography is still
growing fast in emerging economies like China. And the Photo
Marketing Association says that amateur photography is a $15
billion annual market in the United States. Polaroid's own research
shows that 90 percent of American households own cameras, but only
6 percent own digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional cameras may get squeezed out within our
lifetime,'' Almeida of Fuji said. ``But in the next few years? No
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid, too, says that sales of its conventional instant
cameras and film are at an all-time high. Last year, the company
sold 9.7 million instant cameras, topping its 1978 record of 9.4
million. Its total sales hit $1.98 billion in 1999, up from $1.85
billion the prior year. And its net earnings were $9 million, a
nice improvement from 1998, when weak demand in emerging markets
combined with smaller orders from mass marketers in the United
States to cause a net loss of $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has been concentrating its marketing efforts on the
youth market _ it just signed a sponsorship agreement with Britney
Spears, the popular singer _and its cameras have become hot sellers
among teen-agers. The company's I-Zone camera, a $25 item that
yields postage-stamp-sized pictures, was the best-selling camera in
the country last Christmas season. ``There's no question,
Polaroid's instant cameras are going gangbusters,'' said Hoffenberg
of Lyra Research.
</P>
<P>
   But the excitement is clearly in digital products. ``Instant
photography will represent the majority of our business in the next
five years,'' DiCamillo said, ``but digital will be the
fastest-growing area.''
</P>
<P>
   That will probably be true in Polaroid's troubled commercial
business as well. In contrast to its robust consumer sales,
Polaroid's commercial sales, which in the past represented half its
revenues, have been flat, and profit margins razor-thin.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid is banking that its mass market products will be used
for commercial ends. A hospital in Canada, for example, uses
Polaroid I-Zone cameras that yield sticky-backed prints to affix
pictures to admissions records. ``Half of our products are used in
business, even if they're bought at Wal-Mart,'' said Stephen
Golden, director of marketing for consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Polaroid does have strictly commercial products as
well. Its digital microscopy camera, which captures what is seen
through a microscope, is selling well to research labs, despite
price tags that start at $6,000. Polaroid already is the world's
largest supplier of photo ID cards, and it has its sights on
becoming the dominant company for digitally produced
identification.
</P>
<P>
   It is ready to introduce a system, particularly intended for the
passport photo market, that would take and store photos digitally,
but print them out on Polaroid film. Polaroid already produces the
driver's licenses for 37 states, and it is testing a program in
West Virginia for snapping and storing digital photos of children
that police can use to help locate a missing child.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has new technologies for incorporating
fingerprints and facial recognition into ID cards. One system
enables states to check whether someone has a driver's license in
another name. And Polaroid just introduced a product, for sale to
computer keyboard manufacturers, that would let people use their
fingerprints in lieu of passwords and log-ons, by pressing their
index fingers against a little window.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid also is using the Internet to expand its base of
customers. It has begun accepting ID information and images via the
Web, mailing back ID cards within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This now makes us accessible to small businesses that don't
want to spend thousands for an ID system,'' DiCamillo said. ``I
appreciate technology, but I'm a market-driven manager. And our
strategy, now and in the future, will be driven by understanding
what customers want.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ Ground zero at the Yahoo Internet Life Online Film
Festival last week was the coffee shop at the ostentatiously retro
Standard Hotel on Sunset Strip. Black-clad, steely eyed hipsters
with cell phones circled one another like prizefighters, feigning
indifference. Others huddled in the diner's booths while fresh
deals were announced with almost every tick of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a madhouse,'' said Mika Salmi, chairman of
Seattle-based Atomfilms, one of the Internet's leading exhibitors,
producers and distributors of digital movies. ``It's very fast here
in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival is far from being the first or the only event
dedicated to the world of online film _ that is, the making and
distributing of digital movies on the Internet, an explosively
growing field some think is the vanguard of entertainment for the
future. But the two-day event that ended on Thursday night turned
into a kind of coming-out party, a faltering first date, for the
worlds of mainstream Hollywood and online entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 companies that offer some form of online films took
part in the festival along with all the names that have become
familiar in recent months in the field. Besides Atomfilms there
were Ifilm, Shockwave, Pop.com, Filmbazaar, Sputnik 7, EVEO and
others. Also at the festival, though, were some representatives of
mainstream Hollywood, from Peter Guber, the former studio chief,
and his Mandalay Films, announcing a new Internet initiative, to
Propaganda Films, announcing a new partnership to produce movies
for Atomfilms.
</P>
<P>
   The impression was that a load of fresh chum had been tossed
into the water and there was a great roiling on the surface. But it
was difficult to tell exactly who was eating whom down below.
</P>
<P>
   ``All revolutions are great unless they kill you,'' Guber said.
``This is a potentially lethal time. But daring times require bold
actions. Blazing a trail to the future is hazardous duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most emblematic festival event came early, on
Wednesday morning, when 17 companies had five minutes each to stand
up before reporters and announce any new partnership or
acquisition. No time for questions, though. Too many deals to be
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Shockwave announced that the director David Lynch would join
Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of ``South Park,'' and the
filmmakers Tim Burton and James L. Brooks in creating films
exclusively for its site. Lynch said that his animated efforts
would be self-consciously dumb and poorly drawn, but he promised
they would be ``sophisticatedly crude.'' Pop.com announced that it
was joining with John Sloss, an entertainment lawyer and veteran
deal maker from the independent film world, to create Popfest, a
companion Web site that would compete with Atomfilms and others in
exhibiting the works of fledgling online filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Movie Database said it would join with Amazon.com
to create a special independent film area on its Web site that
would strategically link with Amazon's Advantage site to highlight
the works of independent filmmakers and even help them sell their
films. Universal Pictures, part of the Seagram Co., announced that
it would invest in Reelshort.com in hopes of ``providing an online
exhibition platform for cutting-edge creative work.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,800 people signed up for the online festival before
it was overwhelmed and registration had to be suspended on March
18. Along with seminars on how the worlds of Hollywood and dot-com
could get along, profitably, with one another, there were
screenings of online films, keynote speeches from Guber, the
journalist Kurt Andersen (who recently defected to the dot-com
world by founding Powerful Media) and the critic Roger Ebert, and
the world premiere of Mike Figgis' latest movie, ``Time Code,'' an
ambitious shot-on-digital comedy starring Stellan Skarsgard, Salma
Hayek and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   A hostile scene outside the premiere of the Figgis film _ when
many times more people showed up than could be accommodated in the
theater, especially as three-quarters of its seats were reserved
for those affiliated with the film or the festival's sponsors _ was
defused when festival organizers added late-night screenings for
the overflow crowd. Hollywood luminaries Dustin Hoffman, Nicolas
Cage and Jodie Foster also showed up for the event.
</P>
<P>
   For two sunny days, the festival spread along the twisting
stretch of Sunset between the Standard Hotel and the Chateau
Marmont, about 200 yards apart, with the biggest events, like the
``Time Code'' premiere and the keynote speeches, held a few blocks
farther east in the auditorium of the Directors Guild of America.
The pool and the warren of walkways between the Marmont's bungalows
were festooned with balloons, plush chairs and banners advertising
the dot-coms that had their festival headquarters there.
Filmmakers, agents, production company scouts and dot-com aspirants
made the rounds there and in the hospitality suites at the
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This event has turned out to be kind of the key event of the
year for combining the Internet with the world of independent
film,'' said Diane Zoi, director of Amazon.com Advantage.

Army testing `computerized' soldiers 
By Jay Bookman  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At military exercises this summer in Louisiana, troops
will find themselves engaged in fake battle against a rifle platoon
of ``cyborgs'' from the 82nd Airborne Division, headquartered at
Fort Benning.
</P>
<P>
   Through eyepieces mounted on their helmets, the 'borgs will be
able to view the battlefield through telescopic vision, infrared
vision or nighttime vision. Eyepieces connected by cable to a video
camera mounted on their M-16 rifles will allow them to accurately
aim and fire their weapons around the corner of a building.
</P>
<P>
   If they spot a tank or other target out of their range, they'll
be able to tag it with a laser beam that pinpoints the target's
exact coordinates. The cyborg's ``on-board computer'' will then
ship those coordinates back to headquarters, which will order up an
artillery or air strike on the target.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also be able to view computerized maps of the
battlefield through their eyepiece, with their own positions and
the positions of their fellow cyborgs already plotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want them shooting their buddies,'' explains Mike
Tryon, deputy manager for the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine
Command, which is helping to develop the Land Warrior wearable
computing system. Friendly fire accounted for almost a quarter of
the U.S. servicemen killed in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to speech recognition software, platoon members will
be able to perform those chores by voice command alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fighting system, so I want my soldier to keep his
hands on his weapon while he's performing all these other
functions,'' says Tryon, a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Like many complicated defense programs, the Land Warrior system
has a troubled history. Originally conceived in 1996, it was
supposed to be fully deployed by 2000, with as many as 34,000 units
put in the field. Instead it's still in the early phases of
testing, with 2004 as the earliest possible deployment date. In
December, a report to Congress by the General Accounting Office
outlined problems in the program, the most serious involving
weight.
</P>
<P>
   That's always been a touchy issue. Tryon declined to discuss the
system's total weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would give the wrong impression that we were really
burdening these guys down,'' he says. ``The truth is, in some cases
we're actually lightening the soldier's load over what it would be
if they had these functions individually, with a radio and other
equipment. For example, we've taken about 2.5 pounds off the squad
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report was more candid, putting the weight of the Land
Warrior system at a prohibitive 90 pounds, which includes body
armor and two radio systems. However, the GAO also noted that after
its report was drafted, the Army had begun to redesign the system.
A total weight for the new version could not be obtained. The GAO
also criticized the life span of batteries used in the system, but
again it noted significant progress was being made in overcoming
that obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tryon, the United States is far from alone in
developing such systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next summer we'll have the British, the Germans and us all
demonstrating our systems to NATO,'' he says. ``The Australians are
building a system, too, and the Canadians are sitting back, waiting
to see what kind of technology the rest of us go with.''
</P>
<P>
   After the summer war exercises in Louisiana, the platoon of 82nd
Airborne ``cyborgs'' will train with the Land Warrior system for a
year to test its survivability and functionality.
</P>
<P>
   Later versions of the system may incorporate technologies that
are still under development, such as a type of handheld radar
system that would allow troops to detect objects such as tanks or
even human beings on the other side of a solid wall. Even more in
the future, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or
DARPA, is funding research into what it calls ``Exoskeletons for
Human Augmentation,'' basically a high-tech form of computerized
armor that will boost a soldier's physical capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanically augmenting the speed, strength and endurance of
the ground soldier will lead to enhanced survivability and new
mission capabilities,'' DARPA documents claim.

You needn't upgrade all your computer components at once 
By Bill Husted  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The trouble with loving gadgets is that I have a
difficult time resisting them. So my house is beginning to look
like a second-hand electronics shop, with ham radio gear in the
basement, stereo stuff on the first floor, and the big-screen TV
and its assorted amplifiers and speakers up on top.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that _ with all the money I'm spending _ I'll be
scrounging for partially eaten cabbages in the trash bin behind the
Kroger store. Since some of you might be in the same boat _ after
all, we nerds seem to hang out together _ I thought we'd talk today
about some ways to save some money when it comes to computers.
We'll do it by bucking a trend in computer retailing.
</P>
<P>
   If you walk down the aisles of a computer store, you'll see that
most of the systems are bundled. You end up getting the computer,
monitor, all sorts of accessories, a printer and sometimes a
scanner. The system also is packed with software and sometimes
comes with a free Internet offer.
</P>
<P>
   All that sounds good, but in some ways, it's like going to the
grocery store to buy a roast to cook for Sunday and ending up with
a package deal that includes the plates, glasses, some wine and
even the knives and forks.
</P>
<P>
   The smart way to buy computers _ and this will help you stay up
in a world where today's fastest machine is a techno-dinosaur by
tomorrow _ is to treat a computer system like a stereo outfit.
Today you might buy a really good set of speakers, then replace the
amplifier in a year or so, each time getting really good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You can do the same thing with computers. By buying just one
component at a time and gradually replacing the weak links in your
system, you can spread out the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a lot more advantages than that to my system.
</P>
<P>
   Since all of us have different ways we use a computer, by
replacing your system a component at a time, you can gradually
create a system that is tailored to your needs.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you a few ``for instances.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's say I'm a computer gamer. I'd want to spend most of my
money on a high-end video card to handle the graphics and maybe a
really terrific monitor, but skimp on things like a printer and a
scanner.
</P>
<P>
   Or if my thing were the Internet, I could buy a low-end
processor and spend money for a fast connection (either DSL or a
cable modem). What I'm saying is that a computer system is just
that _ a system _ and you can assemble the components that suit the
way you use it.
</P>
<P>
   There's still another leg to this strategy: Identify the
components you won't likely have to replace every year or so and
spend money on top-end components that are unlikely to go out of
date.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some of you might want to look into a really cool
flat monitor, or a regular monitor that's 19 to 21 inches. If you
get a good monitor now, it'll probably last you through three or
four computers.
</P>
<P>
   Printers also are a relatively stable component. Inkjet printers
have gotten a lot better over the past three or four years, and the
top-end models today are liable to last for a long time. It's the
same with scanners and digital cameras _ both are much improved,
and one that is good today is likely to remain usable for years.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow my strategy, you'll soon be in the position of
just replacing your computer processor, as needed. If you get a
midrange computer as far as speed, it may well last you for two or
three years if your prime use is e-mail, letters and simple tasks
like figuring your taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Try my system. I have a selfish motive, of course. If I can save
you some money, maybe there won't be as much competition at the
trash bin behind Kroger for those cabbages.

Nothing mousy about Boomslang 
By Shaun Conlin  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Where Microsoft's ``IntelliEye'' reinvented the
mouse by replacing the intrinsic track-ball with an optical laser
sensor, Karna has improved on the original mouse concept by using a
laser to read the track ball. Karna's Razer Boomslang 2000 ($100;
www.razerzone.com) offers a frightfully fast and accurate interface
for any PC video game using the mouse and keyboard, such as first
person shooters. As a USB device, the sexy-looking Boomslang is
able to transmit more input information faster; its controller chip
has a much higher reading resolution at 2000dpi (400dpi is typical
in a typical mouse) and can cover the screen in about one-fifth the
motion. The trackball of the Boomslang is placed near the heel
rather than dead center, proffering finer poise as it practically
hovers under your hand. The Boomslang also offers on-the-fly, ``in
game'' sensitivity adjustment via a button and the scroll-wheel
and, ultimately, gives gamers much more refined and varied control
by greatly reducing the throw of the mouse, allowing greater range
of character movement and aim without the need to reset or
re-center. Watch your frag count soar.

A mystical ride with Mulan 
By Shaun Conlin  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Though this NewKidCo. product is, indeed, a
PlayStation CD-ROM, Disney's Mulan ($38; www.newkidco.com) is not a
video game per se; it's more of an interactive plaything from the
Disney's Story Studio line that encourages and coaxes kids through
various problem-solving and motor-skills lessons. Terrific and
friendly voice-over work blends story development with pleasant
tutorial as players guide Disney's cross-dressing heroine through a
series of activities, such as bathing and getting dressed, playing
Mahjong and a game of dodge ball as Mulan makes her way down an
avalanche-plagued slope in her back yard. Ultimately, with no way
to lose and with all the problems and conundrums completed, Mulan
is crowned the Imperial Storymaker and can henceforth create her
own stories, play sing-along Karaoke style or paint her own story
boards. Harmless and pleasant interactive fun from the preeminent
early childhood Zen masters at NewKidCo.

Syphon Filter returns 
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Syphon Filter is back. The
counter-terrorism game (which was meant to be a more action-packed
``Metal Gear Solid'') wowed us with its shooter-type gameplay. It
also had a pretty compelling storyline. 989 Studios's Syphon Filter
2 ($55, Playstation; www.989studios.com) surpasses the old Syphon
Filter in plot, and it offers a slew of new game functions. Your
task is to stop the Syphon Filter virus from being spread to
terrorists. To do this, you need to use brute force and an arsenal
that would make any action hero shout with joy (night vision
rifles, grenade launchers, crossbow, etc.). The game also offers an
addictive, two-player side-by-side mode. In this mode, you can play
the unsinkable Gabriel Logan while your partner in crime plays Lian
Xing. Blast your way to glory and save the world for us all.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   As many video games as have been made using the Star Wars
license, you'd think a game that took three years to develop would
blow us out of our collective seats. Unfortunately, LucasArts' new
Star Wars game, Force Commander ($40 for the PC, www.lucasarts.com)
does that, but in the wrong way: the game makes you want to get out
of your chair and take a walk just to get away from your computer.
Commander, a real-time-strategy game with 3D units and movement, is
nice to look at on first glance, but several problems emerge. The
game interface is clunky and needlessly complex. The background and
character graphics aren't as detailed or breathtaking as they
should be. And the control of the game's point of view is dodgy at
best. All of it combines to make an experience that is more
frustrating than fun. Star Wars fans deserve a great, awe-inspiring
strategy game along the lines of last year's stunning Homeworld,
but unfortunately, this is not the game they're looking for.

BATTLE BREWING OVER RIGHTS TO INTERNET CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAM ALLIS   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Over the past 200 years, a rough balance has evolved in
this country between the rights of the owners of intellectual
property and those of the public who want access to their work. But
a sizable body of legal experts now believes that technology being
developed to protect intellectual property on the Internet _
``code'' in Web vernacular _ may shatter this equilibrium and
marginalize much of traditional copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, a trifecta of code, aggressive licensing
contracts, and recent federal legislation has buttressed owners'
rights at the expense of public access. Leading this wave have been
record companies and movie studios incensed over the piracy
flourishing on the Net that costs them millions of dollars each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the tension between open content advocates who
consider the Net nirvana and owners who find it a free fire zone on
their creative work has elevated the arcane world of copyright law
to marquee status.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the movement in this field has been toward content and
then encryption at the expense of Fair Use,'' says Terry Fisher, an
intellectual property specialist at Harvard Law School. Fair Use is
the doctrine that provides exceptions to exclusivity of copyright
protection for criticism, commentary, news, teaching, scholarship,
and research.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is at risk,'' adds Jessica Litman, an intellectual
property law specialist at Wayne State University in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the nonprofit Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF), which is dedicated to open Net access,
has emerged as one of the field commanders waging rhetorical
warfare against corporate intellectual property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was previously considered a common human resource,
distributed among the minds and libraries of the world,'' he
writes, ``is now being fenced and deeded. It is as though a new
class of enterprise had arisen, which claimed to own air and
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Horsefeathers, counter record and movie executives. ``If you
can't protect what you own, you don't own anything,'' says Jack
Valenti, the longtime president of the Motion Picture Association
of America (MPAA), which represents the major studios. ``Society
doesn't say you can copy anything you want. Fair Use is still very
much alive. We have no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a culture clash between those who believe content on
the Net should be free and the content community who says, no, what
we do has value,'' adds Cary Sherman, general counsel of the
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which represents
more than 500 companies in the music business.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Era of Promiscuous Publication, a phrase that
captures the unsettling ability of the Net to transmit anything
instantly and indiscriminately. ``Today,'' Sherman told Congress in
1997, ``one individual, in less time than it takes me to read this
testimony, can send a full-length album to more than 50 million
Internet users.''
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree on one thing: Nothing is safe on the Net today.
``If you handed me a 100-page book, I could give you a digital copy
in about two hours,'' says Michael Segroves, an executive at
peanutpress.com, the Maynard-based e-book publisher that
participated in the online distribution this month of Stephen
King's latest work. ``What then has that done to the intellectual
property?''
</P>
<P>
   To staunch the flow of illicit traffic, the RIAA has filed a
spate of well-publicized lawsuits recently against Web sites such
as MP3.com and Napster alleging massive copyright infringement.
While Sherman said he admires the genius of MP3 software, which
compresses a CD to allow fast and easy storage on a hard drive, he
remains livid at both sites for finessing the permission from
artists and record companies required under copyright law to use
their music.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com makes copyrighted music available to users, providing
they can demonstrate possession of the CDs they want to hear. Thus
far, it has amassed upward of 80,000 from which to choose. Napster
allows users to link their own music archives to those of others.
While Napster doesn't offer any music of its own, it facilitates
access to a huge trove from other participants. Napster, which
Sherman calls ``a giant piracy machine,'' is an example of a
network externality. In plain English, this is something that
becomes more valuable the larger it grows.
</P>
<P>
   When MP3 software surfaced in the late '90s, the recording
industry reacted ``like a parent to a freshly mohawked teenager,''
according to a precis drafted at Harvard Law School's Berkman
Center on the Internet and Society and the EFF. It was just a
phase, record executives concluded. Wrong. Last year, according to
the document, ``MP3'' replaced ``sex'' as the Internet's most
searched term. And Napster use has so overloaded college systems
that it has been banned from many campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge. According to a recent report by Jupiter
Communications, the Net music business alone will swell to $1.6
billion by 2002. Many legal experts expect the recording industry
to prevail in its suits. But a larger question looms: Can
intellectual property on the Net ever really be controlled?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the feverish efforts by the RIAA and MPAA, the answer
may be no. If so, the anxiety flourishing in academic circles is
unwarranted, at least for now. The recording industry association
has sent out hundreds of cease-and-desist letters to rogue Web
sites alleging copyright violations. The sites disappear into the
ether like moonshiners in the hills of Appalachia, who simply move
their stills to another site when authorities approach.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he believes efforts to control intellectual property
on the Net by tightening existing law are doomed. ``Those will all
fail because it is ineffectual to halt the ingenuity of hackers or
the pace of technological innovation,'' he says. ``Ultimately,
copyright owners and their representatives are going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The second way to attempt control of intellectual property on
the Net _ an intermediate step in Fisher's view _ is through
contracts a user must agree to when signing up for a particular
program. These may be ``click-on agreements'' on the Net or
``shrink-wrapped'' ones in which a user agrees to terms
accompanying software to be installed in a computer. But their
legal standing is murky.
</P>
<P>
   A third way, the use of code, offers the best chance for
intellectual property owners to control their work on the Net.
Essentially, code provides techniques to limit or channel the uses
of information through encryption technology. Big content owners
like Disney and Sony can use it without public debate or
legislative fights. Eventually, walls of seamless protective code
may rise from the Net landscape like the towers of a Tuscan hill
town _ a specter that terrifies Barlow and others.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a change from traditional copyright enforcement,
where owners such as record companies have always tolerated a
degree of ``leakage.'' Before the advent of the Net, attempts to
make and distribute bootleg cassettes of music, for example, were
of no consequence because the quality of such reproduction was poor
and the process cumbersome. The lost revenue simply wasn't worth
pursuing. No more.
</P>
<P>
   Code also brings to mind the axiom of Jonathan Zittrain,
executive director of the Berkman Center: Technology always has two
phases _ It's Too Early To Tell and It's Too Late To Do Anything
About It. The only way to avoid the second is to focus on the
first.
</P>
<P>
   If code is indeed where the action is, then who writes it and
toward what end loom as the key questions. Consider the Secure
Digital Music Intiative (SDMI), a worldwide consortium of about 200
organizations associated with the music industry struggling to
develop a global encryption standard available to music content
providers. SDMI is far from reaching its goal, but its very
existence provides a glimpse into the thinking of the recording
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want the amount of freedom to reproduce speech to be
defined solely by the owner, who normally looks only at the
market?'' asks Zittrain about SDMI. ``There is not one user sitting
at that table. I don't want to rely on business models to give me
rights from copyright law. I don't know why I should have to go
down quietly on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness too the hoopla around the recent online release of
Stephen King's latest piece of fiction. Through code, the 66-page
novella entitled ``Riding the Bullet'' was made available only on
computer and hand-held instruments like the Palm Pilot. Most
salient, it cannot be copied. This limitation is at odds with the
First Sale Doctrine, a rule embedded in copyright law that allows
people to lend or resell a hard copy after they have purchased it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the tight access is obvious to owners. ``If I put
intellectual property in a browser, it is almost impossible to
protect the security of that text,'' says Segroves. Adds
peanutpress.com cofounder, Mark Reichelt: ``The publishers want to
be damned sure that what happened to the music industry won't
happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the King experience going to be the future of digital
publishing? ``Absolutely,'' says Segroves. It is but one example of
the new reality that Zittrain calls ``privication'' _ where code
enables the distribution of information to a large audience while
not releasing it into general circulation.
</P>
<P>
   While some panic, others counsel caution. Pamela Samuelson, an
intellectual property specialist at the University of California at
Berkeley's law school, Boalt Hall, may have it right when she says
that despite ominous signs, ``We're in a transitional period where
Fair Use still has a future.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston University Law School professor Maureen O'Rourke agrees.
``The question is, does the law need to intervene at this point or
wait for the market to evolve?'' she asks rhetorically. ``It is
premature to do anything to stop the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But few outside the recording and movie industries, including
O'Rourke, are happy with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of
1998, a leviathan federal law that made it a felony for someone
merely to attempt circumvention of protective code. Mark Lemley,
Samuelson's colleague at Boalt Hall, calls this ``unilateral
technology disarmament'' in which one side uses code to build a
wall, but the other side cannot use technology to crack it.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 act has already triggered an important legal fight. In
January, Norwegian authorities detained a 16-year-old youth who
hacked his way through the DVD encryption code and then posted his
program, called DeCSS, on the Net. The seven major studios that
comprise the MPAA then filed federal suits in New York and
Connecticut under the DMCA, alleging copyright infringement against
individuals who exploited the DeCSS technology.
</P>
<P>
   The movie industry moved fast to avoid the mayhem that hit the
RIAA ranks. ``We watched the savaging of the music industry. They
were first in the line of fire,'' says MPAA spokesman Richard
Taylor. ``There were lessons to be learned.''
</P>
<P>
   But new problems may arise from the DMCA. Jane Ginsburg, an
intellectual property specialist at Columbia Law School, worries
about the inability of code to identify motives behind the copying
of a film in the wake of the DMCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same device that could stop me from copying a whole movie
could also stop me from copying a small amount of the movie to show
to my class,'' says Ginsburg. ``In that case, the copy would be
locked up and I couldn't circumvent the lock because of the DMCA.
Here is where the existence of an alternative copy is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other sources, says Valenti, such as
Blockbuster Video and cable television. But will Blockbuster even
sell ancient technology like VHS cassettes a decade from now?
``These alternatives are only available at the pleasure of the
publisher,'' said Zittrain.
</P>
<P>
   Big content owners claim they are simply protecting what they
own. But they are short on credibility. These are the folks, after
all, who brought us the Sonny Bono Copyright Act of 1995 that
extended copyright protection to an astonishing 95 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that law, the operating system code of an
antediluvian laptop Radio Shack TRS-80, already ensconced in the
Smithsonian Institution as a museum piece, won't be in the public
domain until 2075. Go figure.

READING `WINNIE THE POOH' ON THE PC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MALCOLM MAYHEW  
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know what it is about Winnie the Pooh that makes me want
to play with him. Not exactly how I like spending my Friday nights,
but I've gotta admit ``Disney's Winnie the Pooh Activity Center''
(Disney Interactive for PC, $40, all ages) has probably been the
most exciting thing happening in my social life since, well, the
Little Mermaid.
</P>
<P>
   This game revolves around the ``Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery
Day'' story. Through pop-up windows, players read the tale, while
at the same time solving a variety of challenges that star Winnie's
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Stop giggling _ this is actually pretty fun. I don't plan on
becoming an interior designer anytime soon, but helping clean up
and decorate Owl's room has occupied me for a few hours. Now if I
could only clean up my pigsty.
</P>
<P>
   Players must also guide Pooh and Piglet through an obstacle
course, build a bridge to stop floating debris and create matching
Heffalumps and Woozles _ whatever those are. I like Pooh and his
pals, but I don't like 'em ``that'' much.
</P>
<P>
   Think I have more racing games on my desk than I do nasty
Post-it notes from editors irked that I never turn my stories in on
time. Right now, the only one that's worth a flip _ the racing
games, not the editors _ is ``Ridge Racer 64'' (Namco for N64),
Nintendo's very successful attempt at porting over a game that did
so well on the Sony PlayStation, that old thing.
</P>
<P>
   Players choose from more than 25 cars and nine courses,
including four new courses that the PlayStation obviously couldn't
handle. That's where ``RR64'' excels: The courses are imaginative
and gorgeously detailed. We've seen construction sites and mountain
ranges and desert roads, but ever play a racing game in which the
course swings by a luxury liner? At night, with all the lights
glimmering? ``That's'' cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``RR'' also pays lots of attention to small details: smoking
tires, skid marks, working (and sometimes nonworking) headlights
and lens flares are all here, making the game that much more
realistic. Good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ``Jackie Chan Stuntmaster'' (Midway for
PlayStation, ages 13 and up, $40) sounded as simple as it did
promising: Kick everyone's behind. But even in this day and age of
Next Gen gaming or whatever, it's easy to mess up something as
simple as a walk-around-and-beat-up-people fighting game.
``Jackie's'' got its cool moments, like you can waste three guys
with one pool stick. But the control's too unresponsive and the
game play's too clunky; it's more frustrating than fun. Rent one of
his movies, instead.

FBI DIRECTOR ASKS FOR TOUGHER INTERNET CRIME LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AUSTIN ZALKIN   
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ FBI Director Louis Freeh urged Congress Tuesday to
ease restraints on law enforcement officials so they can more
aggressively pursue Internet criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh praised pending legislation co-sponsored by Sens. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., and Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. that would make it easier for
investigators to trace e-mails and other Internet communications.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director told the Senate subcommittee on technology,
terrorism and government information that present law requires
investigators to obtain multiple court orders so they can trace a
single communication across judicial districts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require only a single judge's ruling for law
enforcement officials to trace Internet crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not asking for extraordinary powers,'' Freeh told the
panel. ``We are not asking for any more authorities than are
currently contemplated under the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer-Kyl bill would:
</P>
<P>
   _ eliminate the requirement for federal prosecution that an
Internet crime inflict a minimum of $5,000 damage;
</P>
<P>
   _ allow federal prosecutors to go after juvenile offenders as
young as 15 in Internet crime cases. Present law bars prosecutions
of defendants under 18 years of age in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   _ remove the existing six-month minimum sentence for convicted
offenders, which Kyl said keeps lesser offenders from being tried
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh told the panel that Internet crimes should also carry
tougher penalties. The damage caused by Internet criminals
outweighs the length of jail terms currently handed down in such
cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said the FBI needs a bigger budget to go after these new
Internet criminals, explaining that the bureau's computer intrusion
caseload had doubled since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI handled almost 500 cases of cyber child
pornography last year, including instances where adults arranged
via the Internet to travel across state lines to have sex with
minors. This type of crime is `a completely new phenomenon,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a member of the panel, noted
that even the FBI's web site was brought down by hackers last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said Congress must make it possible for private companies
victimized by cyber crime to come forward and prosecute offenders
without fear of disclosing their own trade secrets. He said he
would support a measure to close judicial proceedings to the public
in some cases to protect a business' confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, Freeh said that the FBI coordinates its
anti-terrorism efforts with many nations, including `almost a
seamless'' relationship with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He reported that FBI agents and computer examiners had worked
with other nations to get `direct access to computers, hard drives,
which in some cases were the actual plans of terrorists to murder
Americans, large numbers of Americans.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Why would Elian want to leave all this fun?
 &HT;    (For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ So, Diane Sawyer quotes little Elian as saying he
doesn't want to go back to Cuba. And Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the
nun who hosted the bizarre reunion of Elian and his grandmothers in
which, allegedly, they bit his tongue and checked his penis, feels
the child would do better here _ because of something either Elian
or the grandmothers implied to her.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the convenient introduction of aberrations of the
Virgin Mary in nearby Miami locales, and we've got a situation that
begs rationality.
</P>
<P>
   I do not doubt that Elian told Sawyer he did not want to go
home, or that he told it to her several times in response to
modified questions. That ABC did not air Elian actually saying it,
instead left Sawyer to tell us he said it, is not flawless
documentation, but I'll accept it.
</P>
<P>
   But put yourself in Elian's shoes. You're 6 years old. In Cuba,
you've lived a moderate life (despite what strident Cuban exiles
insist is one of poverty). Videotape of your fifth birthday party
shows a bunch of kids and family in your Cardenas home, wearing
party hats, bringing gifts. There's a birthday cake. Everyone seems
fairly well dressed, no one looks starved _ and someone can afford
a video camera to record it!
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing, however, to what you have received in Miami. The
gifts just don't stop pouring in. You've got every toy imaginable,
toys I'm certain you never would have received in Cuba. You are
driven to school every day, and picked up.
</P>
<P>
   You are a celebrity. Every time you come out of your Miami home,
there are people there to cheer you, to photograph you. You are on
TV just about every day, everyone in radio is talking about you,
all those Cuban flags are waving for you out in the street. Great
Uncle Lazaro Gonzalez keeps raising you atop his shoulders so that
you may wave to the cameras and people.
</P>
<P>
   Even Diane Sawyer comes down from New York to roll around the
classroom floor with you.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's fun, isn't it, Elian?
</P>
<P>
   Would any 6-year-old want to give this up? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the things your Miami relatives are telling
you, things about Cuba, about your father. So what if they coach
you on what to do or say? They're nice people, have your best
interests at heart; right?
</P>
<P>
   Remember that second day with the relatives back in December,
when you flashed that V-for-Victory sign from the car window after
coming home from a hearing? You learned that in Cuba, didn't you?
Oh, you didn't? One of the relatives here taught you that? Oh, how
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't fathom yet, Elian _ and it's because you are too
young _ is that you are, simply, a political instrument. It's not
really about you, it's about Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not for you to worry about _ yet. You're only 6. If
you go home, maybe when you grow up, you can wrestle Cuba away from
Castro's communism. But if you stay here, then you'll just
eventually melt into the population. Soon the flags and TV cameras
will go away. Oh, you'll still be held high as a symbol, but the
luster will fade.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, everything's great! Why go home? Tell
Ms. Sawyer you want to stay, tell her you don't even want your
father coming here because he may take you home _ and the attention
at home was never like it is here.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine, Elian: nearly 100,000 (Cuban) flag-waving
protesters filled Miami's streets Wednesday night in favor of
keeping you here, shouting your name.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the Virgin Mary, too.
</P>
<P>
   No, I would have said the same thing to the TV lady.
</P>
<P>
   Go home? Leave this? No way, Jose!

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Double-barreled double-talk from the NRA
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association's phony cry-babying over the
Clinton administration's supposed failure to enforce existing gun
laws bids fair to make ``crocodile indignation'' a companion cliche
to ``crocodile tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's lament is thick and oily with insincerity. Going
beyond mere gall, the NRA is showing more cheek than a strip club
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Except for locking up criminals after the fact, the lobby has
consistently opposed firearms legislation and has politically
harassed federal enforcement of many of the very laws it now
pretends to wish were being more vigorously enforced.
</P>
<P>
   It was the NRA, remember, that notoriously equated agents of the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms with Nazi storm
troopers. It has portrayed federal law enforcement officers as
booted thugs kicking in the doors of innocent citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in good part to NRA lobbying, we have laws that let
convicted felons regain their legal right to buy firearms. NRA
pressure led Congress in 1986 to enact the Firearms Owners'
Protection Act, which, along with legislating other hobbles on
enforcement, limits unannounced ATF inspections of gun dealers to
one a year.
</P>
<P>
   More? Well, although it fought the Brady Act requiring
background checks for gun buyers, the lobby now declares and
denounces a federal failure to charge all felons who try to buy
guns they have no legal right to. But many of those supposed lapses
come under state, not federal, supervision of the law.
</P>
<P>
   And the law, as the NRA knows, limits such prosecutions to
persons who knowingly attempt to buy guns contrary to law. Even
then, more might be called to legal account if the short-handed ATF
didn't have to settle for cherry-picking the most dangerous
violators.
</P>
<P>
   Where the ATF had 2,448 agents and inspectors in 1973, currently
it is budgeted for 2,648 _ an increase of just 200 for very
different times. The NRA regularly lobbies against increases.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA pushed for the huge loophole that leaves private gun
sales unregulated, a means by which firearms are slipped to
criminals by legal but unscrupulous buyers who resell, no questions
asked. It is fighting a Clinton administration proposal to close
another big loophole that allows gun-show sales without background
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the administration isn't doing all it could to prosecute
gun violators. It would take a complicated audit to find out. (Not
a bad idea, by the way.) But many violations can be prosecuted
either under federal or state laws. It is apparently one of the
NRA's tricks to count referrals to state prosecution as federal
defaults.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional group is working up legislation that would add
1,000 new state, local and federal prosecutors for gun crimes and
500 ATF agents and inspectors, would increase dealer inspections
and would improve record-keeping for domestic-violence offenders
who are ineligible to buy firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's enthusiasm for this beefed-up enforcement is more
hoped for than counted on.

 &HT;    Bhopal disaster catches up with ex-Union Carbide CEO
 &HT;    By Molly Hennessy-Fiske
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH _ For 14 years, Warren Anderson has lived in quiet
retirement, relaxing with his wife, taking walks on the beach and
traveling between his seaside homes here and on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   But as of January, the former head of Union Carbide was an
international fugitive, sought by private detectives, Interpol and
the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? He was CEO of Union Carbide in 1984 when a gas leak
at a Carbide-owned plant killed thousands of Indians in the city of
Bhopal.
</P>
<P>
   Private detectives were searching for him to serve him a summons
stemming from a class-action suit filed in New York City. The
Indian government has a criminal warrant for his arrest and alerted
Interpol.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney in the class action said last week that the search
has ended.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson could be at home in Bridgehampton on New York's Long
Island or in the Seaforest development on State Road A1A near Vero
Beach. In the gated Seaforest community, the Andersons' home stands
among about 40 other brick and stucco houses. Its windows are open
and a car is visible in the garage when the door rises now and
then. The silver 1992 Chevy Caprice belongs to Anderson's wife,
Lillian. Those who rang the bell earlier this month, including a
repairman, were greeted by an older man who stands about 6-foot-2,
thin, with glasses and a head of white hair. A man not unlike
Warren Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Anderson said last week that her husband is in Vero
Beach but would not answer questions about the new case.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said they have seen activity at the house but would
not comment on whether they spotted Anderson himself. After being
inundated with calls from servers, reporters (including The New
York Times and several magazines) and the generally curious, many
felt protective of a neighbor who moved in seeking peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That issue was decided 15 years ago,'' said neighbor John
Jandzen. ``There's nothing any of his good friends can do.''
Jandzen said he had not heard of the new suit, although he has been
``besieged'' by calls.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, neighbor Eleanor Harpring said she would
usually run into Lillian Anderson while walking but that the
``quiet, unassuming'' couple often kept to themselves. Theirs was
not a house that hosted cocktail parties, and in the neighborhood
of $300,000 to $700,000 homes, many protect their privacy. Even
backyard patios have walls that are 6 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want to see a soul, you don't have to,'' Harpring
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth McCallion, a Manhattan attorney, wants to see Anderson.
McCallion's firm filed the civil suit against Anderson. McCallion
said private investigators spent months trying to find Anderson at
his homes here and in New York.
</P>
<P>
   According to a March 5 New York Times article, the Indian
government contacted Interpol in an effort to locate Anderson. Last
week, U.S. Interpol officials said they had begun to ask other
Interpol agencies about the search for Anderson after receiving
calls from Florida authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Union Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn., previously refused the
summons service, contending the 1989 settlement prevented
subsequent claims against Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Replied McCallion, the Manhattan attorney who filed the suit:
``He should tell it to the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The search ended March 9 when Union Carbide attorneys finally
accepted a summons on Anderson's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Satinath Sarangi, a member of Bhopal Group for Information and
Action that is a plaintiff in the suit, said he has been searching
for Anderson since the Indian government issued a warrant for his
arrest in April 1992 on charges that include manslaughter, assault
and the killing and poisoning of animals. The warrant was issued
after Union Carbide and Anderson settled an initial suit in 1989
and left the country just as the Indian government began a criminal
trial against Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something had gone wrong,'' Sarangi said. Union Carbide and
Anderson ``had said they would submit themselves to the (Indian)
courts, and when they didn't, the court didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Union Carbide spokesmen said all charges against the U.S.
company and Anderson were severed from those of the Indian
subsidiary. The company later sold its interest in the subsidiary
and contributed more than $70 million to build and operate a new
Bhopal hospital. Sarangi, who works at a free clinic in Bhopal,
said the hospital has yet to open.
</P>
<P>
   The new suit alleges that Union Carbide officials, even after
agreeing to the settlement, failed to accept fault for the
disaster. Union Carbide spokesmen don't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   In statements put forth at the time of the leak and today on the
company Web site, executives blame the toxic gas leak on an outside
saboteur, at one point indicating the culprit may have belonged to
a Sikh terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an act of a disgruntled employee,'' spokesman Tom
Sprick said. ``Our investigation and that of an independent firm,
A.D. Little, confirmed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Company attorneys filed a motion Jan. 27 to dismiss the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a settlement in place that includes all employees,
including Warren Anderson,'' spokesman Sean Clancey said. Clancey
said Union Carbide ``fulfilled our moral responsibility'' to the
victims of the Bhopal disaster through relief efforts, for which
Anderson himself flew to India. But advocacy groups now say the
company stopped far short of what was needed to heal the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Company estimates peg the number of dead at 3,800 and those
permanently disabled at 2,680.
</P>
<P>
   Sarangi said that when he arrived to treat the wounded in
December 1984, many thousands had already died from the effects of
the leaking pesticide gas. He contends that between 16,000 and
20,000 death claims have been filed, and another 120,000 suffer
chronic illnesses, including vision and breathing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to accept and take care of people,'' Sarangi said of
the company. ``They can't just write it off like a balance sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarangi said the plaintiffs filed the new suit under the Alien
Torts Claims Act, granting the U.S. court jurisdiction, and hope to
win enough money to support comprehensive medical care for victims.
Although 16 years have passed since the accident, any statute of
limitations on the suit would have to take into account years spent
negotiating where the initial civil case would be tried _ New York
or India _ and attempting to subpoena defendants, including
Anderson.

GOING BEHIND `BEHIND THE MUSIC' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIMOTHY FINN  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  VH1 will air three ``Behind the
Music'' premieres in April: Oasis on April 2, the Police on April
16 and, as part of a ``BTM Music Marathon,'' No Doubt on April 23.
Show times are 8 p.m. central time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question was trivial; the response was, in the music world
anyway, profound. Sometime in spring 1997, Jeff Gaspin, an
executive producer at the cable-TV music channel VH1, idly
wondered: What ever happened to Milli Vanilli?
</P>
<P>
   That led to a few conversations and phone calls with colleagues
and then some earnest research. A few months later, in August 1997,
VH1 had produced the first two ``Behind the Music'' documentaries:
one on MC Hammer, the defunct//bankrupt '90s pop-rapper; the other
on Milli Vanilli, the fraudulent, lip-syncing Grammy-winning duo.
</P>
<P>
   The show was an instant success: 5 million people combined tuned
into the two episodes, making it at that time the most-watched
original series in the network's 12-year history.
</P>
<P>
   This month VH1 aired its 100th episode of ``Behind the Music,''
focusing, appropriately, on Tina Turner, a woman whose life story
is filled with the kind of pathos, mayhem and personal triumph that
has made ``BTM'' famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The series has become a cultural phenomenon,'' said George
Moll, VH1's vice president of West Coast production and one of the
series' executive producers. ``I've been involved in lots of TV
shows in my career, but not in one that generates the kind of
reaction this one does.''
</P>
<P>
   The network gets some of its highest ratings from ``BTM,'' but
most artists profiled on the series benefit from an immediate spike
in record sales.
</P>
<P>
   Take Def Leppard, whose wild and tragic ``BTM'' episode first
ran on June 21, 1998. According to figures from SoundScan, sales of
the band's ``Greatest Hits'' record jumped 75 percent in two weeks.
Combined sales of the band's three studio records jumped 41 percent
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   One year after his ``BTM'' episode ran, Tony Orlando wrote a
thank-you letter to Moll that flatly stated: ``There has been a
professional reaction where my audiences have quadrupled.''
</P>
<P>
   Such displays of gratitude have made it easier for VH1 to
convince artists that a ``BTM'' episode might be a good career
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first six months, getting artists to agree to do one was
like pulling teeth,'' Moll said from his Los Angeles office. ``But
after that ... let's just say it didn't take the industry long to
see that compelling TV can be an important marketing force.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex, drugs, mayhem
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people work for ``Behind the Music,'' including
technical and legal advisers, but a team of three or four _
producer, associate producer and a researcher or two _ does most of
the work on each episode, which takes about four months to produce.
</P>
<P>
   The show is narrated by Jim Forbes, a veteran TV news producer
and correspondent who has become a popular fixture in the series.
Forbes wrote and produced ``Selena: Behind the Music,'' which won
an American Latino Media Arts Award in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Each ``BTM'' episode costs an average of $200,000 or so, much of
which is spent getting legal clearance to use music clips and video
footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What separates us from the other biography shows,'' Moll said,
``is we make the commitment to get the artists or the artists'
estates involved. The viewer gets the story from the artists and
hears the original music with it, which is very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is, we've earned the trust of the artistic
community. We handle sensitive topics in a dignified manner.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the music adds vital flavor, but those ``sensitive
topics'' are what viewers sink their teeth into: drug and alcohol
jags; car, van and plane wrecks; bankruptcies; prison time and
backstage orgies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said the show works because people like to see
their stars knocked down to size,'' Gaspin told the Los Angeles
Times last year, ``but I think it's more that they like to see that
their heroes are human ... They have problems with sex and money,
and that's something the viewer can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all problems about sex and money are the same, though. The
most infamous ``BTM'' episodes tend to be those that cover the
swashbuckling heavy metal bands who party as hard as they rock.
</P>
<P>
   One of the series' most memorable moments came from Nikki Sixx,
the Crue's bass player, who impassively recalled a near-death
experience. He overdosed on heroin, turned blue and died, was
revived in the ambulance, skipped out of the emergency room, went
back home, shot up again, passed out and woke up the next day, the
needle still in his arm and his hand caked in his own blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have it on tape,'' Moll said, ``artists saying, `I just
don't want to come off as Spinal Tap when I'm telling my story.' So
we are careful. As tempting as it may have been with some artists,
we have never mocked anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen idol
</P>
<P>
   The most popular ``BTM'' episode _ and the second most-watched
program in VH1 history _ was the premiere of ``Shania Twain: Behind
the Music.'' Nearly 6.5 million viewers watched the show, which
first aired April 14, 1988. Since then Twain's episode has been
rerun more than any other ``BTM'' episode: 73 times. (Madonna's is
second with 63 reruns.)
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary stars may draw the most viewers, but the most
indelible shows tend to be about the artists who haven't seen a ray
of limelight in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy George show remains one of my favorites,'' Moll said.
``And the Leif Garrett episode is certainly one of the most
memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Garrett ``BTM'' starts typically: Teen idol gets famous,
overindulges in fortune and stardom and falls out of fashion.
Toward the end, though, the show takes a twist: Garrett is reunited
with Roland Winkler, a friend he hadn't seen in more than 20 years
_ since the day Winkler was crippled in a car accident in which
Garrett was driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things we do when we start working on a show
is run a Nexus search of newspaper articles,'' said Paul Gallagher,
an associate producer of the Garrett episode. ``Our search turned
up this $7 million settlement against Leif. Needles to say, I was
shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   During standard preliminary interviews with Garrett, Gallagher
asked him about the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly a very sensitive issue with him,'' Gallagher
said. ``He told me, `I don't know where to find him.'...
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 10 minutes (on the Internet) to find Roland. I
barely got the question out _ `Would you like to meet with Leif
Garrett' _ when he said yes...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an extremely emotionally charged moment, watching these
two people who had been very close come together after a tragic
accident and after so much time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaspin told The Times: ``It was definitely an uncomfortable
moment ... (but) it struck a nerve and really got people talking
about the show.''
</P>
<P>
   They did more than talk. Two weeks after the episode's premiere,
fans bought 152 copies of ``The Leif Garrett Collection'' _ 152
more than they bought the week before the show was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   VH1 has dozens of ``BTM'' episodes in production (AC//DC, Ricky
Martin, the Monkees), dozens more in development (Pearl Jam, Tupac
Shakur, the Eagles) and a ``hot list'' of artists it is considering
(Public Enemy, Keith Richards, Jerry Garcia).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have embarked on some projects that have been shelved
because the artists have tried to be too controlling,'' Moll said.
(One of those, Gaspin told Entertainment Weekly, is Chaka Khan.)
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' Moll said, ``there are projects we really want to
do, but the artists are reluctant to agree, like Peter Frampton.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaspin told The Times last year that he figured ``Behind the
Music'' could do about 150 shows before the material started
thinning appreciably, but that threshold seems a bit low.
</P>
<P>
   Five or 10 years from now, everyone from Britney Spears to Kid
Rock will have stories to tell and dormant records to sell. And
styles of music may come and go, but gossip never falls out of
fashion.

UNLEASHING YOUR INNER COMEDIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GUTIERREZ  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know people whose faces would crack if they ever smiled,
people who sniff at April Fools' jokes, people who make you want to
yell: Aw, lighten up!
</P>
<P>
   It's not nice to yell.
</P>
<P>
   But you have science on your side when the boss writes you up
for slipping a whoopee cushion onto your colleague's ergonomic
office chair.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, from cancer patients and nurses to employees
at Fortune 500 companies, people are lightening up. In workshops
and summer camps, they're learning to be playful and silly, to
appreciate irony, to be the butt of their own jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Research of humor used as therapy shows that it speeds recovery
times, increases creativity and productivity on the job and reduces
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been ongoing recognition that humor and laughter and a
sense of play is good for us, physically, psychologically and
spiritually,'' says psychologist Ed Dunkelblau, immediate past
president of the American Association for Therapeutic Humor, based
in St. Louis. ``This is not a new concept.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, it's right there in the Bible's Book of
Proverbs: ``A cheerful heart is good medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   We're no doctors, so we consulted with ``professionals'' _
comedians at Stanford &AMP; Sons Comedy Club in Westport _ to prescribe
a six-step program to unstarch your shorts and loosen that stiff
upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragedy's gonna happen every day. Planes are going to crash.
People are going to starve. In order to accept it all you have to
make some sense of it, and that sense is humor,'' counsels Bryan
``Comedy King'' Burgess, Stanford's booking agent.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to want to change. Like an alcoholic, you must
first acknowledge that you have a problem because ``there are
people you can't fix,'' says Jim Fite, a man with a rowdy tenor
laugh who directs the International Center for Humor and Health in
Edmond, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who join Weight Watchers 10, 20 times and
never lose weight. And the reason they never lose weight is that
they still perceive themselves as fat people.''
</P>
<P>
   So repeat after us: Hi, my name is (fill in the blank). And I am
a killjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you're ready.
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: Laugh at yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if people are looking to find humor in life, the first
place you need to look is in the mirror. I'm the butt of 70 percent
of my jokes,'' says Joe Caronia, who's been working the crowds at
Stanford's for a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   The day comedian John Candy died, Caronia, always joking about
his own weight, called one of his heavyweight comic brethren and
crowed: ``We just moved up one!''
</P>
<P>
   When you look in the mirror and ``have big ears, realize you
have big ears. And that it's funny,'' says newcomer comic Justin
Leon, whose ears aren't particularly large.
</P>
<P>
   Leon makes a lot of jokes based on being black, like the time
when the old woman in the beat-up car locked her doors when she saw
him in the next lane on the highway. ``We were going 65 miles an
hour! What did she think I was going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The choice is this: Joke or get ticked off. ``If I lived
miserable, I'd be a miserable man,'' Leon says. ``I'd be my
father!''
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Avoid joy-suckers.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to surround yourself with people who make you
feel happy and make you laugh. ``Being around funny people makes
you funny,'' Leon promises.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Chris Porter, a dead ringer for the cartoon character
Doug, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get around people who make you laugh if you
spend all day with some (bleep, bleep) in the next cubicle,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Learn to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter reduces stress and stimulates the body's endorphins.
Laughter is an outlet, like singing out loud in the shower, Burgess
of Stanford's says.
</P>
<P>
   Can't get a good belly laugh rolling? Practice, practice,
practice. Stand in front of the mirror, ``take off whatever you
need, and just start laughing,'' Fite at the Center for Humor and
Health says.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4: Keep humorous stimuli around.
</P>
<P>
   Create a humor file _ a stash of written jokes or other things
that make you laugh _ that you can pull out when the need arises.
Keep a humorous calendar on your desk at work.
</P>
<P>
   Or ``mirth'' the Net, says Dunkelblau, the psychologist who
keeps an ``emergency tape'' of comedian Emo Philips in his car.
``The Net has hundreds of thousands of laughter resources. There
are tons and tons of joke sites, humorous prose. It's everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's even easier than that, say the comedians, who cull
their best material from things that go on around them every day.
Just open your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Step 5: Relax.
</P>
<P>
   Try a technique called ``freeze frame.'' Unless you're driving,
close your eyes and call to mind a pleasant, restful image. ``It
works almost immediately,'' says psychologist Dunkelblau, whose
freeze-frame snapshot is of a shady spot on a beach, with good food
and someone interesting to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Step 6: Cock your head to one side and look at life with fresh
eyes. It's like when you get stumped playing Scrabble. You walk
away from the board and when you come back, ``boom, you find a
25-point word,'' Leon says.  &LR; tag1:To reach Lisa Gutierrez, features

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE DECLINE OF CIVIL VIRTUE
 &HT;    Moving in the (k) commentary and (p) political categories.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Apr. 2.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You hear lots of talk these days among the winners
of the Cold War about how the Russians still can't get their act
together. A decade after the collapse of communism, it's
fashionable to kick around a nation led by an ex-KGB spy with a
knack for stirring up a patriotic fever over rebellious Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Brand the Russian voters as dysfunctional dupes if you want. But
they sure do know how to reach their polling places to perform
their civic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 percent of eligible voters turned out in the recent
Russian presidential election. Even in bombed-out Chechnya, two of
every three adults managed to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The overall turnout was almost the same as in the 1996
presidential race, which Boris Yeltsin won handily. I saw ballots
being cast in a Moscow prison, where inmates awaiting sentence
retain their voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, we've been honing democratic values for
nearly two and a quarter centuries. But for all of that, in our
last presidential election voter turnout for the first time dipped
below the halfway mark. There's scant reason to believe we'll do
any better this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at what's happening with the census, the
once-a-decade head count mandated by the Constitution. Some three
weeks ago, the U.S. Census Bureau mailed out 115 million
questionnaires, backed by a $168 million ad drive.
</P>
<P>
   The national goal: a 70 percent mail-in response by April 11,
when census takers are due to begin knocking on doors. The response
at the halfway mark: a low 46 percent. The percentage of
``entities'' that have met their target, as reported on the
bureau's official Web site: less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national response rate of 70 percent would signal that the
country has reversed a decades-long decline in civic
participation,'' says census director Kenneth Prewitt. The final
response rate was 78 percent in 1970, 75 percent in 1980 and 65
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a decline in what the ancient Greeks once called
civic virtue is occurring at a time when the rapid convergence of
satellite, computer, television, radio, telephone, and print
services make it easier than ever for all comers to join in the new
digital democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Gutenberg made it possible for anyone to read. The Xerox machine
made it possible for anyone to publish. The Internet makes it
possible for everybody to experience just about anything and
everything.
</P>
<P>
   But can the Internet rekindle that old-time civic spirit, that
proud sense of community when folks turned out for political
picnics? About the most we can hope for: Our ever-present political
polls will detect a nostalgia gap, prompting the presidential
campaigns to respond by staging more made-for-TV election rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, our political ways are much better than Russia's. But just
what is it that we've managed to empower?
</P>
<P>
   It should be more than merely an enhanced ability to retreat
into like-minded communities -- places we fear leaving to cast
ballots, lest by doing so we're placed on jury rosters, places
where census takers are halted by intercoms at security gates.

   Dr. Ronald Livesey couldn't help but feel a little like an
outlaw. Perhaps it was the syringe, the vial of clear liquid and
the alcohol swipe wrapped in aluminum foil. Perhaps it was the fact
that he was sitting in his underwear on a toilet in a strange hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the syringe almost parallel to his thigh, Livesey, 54,
felt a tiny prick of pain as he gently inserted it just under the
skin. He thought to himself, ``Now I know how a junkie must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't heroin that Livesey was shooting up, but something
called human growth hormone. He spent the weekend playing tourist
in Palm Springs, Calif., where the clinic he'd visited was located.
On Sunday night he boarded a plane for San Francisco, where he was
to attend a conference on internal medicine, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Livesey returned to work at Dartmouth Medical
School's Hitchcock Clinic in Manchester, N.H., he was injecting
himself twice a day. But he didn't tell his fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I would get a reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first month people started noticing: ``You've sure
got a spring in your step,'' they'd say, or ``You're really looking
well these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Livesey wondered how much of this was due to the
placebo effect. But time, he says, has proven otherwise. Three and
a half years after his first visit to the clinic, Livesey has lost
nearly 50 pounds, dropped four inches in his waist and built up 12
pounds of muscle in his upper body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the doctor was so overwhelmed by the changes he saw in
himself that he decided to move to New York and start a practice
specializing in this new therapy that has changed his life:
anti-aging medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made incredible progress,'' says his partner, Dr. Joseph
Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was
40 or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, or hGH, is fast growing in popularity.
Even though the drug typically costs $1,000 a month, at least
10,000 people have begun taking it for anti-aging purposes, says
Dr. Ronald Katz, president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this stuff? Produced by the pituitary gland, human
growth hormone helps maintain tissues and organs, build muscle mass
and reduce fat, keep bones strong and enhance mood and mental
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, hGH levels start slacking off at about age 30.
Anti-aging doctors believe that by returning hormone levels to
those of a 25- or 30-year-old, the age when bodies function at
their peak, we can slow and possibly reverse the effects of age.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging doctors also prescribe sex hormones, adrenal gland
hormones, thyroid supplements and melatonin, if patients are
``deficient'' in those areas. The good ones generally recommend a
diet and exercise regimen to complement the hormones, and many sell
their own nutritional supplements, or ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is attracting all sorts of fans. Diane Gilman, 54,
a New York fashion designer who sells her collections to Saks Fifth
Avenue and Nordstrom as well as on the Home Shopping Network,
injects herself with hGH twice a day. ``I feel like I'm 30. I can
get two to three hours of sleep and wake up feeling like a million
bucks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Maffei, 40, an abstract painter from Fishkill, N.Y., was
worried that he'd run out of gas before he managed to really get
his career off the ground. (He earns most of his income as a
plasterer, but he was able to find a cheap hGH supplier on the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at Country Buffet, charging the steam table
for food with all the other senior citizens,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be isolated with the blue-hair set.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors like Nick Nolte and Dixie Carter admit to using hGH too.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were scarce _ the drug had to be extracted from human
cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human
growth hormone in 1985. While not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for anti-aging purposes, doctors can prescribe it
for anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, founded in Chicago in 1992. The group
now has 8,400 members and has developed its own certification exam.
In order to qualify, a doctor must be either an M.D. or a doctor of
osteopathy and have five years of clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   A4M President Ronald Klatz says it takes two and a half years to
complete the testing process and that there are 460 doctors who
have done so or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual A4M conference, held at the Tropicana Hotel
in Las Vegas, attracted 5,040 attendees _ a hundredfold increase
since its first conference in 1993 _ and 450 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a crowd? There's a good chance it has a lot to do with
money. Ten thousand baby boomers turn 50 each day, meaning that the
market for anti-aging therapy may soon be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mintz, a board-certified radiologist, founded the
Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas just two years ago. With
close to 600 patients, it's probably the country's largest
anti-aging clinic. They come from some 40 states and eight
countries to undergo an all-day medical evaluation and begin an
anti-aging program that generally consists of hormone replacement,
nutritional and other supplements, and diet and exercise
counseling. The average fee? Between $500 and $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous economic opportunity in this,'' Mintz says.
``Our goal is to do an IPO in three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the company has launched an ambitious
``physician partner'' program to extend the Cenegenics name and
program to physicians across the country. (The partners use
Cenegenics' medical protocols and its marketing and billing
services; Cenegenics expands its patient base.) So far 58 doctors
have signed up. Mintz believes that most of the clinic's growth
will come from this program.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was

</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, or hGH, is fast growing in popularity.
Even though the drug typically costs $1,000 a month, at least
10,000 people have begun taking it for anti-aging purposes, says
Dr. Ronald Katz, president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this stuff? Produced by the pituitary gland, human
growth hormone helps maintain tissues and organs, build muscle mass
and reduce fat, keep bones strong and enhance mood and mental
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, hGH levels start slacking off at about age 30.
Anti-aging doctors believe that by returning hormone levels to
those of a 25- or 30-year-old, the age when bodies function at
their peak, we can slow and possibly reverse the effects of age.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging doctors also prescribe sex hormones, adrenal gland
hormones, thyroid supplements and melatonin, if patients are
``deficient'' in those areas. The good ones generally recommend a
diet and exercise regimen to complement the hormones, and many sell
their own nutritional supplements, or ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is attracting all sorts of fans. Diane Gilman, 54,
a New York fashion designer who sells her collections to Saks Fifth
Avenue and Nordstrom as well as on the Home Shopping Network,
injects herself with hGH twice a day. ``I feel like I'm 30. I can
get two to three hours of sleep and wake up feeling like a million
bucks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Maffei, 40, an abstract painter from Fishkill, N.Y., was
worried that he'd run out of gas before he managed to really get
his career off the ground. (He earns most of his income as a
plasterer, but he was able to find a cheap hGH supplier on the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at Country Buffet, charging the steam table
for food with all the other senior citizens,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be isolated with the blue-hair set.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors like Nick Nolte and Dixie Carter admit to using hGH too.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were scarce _ the drug had to be extracted from human
cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human
growth hormone in 1985. While not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for anti-aging purposes, doctors can prescribe it
for anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, founded in Chicago in 1992. The group
now has 8,400 members and has developed its own certification exam.
In order to qualify, a doctor must be either an M.D. or a doctor of
osteopathy and have five years of clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   A4M President Ronald Klatz says it takes two and a half years to
complete the testing process and that there are 460 doctors who
have done so or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual A4M conference, held at the Tropicana Hotel
in Las Vegas, attracted 5,040 attendees _ a hundredfold increase
since its first conference in 1993 _ and 450 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a crowd? There's a good chance it has a lot to do with
money. Ten thousand baby boomers turn 50 each day, meaning that the
market for anti-aging therapy may soon be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mintz, a board-certified radiologist, founded the
Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas just two years ago. With
close to 600 patients, it's probably the country's largest
anti-aging clinic. They come from some 40 states and eight
countries to undergo an all-day medical evaluation and begin an
anti-aging program that generally consists of hormone replacement,
nutritional and other supplements, and diet and exercise
counseling. The average fee? Between $500 and $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous economic opportunity in this,'' Mintz says.
``Our goal is to do an IPO in three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the company has launched an ambitious
``physician partner'' program to extend the Cenegenics name and
program to physicians across the country. (The partners use
Cenegenics' medical protocols and its marketing and billing
services; Cenegenics expands its patient base.) So far 58 doctors
have signed up. Mintz believes that most of the clinic's growth
will come from this program.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

<P>
   Dr. Ronald Livesey couldn't help but feel a little like an
outlaw. Perhaps it was the syringe, the vial of clear liquid and
the alcohol swipe wrapped in aluminum foil. Perhaps it was the fact
that he was sitting in his underwear on a toilet in a strange hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the syringe almost parallel to his thigh, Livesey, 54,
felt a tiny prick of pain as he gently inserted it just under the
skin. He thought to himself, ``Now I know how a junkie must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't heroin that Livesey was shooting up, but something
called human growth hormone. He spent the weekend playing tourist
in Palm Springs, Calif., where the clinic he'd visited was located.
On Sunday night he boarded a plane for San Francisco, where he was
to attend a conference on internal medicine, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Livesey returned to work at Dartmouth Medical
School's Hitchcock Clinic in Manchester, N.H., he was injecting
himself twice a day. But he didn't tell his fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I would get a reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first month people started noticing: ``You've sure
got a spring in your step,'' they'd say, or ``You're really looking
well these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Livesey wondered how much of this was due to the
placebo effect. But time, he says, has proven otherwise. Three and
a half years after his first visit to the clinic, Livesey has lost
nearly 50 pounds, dropped four inches in his waist and built up 12
pounds of muscle in his upper body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the doctor was so overwhelmed by the changes he saw in
himself that he decided to move to New York and start a practice
specializing in this new therapy that has changed his life:
anti-aging medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made incredible progress,'' says his partner, Dr. Joseph
Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was
40 or 45.''

 By JULIA WANG  
 &HT;    CoCo Lee looks to be the happiest person seated in the lobby of
the Four Seasons Hotel in New York. After two months of touring in
Asia _ leapfrogging from Hong Kong to the Philippines, eight
countries in all _ she has finally returned to the states, which
explains her beaming expression. After all, for this globetrotting
California girl, the United States means home.
 &HT;    ``But I'm not really home yet,'' the 23-year-old says, a broad
grin spreading across her pixie face. ``My home is L.A. I miss my
bed so much.''
 &HT;    It's the eve of the stateside premiere of her first American
album, ``Just No Other Way.'' It took nine months to produce,
leading Lee to lovingly compare the making of the album to ``having
a baby.''
 &HT;    ``This album is the greatest challenge of my life,'' she says.
``My greatest challenge and my greatest achievement.''
 &HT;    Even though she has just come off a plane from Asia, the
Chinese-American songstress is already preparing to embark on
another whirlwind concert tour. That is, after she spends a few
weeks in her comfortable bed.
 &HT;    A skillfully crafted collection of urban beats, R&AMP;B ballads, and
soul-sister turns, ``Just No Other Way'' is Lee's debut on the Epic
550 label, and the first release in her unprecedented long-term
contract with Sony Music.
 &HT;    The number of Asian and Asian-American artists who've had
breakthrough pop careers in the United States can be counted on
exactly, well ... no fingers. But Sony is convinced that CoCo is
different _ that, given her undeniable beauty and talent, she'll be
able to convert her considerable success in Asia to blockbuster
stardom in America.
 &HT;    In January, radio stations across the country debuted the
high-energy dance track, ``Do You Want My Love,'' the first of
``Just No Other Way's'' 12 tracks. MTV has added the sleek video _
which puts Lee's toned torso front and center _ to its volume
rotation. And if the song's title sounds similar to the breakout
hit of another ``ethnic crossover'' diva _ Jennifer Lopez's ``If
You Want My Love'' _ maybe that isn't a coincidence. After all,
Sony is the music-industry superpower that successfully turned a
trinity of Latin talents _ Lopez, Marc Anthony and, yes, Ricky
Martin'' _ into an unprecedented international phenomenon.
 &HT;    As far as Sony is concerned, CoCo is on deck. They've put the
full weight of their promotional engine behind ``Just No Other
Way,'' and the album is already generating positive buzz. Six weeks
after its debut in October, it went gold in Korea and platinum in
Singapore. In December, it reached No. 4 on Billboard magazine's
new ``Breaking Artist'' chart.
 &HT;    Lee is quick to acknowledge the power of her Asian fan base:
``People there are very supportive; they see that I'm going to be
the first Asian to make this big crossover,'' she says. ``It's
become like a family thing _ they're rooting for me.''
 &HT;    CoCo was ``discovered'' by Michael Caplan, senior vice president
of A&AMP;R for Epic Records at a Sony International Music conference
held in Miami. Although she was already a hugely successful artist
in Asia, it was the first time Caplan had ever seen Lee perform,
and she bowled him over.
 &HT;    ``Even though she sang all her songs in Mandarin, I was really
amazed by her voice,'' Caplan recalls. In no time, he'd made
arrangements to bring her over to the American side of the pond,
already brainstorming a plan to cross CoCo over.
 &HT;    Caplan paired Lee with the industry's top dance and R&AMP;B
producers, among them Rick Wake, Ray Contreras and the ``Godfather
of House'' Frankie Knuckles.
 &HT;    The result was an album that showcases Lee's ability to both
groove and cool it down _ alternating dance tracks and slow jams _
while giving her the urban credibility she would need to break into
America's more jaded market.
 &HT;    ``We'd heard that she was a huge star in Asia, so we really
didn't know what it would be like to work with her,'' says
Contreras, who cowrote and coproduced ``Do You Want My Love.''
 &HT;    Contreras and his partner, Jimmy Greco, had listened to the only
other English-language album Lee has recorded, primarily consisting
of cover songs. They knew she could sing pop.
 &HT;    ``The question was, could she sing R&AMP;B?'' Contreras says. ``This
genre has a lot of improvisational singing.'' After a pause, he
adds: ``And she totally has the flavor.''
 &HT;    High praise for a young woman who never intended to be a singer
in the first place. In fact, Lee's original career goal was to
become a doctor like her mother, and she says it's still in her
game plan.
 &HT;    Born in Hong Kong, Lee emigrated with her family to San
Francisco at the age of 10, where she effortlessly mustered up the
academic chops needed to pursue her medical dreams. She graduated
fifth grade with top honors, despite having only been in the United
States for a year. She was nominated class president three years in
a row.
 &HT;    By the time she was a senior, she'd won the titles of Miss
Teen-age Chinatown and Winter Ball Princess. After graduating high
school with distinction, Lee was prepared to attend the University
of California at Irvine to pursue pre-med studies.
 &HT;    What happened next was a textbook example of overnight success.
In the summer of 1994, Lee, then 18, vacationed with her family in
Hong Kong. On a whim, her mother entered her in a singing contest,
which happened to be the Hong Kong equivalent of ``Star Search'' _
a launch pad for aspiring entertainers.
 &HT;    At high school singing gigs and weekend outings to karaoke
clubs, Lee was capable of belting out songs from her favorite
childhood artists, such as George Michael, Mary J. Blige and Mariah
Carey. But she'd never formally trained to be a singer, nor had any
singing aspirations.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `No way can I make it,''' Lee recalls. ``I had the
attitude that I just wanted to sing. I wasn't there to win.''
 &HT;    She didn't. She took second place instead, crooning Whitney
Houston's ``Saving All My Love.'' The following day, a Chinese
record label called to sign her up. The first-generation parents
who had encouraged Lee and her two sisters to ``study and get good
grades'' suddenly about-faced, advising the baby of the family to
pursue a singing career.
 &HT;    These days, Lee's mother, whom she says is her ``biggest fan,''
travels with her, acting as her advisor, critic and, of course,
personal physician. ``My mom flies with me all over the place and
takes care of me,'' Lee says.
 &HT;    It's a lot of responsibility for a girl in her early 20s. ``I
try not to think about all that,'' she says carefully. ``When you
start thinking about the pressure, that's when you start messing up
and you go off focus. Right now, it's all good.''
 &HT;    Still, she does concede that she's begun shattering some
misperceptions already.
 &HT;    ``There's always been something of a stereotype that when Asians
sing in English, there's an accent,'' she says. ``When I walk into
that studio, I want everyone to feel that even though I'm Asian,
Coco's got a voice.''

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Recently, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in St. Peter's
Basilica in Rome. In an unprecedented gesture he bowed his head and
said, ``We forgive ... and we humbly ask for forgiveness.''
 &HT;    His sweeping papal apology covered approximately 2,000 years of
sin and wrongdoing. He bravely acknowledged Roman Catholic sins
``committed by some of our brothers,'' which included religious
intolerance toward Jews, ``rejection and exclusion'' of women and
misdeeds committed against the poor, immigrants and indigenous
people.
 &HT;    It was an extraordinary and timely admission, but there was one
gaping omission: an apology to lesbians and gays.
 &HT;    I attended a local reflection of the Pope's pardon in Boston's
Cathedral of the Holy Cross. The evening's service were offered in
the spirit of reconciliation. Cardinal Law of Boston expressed
remorse for the shortcomings of Catholics in the Archdiocese of
Boston since 1808.
 &HT;    ``Now is the acceptable time,'' he said. ``The church should be
a sign of unity, of hope, of justice and of love.''
 &HT;    Law referred to the discrimination Catholics have suffered. ``We
ourselves have suffered as a community of faith the effects of
discrimination and prejudice. All the greater should be our
sorrow.''
 &HT;    Law openly spoke of ``intolerable situations,'' naming ``the
obvious cases of sexual abuse, which have seared us all.''
 &HT;    Calling on all Catholics to abandon exclusivity, he acknowledged
the presence of Orthodox Christians at the service, referring to
them as our ``beloved brothers and sisters with whom we are not yet
in full communion.''
 &HT;    His litany of acknowledgment continued: For ``our revered Jewish
brothers and sisters with whom we share the memory of
discrimination and persecution ... For our Islamic friends with
whom we share the memory of the crusades ... For brothers and
sisters from many racial, ethnic and national backgrounds.''
 &HT;    For everyone but gay and lesbian Catholics, his brothers and
sisters in Christ.
 &HT;    His jarring omission disheartened me _ a faithful gay Catholic.
 &HT;    A few blocks away stands the Jesuit Urban Center where hundreds
of gay Catholics worship each week. Nearby, another inclusive Roman
Catholic community confirms lesbian and gay men members of their
congregation. But these Catholics must hold their liturgical
celebration in an Episcopal church. They were banned from Catholic
church property years ago.
 &HT;    Many lesbian and gay Catholics attend mass in parishes
throughout the Archdiocese of Boston _ and all across America. Yet,
in a prayer service of reconciliation, our spiritual leader
bypassed an opportunity to express sorrow and seek pardon for the
ways in which gays remain the brunt of _ to use the cardinal's own
language _ ``harsh words, unjust treatment, prejudice and
discrimination.''
 &HT;    Out west, however, things were different.
 &HT;    In Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony's apology included the gay
and lesbian community.
 &HT;    ``I ask pardon of our Catholic homosexual and lesbian members
when the Church has appeared to be non-supportive of their
struggles or of falling into homophobia,'' he wrote in a Lenten
message to his archdiocese, dated March 6. ``The Archdiocese has
tried to make amends by establishing a special outreach ministry to
our homosexual and lesbian brothers and sisters, by including them
fully in the life of our parishes and by being attentive to
protecting their civil rights.''
 &HT;    Mahony instituted the ``Ministry with Lesbian and Gay
Catholics,'' which operates from his archdiocesan offices. In his
archdiocese, inattentiveness and homophobia have given way to
acknowledgment and redress.
 &HT;    Now is the acceptable time for gays in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Why not the Archdiocese of Boston? And the other dioceses and
parishes throughout the United States?
 &HT;    When will all God's children be embraced?

CARL WARE'S ASCENSION TO LEADERSHIP AT COKE  
 &HT;

 By ERNEST HOLSENDOLPH  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Carl Ware, a veteran executive at the Coca-Cola Co., had gained
almost legendary stature in the corridors of the world's leading
marketing company. Though he is the first African-American to
become so prominent at the company, his accomplishments transcend
race.
 &HT;    He was the man who bailed the company out at crucial times, such
as in the early 1980s, when the company was challenged by Black
leaders for not providing more opportunities for African-Americans.
Later in the decade, he persuaded Coke and other American
industries to take on antiapartheid leadership.
 &HT;    Last year, when the company was hit by an embarrassing
discrimination lawsuit, Ware, who had urged the company previously
that it needed to do more to promote minorities in the supervisory
ranks, became co-chair of a new advisory committee on diversity.
 &HT;    Through his activities and his standing, Coca-Cola was able to
be one of the favored industries on the agenda of the young Mandela
administration, resulting in significant business advantages in
Southern Africa. Ware, personally, as president of the Africa
operation, was able to establish a model way of doing business on
the continent _ by including Africans in the operation of the
business.
 &HT;    With all of this background, who would have expected that Carl
Ware, of all people, would have been demoted, in effect, last year
by M. Douglas Nester _ and at a time when the company needed to
work on its image? Yet, that's what happened when Ivester, Coke
chairman and chief executive officer, called Ware in and said he
would no longer be reporting directly to the chairman as before.
 &HT;    Ware announced he would retire, moving down to his Coweta
County, Ga., farm where he grew up, to start a new life of writing
and lecturing. Publicly reported to be worth more than $15 million
in Coke stock, Ware didn't really need the aggravation. Just weeks
afterward, however, the tables were turned. Nester got the gate,
when the Coke board of directors stunned the global business
community with the announcement that Australian-born Douglas Daft
would become the next chief executive. Within hours after his
elevation, Daft knocked on Ware's door and sat down with his fellow
group president.
 &HT;    He sought Ware's thoughts and ideas about new directions for the
company, and he then invited Ware to stay on board to help launch
the new administration. Ware, promoted from group president to
executive vice president, now sits on the powerful six-member Coke
executive committee, which guides the company's major decisions.
 &HT;    He will oversee global communications, corporate external
affairs, governmental relations and corporate services. Ware
assumes his new role at a time en the company is trying to put
behind it a nightmare year of public relations embarrassments,
regulatory challenges, an equal employment lawsuit, stagnant sales,
and a long slide in the company stock price _ which undoubtedly
played a role in the company's ouster of Nester.
 &HT;    In his new role, Ware is challenged to formulate and carry out
policies that can begin to turn around the tarnished Coke image,
and its frayed relationships with customers and communities. He is
also charged with the task of revitalizing employee morale.
 &HT;    It is decidedly bigger than a public relations job, and much
bigger than the mere improvement of Black opportunity in the Coke
world.
 &HT;    ``My principal job is to see that our company is welcome
everywhere around the world, and out of all the things I do, that
is my primary, principal task,'' Ware says. ``We simply must
improve relations with everybody. ``I also hope to make Coca-Cola a
place where employees find this to be a more pleasing place to
work.''
 &HT;    Ware, who came to Coca-Cola 26 years ago from his position as
president of the Atlanta City Council, is an old hand at government
relations. But much more will be required of him in his new role,
and on a grander world stage.
 &HT;    Among his major tasks, Ware must be in touch with governments in
more than 200 countries where the company does business. Among his
challenges, he is to make sure the company no longer gets
blindsided _ as it was last year, when a product scare in Belgium
stirred fears across Europe that the company fiercely fought to
allay. Coke products bottled in Belgium were pulled from store
shelves in several countries after scores of consumers became ill.
 &HT;    Experts like Frank Mankiewicz, vice chairman of Hill &AMP; Knowlton,
say Ware appears to have the power and position to carry out his
role. Says Mankiewicz: ``I think he can make a difference _ he has
the keys.''

 By JULIA WANG  
 &HT;    CoCo Lee looks to be the happiest person seated in the lobby of
the Four Seasons Hotel in New York. After two months of touring in
Asia _ leapfrogging from Hong Kong to the Philippines, eight
countries in all _ she has finally returned to the states, which
explains her beaming expression. After all, for this globetrotting
California girl, the United States means home.
 &HT;    ``But I'm not really home yet,'' the 23-year-old says, a broad
grin spreading across her pixie face. ``My home is L.A. I miss my
bed so much.''
 &HT;    It's the eve of the stateside premiere of her first American
album, ``Just No Other Way.'' It took nine months to produce,
leading Lee to lovingly compare the making of the album to ``having
a baby.''
 &HT;    ``This album is the greatest challenge of my life,'' she says.
``My greatest challenge and my greatest achievement.''
 &HT;    Even though she has just come off a plane from Asia, the
Chinese-American songstress is already preparing to embark on
another whirlwind concert tour. That is, after she spends a few
weeks in her comfortable bed.
 &HT;    A skillfully crafted collection of urban beats, R&AMP;B ballads, and
soul-sister turns, ``Just No Other Way'' is Lee's debut on the Epic
550 label, and the first release in her unprecedented long-term
contract with Sony Music.
 &HT;    The number of Asian and Asian-American artists who've had
breakthrough pop careers in the United States can be counted on
exactly, well ... no fingers. But Sony is convinced that CoCo is
different _ that, given her undeniable beauty and talent, she'll be
able to convert her considerable success in Asia to blockbuster
stardom in America.
 &HT;    In January, radio stations across the country debuted the
high-energy dance track, ``Do You Want My Love,'' the first of
``Just No Other Way's'' 12 tracks. MTV has added the sleek video _
which puts Lee's toned torso front and center _ to its volume
rotation. And if the song's title sounds similar to the breakout
hit of another ``ethnic crossover'' diva _ Jennifer Lopez's ``If
You Want My Love'' _ maybe that isn't a coincidence. After all,
Sony is the music-industry superpower that successfully turned a
trinity of Latin talents _ Lopez, Marc Anthony and, yes, Ricky
Martin'' _ into an unprecedented international phenomenon.
 &HT;    As far as Sony is concerned, CoCo is on deck. They've put the
full weight of their promotional engine behind ``Just No Other
Way,'' and the album is already generating positive buzz. Six weeks
after its debut in October, it went gold in Korea and platinum in
Singapore. In December, it reached No. 4 on Billboard magazine's
new ``Breaking Artist'' chart.
 &HT;    Lee is quick to acknowledge the power of her Asian fan base:
``People there are very supportive; they see that I'm going to be
the first Asian to make this big crossover,'' she says. ``It's
become like a family thing _ they're rooting for me.''
 &HT;    CoCo was ``discovered'' by Michael Caplan, senior vice president
of A&AMP;R for Epic Records at a Sony International Music conference
held in Miami. Although she was already a hugely successful artist
in Asia, it was the first time Caplan had ever seen Lee perform,
and she bowled him over.
 &HT;    ``Even though she sang all her songs in Mandarin, I was really
amazed by her voice,'' Caplan recalls. In no time, he'd made
arrangements to bring her over to the American side of the pond,
already brainstorming a plan to cross CoCo over.
 &HT;    Caplan paired Lee with the industry's top dance and R&AMP;B
producers, among them Rick Wake, Ray Contreras and the ``Godfather
of House'' Frankie Knuckles.
 &HT;    The result was an album that showcases Lee's ability to both
groove and cool it down _ alternating dance tracks and slow jams _
while giving her the urban credibility she would need to break into
America's more jaded market.
 &HT;    ``We'd heard that she was a huge star in Asia, so we really
didn't know what it would be like to work with her,'' says
Contreras, who cowrote and coproduced ``Do You Want My Love.''
 &HT;    Contreras and his partner, Jimmy Greco, had listened to the only
other English-language album Lee has recorded, primarily consisting
of cover songs. They knew she could sing pop.
 &HT;    ``The question was, could she sing R&AMP;B?'' Contreras says. ``This
genre has a lot of improvisational singing.'' After a pause, he
adds: ``And she totally has the flavor.''
 &HT;    High praise for a young woman who never intended to be a singer
in the first place. In fact, Lee's original career goal was to
become a doctor like her mother, and she says it's still in her
game plan.
 &HT;    Born in Hong Kong, Lee emigrated with her family to San
Francisco at the age of 10, where she effortlessly mustered up the
academic chops needed to pursue her medical dreams. She graduated
fifth grade with top honors, despite having only been in the United
States for a year. She was nominated class president three years in
a row.
 &HT;    By the time she was a senior, she'd won the titles of Miss
Teen-age Chinatown and Winter Ball Princess. After graduating high
school with distinction, Lee was prepared to attend the University
of California at Irvine to pursue pre-med studies.
 &HT;    What happened next was a textbook example of overnight success.
In the summer of 1994, Lee, then 18, vacationed with her family in
Hong Kong. On a whim, her mother entered her in a singing contest,
which happened to be the Hong Kong equivalent of ``Star Search'' _
a launch pad for aspiring entertainers.
 &HT;    At high school singing gigs and weekend outings to karaoke
clubs, Lee was capable of belting out songs from her favorite
childhood artists, such as George Michael, Mary J. Blige and Mariah
Carey. But she'd never formally trained to be a singer, nor had any
singing aspirations.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `No way can I make it,''' Lee recalls. ``I had the
attitude that I just wanted to sing. I wasn't there to win.''
 &HT;    She didn't. She took second place instead, crooning Whitney
Houston's ``Saving All My Love.'' The following day, a Chinese
record label called to sign her up. The first-generation parents
who had encouraged Lee and her two sisters to ``study and get good
grades'' suddenly about-faced, advising the baby of the family to
pursue a singing career.
 &HT;    These days, Lee's mother, whom she says is her ``biggest fan,''
travels with her, acting as her advisor, critic and, of course,
personal physician. ``My mom flies with me all over the place and
takes care of me,'' Lee says.
 &HT;    It's a lot of responsibility for a girl in her early 20s. ``I
try not to think about all that,'' she says carefully. ``When you
start thinking about the pressure, that's when you start messing up
and you go off focus. Right now, it's all good.''
 &HT;    Still, she does concede that she's begun shattering some
misperceptions already.
 &HT;    ``There's always been something of a stereotype that when Asians
sing in English, there's an accent,'' she says. ``When I walk into
that studio, I want everyone to feel that even though I'm Asian,
Coco's got a voice.''

struggles or of falling into homophobia,'' he wrote in a Lenten
message to his archdiocese, dated March 6. ``The Archdiocese has
tried to make amends by establishing a special outreach ministry to
our homosexual and lesbian brothers and sisters, by including them
fully in the life of our parishes and by being attentive to
protecting their civil rights.''
 &HT;    Mahony instituted the ``Ministry with Lesbian and Gay
Catholics,'' which operates from his archdiocesan offices. In his
archdiocese, inattentiveness and homophobia have given way to
acknowledgment and redress.
 &HT;    Now is the acceptable time for gays in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Why not the Archdiocese of Boston? And the other dioceses and
parishes throughout the United States?
 &HT;    When will all God's children be embraced?

CARL WARE'S ASCENSION TO LEADERSHIP AT COKE

 By ERNEST HOLSENDOLPH  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Carl Ware, a veteran executive at the Coca-Cola Co., had gained
almost legendary stature in the corridors of the world's leading
marketing company. Though he is the first African-American to
become so prominent at the company, his accomplishments transcend
race.
 &HT;    He was the man who bailed the company out at crucial times, such
as in the early 1980s, when the company was challenged by Black
leaders for not providing more opportunities for African-Americans.
Later in the decade, he persuaded Coke and other American
industries to take on antiapartheid leadership.
 &HT;    Last year, when the company was hit by an embarrassing
discrimination lawsuit, Ware, who had urged the company previously
that it needed to do more to promote minorities in the supervisory
ranks, became co-chair of a new advisory committee on diversity.
 &HT;    Through his activities and his standing, Coca-Cola was able to
be one of the favored industries on the agenda of the young Mandela
administration, resulting in significant business advantages in
Southern Africa. Ware, personally, as president of the Africa
operation, was able to establish a model way of doing business on
the continent _ by including Africans in the operation of the
business.
 &HT;    With all of this background, who would have expected that Carl
Ware, of all people, would have been demoted, in effect, last year
by M. Douglas Nester _ and at a time when the company needed to
work on its image? Yet, that's what happened when Ivester, Coke
chairman and chief executive officer, called Ware in and said he
would no longer be reporting directly to the chairman as before.
 &HT;    Ware announced he would retire, moving down to his Coweta
County, Ga., farm where he grew up, to start a new life of writing
and lecturing. Publicly reported to be worth more than $15 million
in Coke stock, Ware didn't really need the aggravation. Just weeks
afterward, however, the tables were turned. Nester got the gate,
when the Coke board of directors stunned the global business
community with the announcement that Australian-born Douglas Daft
would become the next chief executive. Within hours after his
elevation, Daft knocked on Ware's door and sat down with his fellow
group president.
 &HT;    He sought Ware's thoughts and ideas about new directions for the
company, and he then invited Ware to stay on board to help launch
the new administration. Ware, promoted from group president to
executive vice president, now sits on the powerful six-member Coke
executive committee, which guides the company's major decisions.
 &HT;    He will oversee global communications, corporate external
affairs, governmental relations and corporate services. Ware
assumes his new role at a time en the company is trying to put
behind it a nightmare year of public relations embarrassments,
regulatory challenges, an equal employment lawsuit, stagnant sales,
and a long slide in the company stock price _ which undoubtedly
played a role in the company's ouster of Nester.
 &HT;    In his new role, Ware is challenged to formulate and carry out
policies that can begin to turn around the tarnished Coke image,
and its frayed relationships with customers and communities. He is
also charged with the task of revitalizing employee morale.
 &HT;    It is decidedly bigger than a public relations job, and much
bigger than the mere improvement of Black opportunity in the Coke
world.
 &HT;    ``My principal job is to see that our company is welcome
everywhere around the world, and out of all the things I do, that
is my primary, principal task,'' Ware says. ``We simply must
improve relations with everybody. ``I also hope to make Coca-Cola a
place where employees find this to be a more pleasing place to
work.''
 &HT;    Ware, who came to Coca-Cola 26 years ago from his position as
president of the Atlanta City Council, is an old hand at government
relations. But much more will be required of him in his new role,
and on a grander world stage.
 &HT;    Among his major tasks, Ware must be in touch with governments in
more than 200 countries where the company does business. Among his
challenges, he is to make sure the company no longer gets
blindsided _ as it was last year, when a product scare in Belgium
stirred fears across Europe that the company fiercely fought to
allay. Coke products bottled in Belgium were pulled from store
shelves in several countries after scores of consumers became ill.
 &HT;    Experts like Frank Mankiewicz, vice chairman of Hill &AMP; Knowlton,
say Ware appears to have the power and position to carry out his
role. Says Mankiewicz: ``I think he can make a difference _ he has
the keys.''

 By TIM GIAGO 
 &HT;    URBANA, Ill. _ Life for the handful of American Indians living
in the college town of Urbana, Ill., was pretty quiet in 1988 B.C.
Yes, 1988 B.C. _ Before Charlene.
 &HT;    Charlene Teters of the Spokane tribe arrived on campus in 1988
along with Marcus Amerman, a Choctaw, and Norman Akers, an Osage,
as part of a recruiting program by the University of Illinois to
bring Indian students into the arts program.
 &HT;    When the three Indian students arrived on campus, they strolled
the grounds looking for the Indian community. They asked about
Indian student organizations and Indian studies departments. There
were none.
 &HT;    They soon discovered that they made up the Native community.
According to Charlene, ``We stuck together like glue because we
soon began to feel out of place, even unwelcome.''
 &HT;    This uncertainty was brought about in part because of the images
of Indians they saw on and off the campus. They saw caricatures of
Indians on T-shirts, cars, store fronts, parking lots and hotel
lobbies.
 &HT;    They wondered what this was all about. Soon enough, they
discovered it was about the school's mascot _ a white, middle-class
boy dressed up in Indian attire. His name is Chief Illiniwek. The
university's sports and social life seemed to revolve around this
hideous impostor.
 &HT;    Over time, the Indian students observed fraternities and
sororities sponsor events like the Miss Illini Squaw Contest.
 &HT;    ``The neon sign at a local bar featured a dumb caricature of a
cartoon Indian with buck teeth and a bent feather, crosses for
eyes, falling down drunk over and over again,'' Charlene recalled.
``This is also the bar at which fraternity brothers donned their
colored paper headdresses and went to get drunk.''
 &HT;    The peaceful town of Urbana was permeated with such demeaning
caricatures of Indians. Any local event brought out the local
artist's interpretations of cartoon Indians _ usually of drunken,
fat and ugly Indian characters. These hideous pieces of art
decorated T-shirts, cars, businesses, sidewalks and any post or
pole that would hold a poster.
 &HT;    Marcus was the first to explode. When he saw Chief Illiniwek
used as a local celebrity to cut ribbons at mall openings and new
businesses or to greet visiting celebrities, he became incensed. He
wrote a letter to the local student newspaper: ``Perhaps the
inhumane treatment and near genocide of my people hasn't satisfied
your need to humiliate and destroy the image of the original
inhabitants of this country. It makes me wonder how members of
other ethnic and racial groups would react to an environment
saturated with derogatory caricatures of their people,'' he wrote.
 &HT;    Marcus became an immediate pariah. He was threatened and
harassed to such an extent that he left school in the middle of the
night without so much as a goodbye to Charlene and Norman.
 &HT;    One of the professors who helped recruit the three Indian
students broke the news to Charlene and Norman by singing, ``One
little, two little, three little Indians ... two little Indians are
left.''
 &HT;    ``We were crushed by the sheer insensitivity of what was
happening around us _ especially when we were told to keep our
mouths shut and get our degrees and then get out of here,''
Charlene said.
 &HT;    It wasn't in the nature of this Spokane Indian woman to remain
silent. Her children's self-esteem had been badly damaged by the
things they saw at basketball and football games. The constant
demeaning of themselves as Indians began to take its toll.
 &HT;    One day when Chief Illiniwek was giving a talk, Charlene showed
up and challenged him. The Daily Illini reported, ``A Native Indian
graduate student went on the warpath Wednesday,'' and other
newspapers and radio stations soon picked up on it, often making
Teters the butt of jokes.
 &HT;    Charlene soon became a target just as Marcus. Her phone rang off
the hook with obscene and threatening calls. She and her children
were harassed by the local police. Her school-age children became
the targets of other students.
 &HT;    Charlene couldn't go anywhere in this once peaceful town without
drawing the stares and the ire of the local population. She was so
discouraged she was ready to quit school.
 &HT;    She called me one day and we had a long talk because I had been
writing about the use of Indians as mascots for several years. She
also called Ken Sterns of the American Jewish Committee. We both
told her the same thing: ``Charlene, if you quit, they win.''
 &HT;    She stayed and fought. Soon banners began to appear around
campus on walls and vans. ``Keep the Chief. Shoot the Indians.''
Since there were only two Indians left on campus, they knew exactly
who the signs intended to disparage.
 &HT;    Despite her continued efforts, on Oct. 11, 1990, the Board of
Trustees voted to keep the Chief as their mascot.
 &HT;    Charlene graduated and left the campus in August of 1991.
 &HT;    Was her fight worth it? Drive around Urbana today at homecoming
and you no longer see the hideous displays that demeaned the Indian
people. You no longer see the Chief paraded around like some sort
of god. Her selfless efforts did bring about some degree of
sensitivity that did not exist, BC _ Before Charlene.
 &HT;    But as Charlene said this week, ``The battle is far from over.''

 &HT;    GOP's Krusee predicts a redistricting romp
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Republicans are going to control
redistricting in 2001 and make huge gains in the Texas House,
Senate and congressional delegation after the 2002 elections. And
there's not a thing the Democrats can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the spin, at least, from state Rep. Mike Krusee (R-Round
Rock). House GOP Caucus leader Ken Marchant of Coppell has made
Krusee the Republicans' point man on redistricting. He also chairs
Texans for Fair Redistricting, an unincorporated political
association.
</P>
<P>
   If you think there aren't many Democrats in Texans for Fair
Redistricting, you're right. Krusee, a hard-charging Republican who
got his seat by knocking off a Democrat in 1992 in rapidly
Republicanizing Williamson County, has the look of someone who is
thoroughly enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   So here, without filtration, is why Krusee thinks the
Republicans' time has finally come:
</P>
<P>
   In past redistricting, Krusee said, Democrats completely
gerrymandered the lines to protect their incumbents by mounting a
house-to-house search for Democratic voters and cramming as many
Republicans as possible into as few districts as possible. (The
Democrats don't dispute this, though they note they protected
Republican incumbents, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Krusee said the Democrats also took advantage of the 5 percent
population deviation allowed between House districts to favor
Democrats in rural districts at the expense of Republicans in
rapidly growing suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been that districts such as Republican state Rep.
Terry Keel's in Travis County have tens of thousands more people
than some rural districts that are losing population, Krusee said.
</P>
<P>
   What that means, Krusee said, is that Republicans will make huge
gains by reconfiguring the districts to make them compact and
roughly equal in population.
</P>
<P>
   Krusee said the Republicans ``can protect every incumbent we
have'' without gerrymandering. ``There's no Republican incumbent
that has to worry about numbers within the next decade _ so we
don't have to go through those contortions,'' he said. ``We don't
have to cheat. We don't have to split communities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are not going to start with the premise that the
lines that are there are valid,'' Krusee said. ``We're starting
with the premise that they're invalid. It's going to be a new map _
fair to Texans, not fair to politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Texas Legislature should draw redistricting maps for
the Texas House or Senate that the Republicans don't like, their
Republican governor _ be it George W. Bush or current Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry _ can veto it.
</P>
<P>
   And then, under Texas law, the plan would go to the Legislative
Redistricting Board. For the first time ever, the five-member board
will include a Republican _ and not just one, but probably four.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Krusee contends, will give the Republicans more than
90 members of the 150-member House, contrasted with the 72 they
have now. In the Senate, they'll up their number from 16 of the 31
members to perhaps 20.
</P>
<P>
   If either of the plans winds up in court _ and that isn't
unlikely, given redistricting history _ the Texas Supreme Court is
completely Republican, and the federal bench and the U.S. Supreme
Court are now more Republican then Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The lines for the Texas congressional districts are also drawn
by the Legislature _ although if that map is vetoed or there is an
impasse, it either goes back to the Legislature or to the courts,
rather than to the redistricting board.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Republicans plan to pick up at least eight seats
from the current 17-13 deficit, Krusee said. Texas should get at
least two and perhaps three new districts because of population
growth. And with the threat of a Republican gubernatorial veto, the
Republicans expect to get 21 to 23 of the 32 or 33 seats, Krusee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats ``have a choice,'' Krusee said. ``They can be for a
Republican plan for Congress, or no plan. It's either Republican or
the courts'' _ which still tilt Republican, even after seven years
of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Krusee is completely mindful that the Democrats are doing
everything they can to hold on to their 78-72 edge in the House and
to take back the Senate. But frankly, Krusee maintains, it doesn't
matter: Republicans will rule on redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a year, we'll have some sense of how
successful Republicans were in controlling redistricting. And on
Nov. 6, 2002 _ the day after the general election following
redistricting _ we'll find out if Krusee's dreams of GOP gains came
true.

 &HT;    As obviously as ominously, our nation is resegregating
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Every half-price historian knows about Brown vs.
Board of Education, the ruling that launched school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Recently with almost no fanfare, the Supreme Court may have put
history's lid on school desegregation _ a formaldehyde cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   The issue wasn't forced busing. That's already in the jar. What
happened in Montgomery County (Md.) Public Schools vs. Eisenberg
was that the Supreme Court refused to act on a lower court's ruling
that schools could not consider race in apportioning students.
</P>
<P>
   A Maryland man sued when his son couldn't enroll in a magnet
school because it would harm the racial diversity of his
neighborhood school. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court could surprise everyone by ruling in
schools' favor in a similar Virginia case about whether a magnet
school could consider racial balance. Unless that happens, said the
National School Board Association, the court has thrown out Brown
vs. Board of Education and reinstituted ``separate but equal'' as
the American way.
</P>
<P>
   This would fit quite neatly into a political trend: the
elevation of institutional race-blindness to a virtue, rather than
the disability it is.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we all want to be race-blind in how we as individuals
apportion kindness. But knowing that inequity exists, we are fools
to have policies blind to how race still plays a factor in aligning
wealth and power. We also are fools to think that race-blindness
yet can produce public institutions that serve diverse communities.
</P>
<P>
   A truly race-blind police department, for instance, would see no
reason to recruit minority officers, crucial though they may be in
giving a department a feel for its community and conveying to all
that the department reflects the city.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action at its origins in the Lyndon Johnson White
House was nothing more than such an acknowledgement _ that public
institutions should act affirmatively (though not necessarily
arithmetically) to give minorities and women chances on which white
males had a historic lock.
</P>
<P>
   Now in a backlash against quotas and racial preferences, we risk
hampering public institutions from acknowledging or acting to end
continuing racial stratification, even without quotas.
</P>
<P>
   As to racial separatism and drift, no more stark example exists
than some of the neighborhood schools that have come from busing's
end. There's no question that major benefits come from poor
children and their parents being able to walk to grade school. But
obvious social drawbacks, and challenges for other institutions,
are inherent in this ``separate equality,'' with desegregation no
longer schools' cross to bear.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of magnet schools, school districts know full well
that if one becomes racially identifiable, it loses its pull.
Typically, as in Waco, magnet student bodies were sculpted to
reflect the district's racial breakdown. This would make for a
setting that can attract from every corner of town.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to court cases like the one in Maryland, school
districts across the country put on hold the use of race in filling
out magnet schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco Independent School District stopped it two years ago
and has been filling magnet slots based on a race-blind lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, fortunately, is that Waco's four magnets continue
to reflect the district's general racial enrollment, which is 40
percent African-American, 40 percent Hispanic and 20 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how a blind draw influences the
racial identities of these campuses over time.
</P>
<P>
   If luck holds, we'll still have some racially balanced schools
in our community, without the Supreme Court's help.

 &HT;    Woman sees America change by reading 80 years of Pulitzer
Prize-winning novels
 &HT;    By Renate Frydman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDALIA, Ohio _ When Carol Ann Brown sets a goal for herself,
she doesn't rest until it is accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   So no one who knows her was surprised when she said she was
going to read all the works that have won the Pulitzer Prize for
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Brown has not only reached her goal, but has
made annotated comments about each of the 80 books. Her comments
make fascinating reading in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   She would have finished the Pulitzer winners in one year, she
says, if she, ``hadn't stopped to read other books in between that
everyone is talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Born 70-plus years ago in Fort Thomas, Ky., across the Ohio
River from Cincinnati, Brown admits that she has a lifelong passion
for reading. A favorite story of her childhood involves her total
engrossment with books.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 12, my mother put a pot of potatoes on the stove.
She asked me to watch them while she was gone. In 20 minutes, I was
to turn them off as she was going to make potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat alongside the stove reading a book. By the time my
mother came home, there were clouds of black smoke and a terrible
stink. I never even noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   The reading was one outlet. Art was another. She showed an early
aptitude for art and won her first scholarship at the age of 10.
Later, she studied at the Studio School of Fashion Illustration in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Brown came to Dayton in 1947 after landing a job at Leakes
Furriers as a fashion illustrator for two years. She free-lanced
for another year and many of her illustrations appeared in the
Dayton Daily News and The Journal Herald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I marveled at being paid to do what I had done with my paper
dolls,'' she says now.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed at the YWCA and the woman who lived directly above
her introduced her to her brother, Leonard Brown, a printer at NCR.
They were married in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Like many women of that time, she stopped working outside the
home to raise her children. In 1967, she returned to work at
Capitol Cleaners and became a problem-solver at many of their
stores. In 1982, both she and her husband retired and he died in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Like many avid readers, Brown does not like to be disturbed when
reading a really good book.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer list came about because she couldn't locate all of
the books on a Wright State University list of ``outstanding
books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something I could complete _ a project,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And what a project it was. Each book is briefly reviewed and
critiqued in her own special way. Yet she is quick to assert that,
``the comments are only my own perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What really impressed me was the contrast of our culture
during the years of the Pulitzer, from 1918 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``From `The Age of Innocence' by Edith Wharton written in 1921
to `The Hours' by Michael Cunningham in 1999, the Pulitzer Prize
winners often reflect the life and times. At the time of
`Innocence,' society forbade divorces. It had the proper social
code for the late 1800s. The hero and heroine had to part because
they couldn't divorce their spouses. The more recent `The Hours'
features bisexual stories.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a wonder that Brown finds the time, with many volunteer
activities, to read 100 books a year. Most people can barely fit
one book into their tight schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read everywhere and watch very little TV,'' Brown says. ``I
read mostly at night and go to bed with a book around 9 p.m. I have
public radio for background music.''
</P>
<P>
   She usually reads until the books falls to the floor. ``If it is
a really good book, I go until 1 a.m. or until it is finished. Like
`Snow Falling on Cedars' by David Guterson. I read all night. It
was wonderful. It gave a feeling of dread, yet at the end, a most
beautiful thing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading is not all Brown does. She volunteers at Aullwood
Audubon Center and at the information desk of the Dayton Art
Institute. One day a week, she studies the ``History of Religion''
with a Sinclair Community College professor at the Vandalia Senior
Citizens Center.
</P>
<P>
   Religion is very important in her life and she is secretary of
the education committee of the Vandalia United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   She attends a Book Lovers Club with a friend at the Dayton
Women's Club, where people talk about and trade books. Another day
each week, she teaches English idioms to a Japanese woman and she
also belongs to the Dayton Chamber Music Society.
</P>
<P>
   Brown satisfies her love of music by frequenting concerts at the
DAI and her love of getting to know people of other cultures
through travel to Europe, China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And Carol Brown has some more lists to tackle. One is a list of
``things I have never done that I want to do.'' Riding on a
motorcycle has already been crossed off that list.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the project of another 100 books, a list that
includes Shakespeare, Homer, and Chaucer's ``The Canterbury
Tales.'' She wants to enjoy these old favorites once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like a good book,'' says Brown.

 &HT;    Ross' books sure to be talk of the town
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A recent conversation with Lillian Ross,
the great New Yorker writer who began on the magazine just after
World War II, revealed that she's working on two books. One is an
anthology of pieces from the Talk of the Town section of the
magazine for Random House; the other is a book about reporting that
Ross said she hopes will be ``like Strunk and White, but more
readable.''
</P>
<P>
   All this in addition to her projects for the magazine. Long may
her banner wave.
</P>
<P>
   EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN ...
</P>
<P>
   James Agee and Walker Evans' ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'' is
being issued yet again as an accompaniment for a traveling show of
Evans' photographs being sent on the road by the Metropolitan
Museum in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The book took years to sell out its first printing _ it was
initially published in 1941 _ but began to gather momentum in the
'60s and has gone through numerous editions and formats since.
Houghton Mifflin's new edition costs $30; if you can deal with the
Faulknerian rumblings of Agee's prose, it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   SOME THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD TO ...
</P>
<P>
   Dial will be publishing ``Driving Mr. Albert,'' a book by
Michael Paterniti that tells the story of his drive across country
with Einstein's brain and Thomas Harvey, the pathologist who did
the autopsy when the great scientist died in 1955 and took the
brain home for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The trip began in New Jersey and ended in California, where they
showed the brain to Einstein's granddaughter. We'll have to wait
for publication in June to discover whether said granddaughter was
thrilled or appalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bad translations are a reliable source of hilarity, as proved by
``Free Drinks for Ladies With Nuts,'' a collection to be published
by Dutton. Jane O'Boyle's book encompasses everything from
incompetent menus (``Pork with Fresh Garbage''), to ragged syntax
in butcher shops (``Recent Veal''), to bad subtitles in movies
(``As the crow flies, so shall you die tonight.'')
</P>
<P>
   My favorite comes from an instruction manual for a Japanese-made
food processor: ``Not to be used for the other use.''
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE
</P>
<P>
   ``Books are the curse of the human race. Nine-tenths of existing
books are nonsense, and the clever books are the refutation of that
nonsense. The greatest misfortune that ever befell man was the
invention of printing.''
</P>

 &HT;    Vacationing in the Bahamas _ your way
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Bahamas are so mystifying for most
of us. There are 30 or so inhabited islands. Which one should you
choose? We've made it easy _ just take a spin around the islands
and see where you land.
</P>
<P>
   HARBOUR ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Pastel, clapboard houses built during and just after the
American Revolu- tion, make Harbour Island one of the prettiest in
the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   If you have loads of money and dress in designer resort wear,
drive a Mercedes 500 series sedan or Porsche Boxster and like to
hang out with celebrities such as Martha Stewart, Christie
Brinkley, Diane von Furstenberg, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon: Go
to Harbour Island, a colonial city of pastel clapboard houses and
white picket fences. Stay at Pink Sands (800-OUTPOST), a collection
of fashionable cottages starting at $475 per night for garden view,
next to a 3-mile-long pink sand beach. Pink Sands is owned by
Island Records CEO Chris Blackwell, and there's the occasional
music celeb such as Keith Richards and his family.
</P>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR
</P>
<P>
   Want to make some European friends? This is the place,
especially at Club Med, which draws plenty of French topless
sunbathers.
</P>
<P>
   If you are European or have European sensibilities and an
appreciation for French food, like to sunbathe topless, and drive a
Saab convertible or BMW Z3: Go straight to San Salvador, which some
say was Christopher Columbus' first landfall and was later the
destination of French sunbathers. Stay at the Club Med
(800-CLUBMED), one of the company's more upscale resorts, which has
diving, sailing, kayaking and sunbathing on incredible white-sand
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   PARADISE ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Towers with its bridge suite, where Michael Jackson
stays, is part of Atlantis, a mega-resort that has a huge casino, a
half-dozen high-rise hotels, and the world's largest outdoor
aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a gamblin' man or woman and wear lots of gold jewelry,
drive a caddie or Lincoln and like to see celebrities such as
Michael Jackson, Oprah, Ivana and various Bee Gees: Go to Paradise
Island, a lushly landscaped island of high-rise hotels only a
causeway away from the colonial capital of Nassau. Stay at
theme-park-like Atlantis (800-ATLANTIS), which has the world's
largest open-air aquarium, humongous casino, a quarter-mile,
man-made river and a white sand beach.
</P>
<P>
   BIMINI
</P>
<P>
   Here, islanders remember Ernest Hemingway shooting sharks with a
submachine gun.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a sailor, fisherman and/or heavy beer drinker; drive a
Jeep Wrangler or Toyota Tacoma and you like to hang out where
Ernest Hemingway, Howard Hughes and Bing Crosby once stayed: Go to
Bimini, only 50 miles across the Gulf Stream from Miami. Stay in
the hilltop cottage (part of Blue Waters Resort, 242-347-3166)
where Ernest Hemingway lived, or next door at the modest but
extremely lively Compleat Angler Hotel (242-347-3122), or the
modern Big Game Resort (800-737-1007).
</P>
<P>
   GRAND BAHAMA
</P>
<P>
   If you like to shop at hundreds of duty-free stores and you wear
real rubies and eat off real English china but enjoy a bargain,
drive a Toyota Avalon or Mazda Millennia and like to see
celebrities such as Robin Williams, who took his family to Club
Fortuna: Go to Freeport, Grand Bahama, which has hundreds of
duty-free stores and miles of uncrowded, white-sand beaches. Stay
at the Lucayan Reef Village (800-582-2926), a seaside resort with a
fabulous renovation that includes a series of pools, high-style
public rooms and guest rooms offering a view of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   NASSAU
</P>
<P>
   Kids can march with trained flamingos at Ardastra Gardens and
Zoo, where they can also handle snakes and feed ducks. Cable Beach,
home to big resorts including the Radisson, is nearby.
</P>
<P>
   If you are parents who like to vacation with your kids, drive a
Dodge Caravan or an SUV made for soccer moms, not construction
workers (Honda CRV, Toyota Rav4) and don't care about hanging out
with celebrities: Go to Nassau, New Providence Island, which has
resorts with kids' camps, beaches, forts and a kid-sized zoo. Stay
at the Radisson Cable Beach Casino and Golf Resort (800-333-3333),
where kids will enjoy Camp Junkanoo, which has counselors and
plenty of activities for kids while the parents can gamble,
water-ski, parasail, kayak and more.
</P>
<P>
   EXUMA
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoy playing sports as well as watching ESPN, drive an
SUV or truck made for real men (Dodge Ram, Humvee) and like to hang
out with celebrities such as Toronto Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi,
Giants manager Dusty Baker (who hosts a bonefishing tournament
every January), Jack Nicklaus, Lee Iacocca and Jimmy Buffett, who
amuses islanders by fishing out of his seaplane: Go to Exuma, a
bucolic island, which offers all the sport fishing and bonefishing
you can pay for. Stay at the historic Peace &AMP; Plenty Inn
(800-525-2210), where you can hire bonefish guides such as J.J.
Dames, who is a guide for Iacocca and Buffett.

 &HT;    Implausibility keeps `Hook' from grabbing you
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bryce Proctorr has two massive problems:
</P>
<P>
   1. His wife is threatening to clean him out in a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   2. For the first time in his career as a best-selling novelist,
he's hopelessly blocked. His deadline is past due, he needs the
money _ $500,000 _ that he gets on delivery of the manuscript, and
there's not a coherent page to be found.
</P>
<P>
   So it's fortuitous that Proctor meets his old friend Wayne
Prentice, who had a promising start as a writer years ago but has
gradually lost momentum. In an effort to jump-start his career,
Prentice desperately adopted the pseudonym of Tim Fleet. It hasn't
helped; Tim Fleet, like his creator, has declined from midlist to
no-list.
</P>
<P>
   Even Prentice's agent insults him. ``You know I'm a fan of your
stuff,'' he says, ``I just wish there were more of us out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce makes his old friend an offer. If Wayne will give him his
new book so he can pass it off as his own, Proctorr will split the
money with him.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice says yes.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one other thing, says Proctorr. You have to kill my
wife, too.
</P>
<P>
   And Donald Westlake, among the most reliable pros in the writing
game _ everything people say about Elmore Leonard could more
justifably be said about Westlake _ is off on what seems to have
been meant as a followup to his superb ``The Ax'' (for my money,
his best book).
</P>
<P>
   There have been other riffs on the basic theme of ``The Hook'' _
remember Ira Levin's play ``Deathtrap''? _ and they all seem to run
into trouble in the third act. Westlake's stumble comes earlier. It
begins with the slightly stiff, implausible names _ Bryce Proctorr
sounds like something out of Danielle Steel _ and continues with
equally implausible behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Wayne be so willing to kill a perfect stranger? His
ego may be starving, but he's not; his wife has a good job and
makes a comfortable living. Or is Westlake saying that a pseudonym
is as invariable a step towards homicide as, say, incivility?
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Prentice keeps up his end of the bargain and, in a
scene that seems to owe a little to Hitchcock's ``Torn Curtain,''
dispatches the deeply unpleasant Mrs. Proctorr. He delivers his
manuscript to Proctorr, who does a light polish to make it sound
like him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, things get interesting. Despite the thriller premise,
Westlake steers his book in an unexpected direction. ``The Hook''
turns out not to be about the spiraling complications of deceit _
Westlake brings in a policeman for a few brief scenes, but we're
closer to Inspector Lestrade than Inspector Porfiry _ but rather
about the slow dissolution of a human personality.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of its problems, for much of its length, ``The Hook''
is entertaining, especially for publishing insiders: ``The big
chain bookstores, they've each got the computer,'' Wayne complains,
``and the computer says, we took five thousand of his last book,
but we only sold thirty-one hundred, so don't order more than
thirty five hundred. So there's a thinner distribution, and you
sell twenty-seven hundred, so the next time they order three
thousand ...''
</P>
<P>
   And Westlake explains the very real modern economic reasons
behind a pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the sales staff. If they know Tim Fleet is Wayne
Prentice, even though it's supposed to be a secret outside the
publishing house, it has that stink of failure on it already. But
if they think Tim Fleet is Tim Fleet, really think that, and he's
brand-new, and he's never failed because he's never been tested
before, they can get excited. They can do wonders, when they're
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Westlake's characters are types, but he does them well,
and he does desperation really well.
</P>
<P>
   But the book doesn't grab and squeeze the way ``The Ax'' and
some of his other books do _ the characters are unsympathetic,
which is all right, but they lack charm, and that's not all right.
</P>
<P>
   The book winds up with a chilly little farewell that would have
made a dandy wind-up for an ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' but it
seems slightly off-key for a writer who's always specialized in
unblinking, cold-blooded moral relativity.

   POLICE-RECORDS (Edwardsville, Ill.) _ Some law enforcement
agencies in Illinois are prohibiting public access to police
records, citing a recent Supreme Court ruling limiting what defense
lawyers and prosecutors can say to ensure that criminal defendants
get a fair trial. Illinois Press Association officials have
attacked the ruling and say they will fight it. ``There is now an
atmosphere of fear on the part of police and prosecutors to make
any statement about anything,'' says David Bennett, the press
group's executive director. By GARY SCHNEIDER.

   KOSOVO-POW (San Antonio) _ Army Spc. Steven M. Gonzales fell
from the exposed turret of his Humvee into its protective cocoon,

loved GI Joe toys and played soldier near his home in Temple,
firing at friends with a water rifle. Now he was being hunted by
soldiers armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. A

new technology companies, or dot-coms. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Outraged law enforcement organizations from
across the nation are mobilizing to persuade Antioch College to
cancel a planned audiotape commencement address by a Pennsylvania
death-row inmate convicted of killing a Philadelphia police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   One national group promised a dignified but ``very large''
protest demonstration at the April 29 graduation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stomach turned in knots when I saw that your commencement
committee voted to have Mumia Abu-Jamal deliver the keynote
address,'' Kevin Temple, Dayton police detective and president of
the Dayton Fraternal Order of Police, said in a letter to Antioch
College President Bob Devine.
</P>
<P>
   Temple pointed to the slayings in Costa Rica this month of
Antioch College student Emily Howell and former Antioch student
Emily Eagen. He said their killers, after their conviction, will
also ``have a cause of their own. I have the feeling your college
will not invite them to speak in an effort to raise greater public
awareness of their cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Antioch College, in Yellow Springs, Ohio, gave no
sign of bowing to the pressure. Some of the hundreds of e-mail
messages that the college has received represent ``hate mail'' that
is intended to ``intimidate and harass us,'' Antioch Dean of
Students Scott Warren said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Antioch has a long tradition of democratic self-governance, and
the graduating seniors selected their commencement speaker by vote,
Warren said. The college ``does not take a position on the merits
of (Abu-Jamal's) case'' but does support his First Amendment right
of free speech, Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can learn from all voices,'' the dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Suzie Sawyer, executive director of the national organization
Concerns of Police Survivors Inc. (COPS), said the invitation to
Abu-Jamal represents ``a slap in the face of the memory of
Antioch's own students'' killed in Central America. ``It's a
disgrace,'' Sawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Camdenton, Mo.-based organization says it has membership of
more than 10,000 families. Sawyer promised a vigorous mail, fax and
e-mail campaign to campus officials. If the college does not
reconsider, Sawyer promised a significant demonstration of support
for police survivors and their advocates when Antioch awards
diplomas to its 110 graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, Yellow Springs will be a very busy place on April
29,'' Sawyer said. ``It will be a very dignified protest, but it
will be a very large one.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Fischer, Xenia police officer and president of the Greene
County FOP, said his organization will send a letter asking Antioch
officials to reconsider. Mike Taylor, secretary of the statewide
FOP, said his group will do the same, and noted the topic ``will be
on the agenda'' of a national FOP board meeting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said students requested that Abu-Jamal speak not about
his court case, but on the topics of how one individual can affect
the world and on the true meaning of revolution, Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``horribly inappropriate, insensitive and totally
unfair'' to compare the Costa Rica murders with the Abu-Jamal case.
There is little in dispute about the motives and circumstances
involving the Costa Rica slayings, while the Philadelphia case has
been on appeal for almost two decades and has spawned significant
support for both the prosecution and defense arguments, Warren
said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal, 45, a radio journalist and former Black Panther
activist, was convicted of fatally shooting Philadelphia police
Officer Daniel Faulkner after the officer stopped Abu-Jamal's
brother for driving the wrong way down a city street. Abu-Jamal's
cause has drawn international support from death penalty opponents
and from supporters who claim Abu-Jamal was targeted for political
reasons and framed in the killing. Amnesty International last month
called for a new trial for Abu-Jamal, citing what it called
judicial bias, irregularities in the police investigation and
possible coercion of key witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the evidence against Abu-Jamal is overwhelming.
He and Faulkner were found lying a few feet from each other;
Abu-Jamal's gun, with five empty shell casings, was found nearby;
and two witnesses testified that Abu-Jamal confessed at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court in October refused to hear Abu-Jamal's
last appeal from state courts. His appeal is now in federal court
in Philadelphia.

   COXNET LIFESTYLES 0330: SOFT SKIN -- There are three secrets to
glowing, healthy complexion, say skin-care experts _ moisturize,

humidity and superheated dry indoor air, your skin is ready for a
spring break and the need for moisture treatment. In an informal
test of drugstore vs. department store moisturizers, our four
testers split evenly with two preferring the less expensive brands
and two the pricey ones. (Johnson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

you to another locale _ the gleaming modern skyline of Toronto,

<P>
   COXNET LIFESTYLES 0330: SOFT SKIN -- There are three secrets to
glowing, healthy complexion, say skin-care experts _ moisturize,
moisturize, moisturize. And after months of cold air with low
humidity and superheated dry indoor air, your skin is ready for a
spring break and the need for moisture treatment. In an informal
test of drugstore vs. department store moisturizers, our four
testers split evenly with two preferring the less expensive brands
and two the pricey ones. (Johnson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   COXNET TRAVEL _ (EDS: This is the CoxNet Travel page for the

reporter Nellie Bly circled the globe. In 2000, a modern-day Nellie
chronicles her own around-the-world adventure. It was a marathon
trip, eight countries in four weeks and sometimes several cities in
one country. But of course, the real joy of the trip was the people
encountered along the way. (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post) Art

   FUNDY-COVE _ ST. JOHN, New Brunswick _ A warming stay at the Inn
on the Cove, a bed-and-breakfast inm that's situated in an
appealingly quirky melange of Victorian and 1950s-style
architecture. The inn sits on a 3-acre climb above Sand Cove, a
tranquil inlet on the Bay of Fundy west of downtown Saint John, New
Brunswick.(Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

   FUNDY-STJOHN _ ST. JOHN, New Brunswick _ The first thing a
visitor to St. John notices, undeniably, are the smokestacks.
Towering exhaust shafts atop area pulp mills and refineries loom
over this working-class city on the Bay of Fundy _ population,
125,000 _ like noxious shrines to the gods of commerce. But, to
borrow the movie poster come-on from ``American Beauty,'' look
closer: Behind the mask of industry is a charming, history-rich
town that reflects a world of influences. (Hamilton, Atlanta

   TORONTO-GARDENS _ TORONTO _ Touring the public gardens of
Toronto: The narrow sandy streets wander past funky little gardens
ablaze with towering sunflowers, rampant petunias and perky
dahlias, all with heads held so high you'd swear you could see them
nod hello. It's a neighborhood so eclectic, so earthy, you'd expect
to find it in the villages of the English countryside or the rural
hamlets of the Deep South. But a sudden breeze off the water jolts
you to another locale _ the gleaming modern skyline of Toronto,
just 15 minutes by ferry across Lake Ontario. There, along the
banks of Canada's largest city, are small public parks that double
as pristine gardens celebrating music and the arts with giant
contemporary metal sculpture. (Flanders, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

MFUME DOESN'T NEED TO YANK ON REBEL FLAG IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush doesn't need the help of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People to win Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it is well that NAACP President/CEO Kweisi Mfume has
exhibited the industrial-strength good sense to decline to dilute
the national organization's resources by taking an active role in
the effort by the state chapter to persuade Bush to take a stand
against the Confederate battle flag _ henceforth, the CBF.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Texas chapter has urged the governor to order
the removal of a plaque containing a replica of the Rebel flag from
the entrance to the building in which the Texas Supreme Court and
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals are located.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has demurred. He lobbed out the idea of attaching some kind
of historical footnote to the plaque to explain why it is
appropriate for it to be where it is. When Gary Bledsoe, president
of the Texas NAACP, wouldn't buy that compromise, the governor said
he'd take the matter under study.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe insists that the Rebel flag symbolizes ``hate, division
and racism'' to African-Americans. He might have added that most of
those who insist on waving that flag in the faces of
African-Americans know this and that their intent is to hurt and
insult.
</P>
<P>
   The CBF that adorns the dome of the state Capitol in Columbia,
S.C., does that insulting and hurting in grand style. And that's
why the national NAACP is waging a full-tilt-boogie
African-American tourist boycott against the Palmetto State.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume has prophesied that the CBF atop the South Carolina
Capitol ``will come down.'' And he's most likely right. The boycott
has picked up steam since it started in January. The governor of
the state already has cried his ``uncle.'' But the Legislature
won't budge.
</P>
<P>
   It's a heritage thing, say many white South Carolinians. And
many of them are serious about that. But for others, perhaps the
majority, it's just a race thing, a resentment thing at the social,
political and economic advances that African-Americans have made
since the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, South Carolina will not be able to endure the
pangs of tourist dollar withdrawal indefinitely, and it will remove
the CBF from its inappropriate perch. When that happens, other
states that assign too much prominence to the CBF will let prudence
be their guide.
</P>
<P>
   So said Mfume at a news conference in Fort Worth last week. And
maybe that was his only reason for declining to enlist the national
organization in Bledsoe's effort to remove the CBF plaque from the
entryway to Texas' highest courts.
</P>
<P>
   But if Mfume is as politically astute as he is reputed to be,
there is another reason. He knows that such a push in Texas could
backfire against the NAACP and give Bush a boost. After all, the
Texas CBF is located in a place that is not visited frequently by a
lot of people. African-Americans have to go out of their way to
find it and get insulted by it.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Bush could portray himself as the victim of a
blatant NAACP plot to embarrass him. That would play well with the
white, Republican majority that will most likely deliver the
state's Electoral College votes to Bush. So he can, with political
impunity, stand in the Supreme Court door and proclaim: ``CBF
today, CBF tomorrow, CBF forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that wouldn't go over very well with Texas
African-Americans. But so what? Bush has never done anything
significant in his political life to indicate that he gives a
flying flip about the African-American vote.
</P>
<P>
   His only nod toward minorities in the state is his cosmetic
courtship of Hispanics. And that is a transparent bid to divide
that voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush relented and pushed the right buttons to get the
plaque moved, he could still claim to have done so out of duress.
And that would accomplish the same political purpose. The NAACP
would come out looking like the heavy.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that Bledsoe is wrong. His cause is just.
Mfume has given the national organization's blessing to the Texas
chapter's effort. It's just not going to waste any time, money and
effort on a Texas boycott.
</P>
<P>
   And that's smart. If the Texas chapter can use gentle persuasion
to change the governor's mind, so be it. But neither the national
organization nor the state chapter needs to go to great lengths to
provide Bush with an issue that could guarantee that he would win
Texas and help in some other states.

U.S. AND CHINA END TALKS WITH FOCUS ON TAIWAN  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The U.S. national security adviser Sandy Berger
completed two days of talks here Thursday that a senior U.S.
official described as ``serious and thoughtful,'' aiding the
recovery of relations between the United States and China since
their nadir last year when NATO warplanes bombed the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant topic in the meetings between Berger and top
officials, including President Jiang Zemin, was new tensions
between Taiwan and China following China's threats against the
island and the victory of an opposition candidate in Taiwan's
presidential election earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The United States reaffirmed its support for the ``one China''
policy, the senior official said at a briefing Thursday afternoon,
but also stressed the need for peaceful dialogue between Beijing
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's president-elect, Chen Shui-bian, had supported
declaring the island's independence but recently softened his view,
saying he would not hold a vote on the issue unless Taiwan came
under attack. Despite earlier warnings of dire consequences if Chen
won, Beijing has so far taken a wait-and-see approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our assessment that both sides have been acting
prudently,'' the U.S. official said. He added that the United
States hopes the two sides can show ``patience, flexibility and
creativity'' in their approach to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that China had repeated its warnings that
relations with the United States will be seriously damaged if
Washington accedes to Taiwan's request for more advanced defensive
weapons. The official said Clinton will decide on the request in
April despite new uncertainties created by Chen's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that new Chinese threats against Taiwan would be
counterproductive, Berger also made clear that the U.S. decision on
arms sales will be influenced by the level of tensions in the
region, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese expressed concern about the progress of trade
legislation to facilitate China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, while Berger noted ``the clear political reality,''
the official said. ``To the extent there are tensions in the Taiwan
straits, that makes it all the harder to get permanent normal
trading status for China through the Congress,'' he said.

&HT;     THE GOLD RUSH WITHOUT BOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new Gold Rush is sweeping San Francisco. And
it is easily as potent (and mixed a blessing) as the 19th-century
version that transformed a pastoral Spanish mission town into an
overnight metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force: legions of new technology companies, or
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, along with residential real estate, which hasn't
been a bargain here since landfill made North Beach a geographical
misnomer, commercial real estate prices are now heading to the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-widening invasion of dot-com enterprises, most with a
Monopoly Game relationship to money, have ``become the latest focus
in the war over growth in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-business folks are inclined to make life super easy for
dot-coms, especially with regard to relaxing the annual development
limit of 950,000 square feet on downtown office space mandated by
14-year-old Proposition M.
</P>
<P>
   Slow-growthers, who have watched the practical boundaries of
``downtown'' spread like an oil slick across the city, see
longtime, low-rent-paying businesses as threatened, goo-covered
wildlife. To them, Proposition M's controls are all that stand
between the survival of these enterprises and extinction (or
Oakland).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe scariest of all, the city's official planners admit they
don't even know how big the dot-com space demand is, let alone how
to solve it in as fair and timely a manner as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1986 when voters enacted Proposition M, the threat was
proliferation of dense, high-rise concrete boxes that promised to
bring lots more automobiles downtown and South of Market while
blocking out air and light to the edge of the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-commerce was but a futuristic dream in the brains of a
handful of cyber geeks who worked in still-affordable Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they knew that a panoply of Internet companies _ each
needing vasts amounts of space, electricity and a ``hip'' San
Francisco address _ would one day be the focal point of the war
over growth in this city. But who else did?
</P>
<P>
   Planning commissions being what they are _ political appointees
who rarely have a strong background in urban complexities _ San
Francisco's could hardly be counted on to provide vision. Nor, as
the current commission has demonstrated, could it be expected to
swiftly recognize a growing crisis or to boldly react.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, here in 2000, the allegedly sophisticated city of
San Francisco is operating on a ``downtown'' land-use policy that
hasn't been updated since 1986. And, boy, is the age starting to
show.
</P>
<P>
   The only real control on dot-com development seems so far to be
the most libertine mechanism known to humankind: what the market
will bear.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years alone, commercial rents have more than
doubled South of Market and edged way up in surrounding areas like
Potrero Hill, the Mission District and Jackson Square.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the only casualties from dot-com takeovers are
rats, cockroaches, bad plumbing and a building's potential collapse
in an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, big-spending companies have elbowed out small
industries, crafts and blue-collar trades that traditionally
populated the peripheries of downtown. Also shut out are bare-bones
nonprofit organizations and genuine (not faked for a live-work loft
lease) artists.
</P>
<P>
   Before we find ourselves reading about how sad it is that
money-eating San Francisco General Hospital or the War Memorial
Veterans Building (in need of $80 million in seismic retrofitting)
have been taken over by a consortium of successful dot-coms,
mightn't we ask the Planning Commission one teensy little favor?
</P>
<P>
   Wake up, will ya?

THE TRUTH ACCORDING TO DAVID DUCHOVNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of David
Duchovny directing a scene from ``The X-Files.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The truth is this: David Duchovny is tired of playing Fox
Mulder. But writing and directing ``The X-Files'' are terrific
perks, and the bucks _ lawsuit notwithstanding _ thrill his
accountant.
 &HT;    The original ``X'' man is almost scarily into his
double-barreled task as writer/director of ``Hollywood, A.D.,'' a
jaunty comic installment in the popular series that's set to air on
April 30.
 &HT;    Over on Stage 8 at Twentieth Century Fox Studios in Hollywood,
Duchovny sits ensconced in a director's chair, dutifully studying a
monitor and soaking in his surroundings. And well he should, since
much of the cavernous stage has been transformed into an
ultra-Gothic cemetery, replete with trees and plants, creepy
tombstones and machine-gun-toting zombies.
 &HT;    Several crewmen are helping Duchovny stage an intricate crane
shot, during which the camera will pan across the whole cemetery
from high above, then dip down until it locates Mulder (Duchovny)
and Scully (Gillian Anderson). Meanwhile, other crewmembers assume
such vital tasks as creating smoke, touching up zombies and
ensuring that guest stars Tea Leoni and Garry Shandling stand in
the right spots.
 &HT;    Duchovny and company rehearse the camera move several times,
then the fledgeling director calls for the camera to roll _ and
watches, slack-jawed, as everything comes together.
 &HT;    ``This is incredible,'' a second assistant director comments.
 &HT;    Duchovny grins and seconds the motion.
 &HT;    ``It's moviemaking magic,'' he says, shaking his head.
 &HT;    A day later, Duchovny settles onto a couch at Los Angeles' Four
Seasons hotel, surrounded by videotapes of dailies that he's been
watching between interviews. The actor/writer/director seems to be
on a natural high. Critics and audiences alike are giving thumbs up
to his latest film, the feel-good weepie ``Return to Me,'' and
Duchovny feels good about ``Hollywood, A.D.'' as well.
 &HT;    ``I have a friend who has a friend who is an FBI agent, and he
comes to Los Angeles to pitch ideas,'' Duchovny says. ``I thought,
`What if that was Skinner (Mitch Pileggi)?' What if Skinner was
talking to Hollywood guys about making a movie, and what if he was
ripping off Mulder? What if he was using Mulder's life and selling
it to Hollywood _ and what would Hollywood do with it? How would
they change it?''
 &HT;    Thus the episode finds Mulder and Scully killing time during a
forced vacation by visiting the set of an ``X-Files'' feature,
where Leoni _ Duchovny's real-life wife _ is playing a buxom Scully
and Shandling a deadpan Mulder.
 &HT;    Needless to say, the real Mulder and Scully wind up deep in an
X-File with potentially explosive religious ramifications.
 &HT;    ``We've been having a lot of fun filming it,'' Duchovny says.
``I think it will be pretty entertaining. That's the goal.''
 &HT;    Despite the air of good will, Duchovny appears ready to bid
farewell to both ``The X-Files'' and his alter-ego of seven years.
However, negotiations are ongoing in a bid to bring him back into
the fold for one last season.
 &HT;    ``There would be things I'd like to know about Mulder if we were
to take the show in a different direction,'' he says. ``But I don't
think that's wise, and I know it's never going to happen.
 &HT;    ``So, for the Mulder that I play week after week, there's
nothing left.''
 &HT;    If, bottom line, Duchovny prefers not to return for an eighth
year, why would he even entertain the possibility? Other than
money, what's the incentive?
 &HT;    ``There is no incentive,'' says Duchovny, who would rather
continue playing Mulder on the big screen. ``The only incentive
would be writing and directing, which is what I'm doing now. I'm
allowed to have a really nice budget, a great crew, great cameras
and all the film I want.
 &HT;    ``More than money, the reason that I would come back would be to
write and direct,'' he says. ``In fact, it's not for the money at
all _ the money is always good, but in the end it's not worth
anything. It's really a chance to teach myself other things I want
to do.''

<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: My 38-year-old brother (who has never liked me)
recently decided that he dislikes me so much that he has requested
that our mother hold separate holiday celebrations so that he
doesn't have to see me. Our troubled relationship really came to a
head when he read a private e-mail I sent to our mother complaining
about how he has tried to exclude me from family events and how he
has forced our mother to be with us separately at meals or other
activities.
</P>
<P>
   While my brother's actions sadden me a great deal, I am more
upset that my mother has allowed him to manipulate the time that I
spend with her. My mother seems to feel that there is nothing wrong
and that I am overreacting. Please advise how I can best handle
these family conflicts. _ S.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The two of you are taking sibling rivalry to a rather
ridiculous extreme, if you'll pardon me for saying so. It is not
unusual for kids to be competitive for mom's attention, but the two
of your are taking this to such an extreme that you'll both be
wrinkled as prunes before it ends.
</P>
<P>
   Let your mother deal with your brother any way she wants. You
deal with him in whatever way works best for you. This may mean the
two of you will be estranged for a while. I do agree with you that
your mother is probably allowing this to go on longer than it
should because she allows him to dictate separate family
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   But for right now, this is your mother's problem. I would stop
sending e-mails that are nasty. Don't ever put anything in writing
_ especially in e-mails _ that you don't want to defend in court.
</P>
<P>
   Go out of your way to be charming to your brother. Let your
mother do whatever she wants to do. Try and understand that if both
you and your brother are willing to let go of this nonsense, it
probably will stop. As long as you are both willing to keep it
going, it will continue.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: I have a 15-year-old son who has driven a wedge so
big between me and my husband of seven years (he's not my son's
father) that we have separated. My husband wants a divorce, and he
and my son refuse to spend time in the same house.
</P>
<P>
   I want my marriage to last. I have learned since our separation
that my son had been causing conflicts. At the time I couldn't
believe he could do such a thing. I was probably feeling guilty
because when my first marriage ended, I gave custody of my son to
his father. I didn't plan to get remarried and believed he needed a
father in his life. I maintained a long distance visitation
schedule. Then my son told me a few years ago that he was being
mistreated by his stepfamily, so I went to court and regained
custody in Oct. 1998.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you can offer some information or suggest a book that can
help me to find ways to deal with the conflict between my husband
and my son. I feel I'm being forced to make a choice between the
two of them and I don't like that position. Is it true that parents
should always side with their children in such situations? _ D.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I don't think the issue is whether or not parents
should always side with children. It sounds like something else has
gone wrong here, given that things were relatively stable for a
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   It's true: Both the men in your life have legitimate claims on
you. Your son needs you because you haven't been his mom for the
past couple of years. You weren't involved with him so you owe him.
Your husband also has some reasonable expectations that you will be
a good wife to him since the two of you have been married for this
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than feeling that you have to choose between your husband
and your son, I would choose a good family counselor. A 15-year-old
child is not the easiest person to live with, but your son has a
legitimate claim. He feels you abandoned him. Consequently, his
wish to have you to himself may be more profound than an ordinary
teen-ager's demand. This doesn't necessarily mean his claim is
valid. You can't be anything more than his mother _ you certainly
can't be his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Find a good marriage counselor and figure out how you can do the
best by both the men in your life. It's clear you love them both
very much.

&HT;     THE CRIME OF PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The speech began: ``I am classified as an
habitual criminal. The habitual criminal is a person who habitually
retains stupid lawyers. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   After the light opening, the speaker continued: ``I saw a man
hanged when I was a boy about 17 years old in the San Francisco
Jail. If I remember right, he was the last man hanged in the old
county jail of San Francisco _ a young man who had killed his
sweetheart. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him when they marched him up the steps to the scaffold.
He looked directly at me and I looked at him, and the clear light
of reason was not in that man's eyes. He was mentally dead, and so
far as punishment was concerned, they should have punished his
insane relatives. If he was punished at all, it was long before he
got to the scaffold.''
</P>
<P>
   Did some bleeding heart liberal, some radical agitator, some
Mumia give this speech? No, Jack Black gave this speech to the New
York state Assembly in 1930, and who was Jack Black?
</P>
<P>
   Black was a professional criminal who wrote the 1926 best-seller
``You Can't Win,'' which recounted his life on the road, on the
lam, in prison straitjackets and under the lash, and his eventual
rehabilitation by the great San Francisco Bulletin Editor Fremont
Older.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Can't Win,'' an underground classic and William Burroughs'
favorite book, has been reprinted by San Francisco's AK Press as
the first of a series of resurrected books by great American
``misfits and rebels,'' as Ramsey Kanaan of AK Press put it.
</P>
<P>
   The book provides a large bottom slice of early 20th-century San
Francisco life, a complete guide to riding the rails, living in bum
encampments, hanging out in Barbary Coast ``hop joints,'' as well
as a how-to (and why not-to) of house-breaking, jewel theft and
armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides this shock. Seventy years ago, a former
criminal with a long record could crusade for prison reform and
give that anti-death penalty speech before applauding state
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   No more Jack Blacks. This is the age of Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Black called for an end to capital punishment. Davis, the
Democratic governor of California, refuses to even recognize mercy.
Black argued for the value of work over prisons. Davis will have
new prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Black pointed out the benefits of humane probation and parole
policies for young offenders. Davis has appointed right-wing
Republicans to his parole boards.
</P>
<P>
   This week Davis appointed former Assemblyman Tom J. Bondonaro
Jr. to the state parole board. This is a man who once sponsored a
bill to make public the names of AIDS patients, fought gay rights
and was called ``extreme right-wing'' by former President Gerald
Ford, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   This is where we are 70 years after Black spoke against capital
punishment to New York legislators. California's governor, a
so-called ``moderate'' or ``centrist,'' is as hard-shelled
conservative as anyone in the country when it comes to matters of
crime and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Shoring up political defenses on the right with prison walls and
prisoners' bodies is standard centrist strategy. When Bill Clinton
was governor of Arkansas he left the presidential campaign to go
home and witness the execution of a brain-damaged prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has more reason to be draconian. He lives with the memory
of the disaster brought on his former boss, Jerry Brown, by
appointing the late liberal Rose Bird to the California Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   These are craven times, and we have given up on the hope that
men and women can be rehabilitated, a hope Black once instilled
with the powerful story of his life and times at the bottom of
society.
</P>
<P>
   In ``You Can't Win,'' you meet honorable low lifes like Salt
Chunk Mary, so named because of the pot of salt pork and beans she
kept on the stove of her bordello and fencing operation.
</P>
<P>
   You learn truths like ``The best way to get misinformed is to
ask a lot of questions,'' and you get handy bits of firearm advice
like not to use ``off calibers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to shoot anybody,'' said one of Black's criminal
acquaintances, ``but if I do they won't dig a forty-one caliber
slug out of him and find a forty-one caliber slug on me.''
</P>
<P>
   You learn argot like ``stir steerer'' (shyster lawyer), ``box
man'' (safe cracker), ``four-bit mickey of Dr. Hall'' (50-cent
bottle of alcohol), ``gump'' (chicken), ``bindle'' (bedroll) and
``the poultice route'' (the rails through the land of milk and
honey of southern Utah).
</P>
<P>
   Black was a born storyteller and a criminal by training and
habit. The story ends with him turned around by the faith of
Fremont Older, and the mercy of a San Francisco judge named Frank
H. Dunne.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy, remember that?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a boy in prison at the age I was, as prisons were
then, he will become a criminal as sure as the day follows the
night or the night follows the day,'' Black told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   As prisons were then, so they are again. And boys are put in
them.
</P>
<P>
   The book ends with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no money, no wife, no auto. I have no dog. I have
neither a radio set nor a rubber plant _ I have no troubles. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could wish for anything else it would be a little more
moderation, a little more tolerance, and a little more of the
trustful innocence of that little boy who learned his prayers at
the knee of the gentle, kindly old priest in the Sisters' Convent
School.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderation, tolerance, trustful innocence? Don't wish for it
now.

&HT;     UPSTATE EMERGES AS BATTLEGROUND FOR CLINTON, GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Voters in upstate New York may be the deciding
factor in the ever-tightening U.S. Senate race between Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani, according to a new poll.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen percent of upstate voters surveyed by the Marist
Institute for Public Opinion remain undecided between the
Democratic first lady and the Republican mayor of New York.
Giuliani leads in the GOP-dominated region, 49 to 37 percent, but
undecided voters upstate could swing the race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the clear favorite in New York City at 60 to 34
percent, but the mayor is strong in the suburbs, 56 to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstate hasn't seen this kind of battleground since the
Revolutionary War,'' Marist polling director Lee M. Miringoff said
Wednesday. ``If you're Rudy, you want to do well in the
traditionally Republican stronghold upstate. If you're Hillary, you
want to do well in an area where people don't know Rudy as well _
upstate. And most of the undecided voters are upstate _ in the city
and in the suburbs, it's harder to find switchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Giuliani's lead over Clinton narrowed in the Marist
poll, which last had the race tied in October. The poll gave the
mayor 46 percent of the vote to the first lady's 43 percent, with
11 percent undecided statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 561 registered New York voters was conducted Monday
and Tuesday, and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's downswing reflects voter dissatisfaction with his
response to the fatal shooting earlier this month of Patrick
Dorismond, a 26-year-old unarmed black man killed following a
scuffle with an undercover New York City police officer. In defense
of the police, Giuliani released Dorismond's juvenile arrest
records, which under law are sealed. The mayor also has refused to
offer condolences to Dorismond's family.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those surveyed by Marist disapproved of Giuliani's
handling of the incident. Still, 26 percent approved of his
actions, and 24 percent were unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's and Giuliani's unfavorable ratings are growing, the
first lady's more so than the mayor's _ a fact his campaign seized
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to divide New Yorkers and play Arkansas-style politics
has hurt Mrs. Clinton with New Yorkers who view her more negatively
today than last month, while Mayor Giuliani continues to enjoy
strong support,'' Giuliani campaign spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, were quick to point out
Giuliani's national fund-raising in Ohio and Washington this week
and in Utah and Arizona Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rudy Giuliani hypocrisy tour rolls on,'' said Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman David DiMartino. ``Rudy
says he is too busy for upstate but not too busy to go out of
state.''

LOW WATTAGE SPOILS `THE SKULLS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtually everything in ``The Skulls'' is bathed in natural
light, coming from behind the characters and creating a haze so
thick that it's a wonder the cast doesn't lapse into coughing fits.
The few electric-light sources in the movie don't provide much
illumination. Thus, the movie provides an apt metaphor for itself:
It's a dim bulb.
</P>
<P>
   This be-careful-what-you-ask-for drama had promise, but writer
John Pogue and director Rob Cohen turn it into a glorified Hardy
Boys drama with a little of ``The X-Files'' thrown in. Our intrepid
hero is Luke (Joshua Jackson of ``Dawson's Creek''), a townie
attending an Ivy League school with _ gasp! _ financial aid. Luke
has left behind what the screenplay continually refers to as his
``misspent youth'' to become a pre-law student and a top-notch
sculler. This is apparently enough to merit him consideration for
membership in the Skulls, a secret campus society.
</P>
<P>
   Luke's potential Skullership is frowned upon by his two best
campus buds, comely artist/love interest Chloe (''Popular's''
Leslie Bibb) and intrepid student reporter Will (Hill Harper of
CBS' ``City of Angels''). But loyalty to old friends apparently
isn't a criterion for Skulls membership, and in scenes that feature
the only things remotely resembling eeriness in the whole movie,
he's initiated into the group.
</P>
<P>
   The Skulls do expect loyalty to ``new'' friends, and Luke is
given a rule book and a ``soul mate'' in Caleb (''Varsity Blues'''
Paul Walker), which gives the movie a vague homoerotic subtext that
it never satisfactorily explores. Instead, it explores Caleb's
becoming a pawn in a power struggle between his father, an
ambitious judge (played with almost laughable oiliness by Craig T.
Nelson) and a grinning senator (William Petersen). Peterson's
performance is crammed with so many Clintonian mannerisms that it's
a mystery why the filmmakers just didn't use ``Saturday Night
Live's'' Darrell Hammond in the role.
</P>
<P>
   When the society's secrecy results in a death, Luke begins to
consider canceling his lifetime membership. Meanwhile, journalist
buddy Will investigates. Hard to see what he's investigating; the
death aside, the secret society's biggest sin appears to be that
it's secret. It does provide its young members with money, cars and
connections, but aside from supplying the phony menace of meetings
conducted in a subterranean war room (conveniently marked ``WAR''),
even the script can't figure out what The Skulls are all about.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Walker do decent enough jobs with this material, but
they're cast adrift by Cohen, who fails to provide any suspense. As
Luke edges closer to the truth, more people try to stop him, but
Cohen never gives the sense that the walls are closing in on him.
</P>
<P>
   With its forced melodrama and unintentional humor, ``The
Skulls'' could have been a guilty pleasure. But Cohen drags it on
about 20 minutes too long, getting more ridiculous, until the movie
finally burns itself out.

   Subtitles still scare some people, who might consider the
awarding of the Best Foreign Language Film a good time to raid the
refrigerator during the Oscars. They don't know what they're
missing, for two reasons. One is that as a rule, only the best
foreign films make it to these shores. And two is that, for the
past couple of years, the award has resulted in one of the most
effusive and entertaining acceptance speeches of the long Academy
Awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was Roberto Benigni. This year, it was world-class
filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, winning his first Oscar for ``All About
My Mother,'' his elegiac tribute to motherhood and feminine spirit.
Here, to the best that we and the folks at Oscar.com could make
out, is his speech:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think they are one of the more beautiful couples?''
Almodovar began, referring to presenters Antonio Banderas and
Penelope Cruz. ``At least Spanish couple. You know, I come from out
in the country, it is very different than this. In that country,
now is six years in the morning. So let me dedicate this to the
Spanish people that are watching TV now, and they sacrificed their
Monday to look at you and me with this. I mean, this is for
Spain.'' (Prolonged applause.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be very quick. So if you have to applaud, you'll
have to be very quick. I also want to thank my sister Maricruz
(spelling approximate) and Antonia for the amount of confidence
they've had in the last month.''
</P>
<P>
   Try as we might, we weren't able to get the exact wording of the
next segment, when Almodovar thanks Jesus and several saints,
including the Virgin of Guadalupe and St. Jude (the patron saint of
lost causes).
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the Sacred Heart of Mary,'' he continues. ``I told
that we are from a different country. Harvey Weinstein, listen,
Harvey one idea, consider my sister's Oscar. Recited by a paragraph
of my mother with Penelope and me. Next, it brings good luck. So I
think now I'm going to be leaving all this. Well, excuse me.
Thanks. Thanks to Sony because they believed a lot in our movie.
I'm very quick anyway. And, of course _ to my brother! And to all
the Spanish people. Bye-bye! I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A Pedro Almodovar primer
</P>
<P>
   If you're not familiar with Pedro Almodovar's work, here's a
crash course: It's filled with high emotion and splashy color,
often with ribald humor and strong but neurotic female characters.
Here's some of his best stuff, all available on video (and all
decidedly for adults). All are in Spanish with English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'': The must-see
Almodovar film, a 1988 movie that heaps crazy ideas (and gazpacho)
on the story of a film-dubbing actress who has just been dumped by
her longtime lover. Worth it alone for a scene involving an
unfortunate telephone-answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live Flesh'': This 1997 movie involves a paralyzed cop, a
prostitute's son, and the prostitute herself in a typically
Almodovarian cycle of coincidences, melodrama and dark humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matador'': Weirder than most of Almodovar's work (and that's
saying something), this 1986 film examines the sexual peccadilloes
of a troubled matador and his protege, played by Antonio Banderas
before he achieved fame in America. A bit disturbing, but better
than later overrated Almodovar films such as ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me
Down!''

   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Army Spc. Steven M. Gonzales fell from the
exposed turret of his Humvee into its protective cocoon, suddenly
realizing it was being hit by bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this is happening,'' Gonzales kept repeating
to himself. ``I can't believe this is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Friday, Gonzales and Staff Sgts. Christopher J. Stone
and Andrew A. Ramirez became the first and only American POWs of
the 78-day Kosovo air war.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not call them prisoners of war at first,
preferring the word ``detainees.'' But in a land where yellow
ribbons long have dotted trees and car antennas in remembrance of
POWs and hostages, they became instant heroes, soldier-celebrities,
the object of letters, e-mails and prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Beaten frequently by a sadistic guard, confined to a prison cell
and forced to mark the days off a crude calendar, Gonzales missed
his 22nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But this year he will celebrate in style with friends at Texas
A&AMP;M University, where he is a sophomore engineering major.
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment, though, has just begun for Gonzales and the
other former POWs of the American campaign to drive Serbian army
and police forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales is engaged to Anne-Eva Schramm, 20, of Schweinfurt,
Germany, where he, Ramirez and Stone once served as scouts with the
1st Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, 25, of Los Angeles remains in the Army helping
recruiters in Southern California. Stone, 26, is on active duty as
a community relations specialist with the Michigan National Guard
in Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Their new lives began in the wake of a national celebration that
followed Slobodan Milosevic's abrupt decision in early May to
release the men from a Belgrade prison 32 days after their capture
along the border between the Yugslov province of Kosovo and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   After their release, the three received six medals before 3,500
people at the 1st Infantry Division's Victory Park in Wurzburg,
Germany, and met with President Clinton. During their first week of
freedom, the men were hounded by a frenzied media, which camped on
a grassy knoll overlooking their quarters at an Army hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shocking and overwhelming, but it was also funny,''
Stone said. ``I found it humorous that the press went to such great
lengths to get the story, sending letters to the hospital, and some
of them even sent their picture in these letters so we would
recognize their face.''
</P>
<P>
   Their return home was marked by parades, a Disney tribute and,
in Austin, a salute to Gonzales from Gov. George W. Bush and the
Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Stone and Gonzales returned to their unit in
Germany while Ramirez was reassigned to Los Angeles. Transformed by
their POW experience, Stone and Gonzales left the Army on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gonzales returned to A&AMP;M, where he is studying and
working part time in the university's veterans services office. A
wedding may come before his graduation, now tentatively set for
2003.
</P>
<P>
   But a year ago, Gonzales and the two other Gis were outside a
Macedonian village when they heard the sound of rocks hitting the
Humvee.
</P>
<P>
   Rock-throwing had become a common occurrence since the Americans
joined a peacekeeping mission in Macedonia, a former republic of
Yugoslavia, but Gonzales knew something was different this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of yelled down to them, I said, `Those aren't rocks!
Let's get out of here!'''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion ensued. They thought Macedonian troops patrolling the
border might have mistaken the Americans for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The military vehicle sped up, then Ramirez took a turn to evade
the gunfire. As the wild ride ensued, the men saw soldiers with
AK-47s and red, double-eagle patches _ the emblem of the
Yugoslavian army.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez took another turn, and then yet another, bullets pinging
off the Humvee's shell. It was when they went down a trail that the
truck's engine began to smoke. Then it quit. And it wouldn't
restart.
</P>
<P>
   Riding shotgun, Stone radioed their position. Gonzales, in the
back of the Humvee, reached for his loaded M-16. But options were
few.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an unspoken agreement. It was over,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the United States and its European allies were
trying to end the campaign by Milosevic to drive ethnic Albanians
from Kosovo. Serbia, which dominates what remains of Yugoslavia,
snubbed peace entreaties by the U.S. and Europe, then endured more
than two months of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States resisted a military invasion, opting for
bombing raids. But the three Gis in the Humvee unwittingly became
tangled in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 Serbs fell upon the men as they exited the ruined
jeep. Gonzales expected to be killed. Instead, he was kicked in his
midsection and struck in the head by wooden rifle butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I was thinking. I was praying in my mind. I
was definitely thinking I would be shot,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the middle between Steve and Chris, and so I figured
I'm going to see one of them get it in the head before I do,''
Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation began to improve when the Serbian troops used
a pair of twigs and cloth to craft a crude split for Gonzales'
injured right leg.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, each soldier was jailed in a 5-by-12-foot concrete
cell with crumbling white paint. Gonzales would break pieces of the
chalky paint and use them to write math problems on a wool blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Stone scraped the paint off to pass the time and lip-synched
rock songs, while Ramirez whispered rap tunes. Pacing back and
forth, Gonzales sang aloud Christian ``praise'' songs learned in
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers said they often were beaten at night.
</P>
<P>
   Freed on May 1, a day after meeting the Rev. Jesse Jackson in
Belgrade, Gonzales found the media's interest on the wane once back
in Texas. But he then began to have a recurring nightmare about an
escalating conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the dream, Gonzales would hear bullets and bombs blasting
buildings. Somehow he would escape his cell and walk through rubble
to a Bradley armored personnel carrier, where he identified himself
as an American. Then he awoke.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the nightmares are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in a sense that things don't happen randomly but at
the same time I'd still say I'm lucky, very lucky, for all the
things I didn't lose and things I came close to losing,'' Gonzales
said. ``I'm just very lucky that I didn't lose anything, that I can
still enjoy those things, that I am still living.''

<P>
   The largest U.S. gathering of women in 23 years will bring the
warriors of the old millennium _ Smeal, Steinem, Friedan _ together
with the up-and-comers of the new one who strive to kick-start the
feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rallying cry for women,'' said Alicia Daly of Girls
Inc. in Alameda, Calif., who will be among those attending the
Feminist Expo 2000 this weekend in Baltimore. ``It affords us the
opportunity to come together as one and learn from each other and
to be able to leave with some ideas of concrete things we can do to
move the feminist movement forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference is being sponsored primarily by the Los
Angeles-based Feminist Majority Foundation, at a cost of $1.2
million, with 575 other groups lending support.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 women have signed up, one-third of them college
students, according to Ellie Smeal, Feminist Majority leader and a
war horse of the movement since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it the biggest feminist gathering on U.S. soil since
the International Women's Year convention in 1977, which drew about
20,000 to Washington, D.C., Smeal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to showcase the movement, for us to get a
status report on it ourselves, to inspire it, to ignite it more, to
really have a sharing of ideas,'' Smeal said. ``We are fervent
believers that what has made social change, especially for women,
isn't money. It's ideas and people.''
</P>
<P>
   Women from more than 65 countries are expected to attend the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues to be discussed is the failure of the United
States, lone among industrialized countries, to sign the Convention
to End All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Born of an
international women's conference in Mexico in 1976, it was approved
by the United Nations three years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday-through-Sunday conference will reunite Smeal, Ms.
magazine founder Gloria Steinem, authors Betty Friedan and Bell
Hooks and others who are among the most active and visible
feminists of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Smeal says the feminist movement, far from fading out as some
have said, is bigger and stronger than ever. And the Internet has
strengthened its global reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so big and so active that no one can see it all. It's
become a part of the mainstream,'' Smeal said.

<P>
   COXNET-YANKEES - Can anyone stop the New York Yankees from
winning another World Series title? The team with the highest

wide-ranging power that could have a huge impact on the sport. A
look at Selig and his possible impact on the game. (Stinson,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: COXNET-STADIUM - The Houston Astros, San Francisco Giants
and Detroit Tigers once had some of the most distinct home-field
advantages in the major leagues. No more. All three teams move into
new stadiums this season, drastically altering not only how the
game is watched in those cities but also how it's played.

   SMITHFIELD-HAM (Tar Heel, N.C.) _ Smithfield Foods, operates hog
farms and slaughterhouses throughout the country, supplying pork to
the nation's biggest supermarkets and fast food outlets like
McDonald's. By aggressively acquiring its bigger rivals over the
last two years and turning itself into a vertically integrated
company that uses precision genetics, huge corporate hog farms and
giant meatpacking plants to control every aspect of production,
Smithfield Foods has ballooned into a $5 billion company that now
accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's pork supply. But in
doing so, the company has come under intense scrutiny from state

wield too much control over the nation's food supply, and too much

GOING FOR A RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As John Cusack stares into the camera at the beginning of ``High
Fidelity,'' the usually wired actor looks momentarily haggard, his
boyish face slightly puffy as if it were tired of resisting growing
up. Of course, it could just be the way the stereo headphones he's
wearing are squeezing his face and disheveling his hair.
</P>
<P>
   They're practically part of a uniform for Cusack's character,
Rob, who runs a vinyl-only Chicago used-record store, an atmosphere
that director Stephen Frears and his crew have captured so
precisely that you can almost smell the dust on the old albums. Rob
is a collector, but not just of records _ he's a collector of women
as well. Or rather, he's a collector of breakups: He makes top five
lists of everything in his life, and his latest and most patient
flame, Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle), has just earned a place
on the Top Five Breakups list.
</P>
<P>
   This sets Rob off on a soul-searching tour of past breakups, and
that makes up the rather loose but amiably funny plot of ``High
Fidelity.'' Cusack's Rob tells us about his life, past and present,
the latter of which includes his two addled co-workers Dick (Todd
Louiso), who's so reserved and nervous that he always looks like
he's afraid someone's about to hit him, and Barry (Jack Black), an
aspiring musician who is prone to harsh criticism of customers'
pedestrian musical tastes. The present also includes Laura, who has
hooked up with the pretentious guy who used to live above Rob, and
her buddy Liz (Joan Cusack), who's torn by loyalty to Laura and
sympathy for Rob.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the movie, Cusack addresses the audience directly,
and his likability and energy keep this from becoming an annoying
device. The movie has an episodic structure, but it retains its
appeal because so many of us know (or have been) a guy like Rob,
who learned all his life lessons from rock music and discovers that
they don't necessarily apply outside the realm of three-minute
records. Iben _ who's also in the Danish film ``Mifune,'' opening
this week in Dallas _ makes an immediate impression as the only
person with the intelligence or patience (to a point) to figure Rob
out.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie goes on a little too long, heaping one ending
on top of another, it wraps up well and includes several amusing
cameos. It also, as is appropriate for a movie featuring three
rock-music snobs, has one of the best soundtracks to come along in
some time.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: In the '40s I was a fan of the Popeye comic strip, and my
favorite character was a doglike creature called a ``Jeep.'' What
information is available on it and where can I track one down?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.L.D., Little Ferry, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: Eugene the Jeep, an orchid-eating, truth-telling,
problem-solving creature who arrived at Popeye's house in a box,
was introduced in E.C. Segar's Thimble Theater comic strip in March
1936.
</P>
<P>
   The character was a combination of a fourth-dimensional creature
and an ``African Hooey Hound,'' according to a history compiled by
Northeast Dubois (Ind.) High School, whose mascot is the Fighting
Jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Stuff in Parker, Colo., sells a large variety of licensed
merchandise devoted to the character _ T-shirts, jackets, coffee
cups, tire covers and other items. The company is run by an
enthusiast of jeep automobiles, and some of the items feature the
Jeep driving a jeep.
</P>
<P>
   You can order items over the Web at www.eugenestuff.com. For

&HT;     HEARST SAYS FOUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVE NOT OBJECTED TO
EXAMINER SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corp. has told a federal court that
four government agencies have not objected to its imminent plan to
sell the San Francisco Examiner and buy the San Francisco
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these agencies have indicated they have any intention
of challenging the closing of the transaction,'' lawyer Gary
Halling said Wednesday in a court declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst filed the papers to oppose former mayoral candidate Clint
Reilly's request for an emergency order temporarily blocking the
Chronicle purchase.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker is considering Reilly's
request.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle has been under review for
months by the U.S. Department of Justice, the state attorney
general's office and the San Francisco district attorney's and city
attorney's offices. The agencies have been told of Hearst's plans
to sell the Examiner to the Fang family, Halling said.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney Louise Renne said Wednesday her office had
finished its investigation of the deals and was satisfied Hearst
had made a ``good faith effort'' to ensure that San Francisco
remains a two-newspaper town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale appears to meet the objectives we expressed to the
Hearst Corporation,'' Renne said. ``The new owners are newspaper
people with longstanding ties to San Francisco. Under the terms of
the agreement as they have been expressed to me, it appears the
buyers have a viable opportunity to continue the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the state attorney general's office
have told Renne they have no objections either, said Renne's
spokesman Marc Slavin.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespersons for the Justice Department, District Attorney
Terence Hallinan, and the state attorney general's office declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly wants Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle blocked until
Walker holds a full hearing on his antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   The former political consultant claims Hearst's purchase of the
Chronicle would result in Hearst's owning the only metropolitan
daily paper in San Francisco, creating an illegal monopoly that
would reduce the range of editorial voices and increase advertising
and subscription prices.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly filed suit as a newspaper subscriber and advertiser but
has since claimed in court papers that he is acting as a ``private
attorney general'' to protect the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Chronicle Publishing Co. have denied Reilly's claims.
Their court papers say Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle and its
plan to sell the Examiner to the Fangs with a $66 million subsidy
over three years to publish the Examiner as a morning paper would
restore economic competition between San Francisco newspapers for
the first time in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has argued that it would cost far more for the Fangs to
publish the Examiner as a viable competitor to Hearst's Chronicle _
as much as $250 million over five years. He has called the Fang
deal a ``sham'' designed to destroy The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But Halling's brief for Hearst said, ``In fact, the transaction
is structured to provide incentives to continue the Examiner's
business. Hearst is only reimbursing actual expenses incurred in
publishing the Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs' profits increase with revenue from the Examiner, and
the paper's ultimate success depends on market forces, Halling
said.
</P>
<P>
   F. Warren Hellman, chairman of the San Francisco investment firm
Hellman &AMP; Friedman, said he and his colleague, Joseph Niehaus, had
personally advised the Fangs on their bid for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that they have every intention of owning and
operating the paper for the long term, and that they have a
financially sound, achievable plan with reasonable prospects for
doing so,'' said Hellman.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst agreed to buy the Chronicle, which has a daily
circulation of 464,535 and is Northern California's largest paper,
for $660 million in cash. The Examiner's daily circulation is
108,968.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the afternoon Examiner and the morning Chronicle
have published under a joint operating agreement, an exemption from
antitrust laws allowing them to combine business operations while
keeping independent news staffs.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a temporary restraining order, plaintiffs typically
must show either that they have a good chance of winning their suit
and that without the order they may suffer irreparable harm.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding whether to issue a temporary restraining order,
courts balance those factors along with whether the requested order
will serve the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's attorney, contends his client need
not meet those standards because he is merely asking the court to
maintain the status quo pending a full hearing already set for
April 13.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst counters that Reilly would suffer ``at most trivial''
harm if the sales go through as planned, and says his suit lacks
merit.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst contends it would suffer irreparable injury because a
temporary order ``would delay Hearst's efforts to expand the
Chronicle into a world-class newspaper and to begin speaking as
soon as possible with the editorial voice of the larger morning
Chronicle. Mr. Reilly has no right to delay Hearst's First
Amendment rights for even a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle claims it would lose as much as $102,000 each day
the deal is delayed and another $160 million that Hearst agreed to
pay above the next-highest bidder.

   JAPANESE-ART-COLLECTOR (New York) _ Since 1954, Mary Griggs
Burke and her husband, Jackson Burke, built the greatest private
collection of Japanese art outside Japan, now exhibited at the
Metropolitan Museum. By Roberta Smith.

   APPLES-CHICAGO (Chicago) _ When friends from abroad come to the
United States, I always send them to Chicago, or try to. It is the
quintessential American city: muscular, inventive, wonderfully
diverse, worldly-wise (if a bit oafish at times) and as
unpretentious as its prairie-flat vowels. ``Chicago is American in
every chitling and sparerib,'' H.L. Mencken wrote wickedly during
the era when the city's stockyards, since demolished, were the
biggest anywhere. ``It is alive from snout to tail.'' Reviled in
the days of Al Capone and John Dillinger as a haven for hoodlums,
Chicago was maligned for years for its cheerful civic corruption
and dismissed in the effete East as a hick town. Nelson Algren, one
of the writers who knew it best, said that ``loving Chicago is like
loving a woman with a broken nose.'' But no more. Chicago enters
the 21st century as a prosperous, well-governed model for the rest
of the country. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   OPERA-QUIZ-KIDS (New York) _ If you tune in Saturday afternoon
to the Texaco Opera Quiz, the popular intermission feature that is
part of the live radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, don't
be surprised if the three panelists sound rather young to be
experts. They are the Texaco Quiz Kids, as the producers of the
broadcasts are calling this first-ever panel of high school
students. Their knowledge and suitability have been tested through
a series of regional competitions in the New York, Houston, and
Washington areas. By Anthony Tommasini.

   NY-JEWISH-MUSEUM (New York) _ The Jewish Museum has not flinched
from efforts to make the story of more than 3,000 years of Jewish
civilization viewer-friendly. And with an eye to enhancing and
streamlining the presentation, the museum has embarked on a
two-stage reinstallation. The first stage, dealing with the ancient
world and the early Diaspora is now open. The second stage, which
continues the story to the present, is to be completed by 2001. By
Grace Glueck.
</P>
<P>
   NY-COMEDY-CLUBS (New York) _ Heard the one about the homeless
guy with the cell phone? I have. In fact, I've heard it over and
over and over again. I've also heard the one about how expensive
New York is and, of course, the one about the guy who can't get a
date. In fact, over the course of the last month, I have heard
hundreds of jokes, thousands of near misses and even a couple of
howlers, all perpetrated by the city's crack corp of comedians.
Considering the sheer number of comics and would-be jokesters, it
only stands to reason that New York is the wisecracking-est place
in the United States. There are nearly a dozen full-time comedy
clubs in the city, and scores of bars and restaurants across the
city regularly open their back rooms to those peculiar men and
women whose sole mission in life is to spread the joy of laughter _
and to book a spot on Letterman. By Jesse McKinley

   ELIAN _ MIAMI _ A mood of public resistance was rising here as
the Thursday deadline approached for U.S. immigration officials to
begin the process of repatriating 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba
unless his relatives here agree to give the boy up if their legal
case to keep him fails. (Williams, Cox News Service)

   ELIAN-GORE _ WASHINGTON _ The Elian Gonzalez case could be a
political setback for Al Gore. Though Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
has the advantage in a state where his brother is governor, the
Clinton-Gore ticket won the state in 1996. That victory was partly
due to strong support from Miami's Cuban-American community,
however, and the Elian case threatens to sap that support.

   ELIAN-RENO _ WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno expressed
confidence Thursday that Cuban-Americans in Miami would not
obstruct government efforts to repatriate Elian Gonzalez if that
became necessary. ``I don't think they came to this country to
incite violence,'' Reno said. ``I think they came to this country
to be able to speak their mind, to follow the law, to respect
others, and to see that those processes were carried out. (Schultz,

</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-REFUSE _ WASHINGTON _ Census Director Kenneth Prewitt,
facing widespread privacy concerns among many Americans and even
some members of Congress, has scheduled a news conference Thursday
to highlight the value of the information collected on the census
long form. A look at what's behind the census resistance. (Holmes,

<P>
   FLOOD-AID _ WASHINGTON _ North Carolina victims of last year's
Hurricane Floyd flooding face the prospects of more months without
disaster relief funds because of a congressional dispute. The House
on Thursday approved a supplemental funding bill containing more
than $2 billion in aid, but the Senate is refusing to act of the
bill, provoking outrage among some members. (Moscoso, Cox News

   FOUNDATION _ WASHINGTON _ Despite yesterday's report that
foundations are giving away more money than ever, community groups
say that it is misleading to think that there's a bigger pot of
money to divide. Most of the increase comes from large corporations
with specialized interests, said Rick McKelvey, vice president for
development at the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. ``There is not this
plethora of new money out there,'' he said. ``Most communities are
working harder than ever for a smaller piece of the pie.'' (Carr,

   AUDITS _ WASHINGTON _ Only 13 of the federal government's 24
major agencies won a clean bill of health from auditors for their
1999 financial statements. Although that was one more success than
last year, the results fell well short of the Clinton
administration's goal. The Pentagon remains the biggest offender,
with auditors saying that it had insufficient records for $119
billion in property, plant and equipment. (Malone, Cox News

   ALAMIN _ ATLANTA _ Evidence specialists will begin combing
through Jamil Al-Amin's Mercedes , looking for something that might
suggest a motive for the shooting of two Fulton deputies. They will
vacuum up every speck of dirt and fiber in the car and examine it
all. Most of what they find will be meaningless. But evidence of
contraband, such as guns, would be a big score. The car, the tag
found nearby, might also provide clues about others who might have
helped him in Alabama. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BUS-TRAIN _ TENNGA, Ga. _ Investigators began the tedious task
Thursday of recreating the train-school bus crash that killed three
children. Using a 1998 school bus matching the one hit Tuesday and
the same CSX locomotive involved in the accident, safety officals
spent the day making measurements to determine when driver Rhonda
Cloer should have been able to see and hear the oncoming train.

   CONVICT-COMMENCEMENT _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Outraged law enforcement

   BUSH-GUNS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ At sunup in an open field near
Houston, in a photo op, Bush learned how guns can banfire. Aiming
for publicity for a staged dove hunt, Bush knocked a protected
species from the sky. But overall, guns have served Bush's
political career well, inc luding his high-profile support for
concealed weapons bill, which helped propel him into state office.
Now the gun industry could help propel him to national office.

AUTHOR PROVIDES BUSINESS INSIGHT THROUGH PRISM OF LITERATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the world's a stage, the Bard tells us, but perhaps
especially the business world.
</P>
<P>
   So why not turn to fiction for a bit of management advice?
</P>
<P>
   That is the premise behind Robert A. Brawer's ``Fictions of
Business: Insight on Management From Great Literature'' (John Wiley
&AMP; Sons, 248 pages, $16.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book, now out in paperback, has received rave reviews as a
deft mix of business and literature.
</P>
<P>
   Brawer himself is an unusual mixture. Before a 20-year stint at
the Maidenform apparel firm, where he became chief executive and
president, Brawer earned a doctorate in English literature and
taught at the University of Wisconsin, specializing in medieval
studies. He returned to academia after his business career and now
teaches a cross-disciplinary course on fiction and business at New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt his book evolved from that course. Brawer's insight
from both his careers puts him in a unique position to address such
subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you enjoy reading fiction or not, this book definitely
outshines the woefully tedious management tomes flooding the
market.
</P>
<P>
   And as ``USA Today'' writes: ``Reading Brawer's book is like
taking a stimulating crash course in literature and management.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, you'll absorb enough literary snippets to
talk about ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' if you missed the movie, or
about ``Death of a Salesman'' if you missed the Broadway revival.
</P>
<P>
   But Brawer offers much more than a Cliffs Notes version of some
wonderful fiction. He seriously attempts to link business and
fiction _ along with anecdotes from his management career _ to
offer real solutions to real management problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immersion in the world of imaginative writing clearly has
nothing directly to do with maintaining a respectable bottom line,
controlling inventory levels, or drafting a marketing plan,''
Brawer says. ``I would insist, however, that the values and
insights we glean from serious literature sensitize us to ourselves
and, by extension, to the problems inherent in managing people in
an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Office politics, stress management and related issues are among
the topics Brawer addresses.
</P>
<P>
   On selling, he writes: ``If I were asked to identify a single
characteristic that the best business people have in common, I
would say that it is a sense of theater. Like theatrical
impresarios, they have mastered the art of illusion: creating the
perception in the minds of their customers that the product or
service they are selling has a unique value that transcends the
usual `features and benefits,' and does more than satisfy customer
`wants or needs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brawer uses David Mamet's play ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' to
illustrate the quintessential salesman making his pitch, then
offers examples from his career. Brawer suggests that firing up a
sales force should begin with ordering this play in bulk and
holding a seminar on it.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with employees unable to flourish under a corporate
light, Brawer turns to Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman.''
Rather than seeing an oppressive corporation breaking a defenseless
employee, however, Brawer suggests that Miller meant for
protagonist Willy Loman to lack self-awareness, thus making himself
a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the more self-aware we become as managers,
the more alert we become to how we should handle failed employees
like Willy,'' he writes. By dragging an employee on for years,
despite declining sales performance, and cutting back on his income
until he's working on commissions, the company was treating Loman
worse than if it had fired him years earlier, Brawer contends.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is easy about human relations management, but Brawer
offers ideas and answers from a different angle.

<P>
   Cashman Dudley, $21.95
</P>
<P>
   ``Competency models'' is one of the new buzzword phrases these
days. They are like ``job blueprints'' in which skills, knowledge,

   APPLES-CHICAGO (Chicago) _ When friends from abroad come to the
United States, I always send them to Chicago, or try to. It is the
quintessential American city: muscular, inventive, wonderfully
diverse, worldly-wise (if a bit oafish at times) and as
unpretentious as its prairie-flat vowels. ``Chicago is American in
every chitling and sparerib,'' H.L. Mencken wrote wickedly during
the era when the city's stockyards, since demolished, were the
biggest anywhere. ``It is alive from snout to tail.'' Reviled in
the days of Al Capone and John Dillinger as a haven for hoodlums,
Chicago was maligned for years for its cheerful civic corruption
and dismissed in the effete East as a hick town. Nelson Algren, one
of the writers who knew it best, said that ``loving Chicago is like
loving a woman with a broken nose.'' But no more. Chicago enters
the 21st century as a prosperous, well-governed model for the rest
of the country. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   NY-COMEDY-CLUBS (New York) _ Heard the one about the homeless

New York is and, of course, the one about the guy who can't get a
date. In fact, over the course of the last month, I have heard
hundreds of jokes, thousands of near misses and even a couple of
howlers, all perpetrated by the city's crack corp of comedians.
Considering the sheer number of comics and would-be jokesters, it
only stands to reason that New York is the wisecracking-est place
in the United States. There are nearly a dozen full-time comedy
clubs in the city, and scores of bars and restaurants across the
city regularly open their back rooms to those peculiar men and
women whose sole mission in life is to spread the joy of laughter _
and to book a spot on Letterman. By Jesse McKinley

&HT;     CALIF. ECONOMY WILL BE GOOD THIS YEAR BUT MAY SLOW LATER,
REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's robust economy will continue to
grow apace in 2000, but tightening credit concerns and a crippling
housing crunch will help cool off the Golden State in coming years,
according to the latest quarterly predictions by UCLA's Anderson
School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   The state's economy, which is diversified both by region and
industry, will grow by 3.5 percent in terms of nonfarm payroll jobs
in 2000, says the report, which was released Wednesday. That will
continue the strong pace set in 1999 when the same kinds of jobs
increased by about 3 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the pace of growth is expected to slow in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Lieser, the author of the report, ``California:
Continuing to Outpace the Nation,'' higher interest rates, rising
oil prices and an ever-increasing housing crunch will combine to
impede the state's white-hot economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Also looming large, according to Lieser, is the high-flying
stock market, which has fueled an unprecedented growth in personal
wealth throughout the state in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``A potential wild card would be a loss of investor confidence
in the highly valued stock market, particularly in the high-tech
issues, which are strongly represented in California's economy,''
wrote Lieser, executive director of the University of California at
Los Angeles' Anderson Forecast. ``However, the main impediments to
even stronger growth beyond 2000 may be in high home prices and in
increasingly widespread shortages of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the labor crunch more acute than in the San Francisco
Bay area. According to Lieser's report, the area's economy is fully
employed by any measure, with jobless rates ranging from 1.9
percent in San Francisco to 2.2 percent in San Jose and 2.7 percent
in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting new workers to the area is difficult because of the
raging real estate market, which has priced most middle-class
workers out of home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, new residential building permits averaged just more
than 140,000 in 1999, the best since 1990. While that may sound
good, Lieser said, the numbers still fall short of what's needed to
accommodate the employment growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the obstacles to increasing housing supply in
California are more political than market-based, and the political
barriers are mainly at the local level,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``With limited new housing supply coming to market, home prices
have continued upward this year. For Los Angeles County, average
prices increased more than 6 percent, and the San Francisco Bay
area was in double digits.''

<HEADLINE>
CUSACK A WINNER IN `HIGH FIDELITY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hero of the melancholy, funny and ultimately very winning
relationship comedy, ``High Fidelity,'' is Rob Gordon (John
Cusack), a twentysomething Chicago used-record store owner whose
live-in girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) has just left him for
another man.
</P>
<P>
   The abandonment has created an emotional crisis and deluge of
soul searching in the harrowingly immature Rob that has him _ for
most of the rest of the movie _ facing the camera and leading the
audience on a guided tour of the numerous failed relationships of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   These include his junior-high first-crush (Shannon Stillo), his
high school sweetheart (Joelle Carter), a knockout he knew from the
beginning was way out of his league (Catherine-Zeta Jones, in a
cameo), and a fellow perpetual loser at love (Lili Taylor).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rob is also having an affair with a sultry recording
artist (Lisa Bonet), desperately trying to get Laura back from her
new guy (Tim Robbins, in a cameo), and endlessly kibitzing with the
two music-junkie clerks in his moribund store (Todd Louiso and Jack
Black).
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is not everyone's movie. It's aimed squarely at a
young dating audience, and is not likely to hugely captivate anyone
out of that demographic. And if you're not a big fan of Cusack, you
should run in the other direction _ because he's on camera for
virtually the entire movie.
</P>
<P>
   For its full appreciation, ``High Fidelity'' also requires a
considerable knowledge of pop music trivia, because so much of the
humor plays off references to obscure musical groups. (Would, for
instance, anyone who had never heard of the '70s band,
Bachman-Turner Overdrive, get a character's punning reference to
``Kathleen Turner-Overdrive''?).
</P>
<P>
   But English director Stephen Frears keeps the situations and
one-liners fast-paced, he balances Cusack with a likably goofy
ensemble of supporting players, and he gives the film the original
eye and succession of uniquely revealing moments that characterizes
his best work _ films like ``The Grifters,'' ``My Beautiful
Laundrette'' and ``Dangerous Liaisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack (who shares a screenplay credit) is also quite effective.
His delivery is crisp and deadly, and _ on top of his work ``Being
John Malkovich'' _ he seems to be establishing a new persona for
himself as a sexually frustrated, angst-ridden, ludicrously
self-centered everyman: maybe even his generation's version of
Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   High Fidelity. Directed by Stephen Frears. Written by D.V.
DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg, from the
novel by Nick Hornby. Cast: John Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black,
Joan Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones. Touchstone. 114 minutes. Rated R
for sexual themes.

VERMONT SEEKS TO PROTECT ITS GOOD NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woe to the makers of salsa and chutney _ the ingredients of
which are harvested in California and bottled in New Jersey _ who
want to invoke the rural purity of the Green Mountain State. By
defining which foods deserve to use the state's name on their
labels, its attorney general is sending a message: If a product
bears the name ``Vermont,'' it had better be made in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   While the Federal Trade Commission regularly investigates
products labeled ``Made in USA,'' states rarely venture into the
same territory. But then, Vermont _ whose name has been estimated
to boost sales by between 5 and 10 percent _ is more than a state.
It's also a brand, and a good one. So, responding to complaints
from in-state food producers that ``people were trying to take
advantage of the Vermont name,'' the attorney general's office has
taken on labeling as a consumer protection issue, said Assistant
Attorney General Michael Duane.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's rules on food labeling, which probably
won't be finalized for months, will be used to flesh out the
state's consumer protection statute. In their final form, they
could require product labels to declare how much of their content
came from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are Heinz Food Corporation, the issue is not where
Heinz ketchup is made. You don't care. But when you get to a
Vermont company, you change context. Now the Vermont identity comes
into play,'' said Murray Burk, president of the Vermont Specialty
Foods Association. ``You've got to be someone without a heart or
soul to want to exploit something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's attorney general has already prosecuted two companies
for too-liberal use of the state's name _ first in 1989, when the
Stowe-based Mad River Traders were required to relinquish the name
``Vermont All-Natural Soda'' and state on their labels that the
product was bottled out of state. A maple syrup company was
prosecuted the next year for falsely claiming Vermont origin. And
as other states begin to capitalize on their state images,
Vermonters' sensitivity has never gone away.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion draft now being circulated for feedback from
specialty foods producers has some worried that the language could
be too purist for good business. Vermont's 300 specialty food
producers bring in $700 million in annual sales _ slightly more
than the ski industry, said Burk, who sells soup and pancake mix
from Post Mill, Vt. He says he's concerned that the rules will be
``micromanaging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my members would say that where the ingredients come
from is incidental to the identity of the food,'' Burk said. ``I
buy my flour from the King Arthur Flour Company, which is based in
Vermont, but do people really think that the wheat in the flour
comes from Vermont?''
</P>
<P>
   His fears are shared by Joanne and John Esau, owners of the
four-year-old Vermont Garlic Co. The Esaus like to think of
themselves as Vermont purists; when a salesman from Springfield,
Mass., called them, doggedly arguing that they could save 2 cents a
bottle by producing some ingredients out of state, the Esaus said
no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that social conscience that is so strong, that people
would judge us,'' said Joanne Esau, who, like her husband, has a
day job, as a high school teacher. If she found a product from out
of state parading its Vermontness, she would consider it ``a little
bit deceitful.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Esaus have a confession: The garlic comes from
California, where there are efficient garlic-peeling facilities.
After making calls to reassure worried customers that ``it wasn't
being peeled by immigrants'' _ it was peeled in a wind tunnel _ the
Esaus have built up their business so that this year, for the first
time, they could afford to pay themselves. They worry new labeling
rules could change all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could totally put us out of business,'' said Joanne Esau.
``We are the epitome of startup, and our initial startup cost was
the cost of the label. If we had to take the word Vermont out of
the name of our product, it would really cut into name
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Esau's anxiety notwithstanding, some of Vermont's
specialty food producers have a devotion to using in-state
ingredients which she refers to jokingly as ``political
correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, David Lyon started his line of pasta and
grill sauce out of his home in South Londonderry, but when sales
had begun to pick up two years later, he contracted processing of
all his 21 Uncle Dave's products to plants in Long Island and
Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But he still gets incensed when entrepreneurs don't make the
effort to buy as many of their ingredients as possible from
Vermonters. That, to him, is a ``moral situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times in the past where people have taken post
office boxes in Vermont just to say they're part of Vermont,'' said
Lyon. ``What they're trying to do is not let the big guys
capitalize in Vermont. I think they're invading Vermont.''

`EL DORADO'S' ANIMATION IS GOLDEN, BUT WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C+   
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg _ who inaugurated the
great cycle of Disney animated musicals of the '90s _ jumped ship
to become a founding partner at DreamWorks, the assumption was he
would soon make the new studio's animation department the industry
flag-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   But DreamWorks first major foray into the field, 1998's ``The
Prince of Egypt,'' was distinctly underwhelming. Its animation was
breathtaking and truly epic, but its storyline (a remake of the
first half of ``The Ten Commandments'') was disjointed and
uninvolving.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost the same criticism can be leveled at the studio's
second big animated musical, ``The Road to El Dorado.'' Its
animation is simply glorious, but its story and characters are
trite. The film can't hold a candle to Disney's recent ``Toy Story
2,'' or even ``Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1519, it's the story of Tulio (voice of Kevin Kline) and
Miguel (Kenneth Branagh), two Spanish con artists, who accidentally
stow away on a conquistador ship and find themselves washed up on
the coast of Mexico with a map to the legendary lost city of gold,
El Dorado.
</P>
<P>
   When they find the city, its natives assume they're gods, and
enthrone them in their own temple surrounded by undreamed of
treasure. The rest of the movie has the rascals straining to
preserve the illusion of their divinity, while trying to figure
some way of getting the gold back to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the stew are a pair of cute animals that join the heroes
in progress, a triangular romance with a young Indian woman (Rosie
Perez), much intrigue and deadly supernatural manifestations
concocted by an evil high priest (Armand Assante) and regular
injections of songs by Elton John.
</P>
<P>
   As this familiar package comes together, the seamless mix of
computer and traditional animation cannot be faulted. The
show-stopping sequences include a tumultuous storm at sea, a trek
through the staggeringly beautiful rainforest, and a dazzling
recreation of a Mesoamerican civilization at its summit.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, the songs are forgettable and bear little
relationship to the action; the characters have no particular charm
(or chemistry with one another); the humor is awkward; and the
whole enterprise has a by-the-numbers feel to it: as it had been
put together by a committee with no guiding sensibility in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, its story is limp. A strange marriage of a
Hope-Crosby ``Road'' picture with ``The Man Who Would Be King,'' it
offers no emotional bite whatsoever. Unlike the best of the
animated musicals of the last dozen years, it doesn't even try to
work as a fable. It's just the story of a pair of 16th century
adolescents, yucking it up in Mayaland.
</P>
<P>
   The Road to El Dorado. Directed by Eric Bergeron and Don Paul.
Voices: Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez, Armand Assante,
Edward James Olmos. Animated. DreamWorks. 83 minutes. Rated PG for
language.

PERILS OF LIFE IN THE FAST LANE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We lead accelerated, time-driven lives.
</P>
<P>
   In just 100 years, science and technology have transformed the
United States from an agrarian nation into a telecommunications and
high-tech center. New efficiencies abound, allowing us to save
time, improve production, and maximize energy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, James Gleick, author of ``Faster: The Acceleration
of Just About Everything'' (1999, Pantheon Books, New York), poses
a simple yet thought-provoking question: At what cost?
</P>
<P>
   Using humor and examples that range from the unusual to the
mundane, Gleick forces us to look at how the production of
innovative time-savers has had the opposite effect: The more time
we save, the more time we need.
</P>
<P>
   Gleick says we aren't working harder or even longer than our
predecessors, though many in law, high technology, and finance
would disagree. Even among lawyers, it seems, the average number of
billable hours per year is now 1,800. Compare that to the 2,500
average billable hours logged by attorneys at a prominent law firm
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   So, why do we feel so busy, so stressed, so time-pressed, so
harried, so overworked and worn out?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, says the author, it is because everything, from the way
we live to the way we think, is faster. And despite the complaints,
many of us are as addicted to the rush of life in the so-called
fast lane as drug users are to narcotics. Speed is a tonic, and
it's pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Helen Stein agrees with Gleick.
</P>
<P>
   The culture has changed, she says, and we run faster to keep up.
We probably have the same amount of time we've always had, Stein
says, but the way we use it, or spend it, has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, you could actually use the same number of hours in a
day as you did before, but you are now going at breakneck speed,''
she says. ``You may not even move, but something _ the beeper, the
mail, the telephone _ is always bombarding you. And one's work life
tends to intrude more into one's personal life. People are no
longer in the moment, or just quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleick's book points out that sociologists in several countries
have found that increasing wealth and increasing education bring a
sense of tension about time. As a result, Gleick says, we believe
we have too little of it _ a myth many of us now live by.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is true is that we are awash in things, in information,
in news, in the old rubble and shiny new toys of our complex
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   We spend more time online, on the phone, on the freeway. For
example, market researchers have found that people 45 and over sit
at their computers for more than 70 minutes per day. A decade ago,
we spent 52 minutes a day talking on the telephone, up from 36.5
minutes in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the average time devoted to sex is four minutes and
a few seconds, or a half-hour per week.
</P>
<P>
   Not suprisingly, our accelerated society has its own lingo.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites allow us to converse from afar in ``real'' time. Other
terms include ``fast track, ``meth-paced,'' ``snail mail,'' ``rush
hour,'' ``sound bytes,'' ``cutting-edge,'' and ``quantum leap.''
</P>
<P>
   All have helped transform the American lexicon while reflecting
our new lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   We ``multitask,'' for example. And we would rather be
``quick-witted'' and working at ``lightning speed'' than slow,
methodical, or ponderous _ all terms once associated with sagacity,
thoughtfulness, and wisdom that comes with age.
</P>
<P>
   Gleick, referring to the voluminous amount of information we
ingest and decode daily, notes that our ancestors had little reason
to process tens of thousands of words, spoken or written, ``any
more than they challenged their visual cortex to process cinematic
montage. . . We absorb the stimuli of a fast, complex world; we
require specialized training to handle parts of it (automobiles,
VCRs, Gameboys); and often we enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard of unhurried qualities, but we think,
nonetheless, that the students who plod through laborious
calculations cannot be quite as smart as their comrades who snap
their fingers and know the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even companies have absorbed this mind-set, building their
recruitment efforts and employment policies around mind-speed tests
and games, according to Nicholas Lemann, author of ``The Big
Test.''
</P>
<P>
   At certain high-tech and finance companies, he notes, job
applicants are peppered with SAT-like questions, timed essays,
puzzles, and games, all designed to gauge speed and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster'' is entertaining, but I couldn't agree with Gleick's
pronouncement that Americans are far from overworked. Has he
forgotten the temps with two or three jobs?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Gleick's view of work differs markedly from those of
the work-addicted or work-abused. Even so, the author succeeds in
documenting our love-hate relationship with a frenzied race against
time, a state characterized by simultaneous feelings of freedom and
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   I asked several people about their perception of time. Do they
have more, but feel as if there is less? Since lunch is sometimes a
measure of how busy we are, I asked if it was eaten at a desk, at a
restaurant with clients or friends, or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Brier, a Newton marketing consultant and mother of two,
says she barely has time for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend two minutes eating it. I have to tell myself to sit
down. Usually I'm standing up when I scoop some cottage cheese into
a mug. There's just no time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brier wakes at 5:30 a.m. to exercise, make breakfast, make
lunches, start dinner, bid her husband goodbye, and see her
children off. She also carpools. She says she speeds through lunch
to make time for a full, sit-down meal with her family later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I eat lunch?'' Laura Russell, a program director at the
Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston, asked. ``Yes,
I'll eat _ while I'm doing something else.'' Russell also has
walking lunches. She eats while on her way to appointments around
town.
</P>
<P>
   Walking lunches, multitasking, rushing: They are all part of the
new paradigm. But what happens when we slow down? Can we?
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that when it's time to be alone, we might need
that cell phone or palm pilot or television?
</P>
<P>
   ``As nature abhors a vacuum, so we abhor the blankness, the lack
of stimulation, that comes with doing nothing,'' writes Gleick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, alone with our thoughts, we feel that there just isn't
enough to keep us entertained.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGLE PASS, Texas _ At the first blast from the seven-gun honor
guard on Thursday, the barking and whimpering spectators fell
silent, as Labrador retrievers, German shepherds and dark-faced
Belgian Malanois looked anxiously at their handlers.
</P>
<P>
   By the third and final blast, they were petrified.
</P>
<P>
   As service funerals go, the one observed outside the Canine
Enforcement Section kennels near the Camino Real International
Bridge was short and to the point, but not without pathos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gathered here today to honor a fallen comrade, not an
officer, but Hamlet, a loyal canine,'' began the eulogy by John
Salazar, the U.S. Customs Service port director for Eagle Pass.
</P>
<P>
   At Salazar's right on a small table, was an urn containing
Hamlet's ashes, a bouquet of flowers, and the wooden badge, bearing
number 6C-66, that until recently had been attached to Hamlet's
kennel door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet had not been in the field very long, barely two years,
but he had already made his mark, intercepting over $7 million in
drugs, with excellent seizures of cocaine and marijuana,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year-old yellow Labrador retriever died of cancer on
March 15.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral was held at the suggestion of Hamlet's handler,
Customs agent Percy Lomax, who had trained with him at the
service's canine school in Virginia, and then worked with him in
Eagle Pass for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mellow, the mellowest dog here, but fun-loving. He
loved to play around,'' Lomax said before the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really loved that dog. It's just kind of hard to let it go.
It really hurt to find out he had cancer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his fellow canines, Hamlet's funeral was attended by his
veterinarian and other agents from Customs, the U.S. Border Patrol,
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Eagle Pass police,
and Mexican Customs. Eagle Pass is 150 miles west of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Most agents were dog handlers, and the Customs dog teams working
the two international bridges in Eagle Pass Thursday morning were
pulled off duty to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The common bond of the officers who attend was their four-footed
partners and their shared sense of grief, and the loss was as real
as the tears that appeared on Lomax's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a parent-child relationship. In the Customs Service,
we take a new handler and put him with a new dog, and they work
together, so after a few years, they develop a strong bond,'' said
Robert Cagle, the team leader for the Customs' 14-dog canine squad
and partner of Crocket, a chocolate lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's your buddy, he's your pet, and he's your partner, and
you're taking care of him. The dog will defend the handler, take a
bullet for him,'' said Trinidad Sanchez, an INS dog handler, whose
partner is Eros, a German shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good dog makes the handler look good, and a good handler
makes the dog look good. And when you lose one, it's like a death
in the family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for the failure of a bugler to show up and play taps, the
funeral service went off without a hitch. After the crowd has
dispersed, calm returned, broken only by the sounds of eager
barking of the drug dogs waiting to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very long, but I think it was appropriate. And I
think it meant a lot to Mr. Lomax. We all would have felt the same
way if it had been our dog too,'' Cagle said.

LAUGHABLE PLOT PUSHES `SKULLS' TO BRINK OF ABSURDITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If it's secret and it's elite, it can't be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of The Skulls as the Freemasons for the Ivy League crowd,
an exclusive club of future movers and shakers with a taste for
dark Gothic theatrics. They're not so much secret as clouded in
mystery and myth _ everyone on campus knows all about them and even
where they meet _ but they are elite and very powerful.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ideal aphrodisiac for star athlete and street kid made
good Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson from TV's ``Dawson's Creek'').
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of its running time, ``The Skulls'' is about
Luke's seduction. Lured by lavish gifts and cabal-like ceremonies
in torchlit stone chambers, he's an everyman toying with selling
his soul in exchange for entrance to the halls of American power.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much to jerk him back to reality, only the death
of his best friend Will (Hill Harper), an aspiring investigative
journalist who digs a little too deep into the secrets of the
Skulls. Luke discovers his own Skull ``soulmate'' Caleb Mandrake
(Paul Walker), son of ruthless society godfather Craig T. Nelson,
is the prime suspect. The moral compass in an amoral underworld, he
challenges the leaders and discovers that powerful friends make
vindictive enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is hopelessly dull as Luke, unconvincing as either a
reformed delinquent or a crusading rebel taking on the Skulls on
their own terms. Walker, with flashing eyes under furrowed brow and
an angular face pulled tight with tension, is far more interesting
as a haunted rich kid ``bad boy'' torn between pleasing an
overbearing father and a conscience pushed deep inside.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Cohen's direction is too solemn for this often laughable
twist in the Victorian ``secret society'' thriller. He fills every
image with haze and shadow, especially the secret ceremonies that
have the humorless gravity of a Satanic ritual, with elder members
standing in the shadows like demonic overlords.
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect between modern boys and ancient ritual is rife
with possibility, but the script is more interested in the plot
launched against Luke (who plays into their hands by ranting like a
paranoid) and the back-stabbing and blackmail of Skulls in
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen drives the film at a galloping pace, but it's not fast
enough to outrun its absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   The Skulls. Directed by Rob Cohen. Screenplay by John Pogue.
Cast: Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker, Hill Harper, Leslie Bibb,
William Petersen, Craig T. Nelson. Universal Pictures. 107 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for violence and language.

ON THE CLUTTER-FREE ROAD TO HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michelle Passoff is a yoga devotee who believes that cleaning
your life of clutter is ``the missing link'' to inner happiness.
</P>
<P>
   A line on the cover of Passoff's ``Lighten Up!: Free Yourself
From Clutter'' claims it's ``the first book of its kind to view
cleaning not as a burdensome chore but as a transformational
experience.'' By that, Passoff means spiritual as well as physical
transformation. In her view you can't have one without the other.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning your life of clutter will produce results, she
promises. It will lead to personal growth, even to ``magic'' and
``miracles.'' For some of us, merely making a dent in our clutter
would be miracle enough, but I suspect Passoff has something larger
in mind. In her book she writes that cleaning your clutter ``can
make a difference in your life, the lives around you, and
ultimately the world.''
</P>
<P>
   World peace through clutter cleaning? Well, it's safer and
cheaper than nuclear deterrents.
</P>
<P>
   Passoff is an amiable Manhattanite who seems pretty laid-back
for a woman who's made a career of organizing. It must be the yoga.
She was in Boston recently to teach a course to a small class, 12
people. Since opening her clutter-cleaning consulting business in
1991, she's traveled far and wide working with private clients and
holding classes for the clutter-confounded.
</P>
<P>
   She's never had a clutter problem herself, she said, thanks to
her mother, a superorganized woman who enlisted her husband and two
daughters in the job of keeping their home neat. It also helped,
she said, that the family lived in a glass house, an A-frame, where
every corner was open to view, so there was no place for clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Her business is thriving because the problem of clutter is
getting worse. ``Life is more complicated; there's more information
coming at us at a furious pace,'' she said during a break in class.
``More people are working from home; people are more mobile. This
is a point of great change in our society, and if we're not able to
anchor ourselves in our physical environment, all this stuff can
overwhelm us.''
</P>
<P>
   We were some of the overwhelmed, 10 women, two men, mostly
middle-aged, a few in their 20s, all of us _ well, all of us but
one, who claimed being organized was one of her chief interests in
life _ so burdened by clutter that we were willing to spend $34 and
sit indoors on a beautiful afternoon in hopes that Passoff would
inspire us to go home and finally deal with all the stuff we've
accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   Passoff had some bad news for us. Clutter never stops; it keeps
on coming. Just as there's no such thing as succcesful binge
dieting, there's no successful binge clutter-cleaning. The approach
has to be integrated into daily life. If any of us was hoping for a
quick fix that would last forever, she told us, we should forget
it.
</P>
<P>
   She started the class by instructing us to take 10 minutes to
think about why we want to clear our clutter: ``Ask yourself, What
am I making room for?''
</P>
<P>
   The sort of answer she was looking for wasn't ``New and better
clutter.'' We were supposed to dig deep and think big. What are our
goals? What do we want out of life? She suggested a few categories
for us to consider: Financial? Professional? Relationships?
</P>
<P>
   In 10 minutes I was supposed to come up with answers to
questions I haven't been able to resolve in 20-odd years of
therapy. Of course, it's possible I already know the answers. It's
even possible that I deliberately keep my life full of clutter,
physical and emotional, to avoid making decisions. Confirmed
clutterers don't like making decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking about clutter is an intimate conversation,'' Passoff
said, encouraging us to delve into our psyches. ``It's talking
about the skeletons in your closet.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused for a second and chuckled. ``You know, I worked with
a client once who literally had skeletons in her closet,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't elaborate on the skeletons, but turned to a young
graphic designer who said he needed to clean his clutter to make
more room for his creative projects. ``I have a lot of nice
stuff,'' he said, ``but you know, if you have too much stuff, no
matter how nice it is, it's junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Passoff nodded, adding that some of her clients are people who
collect rare and beautiful things and turn to her when their
collections overwhelm their lives. ``When you start adding on rooms
to accommodate your stuff, that's a problem,'' she said. ``I don't
care how nice your stuff is.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman said needed to clean her clutter because she is now
working out of as well as living in a 900-square-foot apartment.
Another is expecting a baby and wants to clear up clutter at home
to make room for the new arrival.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman says she's completing her M.A. and running a
business from her parents' home. Her office needs to be better
organized, she said, so she can spend her time more productively.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to clutter-clean often comes at life-changing moments,
Passoff said. A marriage. A baby. Leaving school. A change of job.
Moving house. A death in the family. Yes, and aging, and changing
shape. Several women in the class, including me, had clothes
clutter. It's very hard to face up to the fact I'll never again fit
into all those clothes I wore 20 pounds ago. Passoff advises being
ruthless. After all, the clothes are useless and only remind me of
the weight I've gained. ``When you open your closet,'' Passoff
said, ``your goal is to get dressed, not get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothes should be clean and in good repair and fit your body and
your lifestyle. Anything that doesn't fit those criteria shouldn't
be in your closet. But how can I bring myself to get rid of all
that stuff?
</P>
<P>
   ``One item at a time,'' Passoff said. This is the golden rule of
clutter cleaning, according to Passoff, and it's her own mantra.
``If you look at a whole project you may get discouraged,'' she
said. ``Focus on one paper, one piece of clothing, one object at a
time. Once you've cleaned your clutter, the one-item-at-a-time will
help you maintain a clutter-free lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last hour of class Passoff concentrated more on the
practical than the spiritual side of clutter cleaning. Pick a place
to start, she said. Desk, bedroom, closet, wherever. Then schedule
a block of time to clean, two to four hours, preferably four
because, she said, ``usually you can see a wonderful difference
after four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Gather up all your clutter. Get some boxes for presorting and
label them ``personal,'' ``professional,'' ``financial,'' and so
forth. Lay in a supply of file folders for organizing because, when
all is said and done, successful clutter cleaning involves a good
filing system.
</P>
<P>
   Presort your clutter into the boxes. Then go through each box,
one item at a time, and do what needs to be done. Answer that
letter. Pay that bill. Throw away that clipping you've been saving
for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   After class I told Passoff that I felt exhausted just thinking
about cleaning all my clutter at home and at work. She said it
would take time _ weeks, even months _ but that the effort would be
worth it because decluttering your life is energizing and brings
inner peace. She compared it to practicing yoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yoga practice is about cleaning your mind of clutter,'' she
said, ``so you can go within yourself to a place of silence to
whatever is divine.''
</P>
<P>
   A place where, presumably, you don't need any file folders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lighten Up! Free Yourself From Clutter'' is a HarperPerennial
paperback, $13. Passoff's phone number is 212-222-2488; e-mail her

SEEING FAMILY IN A NEW LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My brother, my sister, and I have been estranged all our lives.
</P>
<P>
   We just didn't know it.
</P>
<P>
   Part it of has to do with the age differences between us. I'm
seven years older than my sister, 12 years older than my brother.
Until recently, we thought we'd grown up in ``different'' families
and been affected in different ways by our parents' changing
fortunes. Since my mother served as the spoke of a wheel, passing
messages between us and often creating conflict in the process, as
children all we knew about one another was what our parents told
us. We didn't really talk until we were adults.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't know how alienated we were because after we all got
married, we made the decision to get along. We got together at
holidays. We smoothed over occasional flare-ups and didn't look at
them too closely. We rose to the occasion of my father's death,
helping him die in hospice care at my sister's house. We probably
would have gone on being politely distant forever if my sister
hadn't gone into therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Susan, however, didn't treat therapy as an act designed to fix
herself apart from her relationships with others. She wanted to
share the process, and so last fall she invited my husband and me
to spend a weekend on the Cape with her and her husband, discussing
the issues she was facing. I was reluctant. What fool wants to stir
things up? I was sure I'd made my peace with my parents who, in any
case, were no longer alive, and so I went with the sole intention
of being a good listener.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't plan to reveal a thing.
</P>
<P>
   After all, my parents had presented me to my younger siblings as
a great success story, someone whose accomplishments could not
easily be matched. Susan, in reaction, had rebelled against the
expectation that she follow in my footsteps, and I was sure that
she resented whatever success I had achieved. I didn't want Susan
to see the chinks in my armor. I was afraid that if I revealed the
childhood demons that had followed me into adulthood, she'd take
satisfaction from my pain. In my deepest soul, I really didn't
trust her. I was afraid of her anger.
</P>
<P>
   When we got together, Susan talked about her experience of
growing up in our home. I was shocked. Every word she said could
have come out of my mouth. We'd both felt the same terrible
loneliness as children, the same sense of disconnection from other
family members. She hadn't felt understood, or valued, or loved.
She hadn't felt supported, or safe, or lovable. And as she spoke
from her heart, mine tumbled open and revealed the same tangle of
painful emotions. I began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   To my immense surprise, Susan comforted me.
</P>
<P>
   It was an enormous relief to feel close to someone who'd shared
the same difficult and unique parents, to finally have someone who
could nod in agreement as I described the nature of my discomfort
in this world. There was such an indescribable feeling of mutual
compassion that we couldn't stop talking. We stayed away from the
disagreements and judgments that had distanced us as adults, and by
Sunday morning, discovered that they were no longer of any
importance, mere symptoms of our underlying distrust. We both felt
as if, through some quirk of fate, we were finally becoming true
friends to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Susan is close to my brother. At odds with him, I always felt
she was on his side. But in this new relationship, she was able to
help me understand that he was also trying to survive the childhood
forces operating in our lives. Eventually I called my brother and
confessed to all the negative feelings I'd been so carefully (and
unsuccessfully) hiding. I acknowledged how unfair I'd been, and how
ready I was to start again from a new place. Ken didn't say a word
of reproach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he asked if Susan and I would include him in our
process.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not recommending this to other families. I hardly believe
what is happening in my own, but I see that our decision to get
together regularly despite our inner reservations was an indication
of how much we each longed to be part of a loving, extended family.
I was wrong in thinking there was no need for me to deal with my
family of origin, which has left such a powerful mark on my psyche.
</P>
<P>
   We three have a shared history; it seems right that memory
should bond us to one another. Perhaps, in daring to examine the
puzzle of our childhoods together, we can add a new dimension of
healing to the meaning of the word family.
</P>

NEW LIFE FOR OLDFANGLED MAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are the forgotten stepchildren of the modern media family.
In all the hoo-hah over the AOL-Time Warner deal, most mentions of
the company's famous magazines came in a few snide stories about
the sudden explosion of Time Inc. stock-option millionaires. When
Times-Mirror was sold to the Tribune Co., its stable of magazines _
from Popular Science to Field &AMP; Stream _ was treated as the
proverbial player to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, somehow, in this digital, high-speed, instantaneous news
cycle culture, the old-fashioned magazine business is alive and
kicking furiously. And some of the biggest names in the business
are about to unveil products, including Oprah Winfrey's magazine
for Hearst, an e-commerce publication from Time Inc., and a Conde
Nast entry about shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've been in better times,'' enthuses Samir
Husni, a University of Mississippi journalism professor and
magazine analyst. ``You don't read anywhere anymore about the death
of print.'' That may be something of an overstatement, but Husni
brandishes the vital stats to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   By his calculations, there were 866 magazine launches in 1999,
which translates to nearly 2 1/2 a day. (And that's a drop from the
1,067 launches in 1998.) Last year, the hottest categories among
startups were celebrity publications (108) and sports (95). But
specialty startups also flourished, which explains the debut of
Rubbertime for latex fetishists and Bark, described as a ``dog
lover's literary forum.'' The news is also bullish from the
Publishers Information Bureau, which reported that 1999 magazine ad
revenue was up almost 13 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Husni's estimate that only about 10 percent of startups
survive 15 years, publishers are constantly churning out new or
improved models. The already competitive celebrity magazine genre
heated up earlier this month when US went weekly and threw down the
gauntlet to the all-powerful People.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much, much younger,'' than People, insists USweekly
editor in chief Terry McDonell, carefully explaining his niche.
``We wouldn't do James Brolin. We would do Toby Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   Life magazine shuffles off the newsstand for good, but here
comes Time Inc.'s 212-page Real Simple, with its attention focused
on ``life/home/body/soul.'' Details magazine is suspended and
retooled, but its place is filled by FHM, another British import
trying to crack the ``lad magazine'' category so named for its apt
attention to female flesh.
</P>
<P>
   This month marks the arrival of Offspring, the Dow Jones-Hearst
collaboration marketed as ``the magazine of smart parenting,''
featuring a cover photo of an elementary school-aged girl toting an
Apple iBook. To find out how she'll turn out in a few years, try
teenStyle, the new guide to youthful beauty tips published by H &AMP; S
media.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what is driving the magazine explosion is what the media
banking firm of Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates calls ``brand
extensions,'' the spinoffs created by major publishers looking to
match new products with ever tighter demographic niches.
</P>
<P>
   The products in the pipeline include O, The Oprah Magazine _
from Hearst and the Harpo Entertainment Group _ that is headed for
the newsstands April 19 as ``the women's personal growth guide for
the Twenty-First Century.'' This spring, Time Inc. introduces
eCompany Now to cover the burgeoning world of online commerce. And
in mid-May, Conde Nast publishes a trial issue of Lucky, a magazine
about shopping designed for young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one trend is that major magazine publishers are
launching, in force, new magazines,'' says Husni. ``More and more
of the companies are finding out that magazines are the missing
link in the electronic chain.'' Using Web sites that offer a taste
of the full magazine _ and taking advantage of the reliability
associated with print _ magazine publishers are wisely avoiding the
crucial mistake ``of trying to compete with the Internet instead of
complementing it,'' says Husni.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing wrinkle is the move by Nerve (www.nerve.com), a
sophisticated three-year-old online magazine about sex, to start
distributing a print version in April. The company's press release
sums up the undeniable appeal of Nerve's subject matter and the
resiliency of the magazine industry by promising readers
``something beautiful they can put their hands on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the theory that a fawning media aided and abetted the
presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain? Well a survey of almost
1,200 adults taken in mid-March by the Pew Research Center found
that 14 percent thought McCain's press coverage was too tough,
compared to only 10 percent who thought George W. Bush got a raw
deal and 8 percent who thought Vice President Al Gore was unfairly
treated. ``Complaints that the media have been too easy on John
McCain appear to have little resonance beyond the Beltway,'' the
survey concluded. Just one more example of that famous Beltway-Main
Street disconnect.

&HT;     EYES AT NIGHT,   WITH NEW SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   I am traveling at 60 miles per hour and it is a pitch-black
night. The 100 yards of highway ahead that are swept by my
headlights are clear.
</P>
<P>
   But there, seeming to dance on the leading edge of my car's
hood, I get an early, important look at potential danger _ 400-500
yards ahead. There is a car in the breakdown lane. Will someone
suddenly step from beside it into the road? It has stopped near the
glowing image of a highway overpass and I see an animal scurrying
up the grassy embankment from the highway to the overpass. Will the
creature _ it turns out to be a dog _ suddenly change direction and
dart back into my path?
</P>
<P>
   At 60 miles per hour, at that distance, I have between 12 and 17
1/2 seconds to weigh these potential dangers and adjust my driving
accordingly. Without the Night Vision system in the Cadillac
DeVille I am driving, I would have seen none of this until I was
100 yards or less from the car and the dog. If the dog darted or an
occupant of the car had been crouched, changing a tire, back
jutting into the travel lane, I would have had only about 3 1/2
seconds to recognize the danger, react, and, if necessary, bring my
car to a sudden stop.
</P>
<P>
   The DeVille is the first car offered in the United States with
Night Vision as an option. Right now, it's not cheap _ about $2,000
_ but its safety potential is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   This Night Vision system was developed by General Motors and
Raytheon Systems, with some work done in Massachusetts, but the
bulk of it done in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Night Vision was born, as are many civilian inventions, of
military design. Early systems designed to help fight in the dark,
such as the ``Starlight'' scope used in Vietnam or night vision
goggles, work by concentrating available ambient light _ what
Stuart Klapper, director of automotive programs for Raytheon, calls
image intensifier technology.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Gulf War came, America got a look at a different
sort of night vision enhancing technology. It was called far
infrared, or forward-looking infrared. It is these images, which
look like photographic negatives, that you may recall from news
photos and video from the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   What is different about forward-looking infrared is that it uses
heat, rather than light, to form an image for the operator of a
tank _ or a DeVille.
</P>
<P>
   Klapper says that even 15 years ago, a single, forward-looking
infrared system cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That a
system can now be offered for $2,000 is remarkable. And Klapper
says that as Night Vision systems become more commonplace, their
costs could drop to what you pay today for a good television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens with prices will depend on public reaction,'' he
says, citing air bags and anti-lock brake systems, once expensive
options, as examples of safety features that drop in cost and make
their way into the mainstream automotive market.
</P>
<P>
   Cost, of course, is but one factor in selling the public on a
new technology. Another is persuading drivers that the technology
will help them and, further, that it will be easy to use and will
not distract them as they drive.
</P>
<P>
   Safety should be marketable based purely on common sense. Only a
quarter of the nation's drive time is spent on the road after dark,
yet that's when half of all fatalities occur. How many moose, deer,
dogs, cats, humans, broken down autos, get hit by vehicles whose
drivers don't spot the danger until too late?
</P>
<P>
   The ease of use and a lack of distraction factors require more
tangible proof _ like a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   So get behind the wheel of the 2000 DeVille (full review of the
car itself next week), fire it up at night, and let the Night
Vision system warm up for about 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   An image about the size of your interior rearview mirror appears
just above the top of your dashboard. With a couple of buttons you
can move it up or down an inch or so, or can alter its intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Though the image _ picked up by a forward-looking camera mounted
in the Cadillac's grille _ is projected through the dash ahead of
you and onto the windshield, you do not ``see'' it on the
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what Klapper calls a ``virtual image'' causes your eyes
to focus out at the very front of the car. If the image were
projected, say, on a flat or pop-up screen on your dash, your eyes
would have to refocus each time you glanced at the screen and again
when you looked back to the road.
</P>
<P>
   With Night Vision's virtual image system, your eyes are in
constant focus on the road ahead. After only about 10 minutes of
getting used to the system, you are looking right through the
virtual image _ aware of what appears on it _ but concentrating on
the road as you normally would.
</P>
<P>
   What you see is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all objects give off some heat. Humans and animals are
warmest and they give off the most heat. My own children, put well
out of headlight range and given a soccer ball to toss, appeared as
strong, milky images on the screen. Even the ball _ warm because
they were touching it, I assume _ was a glowing white orb.
</P>
<P>
   Children safely back in the car, we took a drive. Trees _
they're alive _ glowed in a roadside dance of their own, darker at
the trunks, radiant out near the tips of their branches.
</P>
<P>
   Autos appeared ahead of me even as their tail lights were only
first coming into view. Their bodies glowed, their exhausts were
pulsing emissions of light. Because this system uses heat, not
light, to capture its images, it ``sees through'' the headlights of
approaching cars, a scenario that would be a blinding problem for
systems that concentrate available light.
</P>
<P>
   Road signs are not as bright, but become quickly visible long
before headlights reach them. Bridges and their supports,
presumably giving off radiant heat stored during the daytime,
become visible way beyond the reach of headlights.
</P>
<P>
   It only takes 0.3 of a degree in temperature for the Night
Vision system to respond by offering gradients in the images it
produces. This is why the image _ though much like your old black
and white TV in negative _ is so detailed.
</P>
<P>
   Night Vision can tell that there is more activity at the tip of
a tree's branches; that sunlight has been stored as energy in a
concrete pillar and is now bleeding away as heat in the night; that
a crippled car is located dangerously on the edge of the shoulder
dead ahead; that a moose has wandered into the road; that a child
has run from her yard chasing a pet.
</P>
<P>
   It can show you all this, show you before your headlights reveal
the danger, show you while you still have time to react.
</P>
<P>
   Still rare and still expensive, Night Vision is not within reach
of everyone. But once upon a time, neither were air bags.

EXPLORING MIT BY NIGHT, STEALTHILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Like shadows they scurry through the night,
dressed in black, armed with head-mounted flashlights,
walkie-talkies, ropes, pocketknives, lock-picking tools _ and their
student ID cards.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves ``hackers.'' But these Massachusetts
Institute of Technology students shouldn't be confused with those
who sabotage computers. They have a more lofty goal: to bypass
locked doors, slide through off-limits shafts and tunnels, and
explore the bowels of campus buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Most Saturday nights, groups of fewer than a dozen students seek
adventure by searching for anything from the fabled bricked-in
shower to the Tomb of the Unknown Ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like rock climbing or caving,'' said Jeremy Brown,
27, a computer science graduate student and veteran hacker. ``For
us, it's about interrogating the environment, and learning from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's another less appealing side of hacking: the danger.
Last November a student was seriously injured after falling through
a roof.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hundreds of hackers are reluctant to talk about
their underground pastime. They fear news reports will only push
college officials to clamp down. ``You see, the more detail we
give,'' Brown said, ``the more we're shooting ourselves in the
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, hacking is anything but a secret at MIT. If they haven't
done it themselves, almost any student on campus could name a
friend who has. In fact, during freshman orientation week every
year, upperclassmen take large groups to tour the innards of MIT's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But college officials insist that they don't turn a blind eye to
what is known as ``roof and tunnel hacking,'' a variation or
sometime precursor to another form of hacking: practical jokes. MIT
students are famous for inventive pranks that require engineering
finesse and are often done to coincide with April Fools' Day, such
as placing a replica of a campus police cruiser atop the school's
Great Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely don't encourage it,'' said Lawrence S. Bacow,
chancellor of MIT. ``We lock the roofs, we alarm doors, and we have
fined students when they're where they shouldn't be. It's certainly
not like we say, `Here's a roof; come climb on it.' Far from it.''
</P>
<P>
   With students routinely ignoring ``no entrance'' signs, groping
their way through unlit pipe rooms, boiler tunnels, and
high-voltage areas meant only for specially trained maintenance
crews, safety has long concerned administrators.
</P>
<P>
   But the culture of hacking recently has come under increased
scrutiny. About 3 a.m. on a Sunday morning in November, an
18-year-old woman plunged 96 feet down a chimney. The freshman from
Pennsylvania, whose name MIT won't release, is recovering from
major spinal cord injuries after falling off the roof of the Sloan
School of Management building.
</P>
<P>
   While administrators say the student's injury is the worst
hacking accident in memory, they know the college was very close to
having a fatality _ and they say they're doing everything in their
power to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One injury is one injury too many,'' Bacow said. ``We took
this very seriously. She could have died _ easily. She was lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with fines of up to $500 for trespassing, improved locks
and alarm systems, and constant admonishing by administrators, MIT
hackers are not daunted. If anything, they say, they see the
obstacles as a challenge to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of hacking is about creativity, finding a way around a
locked door or something,'' said a 22-year-old senior majoring in
biology, who used to hack and asked that she not be identified.
``Hackers are generally students who question authority and don't
pay attention to rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet hackers insist they consider safety paramount. Before taking
out novices, usually recently recruited freshmen, they pass out
laminated yellow cards titled, ``Hacking Ethics.'' The cards are
also used as a way to open doors.
</P>
<P>
   The pithy precepts include: ``Don't drink and hack;'' ``Don't
hack alone;'' ``Leave no permanent damage;'' ``Be subtle _ leave no
evidence that you were there;'' and contrarily, ``Don't steal
anything, but if you must borrow something, remember to return it _
perhaps leave a note saying when it will be returned.''
</P>
<P>
   But risks rise when hackers obey their 11th Commandment: Don't
Get Caught. According to ``A Brief Guide to Hacking,'' part of a
pamphlet published by MIT's Technology Communication Association
and circulated to incoming freshmen, hackers ``shalt honor (the
commandment) and keep it wholly.''
</P>
<P>
   After detailing specific evasion tactics _ such as, ``always
have two ways to run,'' or when fleeing, ``change floors often'' _
the guide offers up these alibis if caught: ``Is this the way to
Baker House?'' or ``Where's the nearest bathroom?''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, however, do students get caught in such a bind.
According to MIT campus police, fewer than a dozen students a year
are cited for hacking. Yet on any given night, as many hackers may
be trolling through the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences
building or the domes towering above the Infinite Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult thing to prevent,'' said Anne Glavin, chief
of MIT's police force. ``First, this subculture is made up of
secret associations, and they're not exactly inviting us in as
guest speakers. The other thing is these are some of the brightest
students. Staying ahead of them is a challenge. I mean, they are
the ones who are going to be building the security systems in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of students scoping steam tunnels or climbing
through air ducts for fun reveals the peculiar environment of
grouping some of the nation's smartest science-oriented students,
administrators and alumni say.
</P>
<P>
   At the elite institution, where many of the students grow up
taking pleasure more from solving a quadratic equation than in
things like watching Sunday football, students often are eager to
craft their own brand of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a dollop of curiosity and a bent toward ingenuity and
you come up with students interested in hacking, according to Jeff
Bigler, the former president of MIT Spelunkers club and now an
alumnus who helps chronicle hackers' practical jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, what it comes down to is it's a way to hang out, and
beats drinking beer and bad music,'' Bigler said. ``It's just
exploring, hanging out together and having fun. It's like an outing
club.''

IN `WEST WING'S' SHADOW, `D.C.' IS AN ALSO-RAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blame it on ``The West Wing.'' If Aaron Sorkin's crackling-good
series about a chatty, natty, fratty White House staff hadn't come
along this season, maybe ``D.C.'' wouldn't seem like the Foggy
Bottom Follies.
</P>
<P>
   ``D.C.,'' a Fox-style soaper, isn't even of the same genre as an
ensemble drama like ``The West Wing,'' but Sorkin's take on
capital-ism has set the Beltway bar impossibly high. ``D.C.,'' a
creation of ``Law &AMP; Order'' producer Dick Wolf, will need special
enabling legislation and maybe a high-court ruling to reach it.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's premiere on The WB introduces us first to Mason
Scott, a low-level congressional staffer who tells us via voiceover
that Washington really runs on the spunk of its young people.
``We're the only ones with enough energy to write the laws, run the
committees, party till 3 and then do it all again the next day,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's best friend and roommate is Pete Komisky, a lobbyist for
an obscure nonprofit group that champions the rights of all the
``loser animals'' not claimed by the higher-profile organizations.
Pete (middle-class cynic from Arizona State) and Mason (wealthy
idealist from Harvard) are opposites who obviously need each other
to maintain balance in their symbiotic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Before too long, Mason's free-spirited sister, Finley, shows up
on their doorstep, an escapee from grad school. Though
job-o-phobic, she manages to score them a housesitting deal in a
Georgetown brownstone they'd never be able to afford without
federal aid. To make this a democratic party of five, they take on
a couple more housemates _ Sarah, a junior field producer for a
cable news network, and Sarah's boyfriend, Lewis, a clerk at the
Supreme Court _ and, during one scene in a subsequent episode, they
actually conduct a parliamentary procedure to govern food purchases
for the house.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it. The five basic food groups in the
dog-eat-dog world of Washington, D.C.: legislative branch,
influence-peddling branch, do-nothing branch (a metaphor,
perhaps?), meddlesome-media branch and judicial branch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a potentially rich mix, but a coldly clinical aura pervades
``D.C.,'' maybe because being that close to the citadel of power
turns people into unemotional automatons. Or maybe doing ``Law &AMP;
Order'' for so many years has caused Dick Wolf to forget about
warm-and-fuzzy characters.
</P>
<P>
   The warmest is Mason, played with youthful earnestness by
Gabriel Olds, but even he could stand to take a space heater to
bed. Mark-Paul Gosselaar, as Pete, is the inscrutable pragmatist
who takes a different woman to bed each week. But there's plenty of
that inscrutability to go around. Sarah (Kristanna Loken) and Lewis
(Daniel Sunjata) are a pair of sphinxes, and for all her carefree
joie de vivre, Finley (Jacinda Barrett) is, at best, lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its WB stylishness, ``D.C.'' makes an hour seem like
two, as we watch a group of fabulously attractive people _ this is
The WB, after all _ come to terms with new responsibilities in a
politically charged atmosphere. If it were ``The West Wing,''
they'd be so interesting we'd want to move in with them. But, at
the end of Sunday's episode, when Mason says, ``Our entire lives
are ahead of us, and Washington is where we should be, whatever may
come,'' the overwhelming urge is to exercise one's veto power.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. One-hour drama series about five young adults living and
working in the nation's capital. Starring Gabriel Olds, Mark-Paul
Gosselaar, Jacinda Barrett, Kristanna Loken and Daniel Sunjata.
Series premiere Sunday at 8 p.m., The WB. Parental guideline
rating: TV-PG.

THE SELLING OF THE CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Publisher's Clearinghouse promotes its sweepstakes as a way to
win lots of free money. The federal government promotes the US
Census in exactly the same way.
</P>
<P>
   --``When you don't fill out Census 2000,'' read the full-page
ads taken out by the Census Bureau, ``your community could miss out
on its fair share of billions of dollars in federal funds.''
</P>
<P>
   --``An accurate census is important,'' says the postcard mailed
by the Census Bureau to every home that received a census form,
``to ensure that all communities get their fair share of government
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   --``We use the census,'' the Census Bureau's director, Kenneth
Prewitt, tells a talk-show host on NPR, ``in order to take tax
dollars and bring them back to the communities in the way of Head
Start programs, transportation programs, health programs, veterans'
programs, housing subsidies. . . . You actually bring money back to
the community using the census data.''
</P>
<P>
   In op-ed columns, on its Web site, through its publicists, the
Census Bureau hammers home one message: Cooperate with the census
so you can get more money. You'd never guess from this naked appeal
to greed that according to the Constitution _ Article I, Section 2
_ the only proper use of census data is the apportionment of seats
in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in the letter that accompanied each census
questionnaire, Prewitt did acknowledge, briefly, that the census is
used to calculate ``the number of representatives each state has in
Congress.'' But then he got down to business:
</P>
<P>
   ``The second reason may be more important to you and your
community (my italics). The amount of government money your
neighborhood receives depends on your answers. That money gets used
for schools, employment services, housing assistance, roads,
services for children and the elderly, and many other local
needs.'' In short, Joe and Jane Citizen, don't fill out the census
in order to be properly represented or to satisfy the Constitution.
Fill it out because it can mean cash in your pockets. This is a far
cry from ``Ask not what your country can do for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the census have focused on the intrusiveness of the
questions, especially the ones on the long form sent to one
household in six. ``Does this person speak a language other than
English at home?'' ``Where did this person live 5 years ago?''
``What time did this person usually leave home to go to work last
week?'' ``What was this person's total income in 1999?''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is curious about so many things: Whether you have
trouble dressing or bathing. The year your house was built. Whether
you have flush toilets and indoor plumbing. The size of your
electric bill. But what gives it the right to ask such questions?
The Constitution says we must agree to be counted. Where does it
say, or even imply, that we must tell a federal employee the amount
of our monthly rent or mortgage payment?
</P>
<P>
   We ask these questions, the Census Bureau explains, because a
myriad of federal programs rely on the answers. But that begs the
question. If Washington has no constitutional authority to ask the
questions, it presumably had no authority to create the programs to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   That is an argument about federalism _ something most Americans
never think about. How many of them know that the Bill of Rights
restricts the federal government to just those powers delegated by
the Constitution? Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, but we
have not been very vigilant about keeping the government in its
place. We have forgotten that we have the right to say to
Washington: None of your business.
</P>
<P>
   Soothingly, census officials promise that none of the personal
information you supply will be shared with anyone else. ``Before
anyone inside the Census Bureau sees your completed
questionnaire,'' an essay on the bureau's Web site declares, ``they
must first be sworn to secrecy.'' Why, not even the president
himself has access to private census data. ``There are three
certainties in life _ death, taxes, and the continuation of the
Census Bureau's proud tradition of keeping information it collects
about individuals strictly private.''
</P>
<P>
   But that ``proud tradition'' has had ugly lapses. The New York
Times reported on March 17 that ``the Census Bureau was deeply
involved in the roundup and internment of Japanese-Americans
(during) World War II.'' All disclosures to the government are
subject to abuse. In recent years, hundreds of IRS agents have been
caught pawing through the tax returns of celebrities and
acquaintances. Hackers have crashed the Social Security Web site
and rifled private financial records. Some 900 FBI files on leading
Republicans ended up in the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the Census Bureau doesn't want you to think about such
things. It wants you think instead about how much money the
government will toss your way if you'll only answer a lot of nosy
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the census as an invitation to pig out at the federal
trough is cheap and unworthy. It isn't even honest. The free money
that Washington dangles as bait isn't free at all; it came out of
our own pockets in the first place. Say what you like about
Publisher's Clearinghouse, at least it gives away its own money.

KICKING UP A FUSS ABOUT CUSSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Cuss Control,'' James V. O'Connor writes that at the rate
we're going, swearing will soon be so common that it will be about
as much fun as a nudist camp.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem an odd analogy, especially if you've never been to
a nudist camp, but speaking as one who has, it's appropriate. Like
institutionalized nudity, swearing is losing its mystery, its power
to shock. Cursing is so ubiquitous that it's boring. And that's a
shame, because cursing has its uses.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is a self-appointed bad-language watchdog who founded
the Cuss Control Academy as a division of his public relations firm
in 1998. It was a strange time. Viagra had gripped the national
imagination, the male half of it at least. And most of us were avid
to know exactly what went on between Bill and Monica in the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor weighed these developments and issued a press release
predicting certain saucy words previously unspoken in public were
about to be heard everywhere. He was on top of a cultural wave that
would carry him all the way to ``Oprah!'' to talk about the
deterioration of language, the growing crassness of society, and
the notion that the world in general is going to heck because so
many of us can't stop talking like the cast of ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cuss Control,'' a Three Rivers Press paperback that will be
in bookstores next week, O'Connor explores the linguistic and
cultural history of swearing, but it's essentially a self-help
book, subtitled ``The Complete Book on How to Curb Your Cursing.''
Notice that O'Connor uses the word ``curb'' rather than
``eliminate'' or ``cut out.'' Although he thinks that an excess of
swearing has lowered the level of our national discourse, he
believes there's a place for the occasional curse. He quotes Mark
Twain: ``In certain trying circumstances, urgent circumstances,
desperate circumstances, profanity furnishes a relief denied even
in prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Sometimes nothing but a curse will do. Once, in a quiet
bookstore, I was stunned to hear a refined-looking elderly woman
utter a ringing ``Oh, (expletive)!'' I don't know what her problem
was, but I assume it was something trying or urgent or desperate,
perhaps all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor separates cursing into two types, casual and causal.
</P>
<P>
   Casual cursing is bad language we use for a variety of reasons,
for fun, because we're linguistically lazy, because we want to
exercise our First Amendment right to be rude, because we want to
be one of the boys (or one of the girls), because we want to annoy
our parents.
</P>
<P>
   Causal profanity is triggered by emotion and thus more difficult
to curb than the casual kind. Causal cursing springs from anger,
frustration, anxiety, rage. O'Connor warns it can be dangerous and
destructive, especially to the habitual curser. All may be true,
but there are times when it feels so good to vent. It's practically
impossible to drive a car around Boston and not curse. I'd like to
see O'Connor try.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cuss Control,'' he has numerous suggestions for curbing
cursing, among them think clean, think positively, practice
patience, drive like an angel, make up ``curse'' words (``That's a
bunch of Bolshevik!''), befriend clerics (``You are not going to
cuss when you spend time with the religious leaders of your church
or temple''). Basically, though, his advice boils down to two
elements: eternal vigilance and a total attitude adjustment. Can we
curb cursing in our time? With Oprah's help and a national book
tour, anything is possible.

   WONDERLAND &QL; 
Starring: Ted Levine, Martin Donovan, Michelle Forbes, Michael Jai
White, Billy Burke, Joelle Carter &QL; 
On: ABC, Thursday night &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those ready to call ``time of death'' for the hospital drama may
want to hold off for a week or two. While ``Chicago Hope'' and
``ER'' have slid into creative comas, and ``City of Angels'' has
failed to thrive, the MDTV genre is about to rally with a
</P>
<P>
   messy, compelling, and ambitious new series called
``Wonderland.'' Riskily slotted by ABC opposite ``ER,'' that
Nielsen-topping jewel in the crown of NBC's must-see lineup,
``Wonderland'' is actually interesting and memorable enough to pose
a ratings threat to that ever-expanding ensemble of
intubation-happy Chicagoans.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, ``Wonderland'' is produced, written, and
everything-elsed by Peter Berg, the actor who played Kronk on
``Chicago Hope'' for four years and then wrote and directed a bad
movie called ``Very Bad Things.'' Who knew he was capable of such
an intriguing TV concept, taking the frenzy of ``ER'' and dropping
it into the intense ambiguities of our mental-health system? The
chaotic action is set in the psychiatric department of a fictional
New York City institution called Rivervue Hospital. Instead of
groaning, bleeding patients on gurneys, ``Wonderland'' gives us
people with profound emotional injuries and chemical disorders _
raving street people, a warring elderly couple, a suicidal
executive. The complex nature of their problems, including
competency to stand trial, senility, and missed medication, gives
Berg an opportunity to avoid the black-and-white resolutions and
the sentimentality with which TV is most familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The unstable people in ``Wonderland'' tend to be extreme cases,
a fact that has already triggered criticism from advocates for the
mentally challenged. Such is the nature of TV drama, which distills
and heightens, and such is the nature of psychiatric emergency
rooms. If Berg can keep his patients from lapsing into
cartoonishness and cliche, they have the potential to fascinate,
like Wendall Rickle, played with intensity by Leland Orser. We hear
his internal voice reciting the ABCs of insanity, we know he is
receiving imagined messages about Zeus, and we then see him wander
into Times Square and shoot five people. Not a positive portrayal,
but certainly a dramatic one.
</P>
<P>
   The show's strongest element, though, is its regular ensemble of
doctors and residents. Amid the madness and mania of their jobs at
Rivervue, these characters are sane and confident; but in their
personal lives, they, too, live close to the edges of sanity. The
central figure is Ted Levine's Dr. Robert Banger, a caring advocate
for the mentally ill who has an unnervingly calm exterior. He's in
the middle of a tense divorce proceeding, and the opening show's
best scenes find his young sons testing his patience during a
custody review he knows he won't win. Levine, best remembered as
the eerie ``Silence of the Lambs'' killer, does incredibly subtle
work here. He delivers the show's powerful thesis, as he describes
treating ``the shadow people'' who ``remind us just how tenuous
mental health is. . . . They remind us how easy it can be to
slip.''
</P>
<P>
   Also along for this trip through the looking glass: ``Homicide''
alum Michelle Forbes plays Dr. Lyla Garrity, who finds herself at
the center of a controversy when she fails to admit a man who later
goes on a shooting spree. She's pregnant and married to Martin
Donovan's Dr. Neil Harrison, a gentle healer who finds himself
sitting on a keg of rage. Donovan has graced many independent
films, notably ``The Opposite of Sex,'' and he's a TV hero waiting
to happen. Billy Burke manages to make his Dr. Abe Matthews more
than a stereotypical commitment-phobic womanizer, and Michael Jai
White is promising _ if underdeveloped _ as a tough-minded
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' is helped by an intentionally disheveled visual
style that at times mimics disorientation. Like ``Homicide'' and
``NYPD Blue,'' it has an artful documentary flavor, and the opening
cleverly gives us a Rorschach test. The show also takes its titular
looking-glass reference seriously, as the shots are frequently
directed through glass, either in the maze of windowed offices in
the hospital or through restaurant and cafe fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Berg may be a little too eager to hook viewers from the start.
The premiere episode is overly dense with incident and exposition,
as everything short of Armageddon occurs in less than an hour. The
Forbes-Donovan plotline is the most overwrought. By next week,
though, ``Wonderland'' finds an engaging and evenly paced focus, as
it settles into the aftermath of Rickle's violence.
</P>
<P>
   Will ``Wonderland'' survive its time slot? ABC honchos seem to
think that with ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' as a lead-in, and
with ``ER'' in a mediocre season, it stands a chance. Let's hope
they're right.

TILES ON STAIRWAY ARE NOT PRACTICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The vinyl tiles on my concrete basement floor are intact and
in good shape, but the tiles on the steps are breaking up. How can
I remove them and put new ones on?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA SIDLEY, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, you must determine whether the tiles are vinyl or
vinyl-asbestos. If they are vinyl-asbestos and contain a certain
level of the carcinogen, they must be removed professionally, at
considerable cost. But since there are not a lot of tiles on the
steps, this chore may not be prohibitively expensive. If they are
100 percent vinyl, scrape them up and throw them away. To determine
if they contain any asbestos, break off a small piece, place it in
a plastic envelope, and take it to an asbestos abatement company.
Such companies are found in the Yellow Pages under, of all things,
Asbestos abatement.
</P>
<P>
   Vinyl-asbestos tiles on the floor can be left intact; they are
safe as long as they are not sawn, sanded, or abraded in any way.
They can be covered with indoor-outdoor carpeting or other tiles.
</P>
<P>
   You can retile the steps, but tiles on a stairway are not
practical, because their edges will be exposed at the sides and
nosing of the treads, and exposed edges tend to chip.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of new tiles on the treads, consider a stair carpet;
this will be easy to install on a straight run, but difficult if
the staircase turns a corner with wedge-shaped treads.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My attic has a ridge vent and 3-inch-wide soffit vents going
the full length of all soffits. But for years, mold has been
creeping up the roof boards between rafters. It is mostly on the
north side, but some is on the south side, as well. I think I have
done everything right, and it stumps me. Could I put in a power
vent on one gable end?
</P>
<P>
   JIM SHERIDAN, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It stumps me, too, on the face of it. Make sure the clothes
dryer does not vent into the attic; if it does, it is expelling
moist air, which condenses on the roof boards, resulting in mold.
The cause could also be a furnace in the attic. (Yes, that happens,
and can make attics too warm, causing ice dams, leaks, and
consequent growth of mold.)
</P>
<P>
   A final thing to check: If you have folding stairs, or even a
large trapdoor, to the attic, poor insulation could be allowing
moist house air into the attic, causing mold. You can put an
insulated box on top of the stair opening or over the trapdoor.
</P>
<P>
   This might help: Those 3-inch soffit vents are louvered, and may
be blocking more airflow than they should. I suggest removing the
vents and installing insect screen over the openings, then nailing
an edging along each side of the openings that will cover the
screen edges and give a finished look. But even this increased
airflow is not going to do much good if any of the conditions
mentioned above exist.
</P>
<P>
   A last resort is to install a large power fan in one gable end
to pull out the moist air. I would avoid this if at all possible;
it is another power source, and expensive to operate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am buying a house with Formica counter tops. Can I put
ceramic tile over Formica?
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT MAHER, South Grafton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You could but I wouldn't, because the plastic laminate is too
hard and too smooth, even when heavily sanded, to hold an adhesive
or thin-set mortar. Besides, if you put edge tiles along the
counter edges (maybe 1 1/4 to 2 inches wide), there is not enough
gluing surface to be effective, especially on plastic laminate.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest removing the laminate with heat, using a flat iron;
this will soften the contact cement and make it easy to pull up.
Then you can put down the tile with thin-set mortar or adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My deck looks really good, actually it looks like varnished
wood, and the ivory-painted railings match the house. Only one
thing is wrong. The pressure-treated latticework is not painted or
stained. I would like to make it ivory. Is that possible?
</P>
<P>
   URSULA DILLON, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it is possible, and there are two ways to do it: 1.
Paint it with an exterior primer (latex or oil) and one or two
coats of a latex house paint. 2. Apply two coats of a latex solid
stain. The latter is better and will resist peeling, but both will
have to be repeated sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   But why not let the lattice weather? It will end up as a
relatively attractive gray color. The handyman has pressure-treated
lattice on one of his fences, and he would not dream of painting
it; another darned maintenance chore.
</P>
<P>
   One more possibility: Substitute the pressure-treated lattice
with vinyl lattice. That is one good use for vinyl. You can get
white, not ivory, but that might be OK.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just bought a large cedar bird feeder. Should I finish it
or not?
</P>
<P>
   ERNIE DENTALI, Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No, do not finish it for several reasons. Any color could be
a deterrent to some birds. A finish would require redoing
occasionally, making another maintenance chore. No finish is
necessary; let the cedar weather, and it will last indefinitely.
</P>

THE SUBTLE SHADES OF ROMANCE

   EQUAL LOVE &QL; 
By Peter Ho Davies &QL; 
Mariner Books, 178 pp, $12 (paperback) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rarely pure, rarely absent altogether, love is a many-splintered
thing. In ``Equal Love,'' author Peter Ho Davies explores its sharp
edges with a caring, seldom-erring sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   His is not the storybook sort of love happily ever after. The
characters in his 12 stories suffer and stumble, equivocate and
manipulate. And yet, they love.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more acute than in the story of junkie love
called ``Everything You Can Remember in Thirty Seconds Is Yours to
Keep.'' The narrator left home at 16, when her mother forced her to
choose between drugs and family, and drugs was the runaway winner.
When she gets pregnant in Oregon almost a decade later, she kicks
the drugs but not the habit: ``I'd been high on Luke while I was
pregnant, but coming home all sore to our apartment . . . was a
downer.'' Almost immediately she's back in the haze, and soon her
son is a ward of the court. She's given six months to shape up, and
to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't spoken with her mother since the day she left, but
now she needs Moms again _ not as a mother but as a prop, to fool
the court into seeing a happy home. She drives to Phoenix to
collect her; Moms doesn't seem quite right, but that just makes the
con go easier. At the end of the six months, the scheme has worked,
and the social worker is willing to recommend that Luke be allowed
to come home.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch: The social worker says it's clear to her
that Moms has Alzheimer's, and would be a threat to Luke's
well-being. Just like that, Moms is taken back to Phoenix, needed
no longer. Those are Davies's facts: Luke is the new heroin, and
his mother will do whatever it takes to keep her supply line open.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as he crafts it, it's a sweet, sympathetic tale. Sure,
Moms started out as a prop, but they do reconnect. When Moms has an
episode of incontinence, her daughter's help comes with tenderness.
They look after each other. When they part, there's the hint of
happiness in Moms's return to familiar surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Davies adds to the appeal of his story with a subtle touch for
the language: When Luke poops, she gets out ``the baby works,'' a
mirror of her heroin days, when her ``works'' were needle, syringe,
and spoon. And there is the comparison of mother and daughter,
mother and son, with the narrator lovingly cleaning up the messes
of two generations.
</P>
<P>
   Davies employs that role reversal, of children becoming the
caretakers of their parents, in several of his stories. In another,
a crotchety dad reluctantly lets his son drive him to see his own
mother, who's 88 and addled, confined to a long-term-care hospital.
The grandson hasn't come in three years, but his father drives the
30 miles once or twice a week. The grandson doesn't like it there,
particularly when his father starts talking in baby talk: ``I wish
he wouldn't treat her like a child.'' When her mind went soft, the
grandmother had lived with them for a while, but her son feared she
might ``burn the house down, get hit by a car. (`All the things I
used to worry about happening to you when you were a youngster,' he
told me once.)''
</P>
<P>
   Marital infidelity also recurs as a theme. In one case, it's an
expectant father, 3,000 miles from home, consummating his first
love after years away. In another, it's only infidelity
spiritually, rather than in deed. And in a third, the facts are
even hazier: An encyclopedia salesman would rather be at work than
at home with his wife and son, for reasons never entirely clear.
Eventually, his wife takes the 6-year-old and leaves him. He
remains the good provider for the boy, but can never answer the
wife's question: What went wrong? Eventually, he even invents a
mistress, but only because it's easier than explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Davies revels in such ambiguities; they are simply part of his
landscapes. Thankfully, there's little ambiguity in how he
expresses them. His stories share a wonderful sense of place, and a
wonderful subtlety in how he imparts it: quickly, often in no more
than a phrase or two. In the salesman's story, for example, he has
established it by the third sentence: ``Mrs. Kidner, her name was.
Got on very well, we did, too.'' Clearly, we're in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Britain, Davies sets his stories principally in
Boston and on the West Coast, sometimes in combinations thereof.
One gets a palpable sense that these are the places Davies has
lived, and that some of his stories are rooted deeply in his own
experiences. That notion is reinforced by the short back-cover
biography, but it originates in the keen quality of authenticity he
delivers throughout.

A CENTURY OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Landscape architecture can be a lot of different things. It can
be a 23-acre plaza like the one George Hargreaves designed for this
summer's Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Or it can be old shoes
running up the columns of the Harvard Design School's Gund Hall,
like the installation Cambridge, Mass., schoolchildren are working
on with Detroit street artist Tyree Guyton to celebrate the
centennial of the nation's first department of landscape
architecture at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, landscape architecture started in the Boston
area. An evolving field that combines architecture, urban planning,
pollution control, ecology, sociology, and horticulture, it was
invented by the great park builder Frederick Law Olmsted, who
created a new scale (huge) and a new style (naturalistic) for
public urban spaces with the Emerald Necklace and Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 100 years ago, his son and business partner, Frederick
Law Olmsted Jr., designed and launched the first professional
course in landscape architecture at Harvard with Arthur A.
Shurcliff.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard celebration _ ``100 Years of Landscape Architecture
at Harvard'' _ includes two concurrent exhibits opening Monday in
Gund Hall and running through the end of the month: ``Our
Heritage,'' looking backward, and ``Imagining Futures,'' looking
forward. Two days of seminars open to the public will be similarly
divided: looking back at the last 100 years, April 7; and looking
ahead, April 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look into education and research, what's coming, where
the gaps are in what we should be doing on, for instance, in
sustainable landscapes, or how you design with a flood zone,'' says
George Hargreaves, a 1979 graduate of Harvard's landscape
architecture program and for the last four years its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The many notable conference participants are scheduled to
include Garrett Eckbo and Daniel Kiley, who were flunked in the
late 1930s for insisting on Walter Gropius-inspired modernism in
the face of a conservative landscape faculty dedicated to the Beaux
Arts style. ``Modernism was a revolution that began with the
students,'' says Hargreaves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, under the leadership of Hideo Sasaki, who will be
presented with the Centennial Medal next Thursday, Harvard
emphasized large-scale planning and offered classes taught by
leading practicing landscape architects who also trained students
in their firms as interns, especially at Sasaki Associates of
Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   The practice continues today with Sasaki Associates, and newer
Cambridge landscape architecture firms such as those of Carol R.
Johnson, Douglas P. Reed, Michael Van Valkenberg, Martha Schwartz,
and George Hargreaves, all reinforcing the area's position as an
international center for this kind of work. In recent years,
environmental scientists have been added to the faculty as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most significant landscape architecture school in
the country,'' says Hargreaves. ``The jobs in this field are
expanding, and the other schools produce landscape architects to
fill those jobs. We produce leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Though weary from a night flight from the San Francisco office
of his firm during a recent interview in his corner office of glass
walls perched over Cambridge Street, Hargreaves is imposing,
quietly intense, and handsome, in that fit California way, with
curly hair, chin stubble, and eyes of silver-blue echoed by the hue
of his crisp linen shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The summer he was 18, Hargreaves discovered his deep affinity
for natural landscapes while hiking in the Rockies with friends.
The Atlanta native enjoyed the mentorship of celebrated Berkeley,
Calif., minimalist Peter Walker (also a Harvard alum) and developed
from wunderkind into a force in the field with his original but
environmentally sensitive landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   In the forefront
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old chairman says that Harvard's landscape
architecture department, widely regarded as the best of about 50
such degree programs in the country, is in the forefront on
reclaiming abandoned industrial landscapes, including waterfronts;
countering sprawl; developing regional planning and sustainable
landscapes; and in green technologies such as toxic remediation and
water filtration, though he would like to see more research done in
this area.
</P>
<P>
   Hargreaves, who maintains homes in both Cambridge and San
Francisco (``the two ghettos of landscape architects''), admits to
being in a bit of ``post-project depression'' after completing work
on the Olympics in Sydney, which he considers one of his
masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of job that would traditionally have gone to an
architect rather than a landscape architect, but Hargreaves was
called in to produce a comprehensive plan after lack of
communication between architects of individual parcels produced an
unaccounted-for 5-foot change of grade in the middle of the Olympic
Village.
</P>
<P>
   Hargreaves's master plan unified the buildings by various
architects, including three stadiums, around a central plaza of
celebratory fountains that forms Australia's largest public space.
</P>
<P>
   Built on a defunct and contaminated slaughter yard, the project
illustrates two major themes that Hargreaves is promoting at
Harvard: reclamation of former industrial sites and employment of
ecological solutions for pollution. The Olympic fountains actually
purify water from a nearby polluted stream, as do buffer strips of
toxin-filtering plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a global rather than a regional view of landscape
architecture,'' says Hargreaves, and a quarter of the school's
students come from abroad. Harvard has students working on
landscape projects in Hong Kong, and starting next fall will have
some in China. Hargreaves is working on one class that is
redesigning access to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon at the
invitation of the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig landscaping
</P>
<P>
   But why, if this is such a landscape mecca, is nobody here
designing solutions to that other big hole in the ground, Boston's
Big Dig?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Dig is still looking for an idea of a landscape. It's
somewhat ingenuous to me that we've spent $12 billion so far trying
to get it underground, but no one's sure what it's going to be,
except that it's going to be green,'' says Hargreaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be where you'd start, with an idea and funds for
what you're going to do when it's all done. . . . Sometimes they do
it right, like in Sydney, where they had $40 million for the
infrastructure but they had another $40 million for the landscaping
out of a total of $1 billion for the whole job _ less than 10
percent of the Big Dig.''
</P>
<P>
   What Hargreaves would like to see on the Central Artery surface
is ``a rich mosaic, some parts of it developed with buildings that
knit the city back together where it's appropriate, and in other
places, green spaces that are rich in color and texture, with
features you can enter into: gardens, people spaces. I don't want
to see them just roll out some grass and say, `There we go.' A lot
of thought has to be put into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven or eight years ago Harvard's planning and design
department did a studio _ a brainstorming and design project with
students _ on the Big Dig. ``I'm beginning to ask myself why aren't
we returning to that problem, and we very well might. Funding is
not the problem. It would be more beneficial to have the city or
the state involved in it, so it won't just be 10 students saying
`Do this.' We need some political sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargreaves is already involved with a small, partly pro bono
project to convert land along Chelsea Creek in East Boston into an
``urban wild.''

DELL'S NEW LAPTOPS IMPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Dell's Latitude laptops were the gold standard for
many businesses with employees on the go. The company's new
Inspiron line of mobile computers carries on this proud tradition,
with many enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   These computers have screens so large and keyboards so good that
a growing number of businesses are purchasing Dell Inspiron 3800
laptops as desktop replacements. Although I think this is a
mistake, it's easy to see why a company might be lulled into such a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Inspiron 3800 is an impressive machine. It can be purchased
with a huge 14.1-inch liquid crystal display that has a larger
visible area than many 15-inch video tubes. Unlike other laptop
vendors, which force users to choose between a track pad and an
eraser-like pointer-stick device, the Inspiron 3800 comes with
both. It has stereo speakers built into its base, a built-in modem,
and the full complement of ports.
</P>
<P>
   There are two bays underneath the keyboard. The one on the right
can hold a battery. The one on the left can hold a battery, a
CD-ROM drive, or a DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you need to shut the machine down if you want to
swap the floppy for the CD-ROM. You can also put a blank piece of
plastic into the right-hand bay, which lightens the load on the
system somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with many new laptops, the new Dell battery has a
built-in meter: Just push a white button on the side, and five LEDs
indicate the charge. You must remove the battery from the unit to
use the meter, though.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has also caught iMac fever: Its 3800 series comes in four
colors, midnight gray, Tahoe blue, forest green, and Sierra maroon.
The case is textured with a denim-style print, which makes it
easier to hold and hides fingerprints. Unlike some other laptops,
the screen folds flat to the table, which in some circumstances can
prevent it from breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, one of the most difficult things a laptop
does during day-to-day operations is suspend and resume. Some
laptops do it well. Others never seem to wake up properly. Here,
the 3800 has an uneven history. Speaking with friends whose
companies have adopted the machines, I have learned that some 3800s
have no problem waking up, while others seem to crash frequently.
This may be the result of software that's been added, or it may be
the result of manufacturing problems and minor hardware and
software differences between machines.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's reputation for service is good, but not terrific. The
company prefers to do tech support through its Web site, which is
great as long as you have a working computer. In the past two
years, several friends have had Dell equipment speedily replaced if
it broke down within the company's three-year warranty period.
</P>
<P>
   But one co-worker repeatedly had his tech-support queries lost,
because somebody at Dell mistyped his name. Dell made amends by
replacing his laptop's motherboard free of charge, even though the
warranty period had passed, but that might not have happened if I
hadn't intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Te 3800 is available in a wide range of configurations. The
slowest processor is a 450 Mhz Celeron; the fastest is a 650 Mhz
Pentium III with Intel's new SpeedStep technology, which lets the
processor run faster when you are plugged into the wall, but slower
with batteries. The screen is either 12.1 or 14.1 inches (both in
the XGA resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels).
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $1,638 (small screen, slow processor, with
32MB of RAM) to $2,864 (fast processor, big screen, 96MB).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's just the beginning of Dell's laptop
configuration extravaganza. You can boost the system's memory to
512MB ($1,700), replace the 4.8GB hard drive with an 18GB drive
($449), swap the floppy with a 120MB superdisk drive ($139), and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite option is a second lithium ion battery ($99). Get
three, and you can forget about carrying around a charger.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other vendors, Dell will also sell you a second 18GB hard
drive ($598).
</P>
<P>
   These prices are all pretty good. Dell sells a high-performance
laptop for less than $500 above the price of a similarly configured
desktop system.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, too many companies are forsaking desktops and
giving their employees laptops to use at home, at work, and on the
road. The two problems with this strategy are ergonomics and
durability.
</P>
<P>
   Typing on a laptop keyboard (which has keys that don't move as
far as on a full-size keyboard) and looking down at a laptop screen
for eight hours a day is an invitation to eye strain, neck aches,
and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Dell is a strong computer, the fragile
connectors on its back and sides are not. If you constantly plug
and unplug cords and connectors, they will break.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is a simple solution: another Dell accessory,
of course. It's Dell's Home Base Bundle, which includes a port
replicator, a full-size keyboard, and a mouse. The port replicator
connects to the big docking connector on the back. You leave your
desktop gear connected to the replicator, and slide your laptop in
and out as you need it.

`PRICE OF GLORY' THROWS NO KNOCKOUT PUNCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Price of Glory'' is the sort of movie that inspires backhanded
compliments like ``cliched but effective.'' It's practically asking
for trouble when it combines two genres, the boxing drama and the
father-son conflict drama, that have near-rigid sets of rules. It's
almost impossible to bring anything new to the party, and aside
from focusing on a Latino family, ``Price of Glory'' doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie gets by, thanks to an appealing family, solid
performances and a rousing climax. Jimmy Smits, making his first
feature appearance since his mournfully glorified exit from ``NYPD
Blue,'' brings his prideful bearing to the role of Arturo Ortega, a
once-promising boxer who was shafted out of a career by an
unscrupulous manager. Arturo now lives through his three sons, all
of them Golden Gloves fighters with professional-championship
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Each, of course, wants to do things his own way. Oldest boy
Sonny (''Homicide: Life on the Street's'' Jon Seda) is the steady
one but wants control over his own career. Middle son Jimmy
(Clifton Collins Jr.) is the maverick, whose careless fighting
style masks a desperate need to earn his father's respect. Youngest
son Johnny (newcomer Ernesto Hernandez) is the bruiser, and the one
who comes closest to pleasing his father. And mother Rita (Maria
del Mar) tries to hold the family together, playing peacemaker
between intractable father and willful sons, all the while wishing
they'd pick up some safer sort of career.
</P>
<P>
   The story is pretty much what you'd expect: Good things happen,
bad things happen, people triumph over adversity and Dad learns to
reconcile his feelings for his sons. Ron Perlman shows up as a
shady promoter, sporting a New Yawk accent even though this is set
in southern Arizona, and comedian Paul Rodriguez appears as his
even shadier lieutenant, who inadvertently causes a tragedy that
almost permanently divides the Ortega family.
</P>
<P>
   So many boxing movies have cropped up recently that sitting
through them all can make you feel a little punch-drunk. But the
cast rescues ``Price of Glory'' from total mediocrity, especially
Collins, whose performance echoes the punky rebellion of much of
Sean Penn's early work, and Smits, whose four seasons on ``Blue''
must have taught him a lot about portraying angry heartache.
</P>
<P>
   But director Carlos Avila rarely succeeds in making sportswriter
Phil Berger's screenplay into anything more than a glorified TV
movie. In fact, it would make a good double feature with some
future boxing match on HBO.

BY FAITH, AND A LITTLE TINKERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hallelujah. It finally works.
</P>
<P>
   After much tinkering, I've set up the basics of a modern
computer network at my church. At the heart of it all is a gateway
to our high-speed DSL Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   We've had DSL for a couple of months now, and getting it was an
adventure in itself. Bell Atlantic is still a telephone company at
heart, and barely has a clue about delivering good DSL service.
It's not that they don't try; the folks I dealt with were
unfailingly polite.
</P>
<P>
   And I dealt with so many of them. There was one number to call
to order the DSL service, another number for actually setting up an
Internet account, and a third number to call when things went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Which they did. The original installation was scrubbed because
the DSL modem hadn't shown up. Bell Atlantic has the package sent
to the customer, and if it's not there when the installer arrives,
tough luck. We had to start the process all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we eventually got everything we needed. The installer _ a
clever lad who reads my column faithfully _ soon had everything up
and running. But only on one Windows computer.
</P>
<P>
   What about the others? We plan to hold Internet classes for the
members. Our pastor and his secretary want e-mail access. I'd love
to set up a machine in the lobby so visitors can visit our church
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The DSL connection provides Internet downloads at up to 640,000
bits per second. That's plenty for all our needs. The problem was
figuring out how to connect lots of computers to this one line.
It's a problem many of you will soon have. Computers are becoming
almost as popular as TV sets in American homes, and many of us are
starting to network them. Then you get home DSL or cable modem
service, and everybody wants a piece of the Internet. How do they
get it?
</P>
<P>
   I decided that our church needed a gateway _ a computer that
would be dedicated to linking our internal network to the Internet.
I had an old Pentium PC lying around that was well-suited to the
task. It already contained an Ethernet port for connecting to the
church network. I added a second Ethernet card for plugging in the
DSL line.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I'd have to get software that would route any Internet
requests from the networked computers to the gateway, then out to
the DSL line. I visited a local computer store to see what was
available.
</P>
<P>
   There are several products for connecting multiple Windows
computers to a single Internet access point _ Ositis Software
Inc.'s WinProxy, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But I was annoyed to discover that WinProxy's price varies
according to the number of computers you want to hook up. It was
$60 for a starter pack, and for that, I could connect just three
computers to the network. The unlimited version of the product
costs $700. Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. offers a cheap alternative. Their upgraded
version of Windows 98, called Second Edition, has a feature called
Internet Connection Sharing that's supposed to make for easy shared
access.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, I decided to dive off the deep end and use the
Linux operating system. Linux, after all, is free, powerful and
versatile. Simple, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic doesn't support DSL for Linux machines.
Fortunately, Roaring Penguin Software Inc.
(www.roaringpenguin.com), a Canadian Linux software firm, makes a
free DSL program. Unfortunately, they only provide the program's
raw ``source code.'' Before you can use it, you must use a program
called a compiler to transform it into machine language. I hadn't
installed the compiler on the computer when I'd installed Linux.
Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But I put it right. Soon I had the Linux box linked to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I took advantage of ``IP masquerading,'' another free
Linux feature that does the same thing as Internet Connection
Sharing. It took a lot of tinkering to make it all work properly.
But now the Linux box hums quietly away, shoveling data packets
back and forth across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And putting additional machines online is a simple matter of
plugging them into a network hub.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the pastor will have his e-mail, our kids and senior
citizens will have Internet training courses, and I'll be free to
spend less time in the computer room and more time in a pew.
Hallelujah.

 &HT;    CUBAN-AMERICANS WILL 'FOLLOW THE LAW,' RENO PREDICTS
 &HT;    With ELIAN.
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno expressed confidence
Thursday that Cuban-Americans in Miami would not obstruct
government efforts to repatriate Elian Gonzalez if that became
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they came to this country to incite violence,''
Reno said. ``I think they came to this country to be able to speak
their mind, to follow the law, to respect others, and to see that
those processes were carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Miami officials said Wednesday that local law enforcement
officers would not support actions taken by the Justice Department
with regard to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, speaking at her weekly meeting with reporters, said she
hoped federal and local law enforcement agencies would work
together to resolve the issue in an orderly fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in this great country, which is operated on
principles of federalism, the government in Miami will continue to
uphold the law and to work with other law enforcement to see that
the law is honored in the right way,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was a Florida prosecutor based in Miami for many years
before becoming U.S. attorney general in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the Justice Department is ready to enforce the law
regarding whether Elian must return to Cuba, but will proceed
cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   She said the federal government has had the right to take
custody of Elian Gonzalez since January, but has allowed his Miami
relatives to pursue legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relatives had their day in court and we gave them an
opportunity to file. A federal district judge in Miami heard the
case and affirmed our decision,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said it would be beneficial to allow Elian's father, Juan
Gonzalez, to come to the United States to speak for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always better when families work matters out between
themselves,'' Reno said. ``They do a much better job than
government.''

MORE THAN JUST A BABY BENZ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know of another make of automobile so uniformly
identifiable through its entire model line as Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   That's distinctive as in: Put me blindfolded into a C Class, S
Class, sedan, wagon, or roadster, take me for a spin, and I'll know
I'm in a Mercedes. There's just something so recognizably solid _
in sound, suspension, seating, straightforward surge _ that gives a
Benz away every time.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 C280, wedged into the class between the supercharged
C230 Kompressor and the thundering V8 C430, is no exception. And
what is remarkable is that, at less than $40,000, it's got a lot of
what you pay for in models at far higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a bit of a baby-Benz if you park it beside an S
Class sedan, but standing alone it appears, from the outside,
full-blown, unmistakable Mercedes. Add the front and side farings
that come with the sport model tested and it has a distinct
sport-sedan aura about it.
</P>
<P>
   Among standard features are a five-speed, electronically
controlled transmission (thankfully with a touch-shift option),
10-way electrically-adjustable front seats, power windows, reading
lamps, cruise control, and integrated garage-door opener. For
safety, there's an automatic-manual emergency-calling system (needs
to be activated with your phone company), dual front air bags,
front side airbags, antilock brakes, and a skid-control system.
</P>
<P>
   The sports package, which added $1,600 to the near-$36,000 base
price, included two-tone leather seats, a split fold-down rear
seat, glass sunroof, telephone, integrated CD changer, and embossed
stainless-steel door sills.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats are among the firmest, most supportive to
be found with wide seat areas that are very solid at the thighs.
The backs of the seats are virtually walled in by bulging lateral
supports. Put the car fast and stiff through a tight corner and the
seats simply grip you. Even the rear seats' outside positions
deliver this effect. The middle of the back seat is more of a hump
and would not be a good spot for a long trip.
</P>
<P>
   The gauge/control setup on the dash is classically functional.
Climate controls are large and easy to use. The audio portion is a
bit more confusing and the buttons somewhat smaller than is the
trend toward larger and simpler these days. And I found the
placement of the cruise-control and turn-signal levers _
side-by-each on the steering column _ annoying. It is too easy to
``resume speed'' when what you mean to do is signal a left-hand
turn.
</P>
<P>
   One option that I'd love to see in more sedans is the C280's
box-through between the rear seats for skis. Others offer it, but,
in the Mercedes, not only can you put your skis through this
rectangle that is hidden behind the fold-down rear armrest, you can
also keep the skis safe and dry with a long snap-bag.
</P>
<P>
   Storage for personal items is decent up front with a deep center
console area and bins in the doors. Rear passengers, however, are
at loss for any place to put magazines or personal items. No bins,
no back-of-the-front-seat pouches. They do get an emergency medical
kit built into the rear window ledge, however.
</P>
<P>
   The C280 is powered by a 2.8-liter, 18-valve, V6 aluminum
engine. Its best performance is revealed once you are up to speed,
passing traffic on the highway, as opposed to quick starts. Its
throaty rumble is distinctive and it delivered 20.3 miles per
gallon in widely mixed driving.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed automatic hung onto gears, both shifting up and
down, longer than I like and there were distinct transitions from
gear to gear. Switched to touch shift, however, it behaved very
well, clicking up and down instantly and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was smooth, solid and stable. It was stiff weaving in
and out of highway traffic, stiff on sharp corners, stiff straight
ahead into a winter wind, stiff even on frost heaves. Mercedes
stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes cut no corners in producing the suspension system that
results in this solid ride: Up front is a double wishbone setup
with upper and lower control arms, coil springs, gas-charged
shocks, stabilizer bar, and anti-dive, anti-lift technology.
</P>
<P>
   The rear has a five-link system with most of the above.
</P>

   Antilock disc brakes bring the Benz to quick, straight stops,
and an antiskid system called the Electronic Stability Program
helps keep it under control while rolling or braking.
</P>
<P>
   ESP works by braking individual wheels when it senses understeer
or oversteer. There's also a winter driving mode that cuts torque _
in effect preventing the driver from sending too much juice to the
wheels and setting them to spinning. This is a good thing in most
cases, though I found it a hindrance on a day when we had a couple
of inches of wet, slick snow. I could not get the C280 up a
moderate hill near my home and, once stopped, could not swing the
tail of the car around to get it facing back downhill so I could
descend and make another run.
</P>
<P>
   When I switched off winter mode, it did much better. Sometimes
extra juice is a good thing in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The graphite inserts in dash and doors. They tie the driver's
compartment together nicely.
</P>
<P>
   --The dual-level, covered console between the front seats. Roomy
below, telephone bin above.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The clip on the passenger's side seat-belt dangles at midseat
when not in use. This seems to be its assigned position. Problem
is, on a sunny day, it sends bursts of light darting about the
cabin.

ROD STEIGER: A CINEMATIC LION IN WINTER

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Rod Steiger as
he appears today and with Marlon Brando in a scene from the classic
film ``On the Waterfront.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It comes near the end of ``The Hurricane'' (1999), as Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter (Denzel Washington) finally gets his last shot
at justice in an open courtroom.
 &HT;    The judge takes the bench ... but something is different.
Normally, in this sort of earnest drama, the role of the judge goes
to a B-actor of a certain age or even to a real-life judge. After
all, it demands nothing more than a seat-filler performance.
 &HT;    But this one is different. Unexpectedly, this judge is a force
of nature, a guy you don't mess with, a man you can't bend. Why?
Because this time out, the man in the black robes is Rod Steiger.
 &HT;    His contemporaries are long gone _ Montgomery Clift, James Dean,
Richard Burton _ or have all but written themselves off, as with
Steiger's old co-star and sparring partner, Marlon Brando,
vegetating atop his Los Angeles mountain.
 &HT;    But Rod Steiger is still here. Boy, is he here. As he settles
into a booth in his favorite Italian restaurant in Malibu, Steiger
seems to fill the room. He's still a huge presence, still equipped
with a voice that can zoom from a sibilant whisper to a volcanic
roar in a nanosecond.
 &HT;    He's reached that age and station in life at which tributes
start to arrive. On April 14 he'll turn 75, and to mark the
occasion the cable channel Turner Classic Movies will devote
several nights in its ``Private Screenings'' series to a Steiger
film festival, along with a no-punches-pulled interview with the
actor himself.
 &HT;    The best of Steiger will be front and center beginning on April
11, with classics such as ``Capone'' (1959), ``Dr. Zhivago'' (1965)
and ``In The Heat of The Night'' (1967). On April 14 there's ``The
Harder They Fall'' (1956), ``Jubal'' (1956) and ``No Way to Treat A
Lady'' (1968). Alas, there will be no screenings of ``On the
Waterfront'' (1954), ``The Big Knife'' (1955) or ``The Pawnbroker''
(1965).
 &HT;    His head billiard-ball smooth, his muscular arms protruding from
his short-sleeved shirt and his white napkin tucked under his chin,
the actor looks like a retired truck driver devouring the house
pizza. Steiger was never the pretty one _ Brando, Clift, Dean and
Paul Newman, Steiger's Actor's Studio colleagues, started maidens'
hearts pounding. They were the ones who got most of the glory.
 &HT;    But no one did menace better, as Steiger proved even in his only
musical to date, ``Oklahoma'' (1953), as the looming, obstinate Jud
Fry.
 &HT;    ``I was the only actor ever who sang the part, played the part
and then did the ballet,'' he says. ``Others may have danced and
sung, but ballet is very different.
 &HT;    ``Agnes De Mille was looking for someone to play me in the
ballet sequence,'' the actor recalls, ``but they couldn't find
anyone who looked heavy enough. After two weeks she called me and
said, `We found someone.' So I went down to the stage and said,
`Where is he?' and she said, `It's you.'
 &HT;    ``So I lifted 122 pounds of dancer 22 times,'' he says. ``We
figured it out _ it was over a ton. And I'm scared to death,
because she was a wonderful dancer and, if I'd dropped her, I would
have ruined her career.''
 &HT;    Almost a half-century after his film debut in ``Teresa'' (1951),
Steiger still knows what to do in a supporting role. In the past
year alone, he's played judges in ``The Hurricane'' and ``Crazy in
Alabama'' (1999), played a priest opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in
``End of Days'' (l999) and co-starred with Burt Reynolds in ``The
Last Producer,'' a comedy about two would-be moviemakers that's due
out later this year.
 &HT;    ``Crazy in Alabama'' may have been his favorite, he says.
 &HT;    ```Crazy in Alabama' didn't stick around very long,'' he
recalls, ``When you hear anybody in this town say, `It's a sweet
film,' that means that's what's going to be on its tombstone. It's
finished in about a week.''
 &HT;    But he relished working for first-time director Antonio
Banderas.
 &HT;    ``He has a European attitude towards the people he works with,''
Steiger says. ``I always get spoiled when I work in Europe. They
say, `Mr. Steiger, would you do this or that?' In this place, some
12-year-old third assistant comes up and says, `Rod, baby, we're
ready to shoot.'''
 &HT;    Never one to suffer fools kindly, Steiger had no one to turn to
when a longstanding tendency to clinical depression hit him
full-strength in the 1980s. He was virtually unheard from for a
decade, making it through only with years of psychotherapy.
 &HT;    The lessons linger, he says.
 &HT;    ``If you're trying to obtain the respect that gives you a sense
of wholeness only through your profession, you'll never do it,'' he
says bluntly. ``You need medical or psychiatric help. Without it,
there's no such thing as success.''
 &HT;    After almost 90 movies, Steiger has battled back from depression
and surgery on both his heart and his hip. Even now, though, he
doesn't like to play it safe.
 &HT;    ``I've always loved playing around with the idea of failure,''
he admits between mouthfuls of pizza. ``So I looked for parts that
frightened me to death because of my crazy ego. But when I
succeeded like I did in `The Pawnbroker' and a few others, I had an
experience nobody in the world had. It was my high.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, he concedes, those kind of roles are harder to find.
 &HT;    ``Listen,'' he says, ``When you're my age, they're not exactly
rushing at you with great parts, not in this town. I certainly
don't expect to be a rival to Johnny Depp anytime soon.''
 &HT;    Still, he's out there looking for the kind of parts he wants,
unlike his ``On The Waterfront'' co-star Brando, with whom Steiger
has feuded off and on for decades.
 &HT;    ``Marlon doesn't like acting much,'' he says. ``At least so he's
said. But he's a very clever politician _ he'll say things so
you'll remember them that he may not believe at all.''
 &HT;    Unlike many older actors, however, Steiger doesn't insist that
the old days were the only really good days. He's enthusiastic in
his praise of several younger actors, including Al Pacino _
``because he takes chances'' _ and Meryl Streep.
 &HT;    ``Here's a woman who's such a good actress that I think people
subconsciously hate her guts,'' he says, ``because she makes it
look so easy.''
 &HT;    He envies English actors, he adds, because after long careers
they often are honored by their country in a way that Americans
rarely are.
 &HT;    ``Tony Hopkins is a friend,'' Steiger says, ``and I kid him,
`What is this ``Sir Anthony'' business? You're such a crude
fellow.' Now `Sir Rodney,' that has a ring to it: `Sir Rodney's car
is here.'''
 &HT;    Reluctantly, Steiger admits that there's some truth to his past
reputation as a ``difficult'' actor _ though, characteristically,
he isn't offering any apologies.
 &HT;    ``Clift was difficult,'' he says. ``So was Brando, and Dean. De
Niro and Hoffman, Pacino and Daniel Day-Lewis are all difficult.
And if that is difficult, then I intend to be difficult for the
rest of my life.''

NAPSTER IS STIRRING PIRACY CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shawn Fanning doesn't look, talk, or walk like a revolutionary.
The 19-year-old from Harwich hardly seems like an incendiary
capable of fueling the wrath of the establishment. But that's
exactly what happened after he began tinkering with a computer as a
freshman at Northeastern University last year. He wrote one little
program, and now the lawyers are sharpening their claws, the
students are circulating petitions, and the pundits are predicting
the beginning of a brave new world.
</P>
<P>
   The program is called Napster, which allows computer users to
share digital music files (called MP3s) almost instantly over the
Internet. Faster and more reliable than other MP3 search engines,
Napster is wildly popular among college and high-school students,
who use it to trade both legal and pirated music. Some folks,
however, are not enthralled. The Recording Industry Association of
America has filed suit, and scores of colleges have banned the
program on their campus computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the guy who started the whole brouhaha write the
program in the first place? ``I was bored,'' Fanning says. ``I had
some free time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fanning has barely had a minute since he dropped out of
college to found Napster, Inc., a startup in San Mateo, Calif.
Fanning himself isn't in the direct firing line; the company
recruited a CEO to handle the business while he puts in long hours
as a software engineer (with stock options, of course). As such,
he's not allowed to talk about the legal issues and seems frazzled
by the controversy. ``I knew Napster had potential,'' he says
during a frequently interrupted phone interview. ``But I didn't
think it would gain this kind of popularity. I didn't think it
would be . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Contentious? Litigious? He finishes the thought this way.
``Handing over the business stuff was not difficult at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company is now embroiled in a lawsuit that could
determine the future of the music industry, which is struggling to
redefine itself in the digital age. Napster (the Mac version is
Rapster) enables each user to post his entire MP3 collection online
for others to download, making it simple for anyone to obtain
high-quality music illegally. For instance, tracks from the new 'N
Sync album, ``No Strings Attached,'' were available for downloading
through Napster on Wednesday, the day after the record hit the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association filed its lawsuit late last
year, contending that Napster facilitates piracy. Artists and their
agents contend that such programs are robbing them of their
royalties. Sean ``Puffy'' Combs says the program is a form of
``abuse,'' while Scott Stapp, lead singer for Creed, has said that
Napster is ``robbing me blind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Napster CEO Eileen Richardson begs to differ. ``We want to
create a place where new artists can keep in touch with their
fans,'' she says. Digital distribution, she argues, makes it
possible for unsigned bands to bypass the insular record industry
and market their music directly to millions of potential fans.
Plus, Richardson says, Napster isn't doing anything illegal itself;
the site (www.napster.com) includes a disclaimer warning users to
obey the copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   Disclaimer or not, the primary use of Napster is to download
pirated music. And the program uses a ton of bandwidth, causing a
different kind of fury at scores of colleges. Indiana University,
for one, banned the program in February. Sophomore Chad Paulson
started www.savenapster.com, a grassroots drive to convince college
administrators to restore access to the program. To date, he has
gathered more than 13,000 signatures on a petition, and this week,
the university announced it was restoring an updated version of
Napster on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
   The ban at Indiana never had anything to do with the copyright
issues, says Mark Bruhn, the school's information technology policy
officer. The program was eating up more than 60 percent of the
university's network capacity. ``This isn't a legal issue,'' Bruhn
says. ``A screwdriver isn't illegal unless you use it to break into
a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all college officials agree. Robert Weir, vice president of
information services at Northeastern, banned Napster primarily
because of piracy issues. ``A condition of using our systems is
that you don't do anything illegal, and copyright infringement is
illegal,'' he says, allowing that former Northeastern student
Fanning ``wrote a cool piece of code.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Paulson, who fought to reinstate Napster at Indiana,
doesn't argue that most folks use the program to promote legal
MP3s. ``Piracy is wrong,'' Paulson says, claiming that he only
downloaded one song illegally on Napster and immediately deleted
it. That sounds like the musical equivalent of ``I didn't inhale.''
But Paulson also champions independent bands and legal MP3s on his
Web site and says the Internet will bring democracy to the
oligarchic music business.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, both sides are right, and both sides are wrong.
And it's unclear who is going to win the latest round of the music
wars. But neither outcome is particularly attractive. The music
industry is trying to protect its turf and curtail progress; at the
same time, artists deserve to be paid. ``If the recording industry
wins, we lose the huge social advantages,'' says Harvard Law School
professor William Fisher. ``But if the recording industry loses,
artists' rights are eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher envisions an alternative outcome in the battle, a sort of
new model for the music industry that he whimsically calls ``Doing
Well by Doing Good.'' Under his scenario, artists would release
their music files online in an unprotected format, offering certain
services (such as advance concert tickets) to honest fans who pay
as they play. David Bowie has mastered the concept at
www.davidbowie.com, which offers users everything from Internet
service to CDs (as in compact disc and certificates of deposit).
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's vision is eminently reasonable, since it offers a
compromise that encourages artistic freedom for the masses but
doesn't require artists to work for free. However, the recording
industry isn't going to give in without a fight that could go all
the way to the Supreme Court. And entrepreneurs are not going to
stop coming up with new programs. Just last week, engineers at
Nullsoft, Inc., introduced Gnutella, an open-source program that is
similar to Napster. The only problem was, Nullsoft is owned by
America Online, which recently merged with Time-Warner, which
happens to be a member of the Recording Industry Association.
Gnutella was taken down within hours of its release, but copies are
available all over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's Napster, tomorrow it's Gnutella, and the next day,
it's something else,'' says Northeastern's Weir. And who knows?
Maybe Shawn Fanning will start another revolution some day. ``I
have other ideas I'd like to address,'' he says, ``but right now,
I'd like to get some rest.''

COMPANIES GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS TO FIND EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ How tight is the labor market in Boston? Consider the
latest tactic of Franklin Pierce Temporaries, one of the city's
biggest temporary employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several weeks, six Franklin Pierce recruiters have
been methodically plowing through the Boston white pages,
cold-calling everyone in the city with a listed phone number. Their
question: Are you or anyone you know looking for work?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be creative nowadays, and try everything,'' said
Dave La Fauci, Franklin Pierce's vice president and general
manager. ``Creativity is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   With the state's unemployment rate hovering around 3 percent for
the past few months, employers throughout the city and across the
state have been strapped to fill new jobs created by the economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary agencies say their once-reliable pools of people
seeking short-term work are drying up, and the response to
traditional newspaper and magazine advertisements has dropped
significantly. Increasingly, they say, they must resort to
financial incentives and innovative recruiting techniques to
recruit the people they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, for any job you would advertise, you would get
seven or eight responses,'' said Stephen Flynn, owner of the
COMFORCE temp agency in Boston. ``Now if you get one or two, you
feel very fortunate. So you have to increase what you do to entice
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ComForce has begun putting fliers on parked cars, Flynn said,
and is devoting new energies to job fairs as well as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Flynn added that strong recruiting isn't enough. Referral
bonuses at ComForce that once peaked at $100 now run as high as
$500. And the company is offering benefits, paid vacations, and
holidays to some of its longer-term employees.
</P>
<P>
   Wages for temps are up too, by as much as 15 to 20 percent over
the past few years, according to temp agency executives. La Fauci
said basic receptionist jobs that until recently paid between $9
and $10 per hour now pay $11 to $12 an hour. ``That's just
phones,'' he said. Flynn added that data-entry jobs that paid as
little as $7 an hour in the late 1990s now offer up to $10 per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a shortage,'' said Jeanne Fiol, principal
and president of the temporary staffing division at KNF&AMP;T Staffing
Resources in Boston, which employs about 600 temp workers every
week.
</P>
<P>
   Fiol said staffing problems are especially acute in positions
that require employees with more than the most basic skills.
``There just aren't enough qualified computer-literate candidates
to go around,'' Fiol said.
</P>
<P>
   KNF&AMP;T has yet to crack open the phone book, however. Fiol said
she has preferred to boost advertising budgets and spend more time
surfing job-seeker Web sites such as monster.com, a resume
repository that has become a temp-agency favorite. ``There's a
great deal of Internet recruiting going on,'' Fiol said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fiol was skeptical of some competitors' tactics.
Relying on the phone book, she said, is unlikely to yield the kind
of skilled employees that are most needed.
</P>
<P>
   But La Fauci said he's happy with the results of the white pages
experiment, dreamed up six months ago by Franklin Pierce employee
Kathleen Dorsey.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, each of Franklin Pierce's six recruiters works
through a phone book page _ each of which averages about 440 names,
La Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has been averaging a mere two to three callbacks
per page, a response rate of less than 1 percent. But La Fauci said
that is enough to make it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a numbers game,'' he said. ``You've got to go more
in-depth on your recruiting efforts, and leave no stone unturned.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, La Fauci added, he needs to do everything he can to stay a
step ahead of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's high competition among my competitors,'' he said.
``Everyone in the world has this problem right now.''

&HT;     EYES AT NIGHT,   WITH NEW SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   I am traveling at 60 miles per hour and it is a pitch-black
night. The 100 yards of highway ahead that are swept by my
headlights are clear.
</P>
<P>
   But there, seeming to dance on the leading edge of my car's
hood, I get an early, important look at potential danger _ 400-500
yards ahead. There is a car in the breakdown lane. Will someone
suddenly step from beside it into the road? It has stopped near the
glowing image of a highway overpass and I see an animal scurrying
up the grassy embankment from the highway to the overpass. Will the
creature _ it turns out to be a dog _ suddenly change direction and
dart back into my path?
</P>
<P>
   At 60 miles per hour, at that distance, I have between 12 and 17
1/2 seconds to weigh these potential dangers and adjust my driving
accordingly. Without the Night Vision system in the Cadillac
DeVille I am driving, I would have seen none of this until I was
100 yards or less from the car and the dog. If the dog darted or an
occupant of the car had been crouched, changing a tire, back
jutting into the travel lane, I would have had only about 3 1/2
seconds to recognize the danger, react, and, if necessary, bring my
car to a sudden stop.
</P>
<P>
   The DeVille is the first car offered in the United States with
Night Vision as an option. Right now, it's not cheap _ about $2,000
_ but its safety potential is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   This Night Vision system was developed by General Motors and
Raytheon Systems, with some work done in Massachusetts, but the
bulk of it done in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Night Vision was born, as are many civilian inventions, of
military design. Early systems designed to help fight in the dark,
such as the ``Starlight'' scope used in Vietnam or night vision
goggles, work by concentrating available ambient light _ what
Stuart Klapper, director of automotive programs for Raytheon, calls
image intensifier technology.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Gulf War came, America got a look at a different
sort of night vision enhancing technology. It was called far
infrared, or forward-looking infrared. It is these images, which
look like photographic negatives, that you may recall from news
photos and video from the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   What is different about forward-looking infrared is that it uses
heat, rather than light, to form an image for the operator of a
tank _ or a DeVille.
</P>
<P>
   Klapper says that even 15 years ago, a single, forward-looking
infrared system cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That a
system can now be offered for $2,000 is remarkable. And Klapper
says that as Night Vision systems become more commonplace, their
costs could drop to what you pay today for a good television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens with prices will depend on public reaction,'' he
says, citing air bags and anti-lock brake systems, once expensive
options, as examples of safety features that drop in cost and make
their way into the mainstream automotive market.
</P>
<P>
   Cost, of course, is but one factor in selling the public on a
new technology. Another is persuading drivers that the technology
will help them and, further, that it will be easy to use and will
not distract them as they drive.
</P>
<P>
   Safety should be marketable based purely on common sense. Only a
quarter of the nation's drive time is spent on the road after dark,
yet that's when half of all fatalities occur. How many moose, deer,
dogs, cats, humans, broken down autos, get hit by vehicles whose
drivers don't spot the danger until too late?
</P>
<P>
   The ease of use and a lack of distraction factors require more
tangible proof _ like a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   So get behind the wheel of the 2000 DeVille (full review of the
car itself next week), fire it up at night, and let the Night
Vision system warm up for about 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   An image about the size of your interior rearview mirror appears
just above the top of your dashboard. With a couple of buttons you
can move it up or down an inch or so, or can alter its intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Though the image _ picked up by a forward-looking camera mounted
in the Cadillac's grille _ is projected through the dash ahead of
you and onto the windshield, you do not ``see'' it on the
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what Klapper calls a ``virtual image'' causes your eyes
to focus out at the very front of the car. If the image were
projected, say, on a flat or pop-up screen on your dash, your eyes
would have to refocus each time you glanced at the screen and again
when you looked back to the road.
</P>
<P>
   With Night Vision's virtual image system, your eyes are in
constant focus on the road ahead. After only about 10 minutes of
getting used to the system, you are looking right through the
virtual image _ aware of what appears on it _ but concentrating on
the road as you normally would.
</P>
<P>
   What you see is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all objects give off some heat. Humans and animals are
warmest and they give off the most heat. My own children, put well
out of headlight range and given a soccer ball to toss, appeared as
strong, milky images on the screen. Even the ball _ warm because
they were touching it, I assume _ was a glowing white orb.
</P>
<P>
   Children safely back in the car, we took a drive. Trees _
they're alive _ glowed in a roadside dance of their own, darker at
the trunks, radiant out near the tips of their branches.
</P>
<P>
   Autos appeared ahead of me even as their tail lights were only
first coming into view. Their bodies glowed, their exhausts were
pulsing emissions of light. Because this system uses heat, not
light, to capture its images, it ``sees through'' the headlights of
approaching cars, a scenario that would be a blinding problem for
systems that concentrate available light.
</P>
<P>
   Road signs are not as bright, but become quickly visible long
before headlights reach them. Bridges and their supports,
presumably giving off radiant heat stored during the daytime,
become visible way beyond the reach of headlights.
</P>
<P>
   It only takes 0.3 of a degree in temperature for the Night
Vision system to respond by offering gradients in the images it
produces. This is why the image _ though much like your old black
and white TV in negative _ is so detailed.
</P>
<P>
   Night Vision can tell that there is more activity at the tip of
a tree's branches; that sunlight has been stored as energy in a
concrete pillar and is now bleeding away as heat in the night; that
a crippled car is located dangerously on the edge of the shoulder
dead ahead; that a moose has wandered into the road; that a child
has run from her yard chasing a pet.
</P>
<P>
   It can show you all this, show you before your headlights reveal
the danger, show you while you still have time to react.
</P>
<P>
   Still rare and still expensive, Night Vision is not within reach
of everyone. But once upon a time, neither were air bags.

MORE THAN JUST A BABY BENZ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know of another make of automobile so uniformly
identifiable through its entire model line as Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   That's distinctive as in: Put me blindfolded into a C Class, S
Class, sedan, wagon, or roadster, take me for a spin, and I'll know
I'm in a Mercedes. There's just something so recognizably solid _
in sound, suspension, seating, straightforward surge _ that gives a
Benz away every time.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 C280, wedged into the class between the supercharged
C230 Kompressor and the thundering V8 C430, is no exception. And
what is remarkable is that, at less than $40,000, it's got a lot of
what you pay for in models at far higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a bit of a baby-Benz if you park it beside an S
Class sedan, but standing alone it appears, from the outside,
full-blown, unmistakable Mercedes. Add the front and side farings
that come with the sport model tested and it has a distinct
sport-sedan aura about it.
</P>
<P>
   Among standard features are a five-speed, electronically
controlled transmission (thankfully with a touch-shift option),
10-way electrically-adjustable front seats, power windows, reading
lamps, cruise control, and integrated garage-door opener. For
safety, there's an automatic-manual emergency-calling system (needs
to be activated with your phone company), dual front air bags,
front side airbags, antilock brakes, and a skid-control system.
</P>
<P>
   The sports package, which added $1,600 to the near-$36,000 base
price, included two-tone leather seats, a split fold-down rear
seat, glass sunroof, telephone, integrated CD changer, and embossed
stainless-steel door sills.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats are among the firmest, most supportive to
be found with wide seat areas that are very solid at the thighs.
The backs of the seats are virtually walled in by bulging lateral
supports. Put the car fast and stiff through a tight corner and the
seats simply grip you. Even the rear seats' outside positions
deliver this effect. The middle of the back seat is more of a hump
and would not be a good spot for a long trip.
</P>
<P>
   The gauge/control setup on the dash is classically functional.
Climate controls are large and easy to use. The audio portion is a
bit more confusing and the buttons somewhat smaller than is the
trend toward larger and simpler these days. And I found the
placement of the cruise-control and turn-signal levers _
side-by-each on the steering column _ annoying. It is too easy to
``resume speed'' when what you mean to do is signal a left-hand
turn.
</P>
<P>
   One option that I'd love to see in more sedans is the C280's
box-through between the rear seats for skis. Others offer it, but,
in the Mercedes, not only can you put your skis through this
rectangle that is hidden behind the fold-down rear armrest, you can
also keep the skis safe and dry with a long snap-bag.
</P>
<P>
   Storage for personal items is decent up front with a deep center
console area and bins in the doors. Rear passengers, however, are
at loss for any place to put magazines or personal items. No bins,
no back-of-the-front-seat pouches. They do get an emergency medical
kit built into the rear window ledge, however.
</P>
<P>
   The C280 is powered by a 2.8-liter, 18-valve, V6 aluminum
engine. Its best performance is revealed once you are up to speed,
passing traffic on the highway, as opposed to quick starts. Its
throaty rumble is distinctive and it delivered 20.3 miles per
gallon in widely mixed driving.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed automatic hung onto gears, both shifting up and
down, longer than I like and there were distinct transitions from
gear to gear. Switched to touch shift, however, it behaved very
well, clicking up and down instantly and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was smooth, solid and stable. It was stiff weaving in
and out of highway traffic, stiff on sharp corners, stiff straight
ahead into a winter wind, stiff even on frost heaves. Mercedes
stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes cut no corners in producing the suspension system that
results in this solid ride: Up front is a double wishbone setup
with upper and lower control arms, coil springs, gas-charged
shocks, stabilizer bar, and anti-dive, anti-lift technology.
</P>
<P>
   The rear has a five-link system with most of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Antilock disc brakes bring the Benz to quick, straight stops,
and an antiskid system called the Electronic Stability Program
helps keep it under control while rolling or braking.
</P>
<P>
   ESP works by braking individual wheels when it senses understeer
or oversteer. There's also a winter driving mode that cuts torque _
in effect preventing the driver from sending too much juice to the
wheels and setting them to spinning. This is a good thing in most
cases, though I found it a hindrance on a day when we had a couple
of inches of wet, slick snow. I could not get the C280 up a
moderate hill near my home and, once stopped, could not swing the
tail of the car around to get it facing back downhill so I could
descend and make another run.
</P>
<P>
   When I switched off winter mode, it did much better. Sometimes
extra juice is a good thing in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The graphite inserts in dash and doors. They tie the driver's
compartment together nicely.
</P>
<P>
   --The dual-level, covered console between the front seats. Roomy
below, telephone bin above.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The clip on the passenger's side seat-belt dangles at midseat
when not in use. This seems to be its assigned position. Problem
is, on a sunny day, it sends bursts of light darting about the
cabin.

&HT;     POLICE IN ILLINOIS RESTRICT PUBLIC ACCESS TO RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GARY SCHNEIDER  
 &HT;     c.2000 Edwardsville Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. _ Some law enforcement agencies in Illinois
are denying the public access to police records, citing a recent
state Supreme Court rule limiting what lawyers and prosecutors can
say to ensure that criminal defendants get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Media organizations attacked the response to the court's rule,
and Illinois Press Association officials have threatened to fight
it in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public will be less informed about things they otherwise
would be informed about, and it's going to get worse, probably,''
said David Bennett, the press association's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies in Edwardsville and several nearby
communities have denied reporters access to records deemed public
by state law. Officials said they were acting on the advice of
Madison County State's Attorney Bill Haine.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout of police news in Madison County is the most
extreme response to the ruling in the state. But Bennett called it
``the tip of the iceberg. We have some evidence it's spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   State's attorneys in Scott and DuPage counties have issued
strict guidelines about what prosecutors and the police can say,
and reporters in Tazwell County, near Peoria, are facing resistance
in getting routine police news, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the press group is working with prosecutors and has
received permission from the association's board of directors to
litigate against the rules, if necessary. ``The IPA will continue
to try and get these rules changed,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Dalglish of the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the
Press in Arlington, Va., said police officers who now refuse to
release routine reports ``obviously have been frightened to death
by the state's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's profoundly ironic in all this stuff is the very reason
courts are by law public. The framers of our Constitution made it
that way to protect the defendants so you could not just lock them
away and no one would know. That's what makes this so stupid. How
do you know your mother's not in jail?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how you run a banana republic. You just lock up
anyone. It's un-American. It's absolutely ridiculous. I hope in the
next day or two, cooler heads are allowed to prevail here.''
</P>
<P>
   New Supreme Court rules of attorney conduct that went into
effect on March 16 regulate what lawyers and prosecutors can say in
criminal cases. The rules were designed to ensure the rights of the
accused to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were so broad, however, that they prohibited the
normal flow of news from police departments to news media and had
the effect of a gag order on state's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts the state's attorneys in a box. They're personally
responsible and being gagged by the Supreme Court rules, but they
are also being held responsible for what others say,'' Bennett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph R. Tybor, press secretary for the Supreme Court of
Illinois, said the new rules were well thought out. ``The court
gave very careful consideration to the rules changes and to the
objections to the rules changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tybor said that they imitate model rules put out by the American
Bar Association and used by many states. ``Illinois is not a
pioneer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dalglish called Haine's instructions to the police chiefs in
Madison County an extreme overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredibly hysterical response to what the Supreme
Court has done here,'' Dalglish said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Haine is overreacting to a portion of Amended Rule 3.8
which says, ``a public prosecutor ... shall exercise reasonable
care to prevent investigators, law enforcement personnel, employees
or other persons assisting or associating with the prosecutor in a
criminal case from making an extrajudicial statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in how you define `reasonable care.' He is obviously
taking it to the extreme. Reasonable care is telling a witness of
yours standing outside of the courtroom that there are press people
present, so don't say anything before you testify,'' Dalglish said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mulford, spokesman for the state Attorney General's
Office, said that the attorney general had done all he could do to
oppose the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court reviewed our objection and they denied our
appeal. And now, that's a fact of life. We made our objection
known, so at this point, it's something we have to live with,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While most Madison County police departments exercised a media
blackout, felony filings by the state's attorney's office were
still being released to the press Thursday by the circuit clerk's
office.

PLAYERS LEARNING TO SHUN TOUR'S AUTOGRAPH HOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Making his way to the locker room
after a practice round at The Players Championship, Ben Crenshaw
was doing what has been an important part of professional golf for
years _ signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Hats, programs, trading cards, golf balls. Crenshaw signed his
name to everything, all the while moving forward, smiling,
accepting thanks. Then he spotted something that turned him into
anything but ``Gentle Ben.'' He saw a young spectator hold out a
souvenir flag, a replica of those that sit atop flagsticks at golf
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't sign it?'' asked the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No flags,'' said the two-time Masters winner. He was through
the gate now, safe to walk in peace, safe to put his Sharpie back
in his pocket, safe to vent his frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing us. The collectors are just killing us,'' said
Crenshaw. ``A damned nuisance is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw doesn't sign the souvenir flags, he said, because they
end up on e-Bay, the auction Web site, or get hustled in some other
fashion. Young children wouldn't have money to buy such pricey
souvenirs, he reasons. It pains him to turn them down, but it has
become a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely it has,'' said Bernhard Langer, another popular
target since he, too, has won two Masters. Items signed by major
championship winners traditionally fetch the most money, a reality
that is not lost upon these golfers.
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, Langer was signing autographs for youngsters,
putting his name on sweat-stained visors, crumpled programs, and
sheets with the starting times. When a youngster pulled out a
glossy, color photo of the German professional, Langer politely
handed it back, telling the boy he had signed one for him the other
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can recognize the same guys all the time. I'm not out here
to help them make a living,'' said Langer, and sure enough, the
youngster had a knapsack around the corner from where he had sought
out Langer. It was filled with similar photos of many Tour
regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't like the way the guy looks,'' said Davis Love, ``I
just don't sign it. That might not be right, but if a guy has got a
backpack or bag or football in one hand and he's got a baseball in
another, I just don't sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Love related a story about being approached by a young girl
holding a scorecard from Augusta National. ``Is your daddy a member
at Augusta National?'' asked Love, and the girl said no. When Love
asked her how she got hold of a legitimate Augusta National
scorecard, she pointed to a man standing nearby, at which point
Love respectfully declined to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she came back with a Winged Foot scorecard,'' said Love,
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Funny? Not to Love and a growing number of PGA Tour players,
particularly at the Senior level since autographs draped in
nostalgia bring a higher price. ``But they are using kids to get
the autographs,'' said Love of these dealers who then turn around
and sell their items. ``I don't know what to do, but it is out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players don't hold such concerns. Love said that his
friend, Jeff Sluman, for instance, shrugs it off, figuring ``that
if a guy can make money off me, more power to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Andrade fears that trying to filter out the collectors
could leave an innocent kid holding a souvenir or photo he had just
bought with his own money. How do you know? he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone, I guess, is in the money-making business,'' said
Andrade. ``But, for all those guys there are hundreds of thousands
of kids who keep them for themselves; that's what I look at. When I
was a kid, to get an autograph from someone, whether it was Ernie
DiGregorio or John Havlicek _ that was something I treasured.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade is pretty much the rule out on Tour, for he signs
autographs all the time. ``I like to do it,'' he said. ``It helps
you blow off some steam if you've had a bad day. Arnold Palmer
never seemed to have a problem signing autographs. He's the guy we
all look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   And most follow Palmer's lead, particularly during practice
rounds. Once the event starts, fans are asked to not to seek
autographs, at least until after a player has finished his round.
You would be hard-pressed to find Tour players who routinely refuse
to sign, but more and more of them are wary about what they are
signing and for whom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Combs is senior vice president of public relations and
communications for the PGA Tour. He said Tour officials are aware
of the situation that has some players concerned, that collectors
are after autographs on items that can be then sold for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the back of a ticket to a PGA Tour event, he said.
That's where you find this warning: ``Soliciting autographs from
the professionals with the intent to sell is prohibited and grounds
for removal from the property at the sole discretion of the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is trying to distinguish between
legitimate, eager youngsters, and overbearing, profit-minded
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make our tournaments an enjoyable atmosphere
with players signing as they are used to. It is part of Tour
tradition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Tour is not actively seeking out the professional
collectors, ``the players and their caddies have become pretty
adept at picking them out,'' said Combs.
</P>
<P>
   And when they have been caught, they have been asked to leave.
``Some of the tournaments have been very good at throwing those
guys out,'' said Love.
</P>
<P>
   Players have also been very good at taking measures to combat
the problem. Tiger Woods, for instance, said he tries to autograph
items personally, asking youngsters for their names, a move that
reportedly cuts down on the value.
</P>
<P>
   It's a valiant effort, but when the youngsters come rushing _
and they do when Woods is the target _ it is very hard for him to
stop and put down a personal greeting for every enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman talked to reporters about a method he has found
successful to discourage would-be collectors. Having been told that
collectors prefer black or blue markers, Lehman carries green and
orange Sharpies, which is the marker of choice with PGA Tour
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, `Please, Mr. Lehman, can you use this black pen?'
'' while handing him a black pen. ``I'll say, `Sorry, but today is
green day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What it is, said many PGA Tour players, is a sad day when they
have to screen autograph-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the same three photos of me for a while now,'' said
Brad Faxon. ``On the one hand, I think it's cool to sign something
like that. But on the other, I hate to think I'm helping someone
make money with them. It's a tough call.''

TEAMS HAVE TIES TO HOST CITY

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There's no question fans represent the sixth
player. But the question this weekend is for whom will they cheer?
</P>
<P>
   The teams in the NCAA women's Final Four at the First Union
Center are filled with Philadelphia connections.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers will face Tennessee in the opening game Friday, followed
by the University of Connecticut against Penn State. Three of the
four coaches spent time in the area, and more than a handful of
players have local ties.?
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, located about 200 miles away, boasts forward Rashana
Barnes and center Amanda Garner, who grew up in Philadelphia. Coach
Rene Portland is a native of Broomall, a suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UConn coach Geno Auriemma, who grew up in nearby
Norristown, started his collegiate coaching career at St. Joseph's.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Pat Summitt can't boast of any local ties, but
her players can. Center Kristen Clement grew up in Broomall, and
teammate Tamika Catchings's father, Harvey, played for the
Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   And there are bound to be cheers for Rutgers, which is just two
hours up the New Jersey Turnpike and has senior guard Shawnetta
Stewart, a former star at Philadelphia's University High.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Rutgers' coach, C. Vivian Stringer, who first
coached college basketball at Cheyney State, and remains good
friends with John Cheney, the former men's coach at Cheyney and
current coach at Temple.
</P>
<P>
   So when the games tap off, the cheers might be confusing as fans
try to figure out whether to root for the team with the best stats
or best local ties.

SAUDI ABUSES UNVEILED

<TEXT>
<P>
   Amnesty International's latest report, ``Saudi Arabia: A Secret
State of Suffering,'' merits attention, particularly from
Americans. The report's descriptions of systematic human rights
abuses in Saudi Arabia are no more repugnant than the horrors
perpetrated in some other countries, but what makes the Saudi
monarchy a special case for Americans is its status as an ally of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi royal family has been able to veil from American eyes
the endemic injustices of its justice system. For a long time,
Americans have heard only occasional, isolated accounts of forced
confessions, torture, flogging, amputations, and the execution of
accused criminals and dissidents who are deprived of the right to a
fair trial that Americans often take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty report draws on testimony from foreign nationals who
survived unimaginable cruelties at the hands of Saudi authorities
and were eventually able to leave the country. Saudis who suffer
human rights violations at the hands of the state rarely manage to
obtain a passport to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the human rights organization has been able to
conduct interviews and documentary research over 20 years,
compiling a report that depicts unjust, discriminatory treatment of
defenseless foreign workers, members of the Shiite Muslim minority,
and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Saudi Arabian government spares no effort to keep its
appalling human rights record a secret, and other governments have
shown themselves more than willing to help maintain the secrecy,''
the Amnesty report observes in what may be its most damning
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   If the concept of human rights is to have real meaning, there
can be no double standards for allies, clients, or crucial oil
producers. The public relations firms and lobbyists hired by the
Saudi government _ and named by Amnesty _ should not be able to
hide the truth about the kingdom. Precisely because the Saudi
rulers are allies of Washington, America has an obligation to
demand that discriminatory laws, arbitrary arrests, torture, and
executions without a fair trial are abolished in the kingdom.

<P>
   HOLYOKE, Mass. _ Ah, yes. Two fresh-faced 20-somethings launch a
dot-com start-up, grind away on a couple of PCs in the garage for a
while, latch onto a few million bucks of venture capital, do a
hotly anticipated IPO, get themselves listed on the Nasdaq, sift
through a batch of buyout offers, and blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   But wait.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie and Kara Healy are peddling real stuff that you can hold
in your hands. And they began with a pair of cookie ovens in their
grandparents' basement here. And they borrowed the better part of
their $40,000 start-up stash from their parents. And they talk
about owning their thriving little two-woman dog-biscuit company,
like, beyond the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   How refreshingly retro. Or as 27-year-old Debbie Healy puts it,
sounding surprised herself: ``We're in a business where you
actually make money when people buy the product, not when you go
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but doggie treats?
</P>
<P>
   Yes: silver-dollar-sized Hi5 Biscuits!, turned out in four
flavors and with no additives, originally concocted from stuff that
Healy and her younger sister, 25-year-old Kara, found around the
kitchen. ``These are something people can actually eat,'' Kara
Healy effuses, although it was the enthusiasm of the family's
chocolate Labrador retriever, Stel (short for Amstel, as in the
beer) that sparked the birth of the boutique biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Healy sisters are both former college English
majors _ Debbie at Dartmouth, Kara at Providence _ who never
cracked a business textbook, their projections tell them that
America's dogs will lap up some $500,000 worth of Hi5s this year.
That still makes them a minuscule pet supplier, but they impressed
Stop &AMP; Shop enough last year that the supermarket chain added their
canine niblets to the shelves of 168 of its 202 stores. Small
wonder that the sisters are smiling widely in the picture that
appears, Ben-and-Jerry-like, on the back of each 12-ounce, $2.99
package of Cheasy Pleasy, Nuddy Buddy, Papa Stel, and Original
Flavor.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Stel's photo that fittingly adorns the front of the
Hi5 Biscuits! bags. In 1996, the Healy sisters cooked up a batch of
snacks for the family dog because they and their mother, Gloria
Healy, didn't much care for the ingredients found in most dog
snacks. ``If you read a label in a typical bag of treats, you can't
figure out what's inside. You need a dictionary and a thesaurus,''
Debbie Healy contends, referring to the likes of ethylenediamine
dihydriodide or sodium metabisulfite. At the time, Debbie Healy was
a would-be professional tennis player who was recovering from
shoulder surgery here in her hometown. Her sister was still in
college. Stel, at 100 pounds, was simply hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the first batch of a dozen or so biscuits was
undercooked. ``Stel was so pumped he almost bit my hand,'' Debbie
recalls. ``We knew we were onto something.'' Soon, her plans to
attend law school were put on hold. So was Kara's notion of
becoming an elementary school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the sisters purchased two large stainless-steel
commercial cookie ovens and placed them atop cinder blocks in the
basement of the modest three-bedroom ranch home owned by their
grandparents, Therese and Ervin Holbrook. The neon-lit room had
served as their parents' living room for two winters during the
early 1970s. (Their father, Fran Healy, was a journeyman major
league catcher for nine seasons and is now a television broadcaster
for the New York Mets.) Making dog biscuits by hand, with rolling
pins and cookie cutters, turned out to be hard, hot work. Sore
shoulders and swollen hands were common. ``At least we got a good
upper-body workout,'' muses Gloria Healy, who pitched in. A
200-pound batch of biscuits required five hours of baking.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hi5 Biscuits! began turning up in small grocery
and pet stores from Massachusetts to New Jersey. Daniel Strum, the
owner of a meat market and deli located about a half-mile from the
two busy ovens, was an early buyer. ``Sales were slow at the
beginning,'' Strum says. ``I sold maybe 18 bags every six months.
Now I'm doing 30 or 40 a week. I've got people who come in for dog
biscuits and don't even want a steak or hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning out biscuits as fast as they could while making
deliveries to 200 stores, Debbie and Kara found by 1997 that they
couldn't expand any further. What's more, ``it wasn't fun,'' Debbie
recalls. ``We were completely held up, stuck in the basement,
trying to figure out how to increase capacity. That's why most
businesses fail: They can't keep up with demand.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of searching and researching, the sisters last
August contracted with a commercial baker on Boston's South Shore.
Now, they say, the company is turning out 30,000 to 40,000 pounds
of product per month. The business is expanding again. And the
Healys are no longer working the basement shift. Indeed, they're
completely free of their baking chores, able to market, sell, and
hand out samples to likely looking prospects. ``If I'm waiting in
line at the bank, I'm always asking people, `Do you have a dog?' ''
Kara Healy says.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters live together in a rented apartment in Boston,
although there's still an office in the basement here. ``But our
main offices are our cars,'' Debbie Healy points out, referring to
the two well-aged Saabs that are stuffed with papers, boxes, and
even clothes. ``We're working longer hours, seven days a week. But
it's more fun now.'' And Hi5 Biscuits! has reached the break-even
point, the sisters say.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly untrained in business, the duo is nevertheless
nothing if not businesslike. ``They're very determined people,''
says their mother, who still helps with paperwork. ``Even as young
children, they were independent and self-disciplined. So we had no
doubts about financing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie and Kara Healy dream of Hi5 Biscuits! eventually becoming
a household name, despite the fact that they're competing with such
corporate names as Ralston Purina, Heinz, and Nabisco. (Nabisco
produces roughly as many pounds of its Milk-Bone dog biscuits and
other snacks in a day as the Healys will during this entire year.)
``We want to be carried in every store in the country,'' Kara Healy
says. To that end, they are looking for an infusion of additional
capital _ more real stuff that you can hold in your hands.

THE POWER OF POSSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You know what potential means? Potential means you haven't
done a damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, New York Jets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells may know football. But with his hard-nosed
attitude he would be lost in today's stock market, especially the
technology end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   To tech fans, potential is everything. A company with potential
might become the next Cisco or Microsoft. The fact that a company
``hasn't done a damn thing'' is not a handicap. It is an advantage.
As Michael Lewis put it in his bestseller on Silicon Valley, ``The
New New Thing,`` ``The most appealing companies are those in a
state of pure possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are investors so willing to believe companies with no track
record are capable of such amazing things? And what would it take
for the market to take off its rose-colored glasses and adopt a
more ``Parcellian'' view of the world?
</P>
<P>
   We plan to answer both those questions. But first it's worth
taking a minute to show just how optimistic technology investors
actually are.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to do that is to look at some tech stocks and
calculate their price/sales ratio. You can't use earnings because
many of these companies aren't yet profitable. You arrive at the
ratio by taking a firm's market value and dividing it by annual
sales. In other words, if a company has a market value of $10
million and $10 million of sales, its price/sales ratio is 1.
</P>
<P>
   A high price/sales ratio indicates a business that is valued on
its potential. In effect, investors are saying: I know you haven't
done much yet, but I am confident you are going to do great things
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The price/sales ratio of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is about 2.
Gillette, a successful old-economy company, trades at a price/sales
ratio of 3. EMC, the data storage giant, has a price/sales ratio of
20.
</P>
<P>
   When you move to some of the newer companies, the ratios jump
off the chart. Before Wednesday's tech selloff _ the Nasdaq fell 4
percent _ Navisite, a start-up, had a price/sales ratio of 136;
Sycamore Networks, a telecom company, 300; Akamai Technologies, a
maker of Internet infrastructure, 1,740.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai had $2.7 million in sales in its most recent quarter.
When the market closed Tuesday, Akamai had a market value of $19
billion. Take that, Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the bullishness is clear: people are infatuated
with technology. ``Technology is making astronomical changes in the
way we live our lives,'' said Brian Grove, who manages a technology
mutual fund for Vaughan Nelson in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is allowing businesses to cut their costs
dramatically, even in old economy fields like steel and
automobiles. Consumers can buy stocks and books over the Internet
and they imagine the day when they will be able to do much more
with their computers and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Weiss, chief of equities at State Street Research, points
out another reason for the enthusiasm about technology: a growing
belief that businesses around the world will have to keep investing
in technology in any kind of economic climate. ``The use of
technology will grow as far as the eye can see,'' said Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have grasped that. They also have seen enough bona
fide success stories to know that great things are possible. A
dollar invested in EMC in 1990 was worth more than $800 at the
beginning of this year. All you have to do is find the next EMC and
bingo, you've got it made.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one problem: there aren't going to be that many
EMCs. The attrition rate in high technology has always been
enormous and there is no reason to think that has changed. In fact,
the failure rate could be higher this time around because Wall
Street has funded so many direct competitors in so many different
niches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outright failures by some of the high fliers could puncture
investors' confidence,'' said Maureen Allyn, chief economist at
Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Selectively, there is already some evidence of that happening.
Many e-retailing stocks that were so hot just last year have
already lost 50 percent to 60 percent of their value. The stock
price of MicroStrategy, a high-profile software company, fell 62
percent one day last week after the firm was forced to restate its
financial results for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Which group will get hit next? Will it be the auction companies,
the business-to-business providers, the Internet infrastructure
firms? Who knows? But logic suggests more disappointments are on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   As Parcells understands, it is great to have potential, but
eventually you have to get out on the field and show the world what
you've got. A few players with potential actually become
superstars; others turn out to be busts; still others wind up
somewhere in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same way with stocks. Over time potential will give
way to performance. When that happens, look for some of those
price/sales ratios to come back to earth.

`THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE': A TELEVANGELIST NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former wife of Jim
Bakker, is that most American of stories, a figure of tragedy and a
joke. It doesn't help that her face suggests what would happen if
the masks of comedy and tragedy were tossed into a microwave oven
and nuked into a colorful blur. The documentary ``The Eyes of Tammy
Faye'' walks us through her life, a veritable catalog of bad
marriages, lost televangelist empires, squandered relationships
with children and, despite it all, Messner's indomitable optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The framing device _ each segment is introduced by hand puppets,
echoing the chapters of the children's movie ``Babe'' _ goes a mite
too far. (The puppets were probably used because Messner loves them
and started her television career turning the tops of bubble-bath
bottles into them.) Any movie with narration by RuPaul Charles
hardly needs an extra ladle of camp; it's already swimming in it.
As is so much of Messner's own story _ her life could have been
written by Danielle Steel and directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder,
with makeup tips courtesy of Sears Best Latex. No wonder she's the
patron saint of drag queens everywhere. She spills her biography
with the same waves of determination, honesty and glitter that made
her such a compelling television personality.
</P>
<P>
   She falls in love with, and endures, a loveless marriage with
the boy wonder television religious personality Jim Bakker, perhaps
the one person who could burst into tears almost as quickly as she.
Between them, they create and are forced out of two television
ministries, the most notorious of which results in Bakker's 1989
conviction for defrauding his followers of millions of dollars.
Although she tearfully stands by her man during the trial, she
divorces him three years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' is taken with its protagonist, a
woman who made a career of living out every single moment of her
life _ she is the most compelling character to apply makeup with a
spatula who ever stepped in front of a camera.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary goes through her life a like a series of amiable
flash cards. Anyone who saw her on ``The PTL Club'' or ``The 700
Club'' _ deep-fried exhibitionism at its most extreme _ probably
was transfixed by her exhausting spectacle. It's why all of the
attempts to parody the Bakkers never quite worked, because no one
captured them accurately. They weren't bland and polyester like the
Osmonds, the other squeaky-clean icons of the era. The good
old-fashioned poor-folk anguish that poured from the television
screen _ Messner erased her past face with an airbrush _ was an
all-new breed of extemporaneous biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tammy Faye,'' which will be shown Friday night and Sunday at
the New Directors/New Films festival at the Museum of Modern Art in
Manhattan, cries out for a little more analysis of its subject.
Instead, it joyfully wallows in the backdraft of her excesses,
trailing her as she visits a network to pitch a talk show in which
she would chat with teen-agers, aided by puppets, and shows off her
collection of dolls, all of which feature round cheeks and frozen
smiles frighteningly similar to her own.
</P>
<P>
   The directors, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, are awfully
quick to forgive Tammy Faye's lack of self-awareness, possibly
because she has a heart as big as her hair. She was one of the
first in the televangelist crowd to accept gay men with AIDS. The
movie makes a case for her because she's a survivor; it's more of a
mash note than a formal documentary, and there's nothing wrong with
that.

 &HT;    SEX, BAD LANGUAGE MORE PREVALENT IN PRIME TIME, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    With TV-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment
categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sexual content and offensive language are far more
common on prime-time television programs than they were a decade
ago, a media watchdog group reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings show that broadcasters have neglected their
responsibilities and violated the public trust by abandoning
minimum standards for content, said L. Brent Bozell, chairman of
Parents Television Council, the Virginia-based organization that
conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   The group studied the first four weeks of prime-time programming
in the 1989-90 and 1999-00 television seasons and recorded
instances of sexual content, foul language and violence.
</P>
<P>
   It found that on average, sexual content appeared more than
three times as often in the 1999-00 season.
</P>
<P>
   Oral sex, never mentioned during the four weeks of study in
1989, was alluded to 20 times in 1999, the study found.
Homosexuality was mentioned 24 times more than in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Foul language was heard more than four times as often as in
1989-90, while violent content actually declined slightly, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that UPN dethroned ABC as the raunchiest
network.
</P>
<P>
   Several UPN programs were aimed at children, the group said. For
example, the World Wrestling Federation Federation's ``Smackdown!''
aired by UPN, has one of the highest rates of offensive material,
making up more than 11 percent of the combined sex, cursing and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The program is viewed by an estimated 3 million children under
the age of 18, half of whom are between the ages of two and 11,
Bozell said.
</P>
<P>
   UPN officials did not respond to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress said such televised material was
contributing to the nation's moral decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we are in a time when more than a million
teens are having children each year,'' said Sen. Joe Lieberman,
D-Conn. ``I'm not blaming television, but television (executives)
too often portray sex as just a joke or as any casual form of
recreational behavior without consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said ``I think it is now time, with
studies like this, for the (Federal Communications Commission) and
Congress to step up and determine whether the public interest is
being met'' by television executives. He said an April 25
congressional hearing would address both the findings of the study
and the state of television.
</P>
<P>
   Television pioneer Steve Allen, who appeared at a news
conference releasing the report along with the senators, said,
``The time has come for these multibillion-dollar industries to
recognize that the values expressed in the programs they air and
sponsor are being perceived as their value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They must ask themselves, 'do they wish to be associated with
quality entertainment to be enjoyed by all, or do they wish to
increasingly be seen as marketers of vulgarity and violence?' `` he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said one solution for parents is to ``raise hell very
outspokenly.'' Bozell suggested that parents of the 48 percent of
American children who have television in their bedrooms remove
them.
</P>
<P>
   Bozell also suggested that parents boycott businesses that spent
$47.5 billion in 1998 to advertise on the networks.

ago, a media watchdog group reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings show that broadcasters have neglected their
responsibilities and violated the public trust by abandoning
minimum standards for content, said L. Brent Bozell, chairman of
Parents Television Council, the Virginia-based organization that
conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   The group studied the first four weeks of prime-time programming
in the 1989-90 and 1999-00 television seasons and recorded
instances of sexual content, foul language and violence.
</P>
<P>
   It found that on average, sexual content appeared more than
three times as often in the 1999-00 season.
</P>
<P>
   Oral sex, never mentioned during the four weeks of study in
1989, was alluded to 20 times in 1999, the study found.
Homosexuality was mentioned 24 times more than in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Foul language was heard more than four times as often as in
1989-90, while violent content actually declined slightly, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that UPN dethroned ABC as the raunchiest
network.
</P>
<P>
   Several UPN programs were aimed at children, the group said. For
example, the World Wrestling Federation Federation's ``Smackdown!''
aired by UPN, has one of the highest rates of offensive material,
making up more than 11 percent of the combined sex, cursing and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The program is viewed by an estimated 3 million children under
the age of 18, half of whom are between the ages of two and 11,
Bozell said.
</P>
<P>
   UPN officials did not respond to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress said such televised material was
contributing to the nation's moral decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we are in a time when more than a million
teens are having children each year,'' said Sen. Joe Lieberman,
D-Conn. ``I'm not blaming television, but television (executives)
too often portray sex as just a joke or as any casual form of
recreational behavior without consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said ``I think it is now time, with
studies like this, for the (Federal Communications Commission) and
Congress to step up and determine whether the public interest is
being met'' by television executives. He said an April 25
congressional hearing would address both the findings of the study
and the state of television.
</P>
<P>
   Television pioneer Steve Allen, who appeared at a news
conference releasing the report along with the senators, said,
``The time has come for these multibillion-dollar industries to
recognize that the values expressed in the programs they air and
sponsor are being perceived as their value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They must ask themselves, 'do they wish to be associated with
quality entertainment to be enjoyed by all, or do they wish to
increasingly be seen as marketers of vulgarity and violence?' `` he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said one solution for parents is to ``raise hell very
outspokenly.'' Bozell suggested that parents of the 48 percent of
American children who have television in their bedrooms remove
them.
</P>
<P>
   Bozell also suggested that parents boycott businesses that spent
$47.5 billion in 1998 to advertise on the networks.

`THE SKULLS': RAISE A TOAST TO DEAR OLD Y, WHERE THE NOSY GUYS ALL
DIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title ``The Skulls'' suggests a William Castle horror film
of the late 1950s, filmed perhaps in his patented Percepto process,
with giant death heads jumping out of the screen. But the only
supernatural element in this Rob Cohen film is the mysterious
vanishing university.
</P>
<P>
   Though the story is clearly set at Yale, home base of the secret
society Skull and Bones, that hallowed name is never mentioned.
Instead, the students seem to be attending a university called
``Y'' _ as the bright monograms on the blue-and-white jerseys worn
by the rowing team read _ which is said to be somewhere in New
England, though the Toronto skyline is occasionally visible in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   As movies like ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and ``The Ninth Gate'' have
been telling us for months, it turns out that the world is actually
controlled by groups of elderly oligarchs who like nothing more
than donning monks' robes, gathering in gothic mansions and patting
the backsides of high-priced prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls,'' which was written by John Pogue (``U.S.
Marshals'') returns to this territory, suggesting that Ivy League
secret societies are unspeakably evil hotbeds of cigar smoking,
Champagne and silly initiation rituals involving coffins. In their
spare time the members promote one another for high elective office
and cover up the occasional murder.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on this malevolent system is Luke McNamara (Joshua
Jackson, one of the reigning hunks of ``Dawson's Creek''), a
pre-law student at Y with an audience-friendly working-class
background. At first Luke is thrilled to be recruited as a member
of the Skulls because it will mean free law school tuition, a plump
bank account and a hot vintage convertible. But after his roommate
(Hill Harper) is killed while researching a college newspaper
article on the secret Skulls lair, he starts to experience some
moral qualms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls'' makes a few feints at exploiting the rumored
political connections of the real-world Skull and Bones society,
and there is a father-son team that dimly suggests the Bushes.
Litten Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson) is a prominent judge who hopes to
use his Skull connections to gain the Supreme Court; his son, Caleb
(Paul Walker), is a handsome, spineless wastrel who is assigned to
Luke as his Skull ``soul mate.'' Though Luke's blue-blooded
girlfriend, Chloe (Leslie Bibb), smells him out immediately with
her cute snub nose, it takes Luke some time to realize that Caleb
doesn't have his best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Adding an extra touch is William Petersen, fitted out with a
highly Clintonesque head of curly silver hair and playing a
honey-mouthed Southern senator with dreams of reforming the Skulls
into a socially responsible organization. Cohen does not provide an
Al Gore figure, though it's easy to imagine one visiting Y on a
weekend trip from H.
</P>
<P>
   In the end though ``The Skulls'' is less interested in politics
than in profitably flattering the suspicions and resentments of its
intended teen-age audience. For ``Ivy League Establishment,'' it is
enough simply to read ``parents.''

FORMER TEEN STAR JOHN CUSACK FINDS HIS OWN GROOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of the most indelible images of youth-oriented 1980s
movies: The summer after high school graduation, a forlorn-looking
young man stands in the humidity of a damp Seattle summer morn,
holding a boombox over his head as it blasts a melancholy serenade
of Peter Gabriel's ``In Your Eyes'' to the girl who had just broken
up with him.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1989's ``Say Anything ...,'' in which John Cusack
played Lloyd Dobler, an aspiring kickboxer whose pursuit of the
smartest girl in school resulted in one of the movies' most
realistic depictions of teen romance. Eleven years later, Cusack is
still plying women with music, this time in ``High Fidelity,''
opening this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the new movie, Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a list-obsessed
Chicago used-record store owner with women problems. The book is
based on a comic novel by Nick Hornby, and Cusack says that he can
relate ``100 percent'' to the lead character's fascinations and
frustrations. But then, he doesn't think he's alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people who read the book or see the movie can
say, `Oh, yeah, that's me. I'm Rob,' '' Cusack says during a phone
interview. ``Most of 'em can; they might not want to admit it, but
they all feel like they can relate to the character.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us can relate more than others. Rob's life is dominated
by pop music and record collecting (vinyl only, please), which he
encapsulates into lists such as Top Five Opening Tracks. Music is
so much a part of Rob's experience that at one point, he tries to
rearrange his album collection in autobiographical order _ by which
records apply to certain people in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack co-wrote the screenplay, faithfully adapting Hornby's
book and handling the first-person narration by having Rob
continually address the camera, as if in conversation with the
audience. The only major change the writers made was the setting,
which is switched from London to Cusack's hometown of Chicago.
Although the change of scenery removes a bit of the book's British
snottiness, Cusack says he doesn't think the location was
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that are most interesting about the book had
nothing to do with London,'' Cusack says. ``They had to do with
people's love affair with pop music, and how they use music
autobiographically, and they sort of live through the poetry of
other people to find themselves. And men's relationship to women,
and men's relationships to themselves _ all that sort of
male-confessional aspect to the book that made it a bestseller.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack is surprised to hear the movie described as offbeat,
although the loose plot and camera-addressing narration don't
exactly scream commerciality. But the movie does have a lot of
audience-friendly humor, and it's certainly less offbeat than some
of Cusack's recent work. The 33-year-old actor's major 1999
projects, the air-traffic-controller comedy-drama ``Pushing Tin''
and the surreal celebrity satire ``Being John Malkovich'' helped
boost the perception of Cusack as a risk-taker who avoids the
Hollywood mainstream. He enhances that image, perhaps
unintentionally, by staying rooted in Chicago, where he remains
active in theater as well as movies.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack wasn't always considered a maverick. He rose through
commercial movies such as 1983's ``Class,'' in which he made his
film debut, and John Hughes' ``Sixteen Candles.'' Yet even in the
'80s, Cusack was set off a bit from the Brat Pack, playing pining
but sensitive teen-agers in such comedies as ``The Sure Thing,''
``Better Off Dead'' and ``One Crazy Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Say Anything ...'' rolled around, he had attracted
the attention of such directors as ``Eight Men Out's'' John Sayles
and ``The Grifters''' Stephen Frears, who also directed ``High
Fidelity.'' Although he occasionally indulges in a highly
commercial project such as 1997's ``Con Air,'' he's more likely to
pop up in a Woody Allen movie or an ensemble project such as friend
Tim Robbins' ``Cradle Will Rock,'' movies that have kept him from
the TV destiny of most of his '80s peers.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's screen persona has a hyper side, but he sounded more
reserved in this interview. Perhaps because he prefers dark
clothing and a trademark trenchcoat, he has even been described as
brooding, which mystifies him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why people think I'm brooding,'' he says. ``Maybe
it's because when interviewers come to do me and they want to take
photographs, they're such silly photographs, I don't feel like I'm
in the mood. And maybe it's because I don't talk about certain
things in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``High Fidelity's'' open-book Rob, Cusack doesn't let on
much about his personal life. He's been linked with such actresses
as his ``Grosse Pointe Blank'' co-star Minnie Driver, who
coincidentally stars in an upcoming Chicago-filmed movie, ``Return
to Me.'' But he tends to be reticent about his personal life, which
has led writers to draw other conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say I'm private, but that's just because I don't talk
about everybody I date,'' Cusack says. ``And they think that means
I'm intensely private _ that means you're sane. So I don't really
understand any of that.''

THIS `ROAD' IS PAVED WITH FOOL'S GOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At one point during DreamWorks' new animated film ``The Road to
El Dorado,'' one of the heroes comments, ``This city is full of
suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the filmmakers had the same contempt for their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy storytelling, questionable racial politics and one of the
worst sets of songs Elton John and Tim Rice have ever cooked up
come together in a film that proves that all that glitters is not
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``El Dorado'' has any shortage of glitz. It's a
visually impressive picture with rich, colorful backdrops and nice
animated effects work, and the cartoon leads are good-looking, if a
bit too reminiscent of the wannabe-Disney school of character
design.
</P>
<P>
   But a pretty picture isn't necessarily a good picture, and it
doesn't take much digging to dull the film's shine.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh give voice to Tulio and Miguel,
a pair of Spanish con artists (with American and British accents,
no less) who find themselves unexpectedly ocean-bound for the New
World. With the help of an ill-gotten treasure map, the two set off
for the legendary city of gold, El Dorado.
</P>
<P>
   Following the map's various landmarks, they eventually arrive at
a dead end. But when a slinky native girl called Chel (Rosie Perez)
is captured in front of them by a group of hulking warriors, the
three are led to the magnificent golden city.
</P>
<P>
   Their odd dress, as well as their penchant for riding horseback,
inevitably leads to their being mistaken for gods, and when the
con-men duo gets a look at the kind of riches on hand, they're more
than happy to play the parts.
</P>
<P>
   Temple priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante) is eager to goad the
two into demanding human sacrifice, while the town's chief (Edward
James Olmos) would rather ply them with gifts and festivities.
Chel, on the other hand, just wants a piece of the action and is
willing to do just about anything to get it.
</P>
<P>
   As Tulio falls for Chel and Miguel falls for El Dorado, they get
lax in their godly demeanor, drawing the suspicion of Tzekel-Kan.
But when the priest's evil plans are thwarted by our heroes, he
finds an unlikely ally in the wicked explorer Cortez _ who's been
tracking the pair since they stowed away on his ship _ and decides
to lead his armies right to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Peppered throughout are a series of forgettable Elton John/Tim
Rice ditties that succeed neither as catchy pop songs nor as
effective story devices _ a cardinal sin in the cartoon musical
genre.
</P>
<P>
   When executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg was at Disney, he
built a reputation for being the mastermind behind the studio's
strong foundation of solid storytelling and the driving force
behind the success of ``The Little Mermaid,'' ``Beauty and the
Beast'' and ``The Lion King.'' With DreamWorks' first animated
feature, ``The Prince of Egypt,'' he went to great pains to ensure
that his fledgling studio's animated retelling of the story of
Exodus treated the subject matter with appropriate reverence.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened here? ``El Dorado's'' storyline pirates from
everything from ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' to ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark,'' and the film's slipshod approach to historical
accuracy and its rather queasy portrayal of native stereotypes has
already drawn an outcry from Mexican and Central American groups.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such criticism is written off as nitpicking or as an
attack on racism remains to be debated, but right now, ``The Road
to El Dorado's'' biggest crime is that it isn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Film: ``The Road to El Dorado''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 on a 1-5 scale
</P>
<P>
   Directors: Eric Bergeron, Don Paul
</P>
<P>
   Featuring: Voices of Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh
</P>
<P>
   Length: 83 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Rated: PG _ a brief skinny-dipping scene and sexual references
that might catch unsuspecting parents off-guard.

HOLLYWOOD TEEN SHANE WEST IS READY FOR GROWN-UP ROLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shane West is a 21-year-old who plays teen-agers, but he isn't
exactly what you'd call a teen star. His highest-profile role to
date is on an adult drama: He plays Eli, the popular but
academically troubled son of a single father on ABC's
divorce-romance series ``Once and Again.'' But unlike other actors
in his age group, such as WB stars Joshua Jackson, James Van Der
Beek and Sarah Michelle Gellar, West still lives a normal life.
Well, relatively normal, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird to watch the show and know that I got invited to
the Golden Globes and got to sit with the cast _ and to get
nominated, that's weird,'' West says during a Dallas stop. ``But
the show isn't exactly like a `Popular' or a `Roswell' or `Dawson's
Creek.' I don't think all the teen-agers watch this show, so I get
recognized more by adults.''
</P>
<P>
   West, sporting an incipient goatee that can't quite mask his
baby face, is in town to plug his new movie, ``Whatever It Takes,''
which is the highest-profile teen-oriented project he's done. But
again, ``high-profile'' is a relative term _ the movie, a comedy
very loosely inspired by ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' opened last Friday
to mostly withering reviews and tepid box office. Some critics even
indicated that this movie could signal an end to the teen-movie
craze of the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Whatever It Takes,'' West plays Ryan, a nice guy with a shy
streak and a major crush on the most popular girl in school (played
by Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). One of the school jocks (James Franco), aware
of Ryan's plight, offers him a deal: He'll help Ryan win the
popular girl if Ryan helps him score with Ryan's best buddy, the
equally noncomformist Maggie (Marla Sokoloff). Who really belongs
with whom is pretty obvious from the start, but West still enjoyed
the similarities between himself and Ryan _ and says he also shares
some traits with ``Once and Again's'' Eli.
</P>
<P>
   ``From sixth to 10th grade ... I was very shy; I didn't have
that many friends, I used to dream about being able to go out with
the most popular girl in school,'' he says. ``What happened in the
10th to 12th, I don't know _ I let my hair go, I stopped slicking
it to the side, (and) a senior just said she thought I was cute to
certain people, and you know how high school is, it spread like
wildfire. So the end of 10th grade to 12th grade I had, like,
joined the popular crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-screen, West isn't as concerned with popularity as with
having a steady career, and his acting goals have a Fort Worth
link: Cowtown native Bill Paxton, whom West often lists as his
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Paxton's been working for a long time, and his first big
role was in (1985's) `Weird Science,''' West says. ``I loved him in
that movie, and it was just somebody that I thought was a truly
interesting guy. So what I did was, I just started watching all the
movies he was in. And I was so happy for him ... that he finally
succeeded. Because he did so many movies and nobody knew about him,
or people always forget these great characters that he makes up.
And when he finally hit, I guess with `Apollo 13' giving them that
shot and then `Twister' and everything, I was just very happy for
him. So he's always been an inspiration for me, because it took me
2 1/2 years to get one part.''
</P>
<P>
   That part was in a Tom Hulce-directed LA stage production of
``The Cider House Rules,'' years before the movie. According to
West, the play was even more faithful to John Irving's book than
the Academy-Award nominated movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play was huge,'' West says. ``It was a two-nighter during
the week. And on Saturday and Sunday, it was like, all day. It was
like, the first half, then you go to lunch, do whatever you wanna
do, and come back later that day to finish the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   West has another thing in common with ``Whatever It Takes'''
Ryan: He's a musician. But Ryan's instrument of choice, accordion,
wouldn't necessarily fit into West's music of choice: punk. He says
his band, Average Joe _ which doesn't have anything recorded _ is
like Green Day or Blink 182, but a little bit more hard-core. Makes
sense for a guy whose musical taste is so old-school, most of his
favorite bands made their debuts before he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on the Clash and the Kinks and Zombies and Elvis
Costello, the Pretenders,'' he says. ``It's really hard to have my
friends listen to the Kinks, because no one can really get into
them now. At least, (people) my age can't.''

`THE ROAD TO EL DORADO': THEY'RE OFF ON THE (ANIMATED) ROAD TO EL
DORADO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beavis and Butt-head and Wayne and Garth and the crew from
``South Park'' have so thoroughly coarsened the comic buddy movie
that it comes as a slight shock when ``The Road to El Dorado''
hurtles us back six decades to the mild-mannered zaniness of the
Bing Crosby-Bob Hope ``road'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   Although those comedies, with their oblique inside references to
sex, drugs and other not so simple pleasures, weren't as innocent
as they appeared at the time, only those sophisticates with ears
sharpened to the wisecracks' finer nuances could discern a
subversive undertow. Most people were content to sit back and bask
in those goofy mock travelogues seasoned with topical jokes and
sight gags.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado,'' the new animated comedy from
DreamWorks, borrows its title, its wanderlust and its jokey
buddy-buddy tone from those Crosby-Hope treks into silliness, but
its dialogue is so innocuous that there's no subtext to speak of.
And where the Crosby-Hope romps into exotic climes flaunted a
benighted Yanks-among-savages attitude toward non-North Americans,
``The Road to El Dorado'' bends over backward not to offend. This
is a movie that wouldn't hurt a fly.
</P>
<P>
   In its nicey-nice way, it is so eager simply to entertain that
unlike other mainstream animated films, this one has no moral
lesson up its sleeve. Well, yes, maybe one: human sacrifice is
evil. Stretching things a bit, it also suggests that friendship
might matter more than wealth and that con men can also be noble.
</P>
<P>
   But basically ``The Road to El Dorado'' is little more than a
sanitized blend of nonsense and adventure and just a teeny bit of
romance, interspersed with the occasional pop song. Its half-dozen
musical numbers by Elton John (music) and Tim Rice (words) adhere
to the team's typically catchy pop shorthand: bluntly aggressive
tunes (trimmed with Spanish and South American inflections) and
clunky rhymes that any kindergartner could follow. The songs,
instead of advancing the story, are production numbers dropped into
the movie to brighten it up and provide the animators with gaudy
light-show and morphing opportunities. All but one are declaimed by
John.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie zips along, it has the feel of going on a
not-so-scary thrill ride at a children's amusement park. But that
ride, which takes the two main characters from a Spanish prison to
16th-century Mexico, is nothing if not scenic. If you can't afford
to go to Las Vegas to gawk at the city's theme-park version of the
Pyramids and other scaled-down imitations of the world's wonders,
``The Road to El Dorado'' might be just the ticket for you and your
family.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those pyramids, the movie's awesome sights belong
more to legend than to documented history. Imagine a 16th-century
Mexican Garden of Eden adorned with gleaming temples that resemble
tapering stacks of gold bricks and you'll have an idea of the
shimmer emanating from this lush never-never land.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, El Dorado, the gilded city of legend whose promise
of riches lured European conquistadors from Europe to South
America, is thought to have originated with the Chibcha Indians
(from Colombia) whose chieftains were rolled in gold, which was
then washed off in a sacred lake while offerings of emeralds and
gold were dumped into the water. Here, El Dorado is in Mexico,
where it becomes the destination of the Spanish conquistador
Hernando Cortes in 1519.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay includes no mention of Montezuma or of the Aztec
empire ravaged by the conquistador and his army. In visualizing El
Dorado, the design team came up with a pristine, brilliantly hued
pastiche of Mayan civilization and its ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Playing fast and loose with the myth, the movie portrays Cortes
(Jim Cummings) as an evil, granite-faced villain who is prevented
from conquering El Dorado (Cortes actually loses!) by the daring
and ingenuity of the film's cheeky antiheroes, Tulio (Kevin Kline)
and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh). Greedy con men who escape from the
brig of Cortes' Mexican-bound ship with the help of a crafty
warhorse named Altivo (Frank Welker), they are the perkiest little
crooks ever to set foot in an animated wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   The story, such as it is, finds Tulio, Miguel and Altivo
stumbling into El Dorado after narrowly escaping execution and
drowning. To their amazement, they find themselves greeted as gods
and decide to play along with their hosts' delusion. A convenient
volcanic eruption enhances their status. Heading the welcoming
committee is a treacherous high priest, Tzekel-Kan (Armand
Assante), an ardent devotee of human sacrifice who hopes to use the
visitors in his scheme to overthrow the chubby, good-natured tribal
chief (Edward James Olmos).
</P>
<P>
   Tulio and Miguel's most valuable ally is Chel (Rosie Perez), a
sassy, cynical native girl so bored with El Dorado that she is
itching to leave. Chel, who is steeped in tribal lore, advises the
two on how to keep their cover. This wised-up, tough-talking babe,
who strikes a hard bargain to ensure she gets her share of the
loot, is the movie's most original and engaging character and the
only one who seems remotely connected to today's youth culture.
</P>
<P>
   Tulio and Miguel, by contrast, remain remote figures. Although
they are supposed to be opposites (the lean, swarthy Tulio is the
practical one, and the blond, eye-batting Miguel a flighty,
romantic scatterbrain), Kline's and Branagh's too-similar,
too-polished deliveries make them sound like nearly identical peas
from the same pod. Their blandness is the movie's fatal flaw, one
no amount of animated opulence and fast-paced action can
camouflage.

`BLONDE': DARKENING THE DREAM GIRL'S NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Marilyn. During her short, nervous life, she was abandoned
by her father, her mother and countless men. Her marriages all
ended in divorce; and after numerous abortions, her efforts to have
a child ended in a miscarriage. Though she wanted, more than
anything, to be taken seriously as an actress, she was relentlessly
promoted by Hollywood as a bubble-headed bimbo: the quintessential
dumb blonde.
</P>
<P>
   Since her death at 36 in 1962, the exploitation has continued.
She has been commodified by sleaze merchants and deconstructed by
academics. Her life has been pawed over by conspiracy theorists and
sifted by scandal mongers; her image, appropriated by Madonna and
dissected by everyone from Norman Mailer to Gloria Steinem.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes along Joyce Carol Oates to turn Marilyn's life into
the book equivalent of a tacky television miniseries. In
``Blonde,'' she does to Monroe what she did to Edward M. Kennedy in
``Black Water,'' her embarrassing 1992 fictionalization of
Chappaquiddick, playing to readers' voyeuristic interest in a
real-life story while using the liberties of a novel to tart up the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has concocted bad, sentimental poems and attributed them
to Monroe, even invented books the actress supposedly read. Worse,
lovers, foster parents, suicide attempts and abortions have been
conflated, and some of the central people in her life have been
given new identities: her first husband, James Dougherty, has been
transformed into someone named Bucky Glazer; her acting mentor Lee
Strasberg into a Max Pearlman.
</P>
<P>
   Other players in Monroe's life have been given generic,
fairy-tale names: Joe DiMaggio becomes ``the Ex-Athlete''; Arthur
Miller, ``the Playwright''; President John F. Kennedy, ``the
Prince''; and his brother-in-law Peter Lawford, ``the President's
Pimp.'' As for Monroe herself, she is variously referred to as
``the Blond Actress,'' ``the Girl Upstairs,'' the ``Fair Princess''
and ``Golden Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt these nicknames are meant as a hedge against possible
lawsuits or charges of defamation, but they're also meant to lend
the novel the mythic power of fable. In practice, however, they
simply point up Oates' tendency, in these pages, to turn her
characters into stereotypes: predictable morality-play figures,
smelling of cardboard and paste.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the novel's men are made to play the role of faceless
authority figures: Daddy substitutes who try to stage-manage the
actress' life. Such controlling men, of course, figure prominently
in the author's earlier fiction, and in this novel Monroe, too,
conforms to a familiar Oatesian pattern. Like Enid in ``You Must
Remember This'' and Ingrid in ``Man Crazy,'' she is another
strangely passive girl whose emotional neediness makes her a magnet
for destruction, a love-starved survivor of a dysfunctional
childhood in thrall to the specter of an unavailable man.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the earlier portions of ``Blonde,'' where Oates is
describing the young Norma Jeane's coming of age, are the most
persuasive part of this book: she depicts the fatherless girl _ who
would end up in an orphanage after her emotionally unstable mother
was hospitalized _ much the way she has depicted so many of her
more successfully realized heroines, filling in the melodramatic
arc of their stories with myriad psychological and domestic
details.
</P>
<P>
   When Norma Jeane Baker becomes the Marilyn Monroe we know from
movies and news accounts, however, a note of crude voyeurism creeps
into the book's narration, and we begin to wonder just how much
Oates has made up for the mercenary purpose of sensationalizing her
story.
</P>
<P>
   Was President Kennedy's cruel rejection of the actress after a
New York liaison really the catalyst for her accelerating slide
into despair, as Oates suggests? Did the Ex-Athlete really strike
Monroe, as Oates writes? Did Monroe really have a longstanding
menage a trois with Charlie Chaplin Jr. and Edward G. Robinson Jr.,
as Oates describes?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the reader is even made to consider such questions
underscores the smarmy tone of the second half of this book. Oates
gives us pages and pages in which she imagines the graphic sexual
details of Monroe's relationship with lovers like President
Kennedy, and pages and pages of the sort of heavy-breathing,
romance-novel prose one would think beneath a writer of her
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has Monroe thinking that ``her womb was poisoned, &AMP; her
soul'': ``She knew she did not deserve life as others deserve life
&AMP; though she had tried, she had failed to justify her life; yet
must continue to try, for her heart was hopeful, she meant to be
good!'' She has President Kennedy tell the actress that she's
``alive to be touched'': ``To be breathed on like a flame. Alive to
be hurt, even!'' And she has the Playwright thinking that Monroe's
love ``could justify his existence as a playwright and as a man, or
it could destroy him.''
</P>
<P>
   These clumsy attempts to channel her characters' most intimate
thoughts, like her embroidering of already melodramatic events,
cannot help but remind the reader of how shamelessly Oates is using
the life of Marilyn Monroe as a substitute for inventing an
original story, how shamelessly she is trying to cash in on her
subject's status as a legend. Though ``Blonde'' purports to reveal
``the inner, poetic, and spiritual life'' of the actress, it turns
out to be just the latest effort to exploit the tragedy and fame of
Marilyn Monroe.

`PRICE OF GLORY': SPARRING WITH DAD, IN AN OUT OF THE RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If observed life could be translated literally into art, the
world's museums, libraries and film archives would overflow with
classics.
</P>
<P>
   But gifted transmutation is required, and that element is
missing from ``Price of Glory,'' a film about a father's frustrated
dream and the havoc it wreaks on its family, all set against a
background of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by a feature-film novice, Carlos Avila, and written by
Phil Berger, who formerly covered boxing for The New York Times,
``Price of Glory'' aspires to float like a butterfly, sting like a
bee.
</P>
<P>
   Though clearly rooted in observed behavior of the monomaniacal
parents to be found venting their fury under the cover of love not
only around boxing rings but also around tennis courts, ice skating
rinks and baseball diamonds, ``Price of Glory'' plods when it
should dance and throws roundhouse rights when a crisp jab would
snap the viewer to attention. Not particularly well acted, it
overstays its welcome and proves simultaneously predictable as a
sports film and unconvincing as family drama.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Smits, out of ``L.A. Law'' and ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' stands
in one corner of the conflict in ``Price of Glory,'' and his
family, three boys and a loving wife, Rita, in the other.
</P>
<P>
   As Arturo Ortega, father and husband, he holds down a galling
but unseen assembly-line job, lives in an Arizona town on the
Mexican border and still seethes with the memory of his promising
boxing career, destroyed when he was overmatched by a traitorous
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo is determined to live out his dream of a championship
through his little boys Jimmy and Sonny. His youngest, Johnny,
seems focused on a future in football, and his wife, Rita (Maria
Del Mar), would like to see the boys go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy (as an adult played by Clifton Collins Jr.) and Sonny (Jon
Seda) have talent, but the surprise turns out to be Johnny (Ernesto
Hernandez), pressed into the ring in a Silver Gloves competition as
a peewee to substitute for a child who has come down with hives.
</P>
<P>
   As the years pass, Johnny turns out to be the gym rat with hands
of stone and a will to win who shares his father's singleminded
vision. Jimmy, no matter how hard he tries or how often he wins,
can never seem to earn Arturo's praise; and Sonny, who plans on
marriage to Mariella Cruz (Danielle Camastra), a teacher, is led to
understand in no uncertain terms that Arturo views domesticity as
an impediment to a championship.
</P>
<P>
   In its blunt way, ``Price of Glory'' makes clear that the
psychological toll on these two boys is more punishing than any
blows they may suffer in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   But intent on popular entertainment, the film is determined that
a chastened Arturo, who is not evil though seriously misguided,
will have a reward after all his tantrums, trophy tossings and
other lavish displays of dissatisfaction with his children.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of this tale are Ron Perlman as Nick Everson,
the polished big-time promoter who controls access to the boastful
undefeated champion Davey Lane (Louis Mandylor) and a few goons.
</P>
<P>
   When the proud, mistrustful Arturo crosses Everson, the stage is
set for bloody conflict both in and out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   In films, as in the ring, heart and will without exceptional
talent don't produce winners.

WITH APOLOGIES TO HIGH-SCHOOL DRAMA CLUBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a topsy-turvy pop-culture world when Aaron Sorkin, a guy
responsible for some pretty good movies, produces a quality
political drama (''The West Wing'') for TV while Rod Lurie, a film
critic who no doubt has weighed in on Sorkin's work, brings to
theaters a lame political drama called ``Deterrence,'' which
resembles an episode of ``The West Wing'' as produced by a
high-school drama club.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, that's not fair. Apologies to high-school drama clubs
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deterrence'' takes place in 2007, immediately providing us
with the news that none of this year's presidential candidates made
it to a second term. Instead, the much-loved 2004 electee has died,
leaving Vice President Walter Emerson (Kevin Pollak) in charge.
During a blizzard, Emerson, who is running for election, and his
entourage take refuge in a snowbound Colorado diner just in time to
hear the news that Iraq has invaded Kuwait _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson quickly considers dropping the big one on Baghdad, an
idea that sparks immediate second thoughts from his two top
advisers (Timothy Hutton and Sheryl Lee Ralph), as well as
engendering opinions from the motley group inside the diner. The
most left-field (although not left-wing) of these comes from a
working guy named Ralph (Sean Astin), who teaches the president a
lesson in racial epithets even as stunned African-American advisers
stand by _ never mind the fact that Lurie has provided no
indication of Ralph's racist thinking.
</P>
<P>
   But that's within the nature of his pompous script and haphazard
directing. The first mistake was casting the smirking Pollak _ who
looks like the lost Belushi brother _ as someone who gets elected
to office. You'd think a guy like Lurie, who has TV experience,
could execute this better. Instead, he adds his name to a list of
American critics-cum-filmmakers who should've stuck to their day
jobs.

 &HT;    UNCLE SAM'S BOOKKEEPING STILL UNRELIABLE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only 13 of the federal government's 24 major
agencies have won a clean bill of health from auditors for their
1999 financial statements, Congress will be told on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the total included one more success than last year, the
results fell short of the Clinton administration's goal to have at
least 18 agencies with ``clean'' audits for the annual consolidated
financial statement.
</P>
<P>
   The federal report, only the third ever, is an attempt to match
the annual reports corporations give their shareholders. The
government's statement is scheduled to be released Friday before a
House Government Reform subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problem areas cited by agency auditors:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Defense Department, the single biggest offender, lacks
documentation to verify almost $120 billion in military equipment
and property. The Pentagon also pays out millions of dollars
without proper bookkeeping. In a test of 345 transactions, the
Defense Finance and Accounting Service, based in Columbus, Ohio,
could not provide backup information for $149 million payments.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reported
paying $935 million in excessive rent subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare disbursed $13.5 billion in overpayments for
fee-for-service health care, an increase of $1 billion over the
previous annual report. The errors represented 8 percent of the
annual $170 billion fee-for-service program and ranged ``from
inadvertent mistakes to outright fraud and abuse,'' said the
inspector general's report for the Health and Human Services
Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Internal Revenue Service reported sending a $15,000 refund
to a person who owed $350,000 in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are some bright spots in the 1999 financial reports as
well. For example, the departments of Justice, Transportation,
Veterans Affairs, as well as Health and Human Services, all won
statements from their auditors that their books were reliable.
</P>
<P>
   However, since many of the agencies are repeat offenders in
sloppy bookkeeping practices, the government seemed headed for yet
another bad report card from Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of
the House Government Reform's management subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Horn gave half of the agencies a grade of ``F'' and
most of the rest a ``D.'' This year he will add a category for the
entire federal government. Horn offered little hope that the
government would make the dean's list. He said Thursday that he saw
``early indications of the enormity of the government's accounting
problems'' in the 1999 reports.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.,
took aim at HUD, which last year succeeded in providing an approved
accounting but fell backwards this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think that financial management is an issue that
doesn't affect ordinary people,'' he said. ``But at HUD and other
agencies, poor financial management means that crooks are stealing
from the government, and people that need these funds are going
without.''

   If I had seen Bob Hoskins play Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
earlier, I would have paid a lot more attention to the American
invasion of Panama. Also to the Medellin drug cartel of Colombia
and to Central American politics in general.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Noriega, who is now serving a 30-year sentence
(recently reduced from 40) in a federal prison, was not _ as one
journalist recently suggested _ ``just another banana republic
dictator.'' He was and is a character stranger than fiction, at
least as depicted in ``Noriega: God's Favorite,'' which has its
premiere on Showtime on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on Lawrence Wright's book ``God's Favorite,''
which he classifies as a novel, although it is based largely on
interviews and published journalistic accounts. The producers of
the film stand by everything in the script but the inner thoughts
of the people involved, which had to be inferred.
</P>
<P>
   Hoskins' Noriega is a vegetarian and a Roman Catholic turned
Buddhist who dabbles in voodoo. He is a rabid opponent of cigarette
smoking and a cold-blooded murderer whose sexual tastes draw him to
his loyal middle-aged wife, his loyal young mistress, shapely
prostitutes, equally shapely flight attendants and the (male) pilot
of his official plane, Panama One.
</P>
<P>
   Tony is a chronic acne sufferer who flies to Switzerland for
treatment and finds time while he's there to visit his money (piles
of cash and gold bars) and to oust the Panamanian president by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Noriega's relationship with the United States, which was a
notoriously friendly one for a long time, is represented by his
references to George Bush as an old friend and by Richard Masur's
character, an American political type named Mark. Just Mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that you're one of the good guys: an anti-Communist
Democrat,'' Masur's character tells the general, but ``well, the
American public sees you as a little pizza-faced fascist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord knows how they got that impression,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   David Marshall Grant does a nice turn as a young American drug
dealer who wants to do business with the general. Noriega has
something to say. ``The problem is not in Colombia,'' he tells
Grant. ``The problem is not in Panama. It is in your soul. There is
something wrong in the soul of the gringo, and it needs cocaine,
heroin, marijuana, LSD, crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant answers, deadpan, that he's only a businessman, not a
philosopher, and presents a large briefcase full of money.
Noriega's face breaks into a beaming smile. ``Panama welcomes
you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Noriega is a man who finds himself the victim of a coup at one
point, asks for a few moments alone to pray before he is taken away
and manages to turn the situation around with a single
surreptitious telephone call (not to God). No wonder he tells a
priest, in confession, ``I found I did have supernatural powers.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States sends Jimmy Carter to monitor the Panamanian
elections, but the vote doesn't go in the direction Noriega wants.
So he simply sends out soldiers to shoot up the places where
ballots are being counted and announces that his candidate has won.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went the general's way until the bloody United States
invasion of Panama in 1989. He went on trial in 1991 in Miami and
was convicted of drug trafficking, money laundering and
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the savvy director Roger Spottiswoode _ whose
credits range from the James Bond film ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' to
HBO's underrated AIDS epic ``And the Band Played On'' _ to find
both the complicated human drama and the humor in this story. Lots
of humor.

&HT;     JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OKS SAN FRANCISCO NEWSPAPER DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: PRECEDE San Francisco; new throughout)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department gave the go-ahead Thursday
for the Hearst Corporation to acquire the San Francisco Chronicle
and sell the Hearst-owned San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The decision removed a major obstacle to the transaction that
was announced last August when the family that owned Chronicle
agreed to sell to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hearst said it would try to sell The Examiner,
published in the afternoon. If a buyer weren't found, Hearst said
it would merge the newspaper with the Chronicle and publish a
single newspaper, named the San Francisco Chronicle, in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Because both newspapers are partners in a 1965 joint operating
agreement administered by the Justice Department as an exception to
federal antitrust laws, the department had to give its approval to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department approval came after Hearst agreed to sell The
Examiner to members of the Fang family, publishers of the
thrice-weekly free newspaper, The Independent. The department
announcement said the sale of the Examiner ``has resolved the
department's antitrust concerns relating'' to Hearst's plan to buy
the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Hearst has agreed to provide the
Fangs with a $66 million subsidy over three years to publish the
Examiner as a morning paper. The Fangs agreed to purchase The
Examiner's name, archives, subscriber list, examiner.com Web site,
computers, office furniture, delivery trucks and newsracks. The
staff, buildings and printing presses were not included.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, publisher of The Independent, has said The Examiner
would publish as a daily newspaper sold through home subscriptions
and newsracks. After a four-month transition period, Fang said he
plans to switch the Examiner into the morning field and compete
directly with the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Joel I. Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, said the sale of the Examiner means that ``For
the first time in 35 years, San Francisco will have two independent
daily papers. Consumers, such as advertisers and readers, will
obtain the benefits of full competition between the two daily
morning papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in San Francisco
was weighing a request by Clint Reilly to block the deal on the
basis that the Fang-owned Examiner would not have sufficient
resources to survive in a battle against the Hearst-owned
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's suit contends that the purchase of the Chronicle would
result in higher advertising and subscription rates and thus harm
consumers. It also claims the purchase would violate federal
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has denied those contentions and argued that the
transaction would boost competition between newspapers in Bay Area
suburbs and between electronic media. Gary Halling, Hearst's
lawyer, has asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has argued that it would cost far more for the Fangs to
publish The Examiner as a viable competitor to Hearst's Chronicle _
as much as $250 million over five years. He has called the Fang
deal a ``sham'' designed to destroy The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But Halling's brief for Hearst said, ``In fact, the transaction
is structured to provide incentives to continue The Examiner's
business. Hearst is only reimbursing actual expenses incurred in
publishing The Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs' profits increase with revenue from The Examiner, and
the newspaper's ultimate success depends on market forces, Halling
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle has a daily circulation of 464,535 and is Northern
California's largest paper. The Examiner's daily circulation is
108,968.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1965 joint operating agreement, both the Examiner and
the Chronicle were allowed to combine business operations while
keeping independent news staffs.

`GLORY' GETS TANGLED IN THE ROPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C+   
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second Hollywood boxing movie of the new century, ``Price of
Glory,'' is considerably better than the first: the abysmal, Ron
Shelton ring comedy, ``Play It to the Bone.'' But, granted, that's
not saying much.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite believable performances from a large cast, some
nail-biting fight scenes and a handful of touching moments, it
fails to be either a coherent sports drama or the kind of epic
family tragedy it wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Arturo Ortega (Jimmy Smits), a gifted
Hispanic-American boxer from an Arizona border town whose dreams of
glory are cut short when he's mismatched with a much better fighter
and pummeled into hamburger in the film's 1977 prologue.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 13 years later, and Arturo is now an assembly line worker
who has tried to transfer his dreams to his three very young sons,
and spends all of his spare time coaching them (often abusively) in
the state Silver Gloves competition _ the ultimate little league
father.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 10 more years later, and Arthur now has three budding
champions on his hands: Sonny (Jon Seda), the responsible oldest;
Jimmy (Clifton Collins Jr.), the weak-willed middle child; and
Johnny (Ernesto Hernandez), who Arturo at first wanted to keep out
of the family business but ends up being the most adept at it.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Isn't this the exact paradigm of ``The
Godfather'' _ right down to the name of the oldest son? Yes, it
sure is, and that classic echoes throughout this film, especially
in Smits' performance as an ethnic family patriarch who wants the
best of his boys, but brings them something else.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, ``Price of Glory'' has some flavor and a core of
authenticity: its script was written by ex-journalist Phil Berger,
who covered boxing for the New York Times for seven years; and
director Carlos Avila brings the Hispanic-American milieu to life
without the usual stream of Hollywood cliches.
</P>
<P>
   But, somehow, the elements don't quite click; Smits' one-note
performance never generates the kind of interest or sympathy that
makes us want to stay with him through his long ordeal, and when
the film suddenly turns into ``Rocky'' _ as all boxing films of the
last two decades invariably do _ it totally invalidates its theme.
</P>
<P>
   Price of Glory. Directed by Carlos Avila. Written by Phil
Berger. Cast: Jimmy Smits, Jon Seda, Clifton Collins Jr., Maria Del
Mar, Ernesto Hernandez. New Line Cinema. 113 minutes. Rated PG-13
for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+

 11th INNING GLAND SLAM BY MINORS-BOUND AGBAYANI GIVES METS A SPLIT(jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ By the second night of Major League Baseball's excursion
to Japan, things were so normal that the game itself reverted to
the usual fare of Bobby Valentine's managerial etiquette and
incipient feuds, to say nothing of Benny Agbayani's announcing loud
and clear that he really ought to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   The brief experiment in exporting North American baseball like a
traveling rock show ended with Agbayani clobbering a grand-slam
homer in the 11th inning to give the Mets a 5-1 victory over the
Cubs, who had won the first game in the series Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani knows he is due to be demoted to the minor leagues as
soon as the Mets need to activate Glendon Rusch to be their fifth
starter, probably within a week. He has not been thrilled with the
prospect, since he showed considerable power as a part-time starter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   He showed more of it Thursday, drilling a homer over the
406-foot sign in deep center, to send all the hard-working Japanese
businessmen home for a few hours of sleep before they begin their
grueling jobs in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The split series will count in the standings. What will also
remain, aside from the good will generated by the Japanese hosts
and the players _ who generally got it _ was the itchy relationship
between managers Valentine and Don Baylor of the Cubs. That little
tempest in a pot of green tea will have legs when the Mets and Cubs
meet again in the States later this season.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor had been pretty much hacked off Wednesday night by
Valentine's protest of an irregularity on the lineup card. Baylor
had written Jeff Reed's name twice as a reserve and omitted Jeff
Huson's name, and Valentine decided that could mean the Cubs were
using an ineligible player. It was merely a slip of the hand, and
Valentine soon admitted ``there is no protest,'' but in the
meantime, he had introduced an American-style litigious note in
front of a bemused Japanese audience, which was not used to such
arcane maneuverings.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor cogitated on it overnight, and decided he was still
hacked off nearly 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have done it, just out of respect for the guy on
the mound,'' Baylor said Thursday night, defending his pitcher,
Rick Aguilera. ``Aguilera has over 200 saves in the major leagues.
You keep him standing out there trying to distract him. For me, it
was pretty much nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, it was mostly straight baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored first off Kyle Farnsworth in the fifth on walks
to Todd Zeile and Rey Ordonez, a sacrifice bunt by Rick Reed and a
solid sacrifice fly to center by Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs tied the game in the fifth after a walk to Joe Girardi.
Farnsworth put down a bunt to the right of Zeile, who has been
converted to first base this season, an experiment still very much
in progress. Zeile turned to his right and heaved the ball wide of
second base, sending Girardi to third on the error. Girardi scored
on an infield double play.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed pitched eight innings for the Mets, giving up four
hits and the one unearned run. Both teams went deep into their
bullpens, which they could afford to do because they did not have
another game until their stateside openers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A bemused laugh went around the ball park at the end of nine
innings when the announcement was made in Japanese that the game
would be played to its conclusion. In the Central League here, all
games must stop after 15 innings if tied, and in the Pacific League
the limit is 12 innings, presumably so the fans can catch public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs worked up a rally in the 10th against Turk Wendell on a
walk, a sacrifice and an out. Most of the 55,000 fans were still
around, and began clapping in anticipation of a Sosa home run.
Instead, Valentine had Wendell walked Sosa intentionally, touching
off a chorus of boos louder than the ones the night before for two
Sosa walks, a more raucous sound than usual for the the normal
Japanese baseball crowds. Dennis Cook came in and walked the
left-handed Mark Grace but caught Henry Rodriguez, also
left-handed, on a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th, Zeile hit a single with two outs, Ordonez and
Melvin Mora walked, and Agbayani whacked the grand-slam shot. He
will be flying back to New York with the Mets anyway, but he might
force them to cancel any flight reservations they might be making
for him to the minor leagues.

A DARKLY FUNNY, WILD RIDE THROUGH A TANGLE OF DYSFUNCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iben Hjejle, who plays John Cusack's long-suffering, bemused,
off-and-on girlfriend in the new ``High Fidelity,'' also shows up
this week in a vastly different film from Denmark, her native
country. In ``Mifune,'' Hjejle gives an eye-opening, four-barrelled
performance as a hooker with a heart of pyrite, who finds herself
cast into the roles of housekeeper, sister, mother figure and
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The variety is apropos to a movie that's largely about
role-playing. ``Mifune'' gets its title from the late Japanese
actor Toshiro Mifune, star of such Akira Kurosawa films as ``The
Seven Samurai.'' ``Mifune's'' protagonist, Kresten (Anders W.
Berthelsen), often pretends to be Mifune when he needs to calm his
mentally challenged brother Rud (Jesper Asholt).
</P>
<P>
   Kresten hasn't had to do this for about 10 years, though,
because he's made a life for himself as a successful businessman in
Copenhagen and just married his boss's daughter, without revealing
to anyone his impoverished rural roots. But when Kresten, after a
night of honeymoon bliss, receives word that his father has died,
he returns to the family farm to wrap up matters and take care of
his brother. He also hires Hjejle's Liva, a prostitute on the run
from an angry client and a persistent obscene phone caller, as his
housekeeper, in all innocence of her real career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mifune's'' primary plot is predictable, but it hangs a lot of
surprises on its formula story line, and director Soren
Kragh-Jacobsen steers it from ribald comedy (this isn't for prudes)
to sudden violence to slapstick without losing his grip. The movie
is from the Danish collective Dogma 95, a group of iconoclastic
filmmakers who follow 10 strict rules, the most familiar of which
is that no artificial lighting must be used in filming. Considering
the strength of Mifune's story and characters, the rules come off
as more of a gimmick, although the natural lighting does make for
some astounding shots. But the stunt filmmaking isn't necessary; in
any light, Mifune is a darkly funny, wild ride through a tangle of
dysfunction.

&HT;     HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST LOBBIES ON CHINA TRADE BILL)  
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, April 2)  &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND   
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As armies of lobbyists for businesses, agriculture
and Silicon Valley press Congress to approve permanent trading
rights for China, a lone human rights activist is urging lawmakers
to grant the trading rights only if China improves its human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington lobbyist for Human Rights
Watch, a private New York City-based research group, says China
must be encouraged to ``go beyond opening its markets, to opening
its jails, easing restrictions on the press and the Internet, and
protecting the rights of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to this year's State Department survey of human rights
around the world, China has tightened controls on basic freedoms
since 1998, jailing pro-Democracy activists, arresting labor
organizers and tax protesters. The Chinese government also has
banned the Falun Gong, a spiritual meditation movement with
thousands of followers, arresting more than 35,000 of its members
and burning its books and videotapes. China also has required all
corporate Internet users in Shanghai to register with police.
</P>
<P>
   Jendrezejczyk, in an interview, said Congress should require
China to ratify two United Nations human rights treaties
guaranteeing freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right
to organize trade unions, among other rights, before approving
permanent normal trading relations, referred to in Congress as
``PNTR.'' The president would be required to certify that China is
honoring those rights before Congress would grant PNTR, according
to this proposal.
</P>
<P>
   He wants China to dismantle its ``reeducation through labor''
camps, which force thousands of citizens into camps for up to three
years without judicial review. He wants Tibet and Xinjiang, where
large ethnic minority populations are routinely persecuted, to be
open to the foreign press and human rights monitors. And he wants
Congress to pass a code of conduct that would spell out human
rights principles for U.S. companies in China, such as urging them
to stop using prison labor and halt political indoctrination
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Jendrzejczyk, 50, an intense, high-energy, 10-year veteran of
Human Rights Watch who was formerly with Amnesty International,
acknowledges there is no quick fix to any of these problems.
</P>
<P>
   But he says the United States, which carries considerable clout
as the biggest market for Chinese goods, ``needs to develop a
careful strategy that combines carrots and sticks'' to pressure
China to stop squashing human rights. He is critical of the Clinton
administration, saying President Clinton has ``no real strategy''
on improving human rights in China and ``tends to be driven by
crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Jendrzejczyk says if Congress acts in the next few months, China
would have time to make the human rights improvements before China
is accepted into the World Trade Organization, which is expected at
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a good chance of making human rights prominent
in the China-WTO debate,'' Jendrzejczyk said. ``But whether China
makes any real progress on human rights will largely depend on how
much pressure the White House and Congress exert on Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders and President Clinton are pushing Congress to
grant PNTR to China, which would give the United States greater
access to China's markets as part of China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, the 135-member group that regulates
international trade.
</P>
<P>
   China is subject to the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a 1974 law that
limits the trading privileges the United States can grant countries
that Congress judges to be suppressing their own people. The law
allows an annual waiver if Congress and the administration agree
that it would substantially promote the law's goals for encouraging
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   China has been granted a waiver each year since 1980, though
some lawmakers have used the yearly vote to voice their disapproval
of China's human rights record, its posture toward Taiwan, or its
trade surplus with the United States. While U.S. labor leaders
oppose PNTR with China, Jendrzejczyk merely wants to make it
conditional on improvements in China's human rights record. PNTR is
accorded to all U.S. trading partners except for a few countries
that don't have trade agreements with the United States, such as
Cuba, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Laos, North Korea, Serbia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Jendrzejczyk said the United States should not isolate China or
cut them off from trade. ``I don't think that would help,'' he
said. ``We intend to pressure China to become a government that
fundamentally respects rights.'' He says better trade relations
with China can help advance human rights ``only if it is combined
with effective sustained pressure on China to respect civil and
political rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The House, which is expected to vote before the end of May, is
sharply divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. David Dreier, R-Calif., chairman of the House Rules
Committee, and Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., are urging their
colleagues to vote for the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the most important thing we can do is expand
trade,'' Dreier said. ``For the first time we will be prying open a
market with 1.3 billion consumers. That's a winner for U.S. workers
and businesses.'' Dreier said economic reforms would help bring
about change and be ``a winner for a repressive society.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsui, a longtime free-trader who is rounding up Democratic
votes for the China trade bill, warns that loading the legislation
down with too many human rights demands could sink it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have so many things in there that it blows the whole
thing up,'' Matsui said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., takes a tougher stance than does
Jendrzejczyk.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi praises him as ``a very informed and politically astute
advocate for human rights'' but criticizes his position for failing
to include an annual review of China's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Without that, she says, the United States would lose its
leverage on human rights or violations of the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no credibility when it comes to honoring their
agreements,'' Pelosi said. ``I don't believe we should give PNTR on
the basis of broken promises. They have broken promises on market
access, use of prison labor and intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, which will follow the House in considering the China
trade bill, is likely to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., says a trade bill defeat
``simply kicks American businesses in the derriere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe human rights is improved by isolating a
country tradewise,'' Feinstein said. ``We're in a global trading
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul David Wellstone, D-Minn., is in the minority with his
view that Congress must retain its annual review of China to
protect human rights. Without that, ``we won't have any leverage
and we'll continue to see the same brutal picture'' on human rights
issues, Wellstone said.

   KOSOVO-CONGRESS (Washington) _ After two days of often rancorous
debate, the House on Thursday approved a $12.6 billion spending
bill that commits the United States to help train and equip
Colombia's security forces, which are battling drug traffickers and
leftist guerrillas. Lawmakers, by a vote of 263-146, approved the
emergency aid package, which also includes money for the Pentagon
to pay for the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, and for disaster
relief in the Carolinas. By Eric Schmitt.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ In most countries, an election can
mark the end of political struggle. In Russia this year, the
victory of Vladimir Putin in last Sunday's presidential election
has only intensified the infighting between various groups vying
for seats in the new government and influence in the new court.
Much of the attention is focused on an opulent Moscow building
known as Aleksandr House, the home of a privately financed think
tank set up last December by Putin when he was still prime minister
to devise a program of legal and economic reforms. Many of those on
the Aleksandr House team are refugees from President Boris
Yeltsin's first reform government of 1991, and they are ready to do
battle with tycoons like Boris A. Berezovsky, the financier who
exerted great sway in the latter years of Yeltsin's rule, for the
country's future. By Celestine Bohlen.

bureaucrats and politicians, who would be empowered and gain

impossible. Now, in settlement talks with the government, the
company has offered to do just that. But one possible reason for
the change of heart, some experts say, is that it doesn't really
matter anymore. Trial evidence showed that Microsoft built its
browser into Windows as a tactic to disadvantage its chief
competitor, Netscape. But the browser war is over; Microsoft won.

WALL STREET FINDS PITFALLS IN PRIVATIZING CHINESE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Wall Street's top-drawer investment firms are
falling all over each other to take China's state-owned companies
public. After the furor unleashed by the latest deal, they may
wonder whether it is worth the grief.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. set the price Thursday for its initial
public offering of PetroChina Co., China's dominant oil and gas
producer. At 1.28 Hong Kong dollars a share, or about 16.45 cents,
it is at the low end of the company's predicted range. That will
hardly soothe the architects of the deal, who spent months putting
it together only to see it ripped apart by critics ranging from
Republican lawmakers to Tibetan monks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PetroChina offering has been a very complex and grueling
process,'' said Paul Shapira, a managing director at Goldman Sachs,
at a news conference here last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When PetroChina's bosses traveled to the United States on March
20 to sell the offering, they faced repeated charges of
human-rights and labor abuses. Critics said the listing would lead
to 1 million layoffs at PetroChina's parent company, China National
Petroleum. They also said the company was exploiting people in
Tibet and abetting an outlaw regime in Sudan through a joint
venture there.
</P>
<P>
   Not content just to criticize, the AFL-CIO organized a shadow
road show in New York and other cities to persuade investors to
steer clear of PetroChina. Fund managers in Hong Kong said Thursday
that the campaign had an impact _ scaring off some American funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political concerns have been a major overhang,'' said a
fund manager, who like most people interviewed for this article
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Not that many Asia-Pacific funds
invest in oil and gas companies, so you need demand in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   PetroChina's bumpy ride has far-reaching implications for
China's campaign to overhaul its sclerotic corporate sector. As
part of that effort, Beijing hopes to sell shares in dozens of huge
state-owned companies, including Sinopec, the second-largest oil
company; China National Overseas Oil, the No. 1 offshore oil
company; and China Unicom, the No. 2 telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   With PetroChina limping into the market, however, the prospects
for these other deals are now cloudier. The AFL-CIO, emboldened by
its success, said it planned to go after future Chinese stock
offerings that it feels are bad investments or represent companies
that violate human rights and labor practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is that there is going to be 120 of these
IPOs coming out of China,'' said Richard Trumka, the
secretary-general of the AFL-CIO. ``On ethical issues and
shareholder governance issues, most of these are going to be just
as bad as PetroChina.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such criticism, PetroChina may feel vindicated
that it was still able to raise about $3 billion from the offering,
which values the company at roughly $30 billion. China National
Petroleum will retain a 90 percent stake and will appoint the
entire board, including the two independent directors.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of PetroChina begin trading on April 6 in New York and on
April 7 in Hong Kong. In New York, they will trade as American
depository receipts that represent 100 shares, or $16.45 at the
price set in Hong Kong Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   China National Petroleum had initially hoped to raise $5 billion
or even $7 billion. To meet even the more modest goal, Goldman was
forced to round up strategic investors to soak up the shares. BP
Amoco agreed to buy 20 percent of the offering, or as much as $1
billion, while three politically friendly property developers in
Hong Kong agreed to chip in another $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's performance was also tainted by an unauthorized e-mail
that four of the firm's salespeople sent to 83 clients. Because the
note contained claims that the firm feared may have violated
securities laws, Goldman tried desperately to recall it. Later, on
the advice of lawyers, it took the extraordinary step of reprinting
the e-mail _ and correcting portions of it _ in the prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly was a mistake,'' Shapira said tersely at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The disputes surrounding PetroChina obscure the fact that it is,
in many respects, a trail-blazing deal for China. The company has
instituted an incentive plan for its top 300 managers, tying as
much as 75 percent of their compensation to profit targets. That is
unheard of among state-owned companies in China, which only
recently began paying attention to profits, let alone the role of
managers in producing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a world-scale oil and gas company, and the flagship of
China's reform,'' said Ma Fucai, the chairman of PetroChina, in the
news conference in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Because China National Petroleum is a classic state-owned
enterprise _ with a vast network of hospitals and schools in
addition to oil and gas operations _ the company decided to carve
out its most valuable assets and place them in a separate venture,
PetroChina.
</P>
<P>
   By doing that, the company also removed the burden of its
bloated payroll from PetroChina. The new public company will retain
480,000 employees, while the remaining 1 million workers will stay
at China National Petroleum, where most are likely to be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   These layoffs were a main reason that the AFL-CIO decided to
oppose the deal. But the labor federation also warned that the
proceeds from the stock offering could be siphoned off by the
parent, where they could contribute indirectly to its activities in
Tibet or the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire wall they created between PetroChina and CNPC is
illusory at best,'' Trumka said, ``so money will find its way back
into the parent company.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's prospectus, 90 percent of the
proceeds will be used by PetroChina to pay off debt and finance
capital expenditures. The remaining 10 percent will go to China
National Petroleum to reduce debt and pay for employee severance
and retraining. Ma said the company had hired outside auditors to
guarantee that the money would not be used for any other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ma tried to distance PetroChina from its parent's activities in
Sudan. China National Petroleum is an investor, along with
Malaysian and Canadian companies, in a pipeline there. ``PetroChina
does not have any overseas assets and operations,'' he said. ``We
do not have any plans to expand overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Even aside from questions about Sudan, PetroChina has been hurt
because it is indisputably an old-fashioned company. At a time when
investors are bewitched by technology stocks, PetroChina's
discussion of benchmark crude prices does not send hearts
fluttering _ even though the company has proven oil reserves of
10.3 billion barrels, making it the world's fourth-largest publicly
listed oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Given the low price of its shares, analysts said PetroChina may
prove a shrewd investment. For its labors, Goldman Sachs also gets
a high fee. The firm can expect to split a payment of 3 percent to
4 percent of the offering, or about $90 million, with the other
underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   2 Chinese Oil Companies to Merge
</P>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's second- and fourth-largest oil
companies will merge by order of the government, the companies said
Thursday. The move will make China New Star Petroleum, the
country's fourth-largest producer, a subsidiary of China
Petrochemical, or Sinopec, the country's second-largest oil
company. The combination is expected to reinforce Sinopec's
strength in oil and gas exploration as the company prepares for a
global public offering of its shares. Sinopec plans to list on the
Hong Kong, New York and London stock exchanges by the end of June.
China National Petroleum Corp. remains the country's largest
producer.

 &HT;    FLOOD AID STILL IN DOUBT DESPITE HOUSE PASSAGE
 &HT;    520&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than $300 million in flood aid for victims of
Hurricane Floyd is stuck in Congress, despite a House vote Thursday
to approve the money.
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies in a $12.6 billion emergency spending package
for the current fiscal year that includes the disaster relief.
Senate Republicans say the bill is bloated and that Congress should
deal with much of the spending _ including flood relief _ as part
of the normal appropriations process for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina lawmakers, however, said they remain optimistic
the emergency aid package will pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just arriving here in the Senate. ... Give us time,''
said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C.
``There is always more than one way to skin a cat around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Briggs said that Edwards and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., are
``working hand in glove on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate concerns about the bill have nothing to do with the
disaster relief, but with other spending items, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency package includes $2.1 billion for peacekeeping
operations in Kosovo and $1.7 billion for drug intervention in
Colombia. The Colombia issue dominated the two-day House debate,
where critics warned against U.S. involvement in Colombia's bloody
civil war and expressed concerns about human rights violations and
drug trafficking by military and paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C., said he is ``very pleased'' that the
House approved the hurricane aid. He said he hoped that North
Carolina's senators ``will protect what we have gotten in this
bill'' to help flood victims, ``and I believe they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., criticized GOP
leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., on
Thursday for not focusing on passage of the supplemental spending
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important,'' he said. ``Instead of dealing with flags,
Elian Gonzalez, and (the) gas tax, we ought to be dealing with the
real problems affecting real people. It's drug abuse. It's our
morale in our armed forces and it's currently a disastrous
situation in North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-day House debate rarely focused on flood-ravaged areas,
where scores of victims remain in temporary housing.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of a temporary trailer park in Greenville, N.C., who
identified herself as only as Nebraska said Congress should pass
the bill, regardless of the their concerns about the foreign
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody needs some money, I need some money. I ain't got
nowhere to go when I leave here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of her neighbors, Diane Moore, said that the senators and
representatives, ``with all those degrees behind 'em,'' should be
able to figure out a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Hines, also living in a temporary trailer park in
Greenville, said Congress should look homeward, and Colombia should
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should take care of people in their own
country,'' Hines said. ``There's a lot of people suffering right
now who need help that can't get help.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   During the House debate, North Carolina lawmakers asked their
colleagues to remember flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the widow or the widower who lost a life partner
in the flood waters. ... Think about the farmers ... who are
struggling to repair their fields, their barns, their equipment.
... Think about the thousands of families who are in cramped travel
trailers,'' said Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency package includes $43 million to repair
flood-damaged highways and bridges, $12 million for a new Armed
Forces Reserve Center in Greenville, and $1.5 million for a U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers study on raising the dike on the Tar River
in the historic town of Princeville, in Edgecombe County.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ $81 million to forgive loans from the federal Commodity Credit
Corp. on flood-damaged tobacco, cotton and peanut crops.
</P>
<P>
   _ $77 million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to buy
out homes in the 100-year flood plain. The majority _ $68 million _
would be used to buy homes in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   _ $6 million for North Carolina fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   _ $500, 000 for rural firefighters in North Carolina.

</HEADLINE>

   Next month a large and fine item indeed lands among assorted
good little foreign films to be released on tape and disc. In 1988
the Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski produced a series of 10
one-hour films, called ``The Decalogue,'' for television.
</P>
<P>
   A year later they were shown at the Venice Film Festival, and
then in 1996 at Lincoln Center in New York, the year Kieslowski
died at 54. Other than that, what many critics consider a
masterpiece has been screened infrequently and has never appeared
on video.
</P>
<P>
   On April 11, the series will be released on five cassettes from
Facets Multimedia, the Chicago distributor. (Information:
800-331-6197).
</P>
<P>
   The delay can be described simply: ``Frozen in Canada,'' said
Milos Stehlik, director of Facets. He added that the rights were
not in the tangle they often are in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``North American rights were owned by a Canadian company that
sat on it for a very long time,'' Stehlik said. ``Now, after nine
years, they decided to let go, license it and do a video release.''
</P>
<P>
   Best known in this country for ``The Double Life of Veronique''
(1992) and the ``Three Colors'' trilogy, ``Blue'' (1993), ``White''
and ``Red'' (both 1994), Kieslowski made documentaries and feature
films for television earlier in his career.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 installments of ``The Decalogue'' are set in a huge
Warsaw apartment complex. Each story is rooted in one of the Ten
Commandments, but as in his films Kieslowski can't be pinned down
to literal meanings and traditional concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Moral and ethical issues are under consideration, but the
commandments take unexpected turns. For example, in Decalogue 4
(``Honor Thy Father and Mother''), an actress adores the parent she
lives with, but the relationship goes in another direction when she
discovers that he is not really her father. ``I simply wanted to
show that life is complicated,'' Kieslowski said of ``The
Decalogue,'' ``nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the foreign niche will get three worthwhile if more
modest additions from Steeplechase Entertainment, a new California
distributor named for an old Brooklyn racetrack. In ``Love Is the
Devil,'' Derek Jacobi stars as the troubled and often very nasty
British painter Francis Bacon, who died in 1992 but has been in the
news this month when lawyers for his estate sued his gallery,
Marlborough International, charging fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi gives a convincing performance, but the most intriguing
aspect of the film is its look. Denied the use of Bacon's work, the
director, John Maybury, used light, shadow, reflection and other
optical tools to make the entire film resemble a Bacon painting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another Steeplechase release, ``Voyage to the Beginning of
the World,'' Marcello Mastroianni, in his last film, stars as an
88-year-old Portuguese-French director touring the countryside with
three younger colleagues. The third title, ``Dry Cleaning,'' about
a staid French couple who enter new sexual territory, is by Anne
Fontaine, one of France's emerging female directors.
</P>
<P>
   All three films are also on DVD, a format whose low production
costs sometimes encourage small films as much as large ones. &QL;

and its teen-age queen, Amidala (Natalie Portman), have been
overrun by the giant Trade Federation, ruled by the electrostatic
presence called Darth Sidious. Later, on the planet of Tatooine,
two Jedi knights (Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor) turn up the more
familiar Darth (Vader) as a child space-chariot driver (Jake
Lloyd), in a film that, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
``sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a
swashbuckling extragalactic getaway.''

   Playing sentimental hardball, the stiffly noble pitcher Billy
Chapel (Kevin Costner) ends his glorious 19-year career in front of
56,000 fans in Yankee Stadium. Darned if he doesn't have a
no-hitter going, too, even if that tired arm of his causes a
grimace or two. Seeming as suited for Mount Rushmore as the Hall of
Fame, Billy reveres the game, going back to the days when he first
threw in the back yard with his tall, noble dad. But don't tell it
to Jane (Kelly Preston), whose frustration with Billy has her
headed for London in a film that, despite a talented lineup,
``produces unexceptional results'' (Lawrence Van Gelder). &QL;

Orleans. Well, get used to it because here she is: blond and rangy
and trading on all her good rapport with the French who believe
that she is sent by God to help them drive the English back across
the Channel. As Joan, Milla Jovavich is bristling, grimy and a
trifle too maniacal for refined spiritual tasks in a film of
``jarring, hand-held carnage interspersed with religious visions
straight out of music video'' (Maslin). &QL;

   In Michael Cristofer's film, four women and four men in their
20s convene in Los Angeles to bare their views on sex. Saying that
she has been raped by a professional football player (Jerry
O'Connell), an actress (Tara Reid) shows up at the apartment of her
friend (Amanda Peet), a clerk in the district attorney's office.
One of the men plays pornography on his office computer and another
urinates on a closed toilet. Cristofer won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize
for his play ``The Shadow Box.'' Here he seems ``more focused on
surface than true revelation'' (Lawrence Van Gelder). &QL;

   FELA KUTI: ``Shakara/Fela's London Scene'' (MCA). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a foreign musician who didn't have a serious audience
stronghold in the United States during his life, MCA's reissue
program of Fela Anikulapo Kuti's 1970s and '80s records _ there
will be 10 CDs by the end of the year _ borders on extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   This, the first of the CD reissues, combines two early 1970s
records by Nigeria 70, which is what the Nigerian band leader
called his ensemble after returning from a nine-month American stay
in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Fela absorbed James Brown wholesale _ the scrubbed rhythm guitar
over drum patterns, the intermittent horn-section bursts, the
leader's hectoring vocal cries as he directed the band to change
rhythm, ushered in choirs, played keyboards. But there is more to
it than that. This music stays with single ideas even longer than
Brown's most truculent stretches, and Fela's intensity is broader:
the music was a political platform as well as an emotional one.
</P>
<P>
   The percussion, the seat of both men's music, is entirely
different: some of the funkiest sections of Fela's long tunes like
``Who're You'' and ``Fight to Finish'' rely on combinations of Tony
Allen's waxing-and-waning drum kit patterns and an array of
shakers, congas and tapped wood and metal. (Making the cultural
exchange come back around, Brown, who visited Lagos in 1970,
borrowed from Fela in return, as examined in Michael Veal's
forthcoming book, ``Fela: The Life and Times of an African Musical
Icon.'')
</P>
<P>
   A word for Allen, the band director during this period of Fela's
career: he can't be beat. Everything he does here is spread out,
spacious, an inversion of tight, popping American funk patterns. On
these records he uses toms as American funk drummers used cymbals
and vice versa, and the incredible drama in the space between the
music's slithering quiet moments and its climaxes is due in large
part to his great skill.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has a great new record, ``Black Voices'' (Comet), and will
play a rare New York show with his band Afrobeat 2000 on Wednesday
at the Knitting Factory in New York. &QL;

SCANDINAVIAN DEALER SELLS HIS TREASURES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Denmark)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sotheby's sale of the Arne Schlesch collection next
week marks the passing of an era. Schlesch, 77, has sold his
five-story Scandinavian antiques gallery on East 64th Street,
consigned its contents to Sotheby's and retired to Copenhagen.
``There's a limit to how long you can go on buying chandeliers and
chairs,'' he said. ``I made my hobby into a lucrative business. I
was thrilled to buy things, especially from families I knew. It was
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He was fun too. A native of Denmark, Schlesch said he was
descended ``on both sides'' from Charlemagne (742-814). ``I am not
a snob,'' he insisted. ``I simply belong to an old family.''
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Schlesch gallery was like walking into a grand
townhouse in Copenhagen in the 18th century. Beneath the Russian
chandeliers (never electrified), a grand Danish rococo elm settee
with gilded decorations would be paired with a pair of George
II-style carved consoles whose bases were muscular golden eagles.
Huge mirrors reflected the fire roaring in the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesch would offer guests sherry. He always sat in the same
chair, a Danish neoclassical giltwood wing chair, upholstered in
buttery leather with a reclining backrest. This chair, lot 414 in
Sotheby's sale on Wednesday, is an 18th-century precursor to the
La-Z-Boy. In theory everything in Schlesch's gallery was always for
sale, but he would sometimes refuse to part with things, like that
chair. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his New York gallery in 1965 with a Mexican partner,
Jose Juarez Garza. Early on the shop attracted tastemakers like
Babe Paley and Anne Getty. The decorators soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hail, a San Francisco interior designer who is also Danish,
was an early client. ``Arne Schlesch was the one who started the
whole fascination with Scandinavian style,'' he said. Craig Wright,
a Los Angeles designer and a client for 25 years, called it ``this
special Baltic taste,'' adding: ``He bought Scandinavian furniture
that was very sculptural, so it blended well with French and
Italian pieces. It was always very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The 434 lots include 18th and 19th-century porcelain from
Denmark, Vienna and China; 18th-century cobalt-blue Russian glass,
Scandinavian mirrors, Dutch rococo silver wall sconces, Danish
silver and a great deal of Baltic wood furniture.
</P>
<P>
   To American eyes, the most unusual piece will probably be lot
311, a rare German rococo blue tilt-top tripod table. Its top is
entirely covered in beadwork. Carefully sewn glass beads depict a
formal garden outside a country manor. There are walled sections
with a fountain, a pair of topiary trees in the form of pyramids
and checkerboard flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   Mary F. Cunningham, a Sotheby's specialist in European
furniture, is trying to identify the site. ``We don't know if it's
a real house or a fictional one,'' she said, ``but a nearly
identical tabletop is in the Stadtischen Museum in Brunswick,
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham describes beadwork from Brunswick as one of the 18th
century's great arts. The beadwork for this table is attributed to
Johann Michael van Selow, who worked under royal patronage at a
Brunswick factory that existed from 1755 to 1772.
</P>
<P>
   Glass beads do not fade, so the palette is faithful to the time:
chartreuse green, acid yellow, bright blue and red. Such beadwork
is fragile but protects the table from watermarks. The estimate is
$25,000 to $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   The top of another mid-18th-century rococo table in the sale is
inlaid with ceramic tiles from the Kellinghusen factory in
Schleswig-Holstein, a part of modern Germany that was then held by
the king of Denmark. The dark lavender and white tiles are
decorated with star and geometric motifs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purple was not a common color at that time,'' Cunningham
pointed out. ``Such tiles are usually blue.'' The table has
cabriole legs painted purple and white to complement the tiles. It
is a typical Schlesch piece: charming, elegant, yet relaxed enough
for a country house or city apartment. Its estimate is $12,000 to
$18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesch was known for his magnificent chandeliers. ``He had the
greatest selection of chandeliers and mirrors in the United
States,'' Wright said. Lot 432 is a Russian neo-classical six-light
chandelier that was never electrified. Its stem has three ormolu
mounted, baluster-shaped cobalt blue glass balls that reflect
candlelight, as do the faceted crystal drops hanging from a
hexagonal crown at the top and from a larger hexagonal tier on the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The candle nozzles are joined by delicate swags of pierced
bronze in a cross-hatched pattern. ``It probably has its original
bronzing,'' Schlesch said. ``We can tell by the quality of the
bronzes it was probably made in the St. Petersburg workshop of
Johann Zech, a German who was called there by Catherine the Great.
There's a similar one in Pavlosk Palace outside St. Petersburg.''
The estimate is $30,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 433 is an equally fine Russian chandelier with 12 lights and
three cobalt glass balls. Beneath its pinecone finial is a crown of
arching golden wires that each end in a crystal pendant. The candle
holders on the base are interspersed with faceted glass obelisks
and the drip pans are pierced. It has not been electrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York decorator Rose Cummings once owned it,''
Cunningham said. ``Arne coveted it for years, until she finally
sold it to him.'' Estimate: $30,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 361 is a German rococo console in white and gold whose apron
is a piece of gold-and-white Frankenthaler porcelain. Its gilt
monogram, C.T., is for Carl Theodore, Elector of Palatinate
(1742-1799), in Bavaria. It is simply dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 283 is a pair of German rococo silver and gilded metal
mirrors from the mid-18th-century. The silvered metal mounts in the
frame are in the shape of shells, waves and foliage. ``They are
very rare,'' Schlesch said. ``I've only seen one other pair for
sale, at the Biennale fair in Paris.'' Estimate: $40,000 to
$60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although some characterize Schlesch's taste as aristocratic, he
disagrees. ``I don't have rich taste,'' he said. ``I don't know
what taste is. I despise decoration. I like things that look as
though they were inherited. I had things from every era and country
_ Danish, French, English, Irish, Swedish, Norwegian, even Turkish.
I had the things you'd expect to find in a manor house in Denmark
or Sweden. They were chosen because they were rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Harrison, a partner in the Manhattan antiques shop H.M.
Luther, put it this way: ``Arne Schlesch has got the quality that
makes dealers interesting: a real individual point of view. It's
like a collector's sensibility. One thing the auction houses will
never have is a point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to learn more about one of his specialties, a
daylong seminar, ``The Decorative Arts From Denmark and Sweden,
1720-1820,'' is to be held on Monday at Sotheby's Institute of Art.

`HIGH FIDELITY' HITS ALL THE RIGHT NOTES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Corrects title of earlier movie to read Gross Pointe Blank) 
(Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3{ stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening moments of John Cusack's wonderfully acerbic new
comedy,``High Fidelity,'' Cusack's character, Rob, muses that there
are thousands of songs about misery and he wonders: Do I listen to
pop music because I'm miserable or am I miserable because I listen
to pop music?
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of question the self-obsessed Rob specializes in,
precisely because there's no easy answer. All the better: He can
torture himself for days while searching for the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Music, love and misery are insightfully intertwined in this
quirky comedy about a record store owner who sifts through his past
relationships to discover why women are always dumping him. Rob's
latest loss is Laura (Iben Hjejle), who has just left him for
living his obsessions. Rob baits her, saying she doesn't even make
his top-five list of painful break-ups. After Laura leaves, though,
he compiles a top-five list of reasons he misses her.
</P>
<P>
   Rob, as you can see, is big on lists. He owns a barely
functioning record store in Chicago where he spends his days with
his two clerks _ shy softy Dick (Todd Louiso) and the loud,
opinionated Barry (Jack Black) _ rattling off lists of musical
minutiae while serving or belittling the occasional customer who
manages to find the store. (Sample list: Top Five Songs For Letting
the Person Who Dumped You Know That Even Though They Broke Your
Heart You Can't Get Over Them).
</P>
<P>
   Rob can't get over Laura, particularly after he learns she has
taken up with a pompous, pony-tailed blowhard (Tim Robbins in a
hilarious cameo). Now, Laura is on Rob's break-up list (she's No. 5
with a bullet). A glutton for punishment, Rob tracks down the other
women on the list to find out why ``he's doomed to be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack and his ``Gross Pointe Blank'' writing partners D.V.
DeVincentis and Steve Pink (along with Scott Rosenberg) have done a
brilliant job in bringing Nick Hornby's painfully wry 1995 novel to
the screen. The setting has seamlessly shifted from London to
Chicago, but that's the only change of substance. Rob's
angst-ridden monologues (Cusack spends much of the movie directly
addressing the camera) remain, as do all of his very real character
flaws. There are reasons women are wary of this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' sports one of the best supporting casts you'll
ever find in a movie. Lili Taylor, Lisa Bonet, Joelle Carter and
Natasha Gregson Wagner dazzle as the women in Rob's life, and
Catherine Zeta-Jones steals several scenes as the ex-girlfriend Rob
knew was always out of his league. Joan Cusack plays Laura's best
friend with fetching candor, and Danish actress Hjejle grounds the
movie with genuine grace.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all are Louiso and Black, Laurel and Hardy teammates who
invest their characters with a touching authenticity that goes well
beyond the sort of cartoonish portrayals we usually get from comic
sidekicks. Such depth is this movie's strength, and Stephen Frears'
solid, simple direction allows these satisfying details and
characterizations to come to the fore. ``High Fidelity'' heads my
list of best movies we've seen so far this year. &QL;

 &HT;    Atkins' age-defying diet less a weight-loss guide, more a
lifestyle change
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dr. Robert Atkins is back with a new
revolt. His previous ``Diet Revolution,'' first published in 1973,
was a bestseller and shot him to fame. But his unconventional
premise of a diet where you could eat steak and eggs, but no bread,
was soundly rejected by the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   His new book, ``Dr. Atkins' Age-Defying Diet Revolution,'' has
doctors talking again, but this time, some of them are nodding in
agreement, Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say he's moving to mainstream, nor embracing
popular nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is that the doctors can't ignore what they're
seeing, and that's their patients, who went on my diet, and lost
weight and had no adverse reactions. In fact, they were healthier
in most cases than when they began,'' he said in a recent interview
while visiting for a speech at Lynn University in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The new book focuses on using diet to promote longer lives
without the damaging effects of aging, Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Foods containing antioxidants, such as green, leafy vegetables
and bright fruits, are a major part of the diet. But it also gives
followers free rein with fat and protein. That's where mainstream
medicine and Atkins part ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Atkins, a licensed physician who practices at the
Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine in New York, is listed as
a quack by Dr. Stephen Barrett. Barrett publishes a newsletter and
maintains a Web site (www.quackwatch.com) to expose unsupported
medical claims. Dr. Robert Eckel, chairman of the American Heart
Association's Nutrition Committee, said, ``There are many concerns
with Atkins' diet. But the main one is that his diet is high in
saturated fats and cholesterol. Dieters can eat as much cheese,
butter and meats as they wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturated fats are connected to heart disease, Eckel said,
citing several medical studies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a point Atkins disputes, and he cites other recent
published studies that show no correlation between dietary
cholesterol and high blood cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   Eckel acknowledged that many dieters have shown success with the
Atkins diet, but long-term health problems with a low-carbohydrate,
high-saturated-fat diet haven't been studied. There's no evidence,
he said, to show that it's healthful over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   But Atkins points to what he calls the failure of current
medical theory on weight loss and disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Centers for Disease Control released the study last year
that showed Americans are at an all-time high for obesity,'' he
said. ``Yet they're all supposedly eating less fat than ever before
_ it doesn't take a scientist or a doctor to figure out you don't
lose weight by restricting fat.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says things are slowly changing, and even the medical
community is beginning to look again at what he calls the myths of
nutrition. ``No country in the world has been so criminally misled
about nutrition as the United States.'' Greedy health care
providers and politically connected food manufacturers are to
blame, he said. ``Who would it benefit least if Americans got
healthy? Doctors. And who do you think some of the biggest
lobbyists are in Washington? Cereal manufacturers, the sugar
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites studies and journal articles by respected physicians
who back up his theory, but says there is no formal research on his
diet because he can't afford it. ``I'm a practicing physician.
We're hoping to establish a research fund,'' he said, but ``it's
not in the best interest of all those food manufacturers who have
made a killing selling the low-fat plan to Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes on other old and new opponents in the new book. The
American Heart Association, a frequent target of the past, comes
under attack for endorsing such nutritionally empty foods as Count
Chocula and Froot Loop cereals and low-fat Pop Tarts. He said the
USDA should be particularly embarrassed by its Food Pyramid, and
the way it's translated to the nutrition labels on foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a listing on the label for percentage of recommended
allowances for carbohydrates. There is no such thing as a
recommended allowance of carbohydrates! We do not need these in the
diet. Essential amino and essential fatty acids _ that's it. That's
all we need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a big shift from all his other writings, Atkins includes
complex carbs as part of the age-defying diet. He's quick to point
out, however, the difference between complex carbs and the much
more prevalent simple ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complex carbohydrates are nuts, whole good grains, fruits and
certain vegetables. Quality carbohydrates that are nutrient dense
and beneficial in other ways as well _ fiber and other nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to think of bread, pasta and white rice as complex
carbohydrates, when instead, they are so processed, the body thinks
of them as simple carbohydrates and treats them just like sugar,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to provide a line of foods that help the low-carb
dieter pick foods that are on the diet.
</P>
<P>
   The new book is more of a lifetime diet than a weight-loss
guide. He recommends exercise, using organic foods and eliminating
as many toxins from our food, air and water as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can reverse diseases, and certainly prevent them,'' he
said. ``And most of it can be done by diet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``in order to practice the age-defying diet,
you have first defy conventional wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago, he said, he dedicated himself to opposing the
American Medical Association by practicing what he calls
``complementary medicine _ I use medicine and natural and
alternative medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``But diet is key.''

JEWISH HISTORY FROM HOES TO A LADY LIBERTY MENORAH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GRACE GLUECK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The saga of Jewish civilization over some 4,000 years
is no small matter to tackle in a visual presentation. But the
Jewish Museum at Fifth Avenue and 92d Street has not flinched from
efforts to make the story viewer-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   When the museum reopened in 1993 after extensive renovations,
one of its chief presentations was an ambitious permanent
exhibition, ``Culture and Continuity: The Jewish Journey.''
Occupying two floors, it traces Judaism from 1200 BCE to the
present with graphics, photographs, maps, texts and objects taken
largely from the museum's collection, bolstered by loans.
</P>
<P>
   Over time some parts began to look a little dated. So, to
enhance and streamline the exhibition, the museum has embarked on a
two-stage reinstallation. The first stage, dealing with the ancient
world and the early Diaspora, has opened on the fourth floor. The
second stage, which continues the story to the present, is to be
completed by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Compressing thousands of years of a civilization into a magazine
layout with sound, so to speak, is not the ideal educational
approach. But despite cramped quarters, the exhibition effectively
displays a sampling of the collection's 28,000 objects while
providing a capsule introduction to Judaism. What is now on view,
in the first and in part of the second of the exhibition's four
major divisions, is a more sophisticated presentation with a less
cluttered format and it is easier to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in objects, including additional works from the
collection and the use of video monitors to show a spectrum of
material not exhibited, provide a more varied arrangement. The
galleries and showcases have been redesigned with new lighting and
better-placed texts to emphasize the highlights of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Simplified maps, timelines and documentary photomurals
strengthen the viewer's sense of where and when. And there is more
emphasis on the global nature of the Jewish experience. However, a
few objects are replicas or _ as with a case of Torah scrolls from
the 18th to 20th centuries _ later examples of unobtainable earlier
objects. Help in exploring the show is provided by random-access
audio guides that allow listeners to hear explanations in any order
they choose.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, as the briefest of briefings on Jewish history and
culture, this presentation is an improvement. It was organized by
two members of the museum staff, Fred Wasserman, director of
curatorial administration, and Dr. Susan L. Braunstein, curator of
archaeology and Judaica.
</P>
<P>
   To begin, visitors walk through two rooms of introductory
material that focus on what has kept Jews together for so long.
Four simple stone plinths, each engraved with a biblical quotation,
suggest basic explanations: a unifying tradition founded on a
covenant with God, the shared ordeal of exile in Egypt, acceptance
of a code of laws based on divine revelation, and the promise of
the land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes ``Forging an Identity: 1200 BCE-640 CE,'' the first
of the exhibition's four divisions. It covers the transition of
Israelites into Jews. The Israelites lived on their own land, were
led by kings and priests and worshiped through animal sacrifice.
Because of the Diaspora they became Jews, stateless people under
foreign rule throughout the ancient world, who turned to worship
through prayer and Bible study with the guidance of rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Farming _ the cultivation of olives, wheat, dates, barley, sheep
and goats _ occupied most early Israelites. One exhibit, set
against a photomural of the green Judean hills, shows primitive
implements like hoes, pickaxes, plow points and storage jugs, some
dating to 2,000 BCE.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby display devoted to sacrifices and offerings includes
one of the show's highlights: a small but assertive terra cotta
female figurine with hands on hips and ample breasts (600-700 BCE).
Some scholars consider her a representation of Asherah, the
possible mate of God.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting artifacts in the exhibition are from the
Diaspora, after the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem in 586 BCE and the
destruction of the Temple built by Solomon some 400 years earlier.
These events brought about the exile of the ruling class of Judah,
one of the two Israelite nations, and forced many of its citizens
into slavery. Scattered to other lands, the Israelites became
culturally integrated into their new communities while trying to
keep their traditional ways. (Later, liberated by Cyrus, the
Persian king who conquered Babylonia in 538 BCE, many returned to
Israel and rebuilt the Temple.)
</P>
<P>
   A rare object from the Jewish community of Rome, established in
the second century BCE, is glass from the fourth century, the
circular bottom of a bottle, with a Jewish burial inscription in
Greek and Hebrew commemorating a mother and a daughter. Also
depicting ceremonial objects _ a shofar and a menorah _ the glass
was probably set into the wall of a catacomb, the customary form of
Jewish burial at the time.
</P>
<P>
   That Israelites lived with the gods of their new rulers is seen
in several artifacts from Beit Shean, a city in central Israel that
accepted Greek rule in the second century BCE and was renamed
Scythopolis. One is a huge carved marble toe from a colossal cult
statue taken from a temple honoring Dionysius or Astarte, the
Phoenician goddesses of fertility. It is displayed with a stone
helmet of Castor or Pollux, the sons of Zeus, from the Isis Temple
in Samaria (third century BCE).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Forced to worship in exile without the Temple and its tradition
of animal sacrifices performed by an elite priesthood, the Diaspora
exiles turned to personal prayer and study of the Torah, the first
five books of the Bible. Despite the rebuilding of the Temple in
516 BCE, they eventually established synagogues as less lofty
communal centers for this new form of worship, which became the
primary distinction between the Israelite religion and Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   A one-third-scale replica (with several original ceiling tiles)
of the third-century Dura-Europos Synagogue, from a Euphrates River
frontier fort in what is now Syria, shows wall frescoes depicting
biblical scenes. When first discovered in 1932 the frescoes caused
a shock because they contradicted the widespread belief that the
ancient Jewish religion forbade figurative art. Pagan imagery is
even evident in the ceiling tiles, one depicting Demeter, Greek
goddess of fertility. But rabbinic discussions at the time
indicated that pagan symbols could be used as decoration if they
were not objects of worship.
</P>
<P>
   The periodic uprisings of Jews against their conquerors is
illustrated by the disastrous rebellion of 66-70 against the
Romans, which again brought about Jerusalem's destruction, along
with that of the Second Temple. The event illustrated by a massive
foundation stone of the fortification wall that the Romans
breached. A photomural of a detail from the Arch of Titus, built in
Rome as a further commemoration of the victory, depicts soldiers
carrying off a menorah and other Temple property to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The show segues at about this point into ``Interpreting a
Tradition,'' the second section of the four-part exhibition, still
only partly completed. It's a lot more vivacious. Meant to convey
the vitality and diversity of Jewish life in the Diaspora, it draws
on objects and photographs from all over the world, including
enlarged photographs of a cross section of Jews, among them an
Arizona pioneer, Charles Strauss, and his young son, dressed as
rifle-packing cowboys (circa 1880).
</P>
<P>
   A quote (1781) from the Irish political philosopher Edmund
Burke, ``From the east to the west, from one end of the world to
the other, (Jews) are scattered and connected,'' introduces a
wonderful display of objects, from the silver sugar bowl of an 1861
breakfast set given to a Baltimore rabbi by his congregation, to an
18th-century Chinese figurine of a ``semitic merchant'' in glazed
terra cotta from the Tang dynasty. Monitors show photographs of
many other items.
</P>
<P>
   But the piece de resistance is a huge display of Hanukkah lamps
from various places and centuries. Most are silver, but they range
from serious endeavors, like the intricately worked 18th-century
sculptural form from Galicia that depicts a Torah ark, to the
lighthearted wood structure made in 1974 by Mae Shafter Rockland of
Princeton, N.J. On a platform covered with the American flag stand
eight plastic figures of the Statue of Liberty, torches raised to
receive the Hanukkah candles.

 &HT;    Come aboard America's private rail cars, the magic carpets made
of steel
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riding on the City of New Orleans, Illinois Central Monday
morning rail...
</P>
<P>
   You're trundling north through Louisiana bayous, pulled by
Amtrak Train 58, The City of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours out of the Big Easy, and you're still in the
Mississippi delta, dogwoods blooming in old cedar swamps, shotgun
shacks with last night's rain steaming off tin roofs.
</P>
<P>
   This is not America from 30,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   And the domed observation car you're riding isn't economy class.
It's not even Amtrak. A railroad baron could get used to this car _
opulent, private and built well in the U.S. Henry Flagler would
approve.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Northern Sky, called the most exquisite train car in
America by ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Romance.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 private railroad cars are afield in the land _
sleepers, coaches, lounge cars, even a couple of old mail cars. A
few are corporate-owned, many can be chartered, some are simply the
weekend obsession of their owners _ 90 tons or more of steel and
aluminum graced with carved woods, silk brocade, crystal stemware
and fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be rich to buy one _ $10,000 can get you an
old Pullman, with rusted wheels that still might turn. No, you
don't have to be rich to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing one up is another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let's say you're looking at $200,000 as a start, just to
put a car back on the tracks,'' says Dave Hoffman, owner of the
Northern Sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you could spend virtually forever on decoration,
maintenance. A million wouldn't be out of line,'' says Hoffman.
``It's like redoing an old house, top to bottom, plumbing,
electrical. Paint. Carpets. An old house on steel wheels that has
to meet Amtrak standards before it moves an inch.''
</P>
<P>
   And then what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' says Hoffman. ``You get America like you can never
get it from 30,000 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed you do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can see America just as well from the worn seat
of an Amtrak coach.
</P>
<P>
   But when you ride a private rail car, your fellow riders will
most likely be history and train buffs, with a great deal to say.
And if you transcend the luscious meals and focus instead on the
views that streak past, you'll see America as it is. As it was.
</P>
<P>
   A train ride is a door on America, maybe the back door or the
servants' entrance.
</P>
<P>
   It's the America Steve Goodman wrote of and Arlo Guthrie sang of
in ``The City of New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   The conductor sings his song again ... this train's got the
disappearing railroad blues.
</P>
<P>
   It was written in 1970, the year Amtrak took over passenger
routes from once-great carriers such as Illinois Central, Sante Fe,
New York Central.
</P>
<P>
   Trains were romantic. Trains were historical. And about to be
history.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger trains were rolling toward a sidetrack to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Into the vacuum stepped people like Dave Hoffman. They want
their railroading to live. For them, railroad museums are a sad
sight. Henry Flagler's green-and-gold car sits on the lawn behind
his Palm Beach house. Built in 1886. Fascinating. Beautiful. But it
will never roll again.
</P>
<P>
   But America is not found inside museums, says Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   He owns not one, but two cars. The other's a sleeper, 11
bedrooms. Both are tagging along on Train 58, north to Chicago.
Nineteen hours. Nine hundred and eighty-two miles. Amtrak charges
Hoffman $1.80 a mile for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders, three conductors and
twenty-five sacks of mail.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip to Chicago, the Amtrak part of the City of New
Orleans still pulls 15 cars, but 189 paying passengers are aboard
at $154 a pop, and just one conductor, Ernie Lozano, 30 years on
Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   And the sons of engineers ride their father's magic carpets made
of steel.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano's father was a steam locomotive mechanic in Guatemala
City. Loves the rails, he says. Grew up on them. There's no mail on
board today, hasn't been mail for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Card players?
</P>
<P>
   ``Always card players,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He waves the all aboard at 2:08 on a misty afternoon, two
minutes late, and Train 58 lurches to life on Track 6 in New
Orleans' Union Station. The name evokes the grandeur of another
age, but it's a squat concrete box strewn with yesterday's
newspapers and plastic coffee cups that dance on the wind into dark
corners.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's cars are at the rear of the train, their red and gray
livery fresh and clean. Inside, white snapdragons grace tables.
Nice sound system throughout. Air conditioning, too. The wood is
polished, the wine vintage, the shrimp jumbo and ice-cold.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is hosting about 20 guests. One of them is reading a
history of the transcontinental railroad. The rest are talking
trains. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Sky was built in 1955 for the Union Pacific. Amtrak
picked it up in 1970. It ran on the Auto-Train until 1978. Hoffman
found it in 1990. New, it cost Union Pacific about $500,000.
Hoffman paid less than 10 cents on the dollar, one cent on the
dollar adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like trains,'' says Hoffman. ``Love them, really. Since I
was a kid. So I heard about this car and thought, OK. And my wife,
Marilyn, said, `You're going to what?'''
</P>
<P>
   He's a road contractor, lives in Wisconsin, mid-50s, three kids.
About the same demographics as the other rail-car owners on board _
guys who make private money in small private companies. Some guys
retreat to lakeside cottages, or polish their old Corvettes, or
dabble in fishing or 19th-century landscape art.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and his pals bought railroad cars. They call them iron
mistresses.
</P>
<P>
   The car owners had met in New Orleans for the weekend, members
and associates of the American Association of Private Railroad Car
Owners.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Heard from Fernandina Beach was there, with his 1930
dark-blue Georgia 300, the car Bill Clinton used in a 1992
whistle-stop tour. When he was a kid in Moultrie, Ga., Heard waited
at crossings just to watch that car roll by. He told his pals he'd
own it someday. He does.
</P>
<P>
   Association President Dean McCormick, from Santa Ana, Calif.,
was there, but his car, The Scottish Thistle, was in the shop on
the West Coast. Wheel bearings or brakes or something. There's
always something, he says. And Jim Larson was there, 46 years on
the railroads. He pretty much lives on the rails. Jim Larson knows
everything about trains. Everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grew up near the Boston and Maine?'' he says. ``I knew the
B&AMP;M president, John Berriger, back in the '60s. Good man.''
</P>
<P>
   How many people in the country can name the president of the
B&AMP;M?
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode that passenger train down in Florida,'' says Larson.
``What's it called? Tri-Rail? Strange thing is the stations aren't
where they should be, near stadiums or airports. Good track,
though. And concrete ties. Had dinner at Hoot, Toot and Whistle in
Delray Beach. Had to eat there. The FEC freights run right by.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course.
</P>
<P>
   Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle ...
</P>
<P>
   Not on this train. Northern Sky steward, Louis Nowicki, pours
top-shelf tequila, California cabernet, 12-year-old Scotch. Heavy
crystal goblets. Buckets of cold shrimp. Napkins embossed in gold
with the Northern Sky logo. Nowicki is more innkeeper than steward.
He prepares the 11 bedrooms, handles reservations, gets things
straight with Amtrak. He's been on the train eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best job in the world,'' he says. ``If you don't love
trains when you start, you will soon enough.''
</P>
<P>
   While he works the upper level, chef David Klugler is down below
in his kitchen, about the size of a big refrigerator. Klugler has
been on the Northern Sky four years. Tonight, he's cooking up 10
roast chickens, gravy, mashed potatoes, salad, corn, fresh baked
rolls and croissants. And a chocolate cake to murder for. If you
need a snack, he'll slice some cold filet mignon, add a dash of
horseradish and slide it under a hot deli roll, couple of shrimp on
the side.
</P>
<P>
   If it all sounds appealing, their services, along with the car,
cost about $500 per day, per person, says Hoffman. You pick your
trip _ Chicago to L.A., New York to Miami, anywhere there's Amtrak
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as a luxury land cruise, a grand hotel on
wheels,'' he says. ``And if it's a business trip, and you're on
this car for three days, well, you have a captive audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car, penny a
point, ain't no one keeping score.
</P>
<P>
   The men talk trains while their wives play a dice game at a big
table in the front of the car. They've heard all the stories.
They're playing for nickels.
</P>
<P>
   They roll dice, and the men talk trains and more trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that trip to Churchill, Ontario, for the polar-bear
migration ...'' ``So I was going across Kenya on the old British
track when ...''
</P>
<P>
   They know all the routes, all the train names, all the train
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Panama Limited made this run from Chicago to New Orleans
in under 15 hours. Fifteen hours, on old track, under steam ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Railroad Post Office was the most efficient in the
country. Killed by JFK and that crony of his, Kenny O'Donnell in,
what, 1962? A real shame. You could walk right up to a mail car and
post a letter through a slot ...''
</P>
<P>
   One fellow starts to tell about fishing in Costa Rica. His table
mates stop and stare, as if to say, fishing?
</P>
<P>
   The conversation rolls on into the gray afternoon. And so does
The City of New Orleans, past farms and fields and red sand roads
that shine with the spring rain. Past junkyards full of old oil
derricks and twisted pipe. Past the backside of the Crescent City,
where wet laundry hangs behind tenaments, and bums sleep under
bridges, and rubber tires smolder in big piles. The back door of
America.
</P>
<P>
   It arrives early in Hammond, La. A prim little station, old
brick stores, neat wood houses framed by azalea. A couple jumps out
of their automobile at the crossing, armed with a camera. They
wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my, what a beautiful rail car,'' yells the man. ``I took a
car like that once on the Southern Crescent ... Hey, send me a
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   His name is Eddie Litolff. Everybody loves a train.
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Dave Hoffman love them just a little more.
</P>
<P>
   They name their cars. The Palm Beach, built in 1949, is owned by
a fellow in Wisconsin. It ran from New York to Miami until 1978.
The Survivor, built in 1926 for Woolworth heiress Jesse Woolworth,
was a frequent Palm Beach visitor. The new owner lives in Atlanta.
Lives in the car. He named it The Survivor because it did.
</P>
<P>
   And so did the railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Train 58 snakes up the old Natchez Trace, into Jackson, Miss., a
city bypassed by the latest economic boom. The old station is gone,
most of the sidings and platforms, too. The abandoned Noble Hotel
stands near the derelict Hotel King, which looms over an empty
warehouse on a broken street.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Sky looks like a tourist lost in the wrong
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers with their babes asleep, are rockin' to the gentle beat.
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.
</P>
<P>
   For 500 miles, a baby has been asleep on Northern Sky. Not a
peep. She wakes just before Memphis, Tenn. A squawk, then she's
rocked back to sleep by the constant roll of the train.
</P>
<P>
   Evening. Passengers repair to their staterooms. Jim Larson is
still telling stories. The time he had to use liquid detergent and
bars of soap to free up an overheated wheel bearing. Got the car
rolling again. The years when 200 trains a day came and went from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Nighttime on the City of New Orleans, changing cars in Memphis,
Tennessee. Halfway home, we'll be there by morning ...
</P>
<P>
   The digital speedometer in the Northern Sky observation deck
clicks down from 82 to 50, to 30, to zero. The map on Hoffman's
laptop computer says the train is in Memphis. So does a sign on the
station. The station is a small metal trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Klugler jumps down to stretch his legs. He whistles the
``Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' Good whistler.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hoffman jumps down to check his car, take a walk around and
look under here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Lozano, the conductor, snaps his Amtrak jacket against the
chill. He checks the length of his 15 silver cars, checks
couplings, electrical connections.
</P>
<P>
   A lone taxi waits for fares in the empty parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some railroad car,'' says the cabbie, with a nod to
Northern Sky. ``Beautiful colors. Took one like that back in, what,
1966? On my way to the Army. Lemme tell you about that ride. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's got a train story. Everybody old enough to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Good night, America, how are you ... I'm a train they call the
City of New Orleans ...

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After making a career, not to mention millions, from
swimming with the fishes and living to tell about it, Peter
Benchley, the writer who created and murdered a shark in the
ubiquitous fish story ``Jaws,'' resurfaced in Manhattan the other
day with amnesty on his mind. For himself and for sharks. Don't
blame him for the bad rap sharks have gotten since forever. Please
lend an ear as he tries to undo it. Partly.
</P>
<P>
   Benchley has not forgotten two sharks _ an oceanic whitetip that
ambushed him as he swam in a school of tuna for a Bahamian photo
shoot, then a great white that got the rope from his diving cage
stuck between its teeth like dental floss _ that tried to make a
meal of him since ``Jaws'' made him that rarest of literary
delicacies, an overnight success.
</P>
<P>
   Are sharks capable of plotting revenge? Don't they know Benchley
has claimed he would not write ``Jaws'' today, could not, in good
conscience, demonize them now as he did then? (The eight species of
known killers out of 400 shark varieties have killed an average of
slightly less than one human per year over the last century. Four
of the five people attacked each year survive, as did Benchley.
Twice.)
</P>
<P>
   He beat off the whitetip with the broken broomstick he always
carries for protection, like a set of aquatic brass knuckles,
during dicey dives. His wife, Wendy, spared him from the great
white by coolly reaching out a hand and, as the cameras rolled,
yanking the rope out of the shark's mouth. ``I like to think she
saved my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies indicate sharks have a more sophisticated palate
than previously assumed and far prefer seals to humans. But they
bite first, discriminate later. ``If you happen to be a human,
after one bite, it may be too late for you,'' said Benchley, who
turns 60 this year but still dives at the drop of a hat. ``White
sharks are, for any diver, the apex _ the Tom Cruise of the
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, for Benchley, that and then some. ``If I'm elected
pope and win the Nobel Prize, at my funeral they'll still play the
John Williams music from `Jaws.''' Though Benchley has been other
things (reporter, editor, speechwriter for Lyndon B. Johnson), he's
had a boomerang relationship with sharks since childhood summers on
Nantucket. They've been a major meal ticket since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Benchley calls it coincidence that, just in time for the 25th
anniversary of the film version of ``Jaws,'' he and the National
Geographic photographer David Doubilet teamed for a television
special, ``Great White, Deep Trouble'' (April 9, 8 p.m., CNBC),
that makes a case for the conservation of his old nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to slide into the cliche that, 25 years later, I'm
trying to atone for some damage done to them by my book, but that's
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Benchley owes to sharks, starting with the
malicious, fictitious one he conjured while working for a $7,500
book advance inside a $50 per month office in the bowels of a New
Jersey furnace factory: homes in Princeton, N.J., and Stonington,
Conn.; college educations for his three children; a reputation as
an underwater specialist that has brought him steady employment on
television and radio, in films and the print media.
</P>
<P>
   He was ``a struggling freelance with two kids to feed'' when he
came up with his idea for a shark story after reading a Daily News
account of the harpooning of a 4,550-pound great white by an
eccentric Montauk fisherman, Frank Mundus. (Though Mundus accused
him of stealing his life story, Benchley insists the captain in his
tale, Quint, was a composite of Old Salts from Nantucket, Martha's
Vineyard and Long Island.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I read that newspaper story and thought, `What would happen if
one of those things came around and wouldn't go away?''' said
Benchley, wearing a vaguely nautical navy blazer and khakis, as he
sipped coffee in a hotel before heading to a bookstore for a
magazine-signing (``Never done one of those before'') for National
Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   When he wrote ``Jaws,'' Benchley was not signing much except
ious. ``I was 27 and just out of a White House speechwriting job
I'd been utterly unqualified for,'' he recalled of his job with
LBJ, a fluke that opened his eyes to the fact that presidents lie,
left him cynical about top-level politics and a little ashamed of
his puffball stuff for LBJ. So he went back to freelancing. ``I was
stone broke. It was an atmosphere of survival. There was certainly
no ambition to create a phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also, Benchley said, no truth to the tale that
Doubleday plucked him from obscurity and determined to create him
in the image of his grandfather, the humorist Robert Benchley. A
grandfather he hadn't known and whose humor appears to have been
lost on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 5 when he died, didn't know him except by legend; my
grandfather was a terrible profligate, he made a fortune during the
Depression and spent it on fast women, stuff, and booze in
Hollywood,'' Benchley said. ``His legacy was a $1,500 bar bill at
`21.'''
</P>
<P>
   Benchley, whose father, Nathaniel, a novelist, groomed him to
sink or swim as a writer by charging him to shut himself in a room
each summer vacation day for four hours or 1,000 words, whichever
came first, already knows his own legacy: sharks and more sharks.
``I'm deeply grateful, if one can be deeply grateful to an animal.
Thanks, fellas.''

`RUSSIAN HAMLET': IT'S NOT EXACTLY HAMLET, BUT MORE A STATE OF
MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ History is treated better in tomes than in tights and
despite appearances, a historical drama is exactly what ``Russian
Hamlet,'' Boris Eifman's new ballet, is not. It is, rather, a work
of extravagant artistic license about Czar Paul I, the unhappy son
of Catherine the Great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian Hamlet'' was, in fact, helpfully subtitled ``Son of
Catherine the Great'' at its U.S. premiere on Wednesday night at
City Center, where the superb dancers of the Eifman Ballet of St.
Petersburg will perform it through Sunday night as part of a
three-week season.
</P>
<P>
   Those who missed this exceptional company on its previous visits
to City Center in 1998 and last year will find that a narrow view
of ballet no longer obtains. If the dancers perform with such
power, it is because Eifman has molded them into perfect creative
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Love him or hate him, Eifman stimulates and provokes. Like
others before him, including Moussorgsky and Pushkin, he is a
Russian artist who sees the intrigues and passions of the Russian
czars as a springboard for his own creativity. ``Russian Hamlet''
is not so much about the historical Paul, who is depicted as a
Hamlet-like prince before he reigned briefly as czar (1796-1801),
as it is about a state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to read the program's printed synopsis to
understand the emotional outpouring and passions on stage. Eifman
has a way with electrifying images and theatrical fantasies (helped
enormously by Slava Okunev's stunning sets) that other
choreographers do not.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the tale, he telegraphs the drama of the moment through
an emblematic image. For Eifman, Paul is a victim, crushed by his
mother and his court. We do not see him murdered by his own guards,
as he was in fact. But we see him in ultimate defeat at the end. As
the empress sweeps across the stage in a huge gold train, the
prince sits on her cape and is pulled along, reduced symbolically
and literally to following in his mother's wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian Hamlet,'' which was commissioned by the Bolshoi Ballet
and was also danced by that company in Moscow last month, is not a
perfect work. As a meditation on relationships, the brilliant first
act yields to a diffuse second half. This is not because it opens
up into a fantasy world full of hallucinations (the ghost of Paul's
murdered father makes regular appearances). But the angst is spread
out. The center shifts from Paul to Catherine and even her lover
has a soliloquy to meditate upon his sins.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Eifman image is always provocative, frequently
outlandish and always daring. It is relevant, never dull. You can
gasp or groan when Catherine and her lover dive onto the throne and
a crowd surrounds them for their lovemaking: only their feet stick
up above the group.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, seen briefly as a child (Alexsander Eifman, the
choreographer's 5-year-old son), suddenly becomes a man-sized child
in a crib, surrounded by dancing nursemaids. His wedding night is a
lyrical arching duet in silhouette behind a pale blue cloth
stretched across the stage. When his bride's lust for power is
symbolized in tangled acrobatics with Paul on the throne, Catherine
has her killed.
</P>
<P>
   Like the men in a Georgian war dance, the palace guards stand in
a three-tiered circle. Each tier consists of men on the shoulders
of those below. In a throat-catching toss upward, the bride leaps
up to the top tier and dangles over the men's arms. The spring
upward is a shock, more than her drop to the ground below.
Catherine, for her part, steps up on the men's backs to the top
tier with measured dignity to look down triumphantly on her prey
below.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, there is a certain cartoon simplicity to some of
Eifman's characters, but this distillation of personality does not
come across as caricature.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the characters are generalized without the names
of the real figures who inspired them. Just as Jose Limon called
Othello ``The Moor'' and Iago ``The Moor's Friend'' in his ``Moor's
Pavane,'' so Catherine here is ``The Empress'' and Paul is ``Son of
the Empress, Heir to the Throne.'' Catherine had so many lovers
that the one on stage is generic, called ``Favorite of the
Empress.'' Paul's bride and first wife, Natalya, becomes ``The Wife
of the Heir'' and Czar Peter III, Paul's murdered father, appears
as ``Ghost of the Heir's Father.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions are primary and, as usual, Eifman's choreography is at
its most thrilling in the duets. There are those who find his
vocabulary limited. One would like to see a Western ballet troupe
attempt the swift, acrobatic and always innovative partnering in
these duets. Even the Bolshoi reportedly had trouble adjusting to
the intricacies of Eifman's style.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, it is a highly expressive style put to dramatic
purpose rather than used as form for its own sake. Eifman draws his
strength from an extension of the ballet idiom and his dancers are
exceptional ballet dancers. He has the power in his narrative
ballets that Kenneth MacMillan and John Cranko did not always
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Where he stumbles is in his attempts to find a new vocabulary.
Growing up in the Soviet Union, a country bereft of modern dance,
he emerged as an un-Soviet choreographer (no uplifting hero in his
ballets) who was not confined to gesture. But the solos he has
choreographed here to expose an interior emotional state often
become one-dimensional. And while the male-female ensembles are
effective in moving the action along, there is a robotic simpleness
to the male groups in the second act.

(Eds: Corrects name of earlier movie to `Gross Pointe Blank.') 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Cusack loves music. Sinatra, Mozart, the Cramps _ you name
it, he'll have an opinion about it. He prefers LPs to CDs, knows
the locations of the best record stores around the world and has
already picked out what song he wants to be played at his funeral
(Jimmy Cliff's ``Many Rivers to Cross,'' unless he changes his mind
again).
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's appreciation for music was evident in ``Gross Pointe
Blank,'' the charmingly offbeat 1997 film that he co-wrote and
co-produced under his New Crime Productions banner. Clash frontman
Joe Strummer scored the movie, and the soundtrack, a nice sampler
of Reagan-era pop music, continues to be a big seller to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's latest film, ``High Fidelity,'' continues along the
same path. Cusack and his Evanston, Ill., pals Steve Pink and D.V.
DeVincentis have again written the screenplay, adapting Nick
Hornby's novel about a music junkie trying to figure out women. The
film, which is often set in a barely functioning record store,
features 65 different songs, ranging from classic rock to cult
bands like the Thirteenth Floor Elevators and the Beta Band.
</P>
<P>
   Here we talk to the 33-year-old Cusack about his feelings for
rock, ``Crocodile'' and otherwise, his proclivity for wearing Clash
T-shirts in his films and why music always seems to sound better in
a record store.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did you discover music?
</P>
<P>
   A: As soon as my sister (actress Joan Cusack) allowed me into
her room to play 45s on her turntable. There was no turning back
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of stuff did your parents listen to?
</P>
<P>
   A: They would listen to classical and stuff like Gladys Knight
and the Pips and Sinatra. But nothing modern. We'd introduce stuff
to my dad and he'd say, ``Where was I?'' I remember when I got out
of high school, I told him, ``You've got to listen to Bob Dylan.''
He had never heard one of his records.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do your tastes run?
</P>
<P>
   A: All over the map. There's something satisfying about
listening to classical music and then there's something equally
satisfying about listening to music that sounds like it was made in
a concrete bunker underwater with some tape rolling. It makes no
difference, as long as it's got soul creeping through it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``High Fidelity'' features some pretty heated debates among
the three guys working in the record store. Did you and your
co-writers get into the same kind of arguments?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, the battles were huge. It was a war. It was just like in
the book. We'd talk about music and each one of us was absolutely
right beyond a question of a doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the biggest fights about?
</P>
<P>
   A: What 65 songs we'd have in the movie. If it were up to those
guys, we would have limited it more to these specialized bands that
nobody knows. Don't get me wrong. I love those groups, but there
comes a point where you have to broaden the range and include songs
for people who don't know as much about music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like Elton John's ``Crocodile Rock''?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Grimacing) That was (director) Stephen Frears' choice. I
hate that song with a passion to this day, but he liked the faux
innocence of it to match the scene it's in. And that's OK. It's not
that big of a deal. But at the time for us, including ``Crocodile
Rock,'' was a travesty and we made a great big stink about it:
``You can't! You can't!'' That's how obsessive we were about the
music in this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any song you wanted in that didn't make the cut?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was this one Warren Zevon song that I thought was
perfect, but nobody else felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you remember your first concert?
</P>
<P>
   A: I went to a simulcast of the Who just after Kenny Jones
joined them. The first concert that blew off the back of my head
was Fishbone. Back in the day, those guys were great. They were so
ahead of their time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've worn Clash T-shirts in a few of your films. That had
to be another favorite band.
</P>
<P>
   A: Definitely. But I started out listening to ELO, KISS and
Cheap Trick. I guess you'd consider them guilty pleasures, but
those were the bands that I cut my teeth on. You know, when you're
13, 14 years old and you want to figure out what's radical and you
realize you can be an individual and buy stuff that your parents
don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what was your parents' reaction?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think, like all parents, they didn't understand what the
hell we were listening to. There was this store in Chicago, Rick's
Record Exchange, that's just like Championship Vinyl (the record
store in the movie). I used to go there every day after school and
listen to music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You must have a pretty fair collection.
</P>
<P>
   A: You'd think. But I don't collect. I have things and then they
go away. I don't have a place where things stay. It's probably
because I'm so disorganized. I'll grab a CD to go somewhere and
I'll leave it in somebody's car. I'll go out and buy stuff ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you just won't hold onto it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. I mean, I'll be in a record store and hear something
great, buy it, listen to it for a while and then it's gone. But in
my head, I'll have it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does music always sound better when you're listening to
it in a record store?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a good question. It's true. I've bought albums I've
heard in stores and then when I listen to them again, I wonder what
the hell I was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because everybody goes to a record store hoping to
find that piece of treasure and you have all that energy around
you. It's almost a sacred observance. Everybody's kind of serious
when they're in a record store. You know what I mean? There's this
undercurrent of focus where people are looking, looking, searching
for something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the last treasure you've found?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's this band called Ozomatli. The music is like a
cross-cultural block party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you say you agree with your ``High Fidelity'' character
that Jimmy Cliff's ``Many Rivers to Cross'' would be your funeral
song?
</P>
<P>
   A: That would do just fine. (Pause) But then again ... actually
... nah, I'd probably want Bob Marley. He'd turn it into a party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It doesn't usually turn out that way despite the best of
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't, does it? Maybe we could start with Cliff and
segue into Marley. You've got to give it a try.

 &HT;    AN UNASKED CENSUS QUESTION: HOW MANY DISTRUST THE GOVERNMENT?
 &HT;    770&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many Americans, Census Day, April 1, is a day
of protest. Don't mail in your form, they urge, or if you do, don't
answer every one of those nosy questions.
</P>
<P>
   They are the census refuseniks _ a small but growing number of
Americans who refuse to fill out the questionnaire because they
feel it represents undue government intrusion in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that this is a modern society and that the
government needs information, but I just don't like it,'' said
Howard McCarthy, 62, a commercial real estate developer in
Lakeport, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his life, McCarthy intends to break the
law in an act of civil disobedience. Fed up with the federal
bureaucracy, he says he left some answers blank and answered others
incorrectly on his copy of the 53-question long form.
</P>
<P>
   The founding fathers designed the census to count people.
Questions such as his race, age and how much he earns go too far,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last census in 1990, the level of mistrust Americans
have about the federal government has grown, a phenomenon that the
Census Bureau acknowledges as one of its chief challenges as it
tries to coax 120 million households to respond to the form, or a
less detailed short form.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Capitol Hill Republicans, including Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, have told their
constituents not to answer questions they deem objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to throw it in the trash,'' said Lott
spokesman John Czwartacki. ``We encourage them to fill out all the
questions. But we'd rather them leave blank the ones they find
objectionable than not to reply to the census at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Director Kenneth Prewitt has received plenty of calls and
e-mail in the past few weeks from irate Americans telling him just
what he can do with the form. The census has been a hot topic in
recent weeks on talk-radio stations and Internet chat sites.
Commentator Andy Rooney of CBS's ``60 Minutes'' fueled the debate
on Sunday's program when he ranted about the long form.
</P>
<P>
   Most American households received the short form. It has only
eight basic questions, including name, age, race and number of
people living in your house. The in-depth long form probes deeper
into topics such as income, housing and lifestyle; it was sent to 1
of every 6 households.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution mandates a national head count every 10 years
to apportion seats in Congress. Prewitt defended the long form
Thursday as ``an essential tool'' in determining the needs of
communities across the country. The census also determines the
distribution of spending for education, health care, emergency
services and other public services.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt points out that every question is on the long form for a
reason, primarily dealing with the distribution of federal money to
the states and tied to specific laws passed by Congress. Only one
new question was added to the 2000 census long form, concerning
grandparents who are the prime caregivers to their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a question on the form that hasn't been put there
by Congress. So Congress is having an argument with itself and not
with the Census Bureau,'' said Prewitt.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary survey by the Census Bureau shows that its
extensive promotional campaign is having little effect on the
people wary of the federal government and the census. ``The ad
campaign is reaching them, but it's having a hard time convincing
them,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Edwards, 43, a community activist in Chicago, says he threw
his long form into the trash the day it arrived. Using his Internet
nickname ``the Viscount,'' he's expressed his views on a Yahoo.com
message board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of any rational reason as to why they would
want this information. It's just none of their damn business,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much I paid for utilities? I don't get that. Why do they
need to know that?'' said Mike McBride, 31, a computer network
engineer in Columbus, Ohio. He received the long form but plans to
fill out only the eight questions asked on the short form and leave
the rest blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the scandals that have come along and more. Things
like the FBI files showing up at the White House. It makes me
think, yeah, legally they weren't supposed to be there. But they
were. Well, what if that happens to my census form? It's supposed
to be confidential. But what if Congress passes a new law six
months from now saying it isn't?'' said McBride.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, the Census Bureau had received 46 percent of
the forms it sent out, an encouraging response toward its goal of a
70 percent response rate before census workers go into the field on
April 11 and begin knocking on doors of those who have not returned
their questionnaires. In 1990, only 65 percent of Americans
returned their forms.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are legally required to fill out their forms. There is
a $100 fine for failing to return the questionnaire and a $500 fine
for providing false information.
</P>
<P>
   But the law has rarely been enforced because of a Catch-22: its
policy never to share the forms it receives with other federal
agencies means the Census Bureau cannot use its information to ask
the Justice Department to seek prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in government eroded following the Watergate
scandal in the 1970s and has taken a further dip in the 1990s
following President Clinton's woes with Whitewater and Monica
Lewinsky and the scandals surrounding former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and other members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in late February found that 50 percent of all
Americans do not believe the Census Bureau when it says the
information and identity on census forms will not be shared with
other government agencies and 60 percent believe the government
cannot protect the information from computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the skepticism, eight of 10 Americans said that
their answers matter and that the census is a useful process, the
Gallup poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., has urged people to answer just the
first six questions on the long form and to send it back to the
Census Bureau with a letter of protest. In a statement issued
earlier this week, Coburn said he was ``appalled and outraged by
the intrusiveness'' of the census questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt said Thursday that
Republicans were conducting a campaign to keep response to the
census low. ``The Republicans have been trying to frustrate this
census from the beginning. They don't want more people counted
because they think it serves their political purposes. That's a
pretty shoddy reason to do what they're doing,'' he told reporters
on Capitol Hill.

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening moments of John Cusack's wonderfully acerbic new
comedy,``High Fidelity,'' Cusack's character, Rob, muses that there
are thousands of songs about misery and he wonders: Do I listen to
pop music because I'm miserable or am I miserable because I listen
to pop music?
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of question the self-obsessed Rob specializes in,
precisely because there's no easy answer. All the better: He can
torture himself for days while searching for the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Music, love and misery are insightfully intertwined in this
quirky comedy about a record store owner who sifts through his past
relationships to discover why women are always dumping him. Rob's
latest loss is Laura (Iben Hjejle), who has just left him for
living his obsessions. Rob baits her, saying she doesn't even make
his top-five list of painful break-ups. After Laura leaves, though,
he compiles a top-five list of reasons he misses her.
</P>
<P>
   Rob, as you can see, is big on lists. He owns a barely
functioning record store in Chicago where he spends his days with
his two clerks _ shy softy Dick (Todd Louiso) and the loud,
opinionated Barry (Jack Black) _ rattling off lists of musical
minutiae while serving or belittling the occasional customer who
manages to find the store. (Sample list: Top Five Songs For Letting
the Person Who Dumped You Know That Even Though They Broke Your
Heart You Can't Get Over Them).
</P>
<P>
   Rob can't get over Laura, particularly after he learns she has
taken up with a pompous, pony-tailed blowhard (Tim Robbins in a
hilarious cameo). Now, Laura is on Rob's break-up list (she's No. 5
with a bullet). A glutton for punishment, Rob tracks down the other
women on the list to find out why ``he's doomed to be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack and his ``Grosse Pointe Blank'' writing partners D.V.
DeVincentis and Steve Pink (along with Scott Rosenberg) have done a
brilliant job in bringing Nick Hornby's painfully wry 1995 novel to
the screen. The setting has seamlessly shifted from London to
Chicago, but that's the only change of substance. Rob's
angst-ridden monologues (Cusack spends much of the movie directly
addressing the camera) remain, as do all of his very real character
flaws. There are reasons women are wary of this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' sports one of the best supporting casts you'll
ever find in a movie. Lili Taylor, Lisa Bonet, Joelle Carter and
Natasha Gregson Wagner dazzle as the women in Rob's life, and
Catherine Zeta-Jones steals several scenes as the ex-girlfriend Rob
knew was always out of his league. Joan Cusack plays Laura's best
friend with fetching candor, and Danish actress Hjejle grounds the
movie with genuine grace.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all are Louiso and Black, Laurel and Hardy teammates who
invest their characters with a touching authenticity that goes well
beyond the sort of cartoonish portrayals we usually get from comic
sidekicks. Such depth is this movie's strength, and Stephen Frears'
solid, simple direction allows these satisfying details and
characterizations to come to the fore. ``High Fidelity'' heads my
list of best movies we've seen so far this year. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
The film: ``High Fidelity'' (R; language and some sexuality.) &QL; 
The stars: John Cusack, Jack Black, Iben Hjejle and Todd Louiso &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Stephen Frears. Screenplay by D.V.
DeVincentis, Steve Pink, Cusack and Scott Rosenberg. Released by

<P>
   John Cusack loves music. Sinatra, Mozart, the Cramps _ you name
it, he'll have an opinion about it. He prefers LPs to CDs, knows
the locations of the best record stores around the world and has
already picked out what song he wants to be played at his funeral
(Jimmy Cliff's ``Many Rivers to Cross,'' unless he changes his mind
again).
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's appreciation for music was evident in ``Grosse Pointe
Blank,'' the charmingly offbeat 1997 film that he co-wrote and
co-produced under his New Crime Productions banner. Clash frontman
Joe Strummer scored the movie, and the soundtrack, a nice sampler
of Reagan-era pop music, continues to be a big seller to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's latest film, ``High Fidelity,'' continues along the
same path. Cusack and his Evanston, Ill., pals Steve Pink and D.V.
DeVincentis have again written the screenplay, adapting Nick
Hornby's novel about a music junkie trying to figure out women. The
film, which is often set in a barely functioning record store,
features 65 different songs, ranging from classic rock to cult
bands like the Thirteenth Floor Elevators and the Beta Band.
</P>
<P>
   Here we talk to the 33-year-old Cusack about his feelings for
rock, ``Crocodile'' and otherwise, his proclivity for wearing Clash
T-shirts in his films and why music always seems to sound better in
a record store.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did you discover music?
</P>
<P>
   A: As soon as my sister (actress Joan Cusack) allowed me into
her room to play 45s on her turntable. There was no turning back
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of stuff did your parents listen to?
</P>
<P>
   A: They would listen to classical and stuff like Gladys Knight
and the Pips and Sinatra. But nothing modern. We'd introduce stuff
to my dad and he'd say, ``Where was I?'' I remember when I got out
of high school, I told him, ``You've got to listen to Bob Dylan.''
He had never heard one of his records.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do your tastes run?
</P>
<P>
   A: All over the map. There's something satisfying about
listening to classical music and then there's something equally
satisfying about listening to music that sounds like it was made in
a concrete bunker underwater with some tape rolling. It makes no
difference, as long as it's got soul creeping through it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``High Fidelity'' features some pretty heated debates among
the three guys working in the record store. Did you and your
co-writers get into the same kind of arguments?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, the battles were huge. It was a war. It was just like in
the book. We'd talk about music and each one of us was absolutely
right beyond a question of a doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the biggest fights about?
</P>
<P>
   A: What 65 songs we'd have in the movie. If it were up to those
guys, we would have limited it more to these specialized bands that
nobody knows. Don't get me wrong. I love those groups, but there
comes a point where you have to broaden the range and include songs
for people who don't know as much about music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like Elton John's ``Crocodile Rock''?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Grimacing) That was (director) Stephen Frears' choice. I
hate that song with a passion to this day, but he liked the faux
innocence of it to match the scene it's in. And that's OK. It's not
that big of a deal. But at the time for us, including ``Crocodile
Rock,'' was a travesty and we made a great big stink about it:
``You can't! You can't!'' That's how obsessive we were about the
music in this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any song you wanted in that didn't make the cut?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was this one Warren Zevon song that I thought was
perfect, but nobody else felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you remember your first concert?
</P>
<P>
   A: I went to a simulcast of the Who just after Kenny Jones
joined them. The first concert that blew off the back of my head
was Fishbone. Back in the day, those guys were great. They were so
ahead of their time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've worn Clash T-shirts in a few of your films. That had
to be another favorite band.
</P>
<P>
   A: Definitely. But I started out listening to ELO, KISS and
Cheap Trick. I guess you'd consider them guilty pleasures, but
those were the bands that I cut my teeth on. You know, when you're
13, 14 years old and you want to figure out what's radical and you
realize you can be an individual and buy stuff that your parents
don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what was your parents' reaction?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think, like all parents, they didn't understand what the
hell we were listening to. There was this store in Chicago, Rick's
Record Exchange, that's just like Championship Vinyl (the record
store in the movie). I used to go there every day after school and
listen to music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You must have a pretty fair collection.
</P>
<P>
   A: You'd think. But I don't collect. I have things and then they
go away. I don't have a place where things stay. It's probably
because I'm so disorganized. I'll grab a CD to go somewhere and
I'll leave it in somebody's car. I'll go out and buy stuff ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you just won't hold onto it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. I mean, I'll be in a record store and hear something
great, buy it, listen to it for a while and then it's gone. But in
my head, I'll have it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does music always sound better when you're listening to
it in a record store?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a good question. It's true. I've bought albums I've
heard in stores and then when I listen to them again, I wonder what
the hell I was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because everybody goes to a record store hoping to
find that piece of treasure and you have all that energy around
you. It's almost a sacred observance. Everybody's kind of serious
when they're in a record store. You know what I mean? There's this
undercurrent of focus where people are looking, looking, searching
for something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the last treasure you've found?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's this band called Ozomatli. The music is like a
cross-cultural block party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you say you agree with your ``High Fidelity'' character
that Jimmy Cliff's ``Many Rivers to Cross'' would be your funeral
song?
</P>
<P>
   A: That would do just fine. (Pause) But then again ... actually
... nah, I'd probably want Bob Marley. He'd turn it into a party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It doesn't usually turn out that way despite the best of
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't, does it? Maybe we could start with Cliff and
segue into Marley. You've got to give it a try.

SPOTLIGHT ON WEEKEND TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commercial television is rarely hospitable to new concepts, so
the trick is to fuse familiar ingredients in an innovative, or at
least pleasing, manner. So here's ``D.C.,'' the earnest drama
series that the WB network is unveiling on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of five improbably attractive young adults
sharing a house (and their innermost thoughts) in Washington while
they try to grab hold of the bottommost rung of the power ladder.
</P>
<P>
   An echo of ``The Real World''? A whiff of ``The West Wing''? A
digit of ``90210''? Yes. But, curiously, there is scant evidence of
the wearily wise grown-up sensibility you expect from the new
show's executive producer, Dick Wolf, who presides so successfully
over the ``Law and Order'' franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of ``D.C.'' is the oft-tested friendship between two
recent college graduates. You can tell that Mason Scott comes from
money: he has two last names. His pal Pete Komisky has just one,
and it's vaguely ethnic, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, an idealistic Capitol Hill gofer and Harvard grad, is
played by Gabriel Olds, a real-life Yale grad who appeared on
Broadway in ``A View From the Bridge.'' Pete, a would-be
pragmatist, womanizer and lobbyist (state college, naturally), is
Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who grew up in full view during the endless
run of the children's series ``Saved by the Bell.'' These actors
make an easy-to-take pair of buddies, guys who can still taste
adolescence as they stuff their frames and dreams uncomfortably
into suits.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, do they have a lot to learn. As Pete says to Mason in next
Sunday's installment, ``Until I got to D.C., I thought Brooks
Brothers was a country band.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Sunday's scene-setting episode, Pete and Mason are
living in a dingy apartment when Mason's twin sister, Finley (she
has two last names, too), shows up, announcing that she is quitting
graduate school to find her destiny in Washington. She is played by
Jacinda Barrett, who joins this fake ``Real World'' after spending
a season living under glass on the real ``Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason can't miss the vibes flying between his sister and his
pal. He declares: ``I have enough stress at work. I don't need two
little pheromone factories running in my apartment.'' (Judging from
the first two episodes, when Finley and Pete do get together
they'll do so discreetly.)
</P>
<P>
   Finley uses her wiles and family connections to get the trio an
open-ended house-sitting assignment minding a gorgeous town house,
which has room for at least two more. That would be Sarah Logan
(Kristanna Loken), a junior producer for a CNN-type news operation,
and her boyfriend, Lewis Freeman (Daniel Sunjata), a Supreme Court
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   The first hour also squeezes in a subplot about Mason's effort
to serve the senator for whom he works (played with appropriate
smarminess by Len Cariou in a guest role). Trying to deal with the
vexing issue of the red ring-tailed squirrel, whose forest sits
smack in the path of progress, Mason finds a compromise. His good
deed goes punished, of course, as he suffers what promises to be a
weekly character-building rude awakening.
</P>
<P>
   Pete is philosophical. ``Who'd have thought Washington would be
so political?'' he asks with a smirk. But Mason's optimism is not
diminished. ``Think about it,'' he says, ``our entire lives are
ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people think they'll live forever. Young television shows
can't afford such naivete. So now that the characters have been
established, Wolf and his co-conspirators had better dream up some
stronger lines for them. Borrowed though the elements of the show
may be, the premise has promise. With luck, ``D.C.'' will last
longer than the presidential campaign. &QL;

 &HT;    Celebrity seduces writers, `Plainsong' author fears
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe Kent Haruf should have called his National Book
Award-nominated novel ``Eyes Wide Shut'' instead of ``Plainsong.''
To set the mood for his story of a pregnant teenager, two bachelor
brothers and other inhabitants of a small Colorado town, Haruf
hunkered down in his unheated basement, pulled a stocking cap down
over his eyes and blindly wrote the first draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty crazy,'' says Haruf, 57, a soft-spoken professor
at Southern Illinois University, ``but it seemed to work for me. It
was a way of not paying attention to the extraneous things, and not
being analytical. You can't go back and rewrite a sentence; it's
storytelling, not polishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique did indeed work. Critics raved about the simply
told story of complex relationships. As New York Times reviewer
Michiko Kakutani wrote: ``He has conjured up an entire community
and ineluctably immersed the reader in its dramas.''
</P>
<P>
   Haruf is used to such praise. He won a Whiting Writers' Award
and a PEN/Hemingway Foundation citation for his first book, ``The
Tie That Binds.'' It's the author-as-celebrity syndrome that comes
with the acclaim that bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it's healthy for writers to be anything but
ordinary,'' Haruf says. ``I think most writers have not written
nearly as well after they have gotten some fame. It's seductive and
troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, when a publisher pours a lot of money into
marketing a novel, the author has an obligation to dutifully go on
book tours. That's why Haruf is on the road again, talking about
not only ``Plainsong'' but also the new paperback editions of ``The
Tie That Binds'' and ``Where You Once Belonged.''
</P>
<P>
   Haruf will read and sign copies of his books at 7 p.m. April 6
at Chapter 11 bookstore at Ansley Mall. 1544 Piedmont Ave. N.E.,
404-872-7986.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Award winners: Two books and a work in progress have won the
J. Anthony Lukas Prize for superb nonfiction writing. One of two
$10,000 prizes from Columbia University went to Witold Rybczynski
for his book about one of the world's great landscape designers,
titled ``Clearing in the Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and
America in the Nineteenth Century.'' The second $10,000 prize is
for a book chronicling the American post-World War II occupation of
Japan, John W. Dower's ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Named for the late Pulitzer Prize-winning author J. Anthony
Lukas, the awards are co-administered by the Columbia University
Graduate School of Journalism and the Nieman Foundation at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mystery nominees: Atlanta writer Ruth Birmingham (the pen name
of Walter Sorrells) is one of five finalists for best paperback
original in the Edgar Allan Poe Awards competition.
Birmingham/Sorrells was nominated for ``Fulton County Blues''
(Prime Crime, $5.99), the story of sleuth Sunny Childs'
investigation of the death of a Vietnam veteran who was her late
father's friend. The investigation uncovers secrets that suggest
Childs' father may not have been a war hero after all.
</P>
<P>
   Other paperback finalists are Laura Lippman (``In Big
Trouble''), Tony Dunbar (``Lucky Man''), Mark Graham (``The
Resurrectionist''), and Jose Latour (``The Outcast'').
</P>
<P>
   In the hardback category, finalists are Rennie Airth (``River of
Darkness''), Jan Burke (``Bones''), Robert Crais (``L.A.
Requiem''), Stephen Greenleaf (``Strawberry Sunday'') and Peter
Robinson (``In a Dry Season'').
</P>
<P>
   The awards by the Mystery Writers of America will be presented
May 4 in New York at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Joining the club: With a few exceptions, most of Oprah
Winfrey's book club selections are downright depressing. The
characters are abused, misused and barely hanging onto a tiny shred
of hope. Oprah's latest choice, Tawni O'Dell's ``Back Roads''
(Viking, $24.95), is no different. Set in a lower-class,
crime-ridden section of western Pennsylvania, the novel chronicles
the life of Harley Altmyer, a teenager trying to raise his three
younger sisters after his mother murders his father and was sent to
jail. This book is not recommended for readers prone to depression.

   WASHINGTON _ A federal commission's last-ditch effort to reach a
consensus on Internet sales taxes failed Thursday when a
contentious telephone conference ended with no new agreements.
</P>
<P>
   That means Congress, which created the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce to sort out thorny tax issues, will not get the
clear advice it had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impasse, a majority of the commissioners agreed they
could send a ``report'' to Congress saying that a majority backed a
tax proposal supported by business interests. It will not include a
minority viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the commission in 1998 to get advice on whether
to force online merchants to collect sales taxes from all
customers. It required the 19-member panel to reach a
``supermajority'' of 13 votes to make a recommendation. The
deadline was April 21.
</P>
<P>
   At its final meeting in Dallas last week, the panel broke into
bitterly divided factions, and finally voting 11-8 for a
business-backed plan.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's phone conference, which could be heard over the
Internet, was thought to offer some hope for last-minute
compromises, but it quickly became clear no one was going to budge.
A simple majority finally voted to issue a report and block
inclusion of a minority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to take this to Congress and the people of the
United States,'' said Gov. James Gilmore, R-Va., chairman of the
commission and leader of the majority bloc. ``We'll let the
American people decide whether they like the report.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will call for extending the current moratorium on new
Internet taxes until 2006 while urging state and local governments
to simplify their sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It also recommends ending sales taxes on any product that can be
distributed digitally, rescinding the current 3 percent federal
excise tax on telecommunications, and permanently extending the
World Trade Organization's moratorium on tariffs and duties on
international electronic transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan commission included representatives from the
Clinton administration, state and local governments, anti-tax
activists and six businesses with major Internet-based operations.
The tax opponents and business representatives, joined by Gilmore,
made up the majority voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   They were charged with examining the issue of sales taxes, and
how they might apply to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, states can require retail stores to collect
sales taxes from customers. But companies that sell by phone, by
mail or on line need do so only in states where they have a
physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   As more business shifts to the Internet, the reduction in tax
collections could cause states to begin losing $10.8 billion
annually within three years, a recent University of Tennessee study
showed.
</P>
<P>
   The eight commissioners who represented federal, state and local
governments say they need that tax revenue to pay for schools,
roads, police and other basic services. They wanted to recommend
that Congress move the nation toward a tax system in which all
merchants will have to collect and remit sales taxes, regardless of
how or where they operate.
</P>
<P>
   The six business representatives on the commission agreed that
states should be able to require tax collections, but they wanted
several major concessions. For example, they want to exempt from
taxes all items that could be ``digitized,'' such as books, music
and movies, even when they are sold the old-fashioned way in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that would create a gigantic tax loophole for many
merchants. Because the government representatives on the panel
would not go along, the business representatives refused to support
their plan for a new national system for collecting sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The business bloc instead sided with the a group of five members
more opposed to taxes. Together, they made up the 11 votes to
support the moratorium and other tax-limiting measures.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was able to reach broad agreement on some smaller
issues. Its report to Congress will formally recommend that
lawmakers clarify federal welfare guidelines to allow states to
spend certain surplus welfare funds to ``provide needy families
access to computers and the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Another formal recommendation urges Congress ``to explore the
privacy issues involved in the collection and administration of
taxes on electronic commerce.''

 &HT;    Cliches take beating in father-son conflict
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As dramatically subtle as a head-butt, ``Price of Glory''
retells the age-old story of sons struggling to please a demanding
dad. It's watered-down Arthur Miller tarted up with boxing gloves,
body blows and a Mexican-American accent.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Smits plays one-time boxer Arturo Ortega, whose life
revolves around the training of his three sons in the sweaty art of
right hooks and uppercuts. See, he doesn't want them to ``end up
like me'' with a bad assembly-line job. You half expect him to talk
about having been ``a contenduh,'' like Marlon Brando in ``On the
Waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie borrows some flavor from another Brando flick, owing
its father-son, family-business tensions to ``The Godfather.'' The
oldest of the three kids is even called Sonny (Jon Seda); the
middle one, Jimmy (Clifton Collins Jr.), is, like the
``Godfather's'' sniveling Fredo, a little weak and
self-destructive. Then there's the youngest, 16-year-old Johnny
(Ernesto Hernandez), Arturo's favorite and the one he hopes will
validate the family name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be doing this just for me,'' Arturo constantly
tells his kids, and us. Of course that's exactly what he's doing.
It's a familiar tale of a has-been trying to revive failed dreams
through his kids. The movie pads out its running time with
repetitive scenes of the boys trying to talk sense to their
demanding dad, followed by Arturo's response: He screams, pounds
lockers, trashes their trophies.
</P>
<P>
   The script (from former New York Times sports columnist Phil
Berger) is so busy painting Arturo as a monster, you never quite
believe it when a melodramatic, easily foreseen plot twist causes
Arturo to see the error of his ways. It's a forced redemption; fate
boxes him into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Going on half an hour past its real dramatic climax, the movie
winds up with the typical big match for the title between Sonny and
a cocky boxing champion. Director Carlos Avila's workmanlike
direction gets some juice out of the face-mulching finale. But the
sequence tries to pummel you into forgetting that the main
character is really still a monster, temporarily wearing a smiley
mask because it's in his best interest. The movie clocks out with a
cowardly sucker-punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price of Glory''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jimmy Smits and Jon Seda. Rated PG-13 for violence,
profanity and brief drug content.1 hour, 57 minutes.

   The verdict: Down for the count.

 &HT;    Girl's quest draws audience along
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lesson that sometimes less is more is hardly one that one
would expect to be imparted by Zhang Yimou, the world-renowned
director of such visually sumptuous, emotionally passionate films
as ``Raise the Red Lantern'' and ``Ju Dou.'' However, his lovely
new film, ``Not One Less'' is about as pared-down as a movie can
get.
</P>
<P>
   It's a deceptively simple story about a 13-year-old Chinese
peasant girl named Wei who's assigned to be the substitute teacher
at a rural one-room school while the regular teacher spends a month
with his sick mother. Before he leaves, the schoolmaster offers her
some advice (``Don't write too small and don't write too big'') and
some incentive. Because of the dire economics of the region, he's
been losing students. If, when he returns, every single one of the
students is still attending class, he'll give her a bonus. Hence
the title.
</P>
<P>
   Wei, who's barely older than some of her charges, at first is at
something of a loss when it comes to classes. But she's determined
to earn that bonus. When 10-year-old Zhang Huike, the class scamp,
doesn't show up one day, she learns that he's been sent hind me
wondered, ``Where'd he come from?''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy: He came from the sloppy, who-cares-about-logic
school of Hollywood screenwriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joshua Jackson and Paul Walker. Rated PG-13 for
violence and brief sexuality. 1 hour, 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Fun, forgettable junk.

A SHOW OF JAPANESE ART WITH A LAVISH LINEAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan)  By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Griggs Burke is a third-generation Japanophile
and a second-generation collector, with these characteristics
descending on the matrilineal side. In the catalog for the large
and lavish exhibition of her collection of Japanese art at the
Metropolitan Museum, which runs through June 25, she writes of a
grandmother whose trips to Asia usually included stops in Japan.
She alludes to her childhood fascination with a black silk kimono
that her mother, Mary Livingston Griggs, brought back from her own
visit to Japan and wore when she posed for a portrait by Whistler.
</P>
<P>
   She describes other fruits of her mother's trip, particularly a
Japanese garden commissioned for the family's large Victorian house
in St. Paul and the influence of the Japanese belief in the
aesthetic potential of all objects. The mother lived by this belief
with a flamboyant ecumenicism: the Victorian house was retrofitted
with 18th-century French rooms and filled with art, artifacts and
furniture from around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   As indicated by the sweep and quality of this show, a partial,
revealingly biased survey of several millennia of Japanese art,
Burke's eclectic childhood environment did not sway her from her
special destiny.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, she saw Japan for herself, on the advice of Walter
Gropius. (She was thinking of building a house; he encouraged
familiarity with Japanese architecture before selecting an
architect.) From the vantage point of the present, this first
encounter with the Japanese way of life and art resembles a pebble
tossed into calm waters, creating ripples that have become larger
and more widely felt with each passing decade.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1954, Burke, with her husband, Jackson Burke, and, after
his death in 1975, on her own, has built the greatest private
collection of Japanese art outside Japan. The Burkes became
benefactors of Japanese scholarship, setting up a foundation that
dispenses study and travel grants and establishing the collection
in its own Manhattan apartment so that, for more than three
decades, it has been accessible to scholars, students, curators and
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Containing nearly 200 objects, this is the largest exhibition of
Japanese art in New York since the last show of works from the
Burke collection, at the Metropolitan in 1975. They range from
Neolithic ceramics from the third millennium B.C., to examples of
nanga painting (inspired by Chinese ink monochrome painting) dating
from the mid-15th to late-18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding in the first category is a large black vase from the
Kofun period (A.D. 300-538) with striking horizontal drips of glaze
that give it a sense of forward, torpedolike propulsion.
Outstanding in the second category is the ``Landscape After Xia
Gui,'' attributed to Tensho Shubun (active from 1414-1463), the
first master of Japanese monochrome painting, and ``Landscape of
the Four Seasons,'' by Kano Tan'yu (1602-1674), both characterized
by daring expanses of blank surface and misty washes. In contrast,
the surface of ``The Gathering of the Orchid Pavilion and Autumn
Festival,'' by Ike Taiga (1723-1776), is lush with deft brushwork.
</P>
<P>
   In between are large-scale Buddhist sculptures and exquisite
mandalas inspired by the sixth-century arrival of Buddhism from
China, handscrolls and hanging scrolls, extravagant Momoyama and
Edo period screens and lacquerware, both distinguished by rich
colors and gold leaf, and exquisitely rustic Edo tea bowls. There
are odd showstoppers, like Kato Nobukiyo's 1792 ink painting of
``Ten Rakan Examining a Painting of White-Robed Kannon,'' an image
of Buddhist disciples gathered around a painting-within-a-painting
of a bodhisattva in which every last pictorial element is
delineated in Chinese characters spelling out a section of the
``Lotus Sutra.''
</P>
<P>
   This show illuminates the cycles of research and development, of
borrowing and transformation, that characterize Japan's cultural
history. It brings the viewer into close contact with indelibly
Japanese qualities: the veneration of natural beauty that has its
origin in the Shinto religion; an appreciation, encouraged by
Shinto, of the rituals and objects of everyday life; and finally, a
vitality and expressiveness, and above all a feeling for materials,
that distinguish Japanese art from its Chinese models.
</P>
<P>
   These various qualities seem to meet in a Late Heian religious
sculpture, carved simply in wood, that personifies a Shinto deity
in human form. Such personification did not occur until after
Buddhism reached Japan and its hierarchy of depicted deities began
to influence Shinto. But while the god is shown in a Buddha-like
pose and has a squarish ascetic face, he is not entirely from
another world: his headdress and his scepter reflect secular
authority and possibly even the style of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting thing about the Burke collection, or at least
the selection displayed here, is that it seems to reflect a
typically Western bias about painting's superiority. Astoundingly,
more than three-quarters of the show's inclusions are
one-of-a-kind, two-dimensional works. At the same time, this
emphasis goes against the Western tendency to appreciate Japanese
culture primarily for its elevation of more lowly forms _ like
ceramics, lacquer and textiles _ to the level of high art while
limiting its two-dimensional achievement to well-known
accomplishments like woodblock prints and screens.
</P>
<P>
   Although the few ceramics and lacquers included here are
outstanding, they serve primarily as illuminating detours or points
of cross-reference along what is by and large an amazing
centuries-long progression of surfaces. Measurable in inches or in
yards, these surfaces have been variously drawn, painted or written
on, sometimes all three. By the time one reaches those magnificent
Momoyama and Edo screens, they have been placed in a context of
pictorial and calligraphic developments in a way rarely seen in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer will also have been exposed to an extraordinary
give-and-take: between Japanese and Chinese influences, between
religious and secular impulses and purposes, between the innovative
and the conservative, and the natural and the decorative.
</P>
<P>
   After the disconcerting variety of the first gallery, where five
periods, 40 centuries and several media are encompassed by two
dozen objects, the show begins to hit its stride. In the next
gallery, a few ultrarefined 10th- and 11th-century Late Heian works
are mixed in with the more plentiful, rambunctious works of the
13th- and 14th-century Kamakura period. Different as these two
periods were _ one dominated by a highly cultured aristocratic
elite, the other by pragmatic military provincials _ they were
marked by a turning away from China and the blossoming of cultural
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Among the displays, different Japanese motifs and conventions
seem to hatch before the eyes. Portraiture is evident in a small
Kamakura ink rendering of a poetry contest, where the battling
poets are portrayed as individuals, one clearly dismayed by
something the other has just recited. Early signs of caricature and
the grotesque, so central to later Japanese art, are visible in an
excerpt from a scroll that recounts the temptations of the young
Prince Siddhartha (who became the Buddha), showing him meditating
while set upon by hordes of fiendish, smoke-trailing devils.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   One sees the promise of the specifically Japanese landscape
basic to the Momoyama and Edo screens in a distinctive Kamakura
mandala that depicts two shrine complexes in a verdant park.
Buddhist-Shinto gods float in halolike mandorlas in the sky, but
the dramatically tilted aerial view, boxy architecture and natural
details like rolling hills, hovering clouds, deer and blooming
cherry trees all look to the future. So, in their way, do the two
pages from Late Heian poetry albums, scattered with the elegant
kano script that the Japanese distilled from the more difficult
Chinese writing in the ninth century.
</P>
<P>
   Kano script made possible the development of a secular Japanese
literature, beginning with such Late Heian classics as Lady
Murasaki's ``Tales of Genji.'' Genji's adventures, in turn,
inspired some of the earliest narrative scrolls, helping to set in
motion a pictorial style that would culminate in the Momoyama and
Edo screens.
</P>
<P>
   One also sees the germ of the screens in the album leaves
themselves: the calligraphy dances across unusually decorative
paper printed with patterns in mica and stamped with silver leaves.
This practice has its own apotheosis in the breathtaking early
17th-century handscrolls that mingle poetry inscribed by the
influential calligrapher Hon'ami Koetsu with the atmospheric gold
and silver landscape patterns of Tawaraya Sotatsu, who became one
of Edo's greatest screen painters.
</P>
<P>
   Not all roads lead to the great screens. After one
knee-weakening Edo-screen moment, dominated by monumental images of
curving bridges and spacious scenes from ``Genji'' (the latter
attributed to Sotatsu), come pleasantly minuscule echoes: a white
Mino ware bowl with the tiniest intimation of a figure on a bridge,
and Tosa Mitsunori's little album of white-on-white scenes from
Genji. Both are as affecting as anything else in this ravishing
show.

 &HT;    A world of influences in surprising Saint John
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 2.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT JOHN, New Brunswick _ The first thing a visitor notices,
undeniably, are the smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   Towering exhaust shafts atop area pulp mills and refineries loom
over this working-class city on the Bay of Fundy _ population,
125,000 _ like noxious shrines to the gods of commerce. Around
these parts, those gods are called Irving, the name of a local
family that made it big in shipping, timber, paper production and
oil. Visitors flying or driving into Saint John for the first time
may feel like they're entering the Newark of New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   But, to borrow the movie poster come-on from ``American
Beauty,'' look closer: Behind the mask of industry is a charming,
history-rich town that reflects a world of influences.
</P>
<P>
   Stroll along the Loyalist Trail, which visits historic sites in
the heart of downtown, and you may think you're in jolly old
London. Canada's oldest incorporated city, Saint John (spelled out
so the post office won't confuse it with St. John's in
Newfoundland) was founded in 1783 by British loyalists who
abandoned the states during the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The trail reflects the settlers' Anglo bent. Amble down the
paths in King's Square, an idyllic park laid out in the shape of
the Union Jack. Wander around the Loyalist Burial Grounds, where
settlers are stacked nine deep. And check out the street names in
the picturesque Trinity Royal district _ they include King, Queen,
Princess and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, pop into O'Leary's on Princess Street and you'll be
transported to downtown Dublin. In this raucous pub, and in other
neighborhood establishments such as the knickknack shop House of
Tara, you'll see the influence of the next culture to dominate
Saint John.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1800s, thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the
potato famine landed on Partridge Island, Canada's version of Ellis
Island, about two-thirds of a mile out in Saint John Harbour. Many
died under quarantine there _ you can still find the foundation of
a hospital and a cemetery on the deserted island. Today, their
descendants and subsequent Irish immigrants make up 60 percent of
Saint John's population.
</P>
<P>
   This is a town that celebrates St. Patrick's Week. Each year in
the days leading up to March 17, there are charity breakfasts for
the children of Belfast, rousing sets of Celtic music at O'Leary's,
Irish plays at the Imperial Theatre and traditional religious
observances at local churches.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Saint Johners with green in their veins and they'll tell you
the celebration doesn't end when the week's up. ``Every day is St.
Patrick's Day when you're Irish,'' says House of Tara owner
Anne-Marie Mullin, whose ancestors hail from County Claire.
</P>
<P>
   Stand on the corner of Germain and Princess streets in the
Trinity Royal district and you'll get the feeling you're in
Boston's Back Bay, or on a quiet side street on Manhattan's Upper
East Side. The elegant brownstones lining Germain were, in fact,
designed by architects from Boston and New York. They were brought
in to help rebuild the city after it was nearly destroyed by fire
in 1877, which started in a hay shed down on the wharf.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilt structures were done in the high Victorian style of
the time, with rounded windows and intricate ornamentation. On an
overcast day the street can look like a scene straight out of ``The
Alienist.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the more fresh-faced, touristy side of Saint John,
represented by Market Square and Brunswick Square, conjoined
shopping and entertainment complexes. The malls are connected by an
elevated, indoor pedestrian crossing that offers winterproof access
to stores, restaurants, an aquatic center and a hockey arena, home
to a farm team for the Calgary Flames. You'll also find two
must-see attractions.
</P>
<P>
   In Market Square, there's the New Brunswick Museum, a
three-story industry, natural history and art museum that rivals
institutions in cities many times the size of Saint John. One
exhibit, a series of huge globes, details the geographical
evolution of New Brunswick; another features the skeleton of
Delilah, a right whale who washed up on nearby Grand Manan Island
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Brunswick Square connects to the Old City Market, a sprawling
farmers' market, the oldest in Canada, that offers fresh seafood,
produce and meats, and souvenir trinkets and quick-stop cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this inviting mix of historical sites and easy-access
shopping, Saint John is a burgeoning tourist destination. This
summer, 85 cruise ships will visit, almost three times as many as
in 1999. Paula Harris, a spokeswoman for the Saint John port
authority, attributes the rise in part to a team effort by all the
Atlantic provinces to market themselves as alternatives to the
mundane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of people who are interested in going someplace
other than the standard cruise destinations like the Caribbean,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Local hospitality can't hurt either. The natives are invariably
good-natured and lack pretense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plain speaking is highly valued, as is the politeness of being
succinct,'' says Richard Vaughan, a Toronto playwright originally
from Saint John.
</P>
<P>
   Succinctly put, the people of this off-the-beaten path port
would like you to look their way. Smokestacks be darned.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Toronto _ If you're visiting here for only a couple of days,
there are plenty of gardens worth checking out within walking
distance of downtown hotels.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're lucky enough to manage an extended stay, the list
of must-stops can take you across Lake Ontario or into suburban
mainland towns, all within an hour's drive.

   Whether you garden or just lust over beautiful gardens, don't
miss these sites, beginning downtown and then venturing out. And
don't forget your best sneakers, some sunscreen and plenty of film.

<P>
   CASA LOMA
</P>
<P>
   AND SPADINA
</P>
<P>
   There's a lovely tale of civic support behind the beauty of the
gardens of Casa Loma, the majestic castle in the heart of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Financial ruin tints the history of the biggest private home
ever built in Canada, and the city's most famous landmark after the
CN Tower _ the world's tallest building. The 5-acre estate is the
legacy of Sir Henry Mill Pellatt, a prominent Canadian financier,
who lost his fortune in 1914 just as he was completing the castle.
The city seized the property for back taxes, and the gardens
succumbed to the forces of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the gardens are a prime attraction, thanks to a
restoration by the Garden Club of Toronto. A vaulted marble
conservatory overlooks a formal terraced garden accessed by a pair
of stone stairways at the east and west ends re-created from their
original stone. The property was redesigned as a series of eight
specialty gardens, including upper and lower terraces, an 80-foot
rose arbor that leads to a secret garden, perennial gardens and a
woodlands walk. The gardens feature a century-old ginkgo tree, rare
Japanese tree peonies, 100 varieties of roses and more than 200
types of perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Loma, at 1 Austin Terrace, is open 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. daily
from May through October. Guided garden tours are available.
Information: 416-923-1171.
</P>
<P>
   While here, wander next door to historic Spadina, an 1866
mansion that was once home to financier James Austin. Its Victorian
gardens, also restored by the Garden Club of Toronto, offer a
magnificent view of the city and include an interesting mix of
fruit orchards, grape arbors and cutting gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the house and gardens, at 285 Spadina Road, is $5.
Hours vary so call 416-392-6910 for information.

   ART AND MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   GARDENS
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's waterfront is a hub of activity because its
restaurants, parks and docks make it so pedestrian friendly. Amid
the noise of streetcars and other traffic are 13 oases of
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, the Ontario Arts Council and Sheridan
Nurseries developed this string of unique gardens near Harborfront
Centre. Artists and landscape designers were selected to create
spaces with concepts from the lofty to the whimsical. Six of the
gardens are seasonal installations, while the rest are permanent
and feature metal sculptures as focal points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came by to see the gardens, but it's almost like you're in
an art gallery, too,'' said Carolyn Stokes, visiting the city from
Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest gardens is the six-block Music Garden created
by landscape designer Julie Moir Messery in collaboration with
renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma. The design was inspired by Bach's
``Suites for Unaccompanied Cello,'' and each section corresponds to
a movement in the piece. Winding pathways within some sections of
the public park mimic the shape of musical clefs.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO ISLANDS
</P>
<P>
   Ward's and Algonquin islands _ two of the 15 lying east of the
city _ are as rich in history as they are in plants.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th century, Toronto residents seeking an escape
from city life built cottages here to fish, skate and sail their
iceboats. But much of that lifestyle changed in 1953 as the Metro
Toronto Council made a radical shift in policy toward the islands
in efforts to modernize a retreat frozen in time. The city
transferred its land leases to the council, and businesses were
sold and houses demolished. As the leases came up, the city
reclaimed the land for parks. Residents protested the dissolution
of their community and in 1993 established a trust that procured
99-year leases on the remaining property.
</P>
<P>
   Today, competition for the land, with its panoramic view of the
city, is so stiff some buyers wait 10 years for a lot in the
community spanning the contiguous Ward's and Algonquin islands.
Sandy bike paths and dirt alleys form a grid on the vehicle-less
islands, accessed by ferry and boats. Many of the nearly 300
residents are artists who years ago found the seclusion a haven for
painting or sculpting, and their pieces make quite the statement in
some of the cottage gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Here, gardeners emphasize plants that thrive in the moist, sandy
soil warmed by the lake. Wildflowers, milkweed and goldenrod are
staples, as are foxgloves, forget-me-nots, wild roses and water
hyacinths. And the gardeners don't hesitate to share a bloom or two
with admiring passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of their gardens can be enjoyed from the street,
residents leave their gates ajar every other year for public tours.
This year's Toronto Islands Garden Tours is in August. Call

   PICOV'S WATER
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN CENTRE
</P>
<P>
   AND FISHERIES
</P>
<P>
   Any gardener away from home for long periods experiences soil
withdrawal. For many, the antidote is to shop for the garden when
they can't work in it. Picov's Water Garden Centre and Fisheries in
suburban Ajax is one of those must-stops.
</P>
<P>
   At 10,000 square feet, the family-owned operation is the largest
water garden retailer in North America, offering everything from
state-of-the-art pumps and equipment to plants and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Brightly colored Japanese koi have become popular ingredients
for home water gardens, employee Tina Carpenter said. One frequent
question is how the fish survive Toronto's winters. Holding tanks
are 3 to 6 feet deep so that the fish have room to hibernate at the
bottom, where the water is warmer. (Homeowners learn quickly to
avoid shallow ponds.)
</P>
<P>
   Picov's, at 380 Kingston Road E., is open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily.

   CULLEN GARDENS AND
</P>
<P>
   MINIATURE VILLAGE
</P>
<P>
   The Floral Peacock, with a 55-foot-wide tail made of 3,400
plants, seems more like a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade float than
a horticultural attraction. But it's the most photographed exhibit
at Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village, a quirky family attraction
in nearby Whitby that's part display garden and part amusement
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come mostly to see the flowers,'' said owner Len
Cullen, who opened the site 20 years ago. The 1,600-square-foot
miniature village is a model of Main Street in the typical southern
Ontario small town. The outdoor display, similar to a gigantic
railroad garden, contains more than 160 models crafted at one-inch
scale. The ``town'' is populated by 600 little people staged in
various aspects of everyday life. Boats zip across a pond, while a
train chugs through a tunnel beneath your feet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Cullen added gardens, and today the park is
known as much for its kaleidoscope of colorful annuals as for its
miniature village. Beds and baskets overflow with red, green and
purple coleus, chartreuse sweet potato vines, red impatiens and
orange marigolds.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that Floral Peacock. The 65-foot-long form,
made of half-inch rebar, is stuffed with 9,000 plants that extend
to the ground, where its spread of ``feathers'' stretches along a
hillside. Two dozen plants form the feathers, including ageratum,
impatiens, dusty miller, marigolds, begonias and cleome.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen's wacky world of plants doesn't end with the first frost.
``A big time for us is Halloween, when we dress the place up with
lots of spooks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fall, thousands of chrysanthemums take center stage. In April
and May, daffodils, irises and 80,000 tulips scream ``spring'' to
winter-weary Canadians, while in June, the park is ablaze with a
rainbow of 10,000 fragrant roses.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens, at 300 Taunton Road W., are open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
daily, April through December. Admission, $12. Call 905-686-1600.
</P>
<P>
   ROYAL BOTANICAL
</P>
<P>
   GARDENS
</P>
<P>
   If you have time to visit only a couple of gardens outside
Toronto, this should top your list.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Botanical Gardens, established in 1929, has blossomed
into Canada's largest botanical garden. The site, along the western
tip of Lake Ontario near Hamilton, boasts the largest collection of
fragrant lilacs, 100,000 spring-flowering bulbs, a children's
Discovery Garden, a natural habitat and international center for
plant research.
</P>
<P>
   The property spans 2,700 acres, yet only about 300 are
cultivated. The rest is a natural sanctuary sheltering many plants,
birds and mammals associated with those of the southeastern United
States, thanks to the lake-warmed climate.
</P>
<P>
   The developed areas include the Laking Garden, which features an
English border with 600 cultivars of waist-high bearded irises, new
perennials and ecological, or low-maintenance, plantings.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Rock Garden, a landscaped amphitheater on the
site of an old abandoned granite pit that erupts each spring with
thousands of tulips. ``But one thing we're doing is putting in more
and more perennials,'' said Chris Graham, the gardens' horticulture
director. ``It doesn't make sense to bring in so many annuals each
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other major areas are the Rose Garden and the Arboretum,
home to more than 800 varieties of lilacs.
</P>
<P>
   And for those gardeners seeking practical ideas, there's the
World of Botany Garden, containing four beds representing the four
corners of the world, each filled with flowering perennials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created demonstration borders here with the hope that
homeowners can replicate them in their own gardens,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Botanical Gardens are open 9 a.m. to dusk daily.
Admission: $7. Information: 905-527-1158.
</P>
<P>
   NIAGARA PARKS BOTANICAL GARDENS
</P>
<P>
   Niagara's not just for honeymooners; it's for folks with plant
passions, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara Parks Botanical Gardens, a good day trip while in
Toronto, straddles 100 acres along the Niagara River. Don't miss
its Victorian rose garden, display vegetable garden and ``Annual
Showcase,'' designed as an idea forum for home gardeners. Save
enough time for taking in the Butterfly Conservatory, too, which
houses 2,000 native and exotic species.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens are open from dawn to dusk daily. Admission is free,
except for the Butterfly Conservatory ($8 adults, $4 children).
Information: 877-642-7275.

   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   5 Oscars: picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), director, original
screenplay, cinematography. The ever-more-remarkable Spacey plays a
man caught in a midlife limbo in this scarily disturbing, daringly
hilarious, well-written and well-acted comedy-drama. It's a
hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully Screwed Up.
(ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. Toying with big concepts _ the nature of identity, the
lust for celebrity, sexual desire, the illusion of free will, it's
playfully profound one moment, gonzo the next. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi,
</P>
<P>
   Vin Diesel and Ron Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry
Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to
make their first million before getting their first wrinkle pays
onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's a bracing reminder that
greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' R (sex, profanity, nudity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hilary Swank
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar: actress (Hilary Swank). This intense true story of Teena
Brandon, a 21-year-old woman who believed she was a man. After
cutting her hair and reversing her name, she hung out with some
hard-drinking rednecks in rural Nebraska, which didn't work out.
The movie is a bit low-budget, but it's still a remarkable film.
(ERG)1 hour, 54 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscars: adapted screenplay, supporting actor (Michael Caine).
John Irving adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr. Larch
(Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal abortions in his Maine
orphanage. In the second, less-engaging half, Larch's protege,
Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), runs off to learn about the world.
(ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Danny DeVito,
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler, Neve Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   As we get to know Mona (Bette Midler) through flashbacks, we
quickly understand why nobody is disturbed by her demise. It turns
out that the Yugo in which she took a header into the Hudson River
had its brakes sabotaged. Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito)
begins investigating her murder and finds that everyone in town had
something against Mona. (Hap Ernstein, Palm Beach (Fla.) Post) At
metro theaters. 1 hour, 30 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Emperor and the Assassin'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gong Li
</P>
<P>
   and Li Xuejian.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of a nation, Chinese-style. Set in 221 B.C., Chen
Kaige's film tells the true story of how the would-be emperor of
all China sets about unifying the then-existing six kingdoms into
one. Though long and occasionally confusing, the movie has the
panoramic impact of a Kurosawa epic, the bloody violence of a Greek
tragedy and the human intrigue of a Shakespearean drama. (ERG) 2
hours, 40 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts delivers in a funny, down-to-earth film about an
everyday mom with business spunk who, without a law degree but with
a lot of pluck, helps crash a big-time company responsible for
devastating health problems in a small, dirt-poor town. Call it
``Working-Class Girl.'' (Bob Longino)2 hours, 11 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' R (bloody violence and raw language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Devon Sawa,
</P>
<P>
   Ali Larter and Kerr Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' aims for young audiences with an
``X-Files: The Wonder Years'' science/suspense plot about a kid who
escaped death from a plane crash and learns more than mortals
should about death. Our hero (Devon Sawa) and six others find
they're still targeted for death. The Grim Reaper, feeling cheated,
has plans for them. (Chris Hewitt, Knight Ridder Newspapers) 1
hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghost Dog:
</P>
<P>
   The Way of the Samurai'' R (strong violence and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Forest Whitaker
</P>
<P>
   and John Tormey.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jim Jarmusch takes the overused gangster genre and
makes it compellingly unfamiliar. Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker), who
makes a fascinating lone wolf, is a gun-for-hire who follows the
philosophy of the samurai, especially their utter devotion to their
masters. His is Louie (John Tormey), a tubby, graying soldier
working for a gang boss. Louie saved him from thugs as a teenager.
(SM)1 hour, 54 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity and drugs
</P>
<P>
   content, sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar: supporting acrtress (Angeline Jolie). Based on Susanna
Kaysen's memoir about the two years she spent in the late '60s at
an upscale mental hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone
reminiscent of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Angelina Jolie
provides the fireworks in a fiercely showy turn as a charismatic
sociopath. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing and
beautifully acted adaptation of Stephen King's prison novel. Tom
Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest prisoner, a
mysterious hulk played by Duncan, has mystical powers of healing.
(SM)
</P>
<P>
   3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Here on Earth'' PG-13 (sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris Klein,
</P>
<P>
   Leelee Sobieski and Josh Hartnett.
</P>
<P>
   A limp and clueless variation on ``Love Story.'' Leelee
Sobieski, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett star as kids in a love
triangle. Trapped in this hermetically sealed setting, with a
script that would run 10 minutes if the cliches were yanked out of
it, they can't win. (SM) 1 hour, 37 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Iben Hjejle
</P>
<P>
   and Jack Black.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly dumped by his longtime girlfriend, record-store owner
Rob (John Cusack) rhetorically asks himself, ``What came first _
music, or the misery?'' In other words, does he listen to songs
about heartbreak because he's miserable, or is he miserable. ``High
Fidelity'' is as smart as it is enjoyable. It's a great date-movie
about dating. (SM) 1 hour, 54 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' PG ( sci-fi violence and mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gary Sinise,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle.
</P>
<P>
   Brian De Palma's Red Planet opus is too much like other films
(``Contact,'' ``The Abyss'' and, especially, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey''), but it's still a decent popcorn movie packed with
thrills and sharp special effects. Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Connie
Nielsen and Jerry O'Connell are part of an astronaut team trying to
rescue others lost on Mars. (SM) 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' PG (violent content and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frankie Muniz,
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late Willie Morris' memoir about growing up in
small-town 1940s Mississippi, this family film is a remembrance of
how things can pass from our lives but never really leave us.
Nine-year-old Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz) is
a shy only child whose life changes when his mom (Diane Lane) gives
him a Jack Russell terrier puppy, despite dad's (Kevin Bacon)
objection. (ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Next Best Thing'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Madonna
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue, the melodramatic situations, the performances all
scream ``Phony!'' Madonna and Rupert Everett play best pals (she's
straight, he's gay), who end up raising a child together. Some bad
movies, of course, are perversely enjoyable. This isn't one of
them. (Robert W. Butler, Kansas City (Mo.) Star)1 hour, 40 minutes.
D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ninth Gate'' R ( violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp
</P>
<P>
   and Lena Olin.
</P>
<P>
   A major disappointment from Roman Polanski, the film stars
Johnny Depp in a tale of old books, the devil and the gateway to
satanic powers. Imagine one of those seasonal Halloween horror
houses, but designed by librarians. And what do you get at the end
of the trek? The spectacle of a bunch of rich twits in black robes,
play-acting a satanic mass. (SM) 2 hours, 13 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Not One Less'' Unrated (designed for
</P>
<P>
   mature audiences, subtitles)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wei Minzhi.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned director Zhang Yimou, who's better known for such
sumptuous efforts as ``Raise the Red Lantern,'' presents this
simple film. In a poor rural Chinese village, a 13-year-old girl is
hired to be the substitute teacher. She'll receive a bonus if all
the students are still there when the regular teacher returns. A
small, pared-down film with deep emotional and political
undercurrents. (ERG)1 hour, 46 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar: best animated short. This 'toon, based on Ernest
Hemingway's novel, is, like the author's word choice, deceptively
simple and strikingly beautiful. It's everything a moviegoer would
expect, but didn't get, from ``Fantasia 2000.'' (Bob Longino) 40
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' R (profanity and sci-fi violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel
</P>
<P>
   and Radha Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual. ``Pitch Black'' is just
the latest sci-fi rip-off of ``Aliens,'' packed with caricatures.
In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to
explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver
the thrills. (SM)1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Price of Glory'' PG-13 ( violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and brief drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jimmy Smits
</P>
<P>
   and Jon Seda.
</P>
<P>
   A boxing movie that goes down for the count. Jimmy Smits stars
in another retelling of the age-old story of sons struggling to
please a demanding father. It's about as dramatically subtle as a
head-butt. (SM) 1 hour, 57 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' R (sex, violence, nudity, and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad. ... Ben
Affleck plays an ex-con who poses as his former cell mate in order
to bed babelicious Charlize Theron and gets caught in a nasty mess
with her psycho brother (Gary Sinise), who wants him to help rob a
casino. With John Frankenheimer as the director, the movie is
always watchable, but sometimes it's just plain ludicrous. (ERG)1
hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado'' PG (mild thematic material and
profanity.)
</P>
<P>
   Animated film featuring
</P>
<P>
   the voices of Kevin Kline
</P>
<P>
   and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Not cute enough for kids, not clever enough for adults,
DreamWorks' latest animated feature is gorgeous but curiously dull.
Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline voice a couple of 16th century scam
artists looking for the Lost City of Gold in the New World. The
movie fuses visual splendor with unsteady storytelling and tone.
The waterfalls are beautiful. But the movie is a washout. (SM)1
hour, 23 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo Must Die'' R (violence, some profanity
</P>
<P>
   and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jet Li and Aaliyah.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the martial arts genre, the violence is strong. This
is Jet Li's first English-language film and it has a great look and
an edgy feel, along with some broad swaths of humor. (Kevin Thomas,
Los Angeles Times)1 hour, 55 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream anymore, but it's a decent wrap-up of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween get-up. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM)1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls'' PG-13 (violence and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joshua Jackson
</P>
<P>
   and Paul Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In this conspiracy thriller for the Clearasil set, WB's Joshua
Jackson plays an average Joe sucked into an elite, monied club. It
comes with a price, though. Like he can't ever get out. (SM) At
metro theaters. 1 hour, 47 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' PG (mild peril and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A lame kids movie about Syracuse, N.Y., schoolkids trying to
extend one out-of-school snow day into two. Chevy Chase plays a TV
weatherman suffering all kinds of humiliation and Chris Elliott
appears as the ominous Snow Plow Man with bad teeth. (Robert
Denerstein, Denver Rocky Mountain News) At metro theaters. 1 hour,
30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence, profanity, brief
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon,
</P>
<P>
   Jude Law
</P>
<P>
   and Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome but flawed adaption of novelist Patricia Highsmith's
twisty thriller. Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels
to Italy to bring back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his
lifestyle and committing murder. (SM) At discount theaters.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 18 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG) 1 hour, 16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking the Dead'' R (sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup
</P>
<P>
   and Jennifer Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   A haunting romance in which an aspiring politician (Billy
Crudup) in the early '80s thinks his radical beloved (Jennifer
Connelly), killed in a car bombing in the '70s, may be back from
the dead. Crudup is superb and Connelly is effective in a more
limited role. The movie is a little too earnest, a little slow, but
it's more than recommended to those who love fine acting. (ERG)1
hour, 43 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever It Takes'' PG-13(sexual situations and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Shane West
</P>
<P>
   and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe
</P>
<P>
   Very loosely based on ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' this generic
teen-hormone comedy has two seniors who help each other woo the
girl of their dreams and/or lust. The cast is pleasant enough, but
if you saw a single John Hughes movie in the '80s, you've seen this
territory covered with more style and insight. If your kid is
begging to go, do whatever it takes to palm him or her off on a
clueless grandparent. (ERG)1 hour, 32 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' R (sexuality, nudity, and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry
</P>
<P>
   and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy with a body count and familiar mafioso premise, but
with enough twists to eventually overcome its familiarity. Bruce
Willis stars as a hit man. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' he doesn't
seem to mind playing genial straight man to his funnier cast mates:
Matthew Perry, Patricia Arquette and Kevin Pollak. (SM)1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Douglas,
</P>
<P>
   Tobey Maguire
</P>
<P>
   and Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas plays scruffy, scattered English lit professor
Grady Tripp in director Curtis Hanson's (``L.A. Confidential'')
well-written version of Michael Chabon's novel. Part satire and
part coming-of-age tale of a man in his 50s, the film is full of
episodes and digressions that are as interesting as the final
destination. It's also a feast for actors, who make the most of
tiny, telling moments. (SM)1 hour, 57 minutes. B

 &HT;    As the weather warms, Toronto touts a somethig-for-all blaze of
blooms
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 2.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The narrow, sandy streets wander past funky little
gardens ablaze with towering sunflowers, rampant petunias and perky
dahlias, all with heads held so high you'd swear you could see them
nod hello.
</P>
<P>
   Behind these postage-stamp-size Edens are vine-shrouded
clapboard cottages with front porches sporting everything from
ratty old recliners to broken-down washing machines. It's a
neighborhood so eclectic, so earthy, you'd expect to find it in the
villages of the English countryside or the rural hamlets of the
Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   But a sudden breeze off the water jolts your attention to
another locale _ the gleaming modern skyline of Toronto, just 15
minutes by ferry across Lake Ontario. There, along the banks of
Canada's largest city, are small public parks that double as
pristine gardens celebrating music and the arts with giant
contemporary metal sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Among Torontonians, interpretations of what constitutes a garden
are as varied as the city's quilt of ethnic neighborhoods. To some,
gardens are those quaint cottage retreats across the lake on Ward's
and Algonquin islands. To others, they're the historic grounds of
the city's landmark castle, Casa Loma, restored in 1987 by the
Garden Club of Toronto for $1.5 million. Many point to the Royal
Botanical Gardens, which boast the world's largest lilac
collection, while some insist you can't beat the gardens at Niagara
Falls, which shower visitors with a showcase of thousands of
annuals each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's green thumbs pride themselves not only on the variety
of their gardens but on the city's growing sense of ecological
awareness, emphasizing natural habitat restoration, native plants
and community spirit, said Janet Davis, garden columnist for the
Toronto Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The area enjoys a growing season much like that of Chicago.
Brown barren yards turn into artists' palettes in April as hardy
perennials return with their spattering of color, bidding a long
winter farewell. But the true gardening season doesn't unfurl until
late May _ when all risk of a late freeze has passed _ and lasts
until the first frost of October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the start to be the Victoria Day (May 24) holiday
weekend, when you're generally safe to put out annuals. That's when
the nurseries here get incredibly busy,'' Davis said. ``After that,
June, July and August in the city are just beautiful in
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the thaw begin.

 &HT;    At Inn on the Cove, you're part of the family
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT JOHN, New Brunswick _ Rigid with anticipation, the dog
eyes the stone in Willa Mavis' hand. With a casual flick she tosses
it toward the surf, where it lands among thousands of rocks of
similar size and color.
</P>
<P>
   Bosun, a 60-pound Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever, scampers
after it and soon returns to deposit the very same (though
saliva-soaked) rock at our feet. Again and again, Willa throws it
and Bosun brings it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got such a nose!'' Willa exclaims. ``Our vet says he
would make a good narc dog.''
</P>
<P>
   I have joined Willa and Bosun on their evening walk around the
grounds of Inn on the Cove, the bed-and-breakfast she runs with her
husband, Ross Mavis. An appealingly quirky melange of Victorian and
1950s-style architecture, the inn sits on a 3-acre climb above Sand
Cove, a tranquil inlet on the Bay of Fundy west of downtown Saint
John.
</P>
<P>
   It is, the Mavises feel, home. Stay here a few nights and you'll
no doubt feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we're on McLaren's Beach, a gravelly strand of shoreline
about 100 yards below the inn. A hillock to the north obscures
Saint John's industrialized skyline. Far out in the bay, you can
see the outline of Partridge Island, where thousands of Irish
immigrants landed during the potato famine of the 1840s. Seals loll
on the rocks on and around the island _ if you look through the
telescope in the inn's kitchen you can spot them. They look like
little wiggly sausages.
</P>
<P>
   From the beach, the land behind the inn rises in terraces. The
first holds a sheep pen _ Ross and Willa sheep-sit for friends who
travel during the summer. On the second tier is a filled-in
swimming pool, built and subsequently abandoned by the inn's
previous owners, who found the upkeep too costly. Also here is the
patio where the Mavises film summer installments of their
cable-access cooking show, ``Tide's Table.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the inn itself, which is similarly tiered, rising
four multicolored stories from sub-basement to eaves.
</P>
<P>
   Willa looks up at her dream house in awe. ``From the front, it
looks so modest. But when I look at it from this side, I sometimes
get overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple bought the place in 1991, shortly after they married.
``We found it in the classifieds, can you believe it?'' Willa, 54,
says. ``It's like it was sitting here waiting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The central part of the house was built at the turn of the
century. A local construction magnate bought it in the '50s and
added a front bedroom, a back den and a kitchen (along with that
pool).
</P>
<P>
   Willa handled decorating duties, playing to the inn's eclectic
look. Each of the five guest rooms has its own personality _ Room 3
upstairs has the feel of a Cape Cod beach house, with white wicker
furniture, an ocean view and a bay-blue color scheme. Room 1 is
darker, more masculine, with a stout brass bed and oak fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   The homiest place in the house is the den, or Ocean Room, which
overlooks the water. It's here that guests sit down for sumptuous
breakfasts, stealing glimpses of the bay as they tuck into Ross'
rich egg-and-cheese breakfast pudding or his tart-sweet cranberry
orange muffins. Ross is head chef, though both Mavises are handy
with a skillet. Besides hosting the TV cooking show, the couple
have authored a cookbook, also titled ``Tide's Table,'' and are set
to release a second on outdoor cooking this month. In between
breaking eggs, Ross will let Bosun out to fetch the morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of innkeepers strive to make their accommodations homey,
but any traveler who's ever been met at the door by a plastic smile
knows that a lot of times the exertion shows. The Mavises make it
look effortless. Their interactions with guests are chummy without
being intrusive or fake. ``There's a fine balance between warmth
and overdoing it,'' Ross, 58, says. ``We like to do things with a
little bit of class.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, they focus on little extras. There's a dish of bridge
tokens on the table next to the door _ guests, or even curious
visitors, are invited to take one to pay the toll on their way into
Saint John. There are no phones in the rooms, but guests are
invited to use the one in the Ocean Room to call anywhere for free.
A tin of homemade cookies rests on the kitchen counter, and this
summer, Willa plans to offer jars of her homemade straw-
</P>
<P>
   berry-rhubarb jam.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hanley loves the inn's laid-back atmosphere. This is the
third visit in five years for the fisheries enforcement clerk, up
for the weekend from St. Andrews, 70 miles southwest, with her
friend Rita O'Rourke. Both are recovering from recent maladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get away,'' says Hanley, 50, warming herself by
the Ocean Room fireplace. ``It's like an escape from reality. It's
so relaxing to just sit by the fire and forget about the
hustle-bustle of the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Chimes in O'Rourke, 63: ``The owners certainly have the gift of
hospitality.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so, in fact, that I'm sure I'm not the first guest to
try to adopt the family pet. On the final day of my stay, the
Mavises let me take Bosun out for a walk on my own. After a
leisurely hike down the path that leads into neighboring Irving
Nature Park, we head to McLaren's Beach.
</P>
<P>
   I want to see if Bosun will fetch for me as he does for Willa.
So I heave a small lump of rust-colored sandstone as far as I can,
into a heap of countless shore rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bosun bolts after it but overshoots the landing point by about
10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He wanders around, sniffing the wind for the scent. When he
starts to trot the opposite way I think about calling him back, but
suddenly he stops, reverses and goes right to the target. He scoops
the rock up in his jaws and deposits it, slobber-soaked, at my
feet.
</P>
<P>
   At the Inn on the Cove, hospitality runs in the family.

 &HT;    `The 70's' explores the hedonistic decade that brought us to
today
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 2.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In five years, from 1971 to 1975, I directly experienced EST,
Gestalt therapy, bioenergetics, rolfing, massage, jogging, health
foods, tai chi, Esalen, hypnotism, modern dance, meditation, Silva
Mind Control, Arica, acupuncture, sex therapy, Reichian therapy and
More House. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The man who ran this gantlet and wrote those words was none
other than Jerry Rubin, baton twirler in the revolutionary marching
band a decade earlier. Revolution, it turned out, was less urgent
than self-actualization. The gassy rhetoric that fueled the
protests and politics of the '60s long ago fizzled, and even the
music of those years is beginning to sound quaint. The civil rights
acts of 1964 and 1965 survive as testaments, but to the very system
that was under siege. By decade's end, it had become ugly carnival,
tatterdemalion white kids running about like scamps. Nothing
mattered more at the time than the perpetuity of the moment. The
moment, alas, came and went.
</P>
<P>
   What followed could hardly be more ironic. The hedonism and
self-spelunking of the '70s _ so easy to satirize at the time _
would leave a deeper imprint on American life than all those campus
sit-ins, ``The Port Huron Statement,'' ``The Strawberry
Statement,'' ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' or any
number of forgotten shibboleths of the '60s. (Wouldn't most people
have to be told that the author of ``The Strawberry Statement'' was
not Darryl but a Columbia University student named James Kunen?)
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, as David Frum's subtitle qualifies it, the
lives we live today are rooted in social changes that took place in
the decade that saw us eating granola, listening to James Taylor
and Jimmy Buffett, sitting in gas lines, witnessing the resignation
of a disgraced president, abandoning the idea of marriage until
death do us part, jogging not just for healthy recreation but on
the moral principle of fitness and low resting pulse rates.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the '70s, never the '60s, could magazines like People
and Self have been created. If the '60s saw the flowering of free
love, the '70s gave us _ briefly _ the legitimation of open
marriage. ``If it comes down to your marriage or your identity,''
the authors of ``Open Marriage'' wrote, ``we think your identity is
more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The brave new world of connubiality that George and Nena O'Neill
espoused in 1972 (they later had second thoughts) was a little
further than most of their readers wanted to venture. But the genie
of self-realization was out of the bottle. And so the divorce rate
_ one marriage in 20 through the first 65 years of this century _
was knocking on the door of 50 percent by the end of the decade. As
Frum writes, ``A society in which people are encouraged to put
themselves first is not likely to be a society in which many people
celebrate their golden wedding anniversaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Frum, a frequent contributor to The Weekly Standard magazine,
The Wall Street Journal and National Public Radio's ``Morning
Edition,'' might be the most acute social commentator writing
today. He sees how the new is transformed into the now _ and why
social change and technological change do not travel on parallel
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is often said that we live in a time of unusually rapid
change,'' he writes. ``If we are referring to economic and
technological change, this isn't true.'' When long-distance phone
calls are part of everyday life and even laymen have a fair
understanding of DNA, most people can ``take the Internet and Dolly
the Cloned Sheep in stride.'' Indeed, little that's happened since
1970 has been so astonishing as what Americans witnessed earlier in
the century: the advent of air travel, motion pictures and
television, the control of infectious diseases through antibiotics,
interstate highways and the automobile, the birth control pill and
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   It's other changes that are more bewildering. A Rip van Winkle
who nodded off in 1970 and awoke this morning would wonder where he
was: women sleeping in military barracks, the percentage of babies
born out of wedlock rising from 11 percent in 1970 to 32 percent in
1996, magazines flaunting homoerotic advertising, smoking
proscribed, the mainline Protestant churches losing their
franchise, children going off to day care and ``middle-aged men
going to work in khaki pants and baseball caps.''
</P>
<P>
   He would see, in short, a world turned upside down, but socially
more than technologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live,'' Frum writes, ``in a world made new, and made new
not by new machines, but by new feelings, new thoughts, new
manners, new ways.'' And in all that newness, nothing has been more
transforming _ for better or worse _ than the priority of the self.
It was in the '70s that Phil Donahue appointed himself therapist at
large. It was in the '70s that the self-help market for books took
off. Whatever else you did with your life, you first looked out for
No. 1. The effects extended beyond the personal: ``People bear
fewer children in economically troubled times. But the Americans of
the 1970s did not merely postpone children, as the Americans of the
1930s did. They actually changed their minds about wanting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pendulums shift sooner or later. The self-seeking of the '70s
has brought us Dr. Laura as knuckle-rapping national scold. Women
are forsaking the careers they thought they wanted in order to have
children, and skeptics ask whether ``self-esteem'' is really the
answer to all of life's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hardly conceivable that it will swing all the way back.
The barricades that were stormed in the '60s are museum pieces, and
the gaudy figures of that time a gallery of cartoon characters. Not
so the new way of looking at life that emerged a few years later.
It is, for better or worse, the way we live now, and anyone reading
David Frum's witty retrospective knows there is enough reason for
discontent to move on to something newer.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST LOOK
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from ``How We Got Here: The 70's''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there was a time when Americans thought of
themselves _ and were thought of by others _ as a taciturn people.
The Puritan heritage and the rigors of frontier life had instilled
in Americans a mistrust of garrulity, of the blatherskite, of the
flibbertigibbet. ``Speak not but what may benefit yourself or
others; avoid trifling conversation,'' urged Benjamin Franklin in
his autobiography, and even into the mid-twentieth century,
Americans wanted to think of their heroes as men of few words, like
Gary Cooper or John Wayne. But the public display of one's
suffering, one's wrongs, one's pitiableness, one's misfortunes,
which would have seemed shameful, ignoble, even disgusting before
World War II, became in the 1970s the distinctive American national
style. Don't bottle it up; you have a right to tell others how you
feel. It was, said the author Tom Wolfe, the undeclared motto of
the 1970s: ``Let's talk about me!''

 &HT;    A wealth of wildlife and grand vistas await in Bay of Bundy
welcome

<P>
   OVER FUNDY NATIONAL PARK, New Brunswick _ ``Keep an eye out for
moose tracks,'' shouts Heinz Limpert over the thup-thup of the
helicopter blades.
</P>
<P>
   He lowers the chopper to within a hundred feet of the treetops,
then tilts it passenger side down to give me an unimpeded look.
Gripping the seat beneath me, I lean over and peer into a dense
stretch of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   It is a frigid morning in March, and snow still lies in patches
on the ground between the towering blue spruce. We're near the edge
of the Bay of Fundy, its famously fluctuating tide now at its
lowest level, laying bare a mile or more of bay floor. Behind us
are Hopewell Rocks _ impossibly stacked sandstone pillars created
by the sluicing bay. Ahead, over a few rolls in this undulating
landscape, looms Saint John, New Brunswick's oldest, largest and
most industrialized city, its skyline a dissonant panorama of
stately church spires and belching smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   Just now, though, I only have eyes for moose.
</P>
<P>
   And Limpert knows where to look. The 59-year-old German pilot
tracks the movements of moose and deer through this rugged terrain
for New Brunswick's Department of Natural Resources, when he's not
squiring the occasional tourist around in his chopper. Out of the
corner of my eye I see him pointing, and I follow his finger. It
leads to a long, crooked column of deep hoof prints in the snow.
Another set of tracks crosses it; yet another crosses the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll be able to pick one out,'' Limpert bellows. ``The
snow makes it easier to see them, but if they're lying down they
may blend in with the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it must be nap time for the moose population. We make
several circles over the area, paying special attention to large
groves of spruce seedlings planted by local timber companies.
(``They like to feed on the young trees because they're more
tender,'' Limpert explains.)
</P>
<P>
   But I'll see no moose today. It's just as well. I have already
witnessed so many eye-popping sights on this buzz over a sliver of
New Brunswick's Fundy coast, which spans 220 miles between the
borders of Maine and Nova Scotia, that I'm starting to get sore
sockets.
</P>
<P>
   Every turn of the head brings another astonishing vista. The
craggy, plunging cliffs of Black Point and Cape Enrage. The wild
splash of the Big Salmon river, swollen with winter runoff. The
picture-puzzle-perfect fishing village of St. Martins, with its
white clapboard churches, covered bridges and little red
lighthouse. And the gorgeous, sun-infused emerald of the bay
itself, the banks of Nova Scotia hazy on its horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Later, back on terra firma, I'll tramp through a couple of
coastal nature parks and discover that the view is just as dizzying
with my feet on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   New Brunswick is a place of vast, untouched beauty _ a little
too untouched for many in the tourism industry here. Slightly
smaller than Maine, with a population roughly that of Fulton County
(about 725,000), the laid-back province isn't exactly the first
place that springs to the minds of travelers planning a Canada
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Nova Scotia, with its ruggedly handsome Cape Breton
Island and popular Cabot Trail, is sexier. Newfoundland, with its
edge-of-North America mystique, is more extreme. And there are
always the big-city, big-ticket destinations: Toronto, Montreal and
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, visitors have trickled in, whether to whale-watch off the
islands that guard the mouth of the bay, to moose-watch in
51,000-acre Fundy National Park or to bird- and seal-watch at
Irving Nature Park in Saint John. In 1998, about 1.5 million people
visited New Brunswick _ peanuts compared with Georgia's tourist
numbers for the same year (47 million).
</P>
<P>
   That's changing. Provincial and city governments have recently
focused on tourism with a new vigor, and New Brunswick now leads
the Atlantic provinces in tourism growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Fundy coast is getting the biggest push. The Fundy Trail
Parkway, a 15-mile series of roadways and hiking and biking trails
in a 7.5-mile corridor between St. Martins and the Big Salmon
River, opened in May of last year and drew 79,000 visitors in its
debut season. Saint John is becoming a popular cruise ship port _
85 ships will visit this summer, up from 30 last year. And two golf
resorts are opening in September, one in St. Andrews near the Maine
border and the other in the inland city of Moncton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we didn't have much to offer,'' concedes Mitchell
Franklin, the Fundy Trail's most fervent and enduring champion. The
86-year-old hotel and newspaper magnate, who lives on an 8,000-acre
estate west of St. Martins, has been trying for half a century to
get the trail established.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a failure for 50 years!'' he jokes. ``I knew the
beauty of the coastline and knew it had tremendous tourism
potential. But nobody would listen.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Franklin says, the provincial government focused on
industry, granting rights to large swaths of crown land to the
locally based Irving conglomer-
</P>
<P>
   ate. (Those are Irving pulp mills and oil refineries smoking up
the sky over Saint John.)
</P>
<P>
   The focus shifted somewhat in the late 1990s with the increasing
popularity of outdoor adventuring. ``When Mitchell first started
his crusade in the '50s, there wasn't any such thing as
eco-tourism,'' says Fundy Trail marketing manager Brian Clark.
``But I think people see the possibilities in that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the dream is to expand the Fundy Trail along the entire
coast. There are already plans afoot to connect it to Fundy
National Park, 25 miles east. Franklin, who serves on the board of
the Fundy Trail Development Authority, hopes to complete the
coastal expansion within a decade. ``I think we're finally on the
right road,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the Fundy Trail's Fox Rock Lookout, gazing across a
bay inlet to the lighthouse on Quaco Head, it's easy to understand
Franklin's passion for this land.
</P>
<P>
   The trail doesn't officially open for the year until May 1, but
I'm being offered a sneak peek (perks of the trade) by maintenance
manager Jim Clayton, who waits patiently as I gingerly teeter on
the icy paths that lead down to the park's nine lookout points.
</P>
<P>
   All the slipping and sliding is worth it. Though Clayton admits
that a few hardy locals venture here to walk their dogs this time
of year, the park is quiet on this chilly morning. The pervasive
silence and the cold, calm air create the perfect atmosphere for
the heavenly lookout views.
</P>
<P>
   On the suspension footbridge that spans the Big Salmon River, I
contemplate the rush of water as it courses past remnants of
logging wharfs from the early 1900s. Elsewhere, heavy cascades at
Fuller Falls catch the late-morning light as they gush through
copses of birch, maple and spruce. Below the falls, the lonesome,
rocky expanse of Pangburn Beach waits to be covered by the bay,
which rises as much as 48 feet between low and high tides, the
biggest tidal shift in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, the beaches and bay lookouts here will be teeming
with eco-minded visitors hoping to catch sight of the right,
humpback, minke and finback whales that come to feed on krill, a
tiny, shrimplike crustacean. But not even the whales are here yet _
I'm told they're off the coast of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to see them, but it's nice to have the park to myself.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   If the Fundy Trail is a testament to Franklin's persistence (OK,
and his multimillionaire clout), Irving Nature Park shows us what
can happen when big business grows a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Does the Irving name ring a bell? That's right, it's the same
company that runs the paper mills, shipyards and refineries in the
area. In fact, the Irving Paper and Tissue plant is just down the
road, the sign out front emblazoned with the brazen motto:
``Committed to a clean environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1992, the park, which sits on a peninsula of volcanic
rock that juts into the Bay of Fundy west of downtown Saint John,
was a gift from James Irving, who runs the Irving industries with
his brothers, John and Arthur. (The siblings' combined wealth is
estimated to be more than $6.5 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   The motivation behind such largesse is open to interpretation.
``This is the Irvings' way of giving back to the community,'' says
the park's naturalist, Kelly Honeyman. Others consider it
reparation to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the results are lovely. The 600-acre park
encompasses several diverse man-made and natural ecosystems. The
salt marsh on the west side draws more than 250 species of birds,
including great blue herons, which should be arriving from Central
and South America this month.
</P>
<P>
   Porcupines, foxes and white-tail deer forage among the spruce,
fir and birch of the Acadian Forest. The mud flats lure sandpipers
and the occasional moose. And the eastern shore is the place to see
Seal Rock, where harbor seals jockey for position at low tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a hierarchy for who gets the best place on the rock,''
Honeyman says. ``You'll see a lot of the big guys jostling the
little guys.'' At high tide the rock is under water, but if you're
lucky you can still see a seal or two splashing in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Honeyman, who gives tours of the park to school, civic and
seniors groups, proudly shows off a new section called the
Children's Forest. Created on land that was once a gravel pit, the
forest gives youngsters the opportunity to plant a tree and monitor
its growth. ``We have a grid, and we record who planted what and
where,'' Honeyman says. ``In 50 years, you'll be able to come back
and find your tree.''
</P>
<P>
   It is windy and sleeting on the morning of our visit. We stand
looking out over clusters of birch, maple, ash and spruce saplings.
They look so vulnerable, huddled together against the elements.
Their survival truly would be a gift.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   If a visit to the Fundy coast is this rewarding in March, you
can imagine what it's like during the summer, when the temperature
can climb into the 90s and the migratory animals return to feed and
frolic.
</P>
<P>
   The humpbacks should start showing up around mid-June, while the
dawdling right whales, with their big gnarly skin calluses, should
make it in by mid-July. Die-hard birdwatchers may have to make two
trips _ Atlantic puffins, Arctic terns and pied-billed grebes are
in by early June and out by the end of July, while August brings
great flocks of semipalmated sandpipers.
</P>
<P>
   Sailboats begin to dot the bay in May, growing to a grand
flotilla by high summer. And the whale-watch tours off Deer Island,
Campobello Island and Grand Manan gear up at the first sign of a
whale tail. But unless you have a wet suit, you probably won't want
to swim with the big beasts _ the bay's dramatic tides draw a daily
transfusion of bone-chilling water from the Atlantic Ocean, keeping
temperatures at about 50 degrees year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Let the crowds have their regular tourist haunts. Myself, I'll
be coming back to this pretty province for one more hike down the
Fundy Trail (hopefully, no frozen paths next time), to catch one
more soul-nourishing sunset from Sheldon's Point in Irving Nature
Park and maybe for one more spin over the coast in Limpert's
helicopter. And to Fundy National Park's coy moose populace, I'll
just say this _ you can't hide forever.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When friends from abroad come to the United States, I
always send them to Chicago, or try to. It is the quintessential
American city: muscular, inventive, wonderfully diverse,
worldly-wise (if a bit oafish at times) and as unpretentious as its
prairie-flat vowels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago is American in every chitling and sparerib,'' H.L.
Mencken wrote wickedly during the era when the city's stockyards,
since demolished, were the biggest anywhere. ``It is alive from
snout to tail.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviled in the days of Al Capone and John Dillinger as a haven
for hoodlums, Chicago was maligned for years for its cheerful civic
corruption and dismissed in the effete East as a hick town. Nelson
Algren, one of the writers who knew it best, said that ``loving
Chicago is like loving a woman with a broken nose.'' But no more.
Chicago enters the 21st century as a prosperous, well-governed
model for the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Daley does the governing. He won a third term as
mayor last year, and he and his minions sometimes seem to be
everywhere at once, effacing graffiti, reshaping the schools and
creating new green spaces like the 16-acre, $230-million Millennium
Park, with a Frank O. Gehry band shell and pedestrian bridge, just
north of the Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Consummate pol that he is, the mayor works hard to maintain
links to arts groups, business, labor, blacks and Hispanics. He
bullies enemies. He mangles syntax, though not as mercilessly as
his father, Richard J. Daley, who spoke unconsciously for all
politicians everywhere when he harrumphed, ``Together we must rise
to ever higher and higher platitudes.'' But Richard M. _ ``Richie''
to his constituents _ never loses sight of his grand goal: ensuring
the city's future by persuading its middle class to stay. He has
made a good deal of headway.
</P>
<P>
   Daley the elder, who ruled Chicago like a pharaoh for 21 years,
also did a lot to beautify the city. But he is best remembered for
flying into a black rage at the 1968 Democratic convention, siccing
his cops on Vietnam War protesters and the reporters covering them.
The ensuing melee, a grim spectacle of swirling tear gas and
flailing billy clubs, all but guaranteed the defeat of the party's
hapless nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   The first president nominated in Chicago was a favorite son
named Abraham Lincoln, and a dozen others have been nominated here
since. One of them was Warren Gamaliel Harding, whose grandiose
middle name promised so much more than he delivered; he was chosen
in the original smoke-filled room, Suite 408-409-410 of the
Blackstone Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   They must put something into the water in Chicago. Politics here
_ national politics, local politics _ never pales. This is the
city, you may recall, that produced not only the Daleys but also
Daniel Rostenkowski, the consummate congressional deal maker, a
stout political oak felled by a petty-cash scandal;
aldermen-scoundrels of yore like Bathhouse John Coughlin and Hinky
Dink Kenna and Paddy Bauler, who told the world in 1955, ``Chicago
ain't ready for reform''; and Mayor William Hale Thompson, who
threatened to punch King George V in the nose if he dared set foot
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there is nothing Old World about Chicago. Europe seems
further away here than it does in Boston, New York or even San
Francisco. And yet the genius who did more than anyone else to give
the city its charm _ the architect Daniel H. Burnham, who planned
waterfront pleasure parks and scenic drives where other cities have
factories and warehouses _ did so in the name of transforming
Chicago into Paris on the Lake. On Lake Michigan, which lies like
an ocean at the city's feet, ``so huge that you can't see across,''
as my awed wife, Betsey, said when she first came here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no little plans, for they have no magic to stir men's
blood,'' said Burnham, the master planner who laid out the new city
that rose from the rubble of the flimsy boom town consumed in the
Great Fire of 1871. He made none, nor have the generations of
builders who succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Dogs and Fancy Stuff
</P>
<P>
   The old song warns, ``Don't ever ask what Chicago is, unless
you've got an hour or two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is a lot of things: the fabulous Frango chocolate mints
that they sell at Marshall Field's department store; Oprah Winfrey,
queen of television talk; Ann Landers, ageless purveyor of
newspaper advice to the lovelorn; the Chicago River, once a key
link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi, which is dyed
green every St. Patrick's Day, and O'Hare Airport, the sprawling
kingdom of fallen arches and missed connections used by 70 million
passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
   All that and the Lincoln Park Zoo, which makes a specialty of
breeding gorillas; the Field Museum of Natural History; the vast
Museum of Science and Industry, the youngsters' favorite, housed in
the only building left from the World's Columbian Exposition of
1893; and the John G. Shedd Aquarium, the world's largest, which my
sister, Barbara, calls ``the whale jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is good eats: the frogs' legs at Phil Smidt's in
Hammond, Ind., just across the city line, amid the smokestacks of
the old industrial economy, and Italian beef sandwiches and
deep-dish pizza and garlicky Chicago hot dogs (hold the ketchup).
Fancy stuff, too. I remember when Jovan Trboyevic, the fastidious
wonder worker who ran the much-mourned Le Perroquet, was alone in
offering proper haute cuisine; now it's all over town.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is also a city of neighborhoods, so far-flung that the
visitor can sample but a few.
</P>
<P>
   Off to the northwest, in the gritty areas along Milwaukee and
Lincoln Avenues, far from Michigan Avenue's glittering Magnificent
Mile, where the affluent shop, immigrants have lived since the
mid-19th century: first Germans and Scandinavians, then Poles,
Russian Jews, Italians, Ukrainians, Slovaks and most recently
Puerto Ricans. Shop signs in countless languages and churches with
exotically shaped domes serve as testaments to the succeeding waves
of newcomers.

CHICAGO: of newcomers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saving a Church
</P>
<P>
   One of the churches, St. Stanislaus Kotka, which had the world's
biggest Roman Catholic congregation only a century ago, was saved
from the wrecker's ball by Rostenkowski, who used his legendary
clout to divert a new federally financed expressway around it.
</P>
<P>
   The South Side has been America's largest black community for
most of the last century. It is home today to Jesse Jackson and
Louis Farrakhan, two very different black leaders, and two
prominent black members of Congress, Jesse Jackson Jr. and Bobby
Rush. Rush was once a Black Panther leader; now he is a moderate
who says, ``Most African-Americans just want a comfortable
middle-class lifestyle.'' They find it more easily on the South
Side than on the West Side, which is almost as bedraggled today as
it was when the Nobel Prize winner Jane Addams and her staff at
Hull House labored there early in the century.
</P>
<P>
   Also to the south is the top-drawer University of Chicago,
founded in 1890 with Rockefeller money. No fewer than 69 Nobel
Prizes have been awarded to its teachers, students and researchers.
Among the laureates are Saul Bellow, the novelist, and Milton
Friedman, the conservative economist, whose teachings influenced
not only his colleagues but also influential scholars at the
university's law school, like Edward H. Levi, who served as
attorney general in the Ford administration.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the Stagg Field grandstands, Enrico Fermi and his
co-workers achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear
reaction on Dec. 2, 1942, the most important step in developing the
atomic bomb. The site is marked with a massive bronze by Henry
Moore, ``Nuclear Energy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Loop
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright's prototypical Prairie Style building, the
Robie House, stands nearby, echoing the horizontality of the plains
in its strip windows, the deep overhang of its eaves and even in
the proportions of his trademark Roman bricks, very long and very
skinny. The house made him world famous, along with the houses he
built for himself and others in the western suburbs of Oak Park and
River Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Oak Park is Unity Temple, ``my little jewel,'' as Wright
called it, a masterpiece in reinforced concrete, built in 1905 on
an awkward site for only $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the birthplace of modern architecture, and of the
skyscraper, was the Loop, as the central business district is known
(after the elevated train tracks that circle it).
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's architects capitalized on the fire of 1871, which
began in Patrick and Catherine O'Leary's barn on DeKoven Street,
much as Christopher Wren capitalized on London's Great Fire of
1666. They were influenced by the great Henry Hobson Richardson's
startlingly original Glessner House, a rugged study in rusticated
stone (1887) that turned its back to the street, opening instead
onto a south-facing courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Sullivan, Richardson's disciple and Wright's teacher,
sensed ``an intoxicating rawness, a sense of big things to be
done,'' and began with the Auditorium Building in 1889. Its
acoustically perfect 4,000-seat theater, spanned by vast flattened
arches, illuminated by thousands of clear, unshaded bulbs, is one
of America's great interiors.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Burnham &AMP; Root were designing the Rookery a few
blocks away, organized around a graceful cast-iron light court that
Wright reworked to good effect in 1906. In 1891 Burnham &AMP; Root
built the brooding 16-story Monadnock Building, a pioneering
skyscraper, and in 1899 Sullivan, in the Carson Pirie Scott &AMP; Co.
store, frankly expressed the revolutionary steel grid in bands of
windows that became a Chicago School trademark. Below he applied
webs of his luxuriant foliate ornament in cast iron.
</P>
<P>
   All these buildings remain, on or near State Street, ``that
great street,'' a living textbook of modern architectural
development.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the German master who helped found the
Bauhaus, came to Chicago to escape Nazi persecution and
reinvigorated Chicago architecture. His deceptively simple
stripped-down steel-and-concrete designs, like the apartment
buildings on North Lake Shore Drive, the Federal Center in the Loop
and the Illinois Tech campus on the South Side, achieve a rare
elegance through the careful calibration of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   From Mies' work grew such landmarks as the John Hancock Tower,
the distinctively cross-braced high-rise by Skidmore, Owings and
Merrill in the Magnificent Mile shopping area, and in reaction to
it arose the postmodern movement, epitomized here by the sleek
buildings of Helmut Jahn.
</P>
<P>
   Icons of Isolation
</P>
<P>
   In among the shining towers stands an unparalleled collection of
modern street sculpture: not only Picasso's enigmatic Cor-Ten steel
beast outside the Daley Center and a 100-foot-tall baseball bat by
Claes Oldenburg on West Madison Street but also big works by
Calder, Stella and Miro.
</P>
<P>
   You can see many of the best surviving buildings on boat tours
organized by the Chicago Architecture Foundation, and at the Art
Institute you can see fragments of many that have been destroyed,
including the entire, colorfully stenciled trading room of the old
Chicago Stock Exchange by Louis Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   But it is for paintings that the Art Institute, a ``universal''
museum like the Metropolitan and the Louvre, is best known. There
is a St. John the Baptist by Guido Reni, admired by Sister Wendy on
a recent visit, but most of the lures are newer: Seurat's ``Grande
Jatte,'' the greatest of Pointillist canvases; ``Paris Street:
Rainy Day'' by Gustave Caillebotte, a magnificent mood piece to
which the institute gave pride of place long before the general
revival of interest in his work; and two icons of American
isolation, Edward Hopper's ``Nighthawks'' and Grant Wood's
``American Gothic.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther up Michigan Avenue, the Terra Museum of American Art
rotates its collection every few months; when we were last there, a
George Luks called ``Knitting for the Soldiers'' (1918) struck us
with its acid Kirchner-like colors. Nearby, the excellent Museum of
Contemporary Art showcases its own holdings, which range from Bruce
Nauman to Cindy Sherman and well beyond, in a series of
barrel-vaulted galleries. The museum looks out across a cityscape
typical of this part of Chicago, with wide, tree-lined sidewalks
and an agreeable little park surrounded on three sides by tall
buildings.

 CHICAGO: tall buildings.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Da Bulls an' Da Bears
</P>
<P>
   Chicago loves its sports. It loves the Cubs and their cozy
little park, Wrigley Field, with ivy-covered outfield walls and
seldom-used floodlights. (God made baseball to be played under his
own light, the Cubs and their fans believe.) Forget the fact that
the Cubs haven't played in a World Series since 1945 or won one
since 1908. Chicago loved Da Bears in the heyday of Mike Ditka and
Walter Payton. It swooned over Da Bulls and their balletic,
clutch-loving, gravity-defying star of stars, Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Air Jordan and the Bulls carried the city's name around the
globe; so did Sir Georg Solti and the mighty Chicago Symphony
Orchestra, which he made one of the finest on earth. But both are
gone now, Air retired, Solti dead. The Bulls are rebuilding, and
the orchestra has not quite managed to maintain its old luster,
despite the manifold gifts of its current music director, Daniel
Barenboim.
</P>
<P>
   Barenboim's goals are different from those of Solti, a
taskmaster if not a martinet, who drilled his players until they
achieved a rare precision. At its peak the Chicago was best noted
for the sonority of its brass choirs, especially in the late
romantic repertory. Sometimes its Bruckner rang out with the
awesome power of the horns of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over in 1991, Barenboim has encouraged subtlety.
Today quiet passages are often as impressive as climaxes, though
some critics, including James R. Oestreich of The New York Times,
have detected occasional raggedness. Many listeners wonder how
things will change when the virtuoso trumpeter Adolph Herseth, who
is now 78, finally yields his chair.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barenboim is a musician of substance as well as a figure
of glamour. At Orchestra Hall and on tour in the United States and
abroad, he not only conducts but doubles as a piano soloist, and he
has kept the orchestra ensconced among the nation's elite musical
ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   The big stir in Chicago music this past season came from the
Lyric Opera's heralded premiere of a work it commissioned, William
Bolcolm's ``View From the Bridge,'' based on the Arthur Miller
play. The critics were kind, and the company liked it so much that
it has asked Bolcom, a genial University of Michigan professor who
likes Gershwin and Youmans as much as Puccini, to produce two more
new scores for production in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   It was a general director named Ardis Krainik, one of the rare
women in her line of work, who propelled the Lyric into the first
rank of American opera houses, along with the Metropolitan and San
Francisco. (Some would add Houston to the list.) She died in 1997,
to be succeeded by William Mason, and the company has gone from
strength to strength. It sells more than 100 percent of its seats
every year, an unparalleled accomplishment, because subscribers
religiously turn in unwanted tickets for resale.
</P>
<P>
   Dance and Drama
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has also taken the Joffrey Ballet to its heart. Directed
by Gerald Arpino, the company moved its base here in 1995 from New
York after running into financial trouble. It seems to have
restored its bank balance and renewed its classical style. Daley
regularly attends performances.
</P>
<P>
   Big-league drama abounds in the Windy City. Two of the most
widely applauded Broadway productions of the past couple of years
originated at the Goodman Theater here: Arthur Miller's ``Death of
a Salesman,'' starring Brian Dennehy, and Eugene O'Neill's ``Moon
for the Misbegotten,'' starring Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne.
Another O'Neill play, ``Desire Under the Elms,'' directed by Walter
Dallas, scored a hit this winter at the Court. And the Steppenwolf
helped propel David Mamet and John Malkovich to fame.
</P>
<P>
   No better evidence could be found that Chicago has long since
shed the ``Second City'' complex A.J. Liebling diagnosed 50 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune, still ensconced in its lacy neo-Gothic
tower on Michigan Avenue, is in almost every respect a different
animal from the wacky, pugnaciously conservative, isolationist
sheet full of local puffery and idiosyncratic spelling that Col.
Robert R. McCormick oversaw in the 1940s and '50s. It is in the
process of buying The Los Angeles Times, The Baltimore Sun and
Newsday, plus several television stations, which will make it one
of the nation's handful of dominant media conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons of the Arts
</P>
<P>
   Swift and Armour and the other barons of beef are no more;
Chicago is no longer ``hog butcher to the world.'' Only a gate
adorned with a bas-relief of a Hereford steer remains of the Union
Stockyards, where in 1892 alone 2.5 million cattle and 5 million
hogs were slaughtered. Many of the big corporations hereabouts,
like Walgreen's, United Air Lines, Motorola and Sears, which
abandoned its eponymous skyscraper in the Loop, are out in the
suburbs. Amoco and Ameritech and a couple of big banks succumbed to
takeovers. But many biggies remain, including Bank One, Sara Lee
and Quaker Oats, to which the city gave $9.75 million in tax breaks
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them support the arts with enthusiasm. C. Steven
McMillan, who takes over as chief executive of Sara Lee on July 1,
told me not long ago, ``The arts, politics and the business
community are more heavily comingled in Chicago than in any other
American city I know of, to everyone's benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Down at the foot of La Salle Street, in a fine Art Deco building
with a statue of Ceres on top, is the headquarters of the Chicago
Board of Trade, where the big commodity traders do their (to me)
incomprehensible thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few economic institutions,'' the social historian Thomas
Cronon tells us sternly in ``Nature's Metropolis'' (Norton, 1991),
``more powerfully affect human communities and natural ecosystems
in the modern capitalist world. Even those of us who will never
trade wheat or pork bellies on the Chicago futures markets depend
upon those markets for our very survival.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll have to take his word for it. Meanwhile, allow me to focus
for a moment on Chicago's writers: the early reformers Frank Norris
and Upton Sinclair; the overearnest but underrated Theodore
Dreiser, whose ``Sister Carrie'' still moves me; James T. Farrell,
whose ``Studs Lonigan'' is set in one part of the South Side, and
Richard Wright, whose ``Native Son'' is set in another; Ben Hecht
and Charles MacArthur, who gave us the greatest of all newspaper
plays, ``The Front Page,'' and Carl Sandburg, who for better or
worse gave Chicago its overfamiliar nickname, ``City of the Big
Shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the city and its ways have been depicted by Mike
Royko, the irascible newspaper columnist; Studs Turkel, the oral
historian; and Ward Just, the novelist.
</P>
<P>
   A moment, too, for the popular arts: the blues that Muddy Waters
and others brought up the Illinois Central from Mississippi; the
jazz that King Oliver and Louis Armstrong brought to the South
Side, echoed by white kids from the suburbs like Benny Goodman and
Eddie Condon; and the wacky, wonderful plaster cows (including
Ferragamoo, sponsored by the Italian fashion house) that appeared
all over the city in the summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sinatra's kind of town, and it is mine, too.

 CHICAGO: mine, too.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; IF YOU GO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By R.W. APPLE Jr. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of Chicago's attractions, along with travel
information:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   BURNHAM, 1 W. Washington St., (312) 782-1111. In a minor miracle
of adaptive restoration, D.H. Burnham's Reliance Building (1891),
one of the world's first skyscrapers, has been raised from
near-dead and turned into a boutique hotel, managed by the Kimpton
Group of San Francisco. In the heart of the Loop, it has 103 rooms
and 19 suites, average in size, below average in price. A lot of
fine original detail has been retained, including the terra cotta
facade, terrazzo floors and Carrara wainscoting. Double room: $135
to $230.
</P>
<P>
   FAIRMONT, 200 N. Columbus Drive, (312) 565-8000. A businessman's
favorite a few blocks north of the Loop, the Fairmont occupies a
42-story post-modern tower sheathed in pink granite. Its 692
exceptionally large rooms offer drop-dead views over the city or
the lake, plus marble-topped desks and tables. Give the Primavera
restaurant a pass; the waiters sing. Double room: $159 to $259.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR SEASONS, 120 E. Delaware Place, (312) 280-8800. In city
after American city, the Four Seasons is the top-rated hotel. The
Windy City is no exception. The English-country-house-fantasy lobby
occupies the 7th floor of a 66-story skyscraper, above a mall full
of chic shops (Bloomie's, Bendel's). Whatever you want, it's right
at hand: barber and beauty shop, sauna, indoor pool and a stellar
restaurant, Seasons, with Mark Baker as chef. Double room: $465 to
$900.
</P>
<P>
   RITZ-CARLTON, 160 E. Pearson St., (312) 266-1000. Operated by
the Four Seasons chain, despite the misleading name, this luxurious
lair forms part of the Water Tower Place complex, smack in the
middle of the Magnificent Mile. Its bright, expansive lobby,
complete with octagonal fountain, is on the 12th floor. Guest rooms
are all that anyone could ask, as is Sarah Stegner's cuisine; her
Sunday brunch, Chicago's most sumptuous, ranges from gravlax to
mini-souffles. Double room: $400 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   WHITEHALL, 105 E. Delaware Place, (312) 944-6300. European in
style and ambiance, this little hideaway is tucked into a side
street, well away from Michigan Avenue's noise and bustle. In-room
faxes, phones with data ports and wall safes were installed in a
recent renovation. On weekends and during special promotions,
prices are low by Magnificent Mile standards. Double room: $199 to
$379.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   ARUN, 4156 N. Kedzie Ave., (773) 539-1909. This is America's
best Thai restaurant, a kitsch-free zone where the food on the
plates is just as delicate as the ceremonial headdresses adorning
the room. Miang kum, the first of 12 stellar dishes at a recent
meal, consisted of batons of lime peel, ginger and coconut, heaped
with tiny red peppers and peanuts on betel-nut leaves with tamarind
sauce. It would awaken the most jaded palate. Superb Austrian and
American wines; tasting menu only, $75 and worth it.
</P>
<P>
   BERGHOFF, 17 W. Adams St., (312) 427-3170. Old Chicago, alive
and kicking. Owned by the same clan since 1898, the Berghoff holds
the first liquor license issued by the city after Repeal. It brews
its own beers and root beer and serves all the old favorites from
Mittel Europa, like herring, bratwurst and knackwurst with
sauerkraut and real wiener schnitzel.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLIE TROTTER'S, 816 W. Armitage Ave., (773) 248-6228. One of
the nation's two or three premier chefs, Trotter makes gastronomic
Faberge eggs. He bathes foie gras, salmon and Japanese mushrooms in
a warm broth to create a dish that is both rich and refreshing: a
rarity. The service is fluent and the wine list (check the big
bottles) mind-blowing.
</P>
<P>
   EVEREST, 440 S. LaSalle St., (312) 663-8920. The next time
someone tells you he never eats on top of skyscrapers, send him to
Jean Joho's place, 40 floors up. Alsatian-born, J. blends the
cuisine of kings with the cooking of commoners in dishes like
creamy sauerkraut soup with caviar. The attention to detail is
constant, the tapestry of lights below stirring, the service urbane
and the Alsatian wines the best in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   FRONTERA GRILL AND TOPOLOBAMPO, 445 N. Clark St., (312)
661-1434. You could spend half a lifetime in Oaxaca and know less
about Mexican food than you will learn at Rick and Deann Bayless'
two restaurants, one casual, the other less so. Both, saturated
with vibrant color, serve food prepared with immense care from the
best ingredients. Every sip or bite is a revelation, from
margaritas to marlin ceviche to tacos al pastor.
</P>
<P>
   GIBSONS, 1028 N. Rush St., (312) 266-8999. Chicago is a steak
town from way back. It has plenty of places to satisfy your
carnivorous impulses, but this one, packed with politicians,
visiting show-biz types, bulky guys in warm-up jackets and
head-turning dolls, epitomizes the city's exuberance. Order a
martini, chopped chicken livers (try them on the house raisin
bread) and either a W.R. Cut (a bone-in rib-eye named for the
Tribune's food columnist, William Rice), or tender London broil
(made with top sirloin). Desserts, like strawberry shortcake, are
the size of a steamboat.
</P>
<P>
   M K, 868 N. Franklin St., (312) 482-9179. The letters stand for
Michael Kornick, the chef, and he stands for modern American
cooking with bright, true flavors. Sweetbreads with caramelized
endive, for example, and definitive calves' liver with grilled
Vidalia onions, Nueske bacon strips and a sauce of mustard and pan
juices. The decor is terminally chic.
</P>
<P>
   SPIAGGIA, 980 N. Michigan Ave., (312) 280-2750. The name means
``beach,'' and you can glimpse the lake from this snazzy aerie
perched above the Magnificent Mile. But bag the view. Paul
Bartolotta's thoroughbred Italian cooking, the best between New
York and Santa Monica, is the thing to focus on here:
full-flavored, grown-up, fantasy-free dishes like asparagus with
unctuous fonduta, gnocchi with duck ragu and wood-roasted rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   TRU, 676 N. St. Clair St., (312) 202-0001. In from the suburbs,
Rick Tramonto and Gale Gand are challenging Charlie Trotter and
Jean Joho for local supremacy in an airy glacier-white room.
Tramonto sends out a lobster risotto in a miniature copper saucepan
and serves dazzling savory sorbets (beet, orange pepper, etc.) in
parmesan cones. Gand, his wife, whips up whimsies like pineapple
``carpaccio.'' Well-chosen wines.

`DIVINE TRASH': HOW A FAN OF THE WICKED WITCH BECAME A SUCCES DE
SCANDALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
By STEPHEN HOLDEN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John Waters was a little boy, his mother recalls in Steve
Yeager's documentary film, ``Divine Trash,'' it wasn't the heroes
of children's literature but the villains who attracted him. The
Wicked Witch of the West and Captain Hook were among his fantasy
idols. By the age of 10, under the spell of the movie ``Lili'' and
of ``Howdy Doody,'' he was staging his own puppet shows in his
neighborhood and earning $25 a week, not a small sum for a boy that
age.
</P>
<P>
   These influences and many others, including the B-movies he used
to watch through binoculars from a hill overlooking a drive-in
theater, and the underground films of Andy Warhol, Kenneth Anger
and the Kuchar Brothers, helped shape a directing career that has
made Waters both the pride and the scandal of his native Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   His informal repertory company was drawn from a group of local
``post-Beat, pre-hippie'' outsiders whose collective sensibility
was fueled by amphetamines and pot.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager's fine and fascinating biography of Waters pays scant
attention to his Hollywood career. The movie, which opens Friday in
Manhattan, only follows his work up through the making and
marketing of his 1972 underground succes de scandale, ``Pink
Flamingos,'' which made film history with its notorious scene of
Divine (aka Glenn Milstead) ingesting a dog turd. As Waters
demurely remembers that shattering moment: ``It was a magic day in
our happy young lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Divine Trash'' reminds us that successful film-making careers
don't evolve haphazardly, no matter how bizarre the work. From his
days as a neighborhood puppeteer, Waters was an extremely focused,
well-organized and hard-working showman who instinctively
understood the importance of promotion and marketing. Even in a
1972 television interview that is threaded through the movie, he
displays a cool-headed sense of who he is, and where wants to go.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the movie, Waters also evinces the brass-tacks
practicality of someone who learned film making by the seat of his
pants. Pete Garey, who ran the Quality Film Labs, which processed
his early movies, is credited with being the closest thing in his
life to a film school.
</P>
<P>
   Although Waters studied film at New York University ``for five
minutes,'' he admits that he was more interested in watching
``Olga's House of Shame'' than ``Potemkin.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters is highly articulate and endlessly quotable. He describes
the appearance of Divine, the hefty drag queen who was his biggest
star, as a conscious cross between his favorite '50s film star,
Jayne Mansfield, and Claribel, the seltzer-bottle wielding clown on
``Howdy Doody.'' More than anything else, he wanted Divine to scare
people.
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes a short detour to examine the life and influence
on drag culture of the larger-than-life Divine, who died in 1988.
``He was my Elizabeth Taylor,'' recalls Waters. ``He was an actor
who started his career as a homicidal maniac and ended it playing a
loving mother, which is a pretty good stretch, especially when
you're a 300-pound man.''
</P>
<P>
   The last section of ``Divine Trash'' shows actual rehearsals for
``Pink Flamingos'' including the dog-turd moment without which the
movie probably wouldn't have become the sensation that it did.
Waters is characteristically blase about it all. He characterizes
the film, in which two transcendently weird households compete for
the title of the filthiest family alive, as ``a kindergarten
movie.'' And in a way he's right. &QL;

&HT;     ROBERT BYRD: A PROFILE IN COURAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They don't call Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the
conscience of the Senate for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   At 82, Byrd is one of the institution's last great orators, an
old-fashioned patriot who reveres the Constitution and is
determined to defend its integrity. And Byrd was at his best this
week as he reversed himself to help block a constitutional
amendment aimed at banning the desecration of the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment has been around since 1989, when the
Supreme Court ruled that flag-burning was constitutionally
protected by our free speech rights under the First Amendment.
Congress, incensed by demonstrations disrespectful of the flag
during the radical 1960s, rushed to make political points by
undoing the high bench ruling, and Byrd initially joined in.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has come to his senses, observing wryly that changing
one's mind is a perfectly acceptable political practice, given a
sufficiently important reason. Not that he favors burning the flag,
mind you.
</P>
<P>
   He just believes the Founding Fathers did not mean the
Constitution to be trivialized by an issue that neither affects the
structure of government nor protects personal rights by narrowing
the powers of government, the two suitable amendment categories.
``This is neither fish nor fowl,'' he intoned majestically. ``It
does not belong in the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure fell four votes short of the 67 needed to change the
Constitution. But to their shame, 63 senators did support it,
cringing before the prospect that political opponents might accuse
them of lacking proper patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Such a good commercial sound bite: Senator thinks its OK to
trash American flag! Senator doesn't love American flag! Shocking,
shocking. Terribly UnAmerican.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, former Gov. George Allen of Virginia, a Republican,
didn't even wait for his rival, Democratic Sen. Charles Robb, to
cast his opposing vote before attacking Robb as ``out of touch''
with ``the values and beliefs of Virginians.''
</P>
<P>
   Robb, a Vietnam veteran who literally had men die in his arms,
countered that American soldiers do not sacrifice ``for a piece of
cloth'' but for ``all that our flag represents _ including the
freedom to express views we don't share.'' The amendment sailed
through the House of Representatives last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible men and women know that flag-burning is not a major
threat to the republic. It is stupid and in bad taste. But it does
not rise to this level of congressional intensity. Such events
happen only rarely, are universally greeted with disgust and do no
substantive damage to our culture, our values or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Protection of the Constitution, however, needs constant
vigilance. It is under assault from many directions. Majorities
always want to bend it to favor their views and ignore the rights
of racial, religious and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is right. We cannot allow this to happen. The Constitution
protects the fundamental liberties of all of us.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, Byrd reminds us, is designed to be ``an oasis'' for
reasoned debate, resistant to the political passions of the moment.
Tinkering with the great document that is the foundation of our
democracy ``can have far-reaching and unexpected consequences'' not
immediately clear, he warns.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd also worried that a flag-burning ban would be mocked,
providing a tiny minority of rabble-rousers an opportunity to defy
the Constitution itself. ``Some verbiage can't be enforced, won't
be enforced,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the prohibition of liquor in 1919 as a misguided but
temporarily popular attempt to dictate human nature that distorted
the grand principles of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one provision is unenforceable, what about the other
provisions?'' he asked rhetorically. Prohibition, a law enforcement
disaster, was finally repealed in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd also stood against the popular mood six years ago when he
led the Senate fight to reject a constitutional amendment to
mandate a balanced federal budget. He dismissed it as an accounting
device that had no business being in the Constitution. And indeed,
Congress managed to balance the budget all on its own afterward
without a constitutional straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is an extraordinary political figure. After more than four
decades in the Senate, he is second in congressional seniority only
to that invincible geezer Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. His influence is
not what it was when he was Senate majority leader, but he is
greatly respected for his sense of institutional history, his deep
commitment to civility and protocol, and his protective instincts
about the power of the legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
   He has produced two volumes of Senate history that are already
regarded as the legislative bible. He began in politics as a member
of the Ku Klux Klan, but he learned along the way he had been
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He stands, in fact, as testimony to the wisdom of old age and
long service. He is running for re-election and likely to win.
</P>
<P>
   We need him. Phooey to term limits.

`HIGH FIDELITY': A MUSIC GEEK'S WARPED LOVE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is it about pop-chart rankings and baseball statistics that
can turn a grown man into a talking encyclopedia who spits out
prize trivia with the vehemence of a sidewalk prophet quoting
scripture? Nearly two decades ago, Barry Levinson's ``Diner,'' a
movie drenched in late-'50s nostalgia, touched knowingly on the
adolescent male obsession with such things (the relative merits of
Frank Sinatra vs. Johnny Mathis, the B-sides and label credits of
early rhythm-and-blues singles). Now we have ``High Fidelity,''
Stephen Frears' witty, exquisitely fine-tuned screen adaptation of
Nick Hornby's 1995 novel, whose narrator, Rob Gordon (John Cusack),
is a walking databank of pop-music lore.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of Championship Vinyl, a Chicago record store that
in addition to selling CDs, specializes in vinyl copies of
hard-to-find albums, Rob also moonlights as a nightclub D.J. and
small-time entrepreneur. He and his two music-fanatic clerks, Barry
(Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso), are so smug in their superior
musical tastes that when a clueless middle-aged customer requests
Stevie Wonder's ``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' for his
daughter's birthday, Barry jeers him out of the store.
</P>
<P>
   Rob and his colleagues are so immersed in pop culture that they
give the most important events of their lives hit-parade rankings.
Early in the film, Rob, reflecting on his disastrous love life,
announces that his recently departed girlfriend, Laura (Iben
Hjejle), didn't make the list of his all-time top-five breakups.
Addressing the camera, he proceeds to name the top five, beginning
with his junior high school sweetheart, Alison (Shannon Stillo),
and continuing with Penny (Joelle Carter), Charlie (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) and Sarah (Lili Taylor). Each breakup has its own
vignette and flashback. Ultimately, Rob decides Laura qualifies
after all, and ranks her No. 5. Trivia fanatics will note that the
movie's list isn't identical to the novel's.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the movie has made many alterations from the book, the
most significant being the story's relocation from England to the
United States. Championship Vinyl is now in Chicago, not London.
But despite the change of venue, the movie remains remarkably true
to the novel's spirit. If the characters' musical obsessions don't
precisely coincide with those of the novel, they haven't been
softened. The esoterica Rob and his colleagues swap with such
competitive zeal remains as specialized (and as accurate) as
before. To them, the ultimate measure of a person's value is hip
musical taste.
</P>
<P>
   Even more sharply than the book, the movie evokes the turmoil of
urban single life with a quirky mixture of confessional poignancy
and dry, self-deflating humor. Rob's relationships _ with their
petty grievances, arguments and small accumulated misunderstandings
_ have a pulsing flesh-and-blood reality. The women in his life, by
turns charming, impulsive and sexy, each in a different way, are no
romantic pushovers. And in so precisely evoking the prickly
intimacy of a loosely knit group of friends and lovers, the movie
is a triumphant return to form for Frears, whose last film, the
turgid modern western ``The Hi-Lo Country,'' found him way out of
his element.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' is an equal triumph for Cusack, who wrote the
script with three collaborators (D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink and
Scott Rosenberg). Their screenplay, some of it taken directly from
the novel's pages, shares the main character's musical passions but
has enough perspective to recognize Rob's pop fanaticism as a sign
of his arrested emotional development.
</P>
<P>
   In his winning performance, Cusack finesses the tricky task of
alternately telling his story to the camera as though he were
talking to a friend, and living it. A master at projecting an
easygoing camaraderie, he navigates the transitions with such an
astonishing naturalness and fluency that you're almost unaware of
them. At the same time, he makes Rob so charming that even when he
behaves badly, our immediate impulse is to rationalize and forgive.
</P>
<P>
   And the better we get to know Rob, the clearer it becomes that
far from being a sad-sack loser at love with a lifelong pattern of
being dumped, he tilts more toward being a sneaky commitment-phobic
womanizer. When he finally tells us why Laura left him (the reasons
are offered as another witty list), the behavior he owns up to with
a disarming casualness isn't simply bad; it's appallingly
insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's basic plot follows Rob's attempts to win back Laura,
who to his chagrin becomes involved with her upstairs neighbor, Ian
(Tim Robbins), a pompous expert in conflict resolution who flaunts
an obnoxious New Age vocabulary. But even as Rob makes headway in
his campaign, he slips into a casual affair with Marie De Salle
(Lisa Bonet), a sultry up-and-coming singer with a taste for Peter
Frampton songs, and pursues a budding flirtation with Caroline
(Natasha Gregson Wagner), an admiring rock journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cusack's Rob, the movie is sparked by more than half a
dozen incisive performances. As Laura, Hjejle successfully walks a
difficult tightrope between willfulness and vulnerability.
Zeta-Jones' Charlie epitomizes a supercilious yuppie chauvinism of
a particularly nasty sort, while Taylor's flailingly self-dramatic
Sarah is a heat seeker after emotional distress. Joan Cusack has an
acidly funny turn as Laura's best friend, Liz, a first-class scold.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all are Louiso and Black as Rob's geeky partners in
perpetual adolescence. Louiso's Dick is a quivering, bashful nerd
waiting for a girl to appear in the store who recognizes him as her
ideal man when shared musical tastes miraculously coincide. Black's
Barry is Dick's opposite, a loudmouthed know-it-all who wields his
musical taste with bullying defensiveness.
</P>
<P>
   For all its finely calibrated emotions, ``High Fidelity'' (like
``Diner'') is a very small portrait of a hothouse world that even
now is in the process of disappearing. Five years ago, when the
novel came out, it seemed much more contemporary than it does today
in the era of the computer nerd and MP3 downloads. There's finally
no escaping the fact that the vinyl junkies the movie celebrates
already seem like prehistoric relics. That said, ``High Fidelity''
gives these dinosaurs the most heartfelt and respectful valediction
they could hope for.

   UNDATED _ One of the more entertaining moments on Oscar night
the past two years has been the presentation of the Academy Award
for Best Foreign Language film. Hyperactive Roberto Benigni stole
the show last year with his rambling stream-of-consciousness
acceptance speech; this year, Pedro Almodovar of Spain was almost
as entertaining with his over-the-top, if not coherent, acceptance
speech. We look at who he is and some of his previous work. By
ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SHANE WEST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Shane West isn't a teen-ager, but he plays one on TV,
as one of the cast members of the divorce-romance drama ``Once and
Again.'' He's also in a teen movie, ``Whatever It Takes,'' but he's
ready to break into more mature roles _ and maybe rock out a little
with his punk band. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HIGH FIDELITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Although ``High Fidelity'' goes on a little too long,
heaping one ending on top of another, it wraps up well and includes
several amusing cameos. It also, as is appropriate for a movie
featuring three rock-music snobs, has one of the best soundtracks
to come along in some time. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PRICE OF GLORY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Price of Glory'' is the sort of movie that inspires
backhanded compliments like ``cliched but effective.'' It's
practically asking for trouble when it combines two genres, the
boxing drama and the father-son conflict drama, that have
near-rigid sets of rules. It's almost impossible to bring anything
new to the party, and aside from focusing on a Latino family,
``Price of Glory'' doesn't. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-EL DORADO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ At one point during DreamWorks' new animated film
``The Road to El Dorado,'' one of the heroes comments, ``This city
is full of suckers.'' Apparently, the filmmakers had the same
contempt for their audience. Shoddy storytelling, questionable
racial politics and one of the worst sets of songs Elton John and
Tim Rice have ever cooked up come together in a film that proves
that all that glitters is not gold. By TODD CAMP. Story has moved
in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-THE SKULLS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Virtually everything in ``The Skulls'' is bathed in
natural light, coming from behind the characters and creating a
haze so thick that it's a wonder the cast doesn't lapse into
coughing fits. The few electric-light sources in the movie don't
provide much illumination. Thus, the movie provides an apt metaphor
for itself: It's a dim bulb. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL;

   C O M M E N T A R Y &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOHNSON-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Gov. George W. Bush doesn't need the help of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to win
Texas. Therefore, it is well that NAACP President/CEO Kweisi Mfume
has exhibited the industrial-strength good sense to decline to
dilute the national organization's resources by taking an active
role in the effort by the state chapter to persuade Bush to take a
stand against the Confederate battle flag. By CECIL JOHNSON. Story
has moved in ``k'' commentary category. &QL; 
 &QL;

   F I N A N C I A L &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIZBOOKS-REVIEWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ All the world's a stage, the Bard tells us, but
perhaps especially the business world. So why not turn to fiction
for a bit of management advice? That is the premise behind Robert
A. Brawer's ``Fictions of Business: Insight on Management From
Great Literature'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 248 pages, $16.95). The
book, now out in paperback, received rave reviews when it was first
published, as Brawer melded two of his favorite topics _ business
and literature. By TERESA MCUSIC. Story has moved in ``f''
financial category. &QL;

   TO: My friends in the San Francisco Bay Area, center of the
universe
</P>
<P>
   FROM: Matt
</P>
<P>
   SUBJECT: Search for Silicon Alley
</P>
<P>
   Friends, I write from the Big Apple, home to Broadway shows,
museums and unmatched cuisine. What a backwater!
</P>
<P>
   Unlike our enlightened and searingly focused Silicon Valley,
this place is distracted from the most important pursuit of our
era, the Internet revolution. Here, innovation is not a cause
celebre, tech entrepreneurs are scarce and, sadly, many people are
in their late 20s before they get their first stock option.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is said to be a place called Silicon Alley, New
York's answer to Northern California, a Manhattan enclave of
high-technology entrepreneurs. I decided to check it out, which
wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, many people I spoke with on the street cared
little about the digital revolution, and inexplicably have no plans
to quit their jobs, drop out of school or leave a spouse to start
an Internet company. More to the immediate point, they have no idea
where Silicon Alley is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it what?'' said Bashir Saleh, who sells coffee and
bagels just off Times Square, and who suggested I walk south.
``Maybe it's near Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't he just say he doesn't even want to be an Internet
billionaire?
</P>
<P>
   So I began my descent, walking through the garment district and
past Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Saleh wasn't the only person incapable of giving directions to
the Alley. I stopped, but got no satisfaction from, a police
officer, security guards, food vendors and numerous passers-by,
including a woman named Alison Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in Washington State,'' Bradford said. ``That's
where Bill Gates is from.''
</P>
<P>
   Have these people no shame?! I engaged her in word association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Bezos,'' I said reverently of the founder of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't heard of him,'' she admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``IPO,'' I said next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's when you get stock shares before someone
else,'' she muttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandwidth,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No idea,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   I gave up. This woman wasn't tech-savvy in the least. She
probably thinks Unix refers to people who have been neutered.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford was in a hurry, she said, because she had to get to a
taping of ``The Ricki Lake Show,'' a program whose appeal is
utterly beyond me, given that they rarely talk about day trading.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked farther south, and east, I met Maryann Finnegan.
``You've come to the wrong place if you want to talk computer
jargon,'' Finnegan said. I was, however, in the right place to talk
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   She owns Foliage Garden, a shop in the flower district.
Surrounded by beautiful azaleas in front of her shop, she said she
suspected Silicon Alley was just another commercial district in New
York, like the diamond or toy district, or a neighborhood, like
Chelsea or Little Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aha! It's just as I suspected. Silicon Alley is an afterthought
here. After all, Northern California has great activities, too, but
we don't let them subvert the Internet revolution. I would have
told Finnegan that, but I got directions to Little Italy instead. I
also asked for a restaurant recommendation, directions to the East
Village, tips on getting tickets to ``Cats'' and what it would be
like to get into the flower business.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case this e-commerce stuff doesn't pan out.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Finnegan has an interesting business model in
that she appears to be making a profit. This is something we may
want to experiment in the e-commerce space.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I was becoming discouraged, fearful that this backwater
might pull me in, a vision appeared across the horizon. As I
wandered south on Broadway, around 25th Street, munching on a giant
falafel from a street vendor, I saw a giant sign hanging from a
building two blocks away on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   It read ``DoubleClick welcomes you to Silicon Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   Success!
</P>
<P>
   Drawn like a Crusader to the Grail, but with much less chain
mail, I headed for the sign. I had arrived. There, beneath the
sign, was a familiar sight, a man strolling down the street working
on a Palm Pilot (albeit an outdated version). I called out to him,
high-tech brother to high-tech brother, ``Sir, can you tell me
where to find the heart of Silicon Alley?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of what?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Alley,'' I said, bewildered. ``Aren't we in Silicon
Alley?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never heard of it,'' he said, standing beneath the sign, which
he apparently had not seen or bothered to read. ``Maybe it's near
SoHo.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, Ben Bocardo, said we might or might not have been
standing in Silicon Alley, but he didn't know and didn't care. He
said he did know the music district, which is uptown. He said he
was a bass player. I asked him if he performed music for streaming
over the Internet or for downloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live,'' he explained. Sounds interesting, I thought. Maybe I
can check out his performance after I see ``Cats'' and visit the
Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   But I still wondered: Had I found Silicon Alley or not?
</P>
<P>
   I finally found out. I took a subway to Wall Street (fascinating
area; you should check it out sometime) and asked the participants
in a conference titled ``Silicon Alley Executive'' where I could
find the Alley.
</P>
<P>
   They confessed the truth: They were not sure either. The area
where I had been standing beneath the DoubleClick sign turned out
to be the original center of it all. But, they explained, it is now
a broader term for the community of Internet companies in the New
York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a general place,'' said Len Duckman, the sales manager
for Interactive Futures, a Web consulting firm. ``It's like
Brigadoon.''
</P>
<P>
   So it turns out Silicon Alley is both everywhere and nowhere,
and, in either case, merely a piece of New York, along with Wall
Street, Broadway, the flower district, nooks and neighborhoods,
fashion, falafel vendors, street-side food, artists and musicians
and even, in what they call the ``boroughs,'' places where people
actually make tangible things. In short, can you believe how myopic
this place is? It doesn't hold a candle to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   To find out how myopic, I plan to stay awhile to check out the
attractions. Anybody know the way to SoHo?
</P>

AN INTERNET DUMMY LOGS ON FOR A SHOPPING ADVENTURE

 By BRIAN ALEXANDER  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Sen. John McCain thinks that online shopping is so vital to
America's prosperity that it should be tax free. Until now, I had
shirked my patriotic duty. I had never shopped online. When I
confessed this, people reacted the way women at Vogue magazine
would react if someone mispronounced ``Manolo Blahnik.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid being labeled a misfit and to help keep our national
economic engine humming, I jumped at the chance to shop on the Web
for things I really needed and wanted. I then compared online and
real-world shopping experiences by buying the same items the
old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   I kept score by price, time and frustration level (a 0 is no
frustration; 3 is highest), and included driving time when judging
real store shopping.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, I should admit a few things. First, I am biased
toward interacting with real people rather than sitting at home
with my computer and credit card. So if the scores for the real
stores and the online stores were close, I favored the real stores.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is a learning curve to shopping online. My early
purchases proved more frustrating than later ones. For example, it
took hours for me to realize that typing a fairly common word into
a search engine was hopeless. A search for ``modems'' generated a
list of more than a million Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Third, regardless of where I shopped on the Internet, I was
continually assaulted by DoubleClick advertisements; requests for
``cookies''; warnings about my Netscape security certificate
lapsing (whatever that means); windows upon windows alerting me to
a ``Java Script Error'' (whatever that means); and my favorite:
``This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut
down.'' I half- expected Eliot Ness to burst through my door. (I
also learned to click ``OK'' or ``Continue'' and keep my fingers
crossed.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, my perception was also influenced by the fact that my
computer is almost five years old. It has a 75-megahertz processor
and 16 megabytes of memory. The modem is a 14.4K. I have made
coffee while waiting for sites to download. In Silicon Valley's
view, this means I should buy a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   MODEM
</P>
<P>
   Instead of replacing my computer, however, I hijacked my wife's
laptop and beefed it up with a new 56K modem. After two hours of
ineffective searching, I found the 3Com Web site and selected a 56K
V.90 Wintel modem card. The purchase took 20 minutes, only because
I read the 14-paragraph legal document headed ``Contract'' and the
privacy statement that said, essentially, there was no such thing
as privacy. I paid $133.81, including tax and shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The modem arrived three days early. Installing it was tricky, so
I added 25 penalty minutes for consulting a technician by phone,
plus 10 minutes for the moment he said, ``Man, I give this a 2-to-1
shot of ever working.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked, finally, but did not increase the laptop's speed
because of its limited memory. I returned to my own digital jalopy.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping at a real store for the same type of modem was even
more frustrating. I drove to Radio Shack, Circuit City and Staples.
None stocked the modem. Circuit City had an Actiontec for $99.99;
with tax, $107.75.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER: Online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL TIME: Two and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL COST: $133.81, including tax and shipping.
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATION: 2.
</P>
<P>
   THE RETURN: 3Com accepted the return without a hitch and
promised to credit my charge card, but I had to pay to ship the
modem back.
</P>
<P>
   PROSCIUTTO
</P>
<P>
   Two hours into my search for prosciutto, I knew more about
Parma, Italy, home of arguably the best prosciutto in the world,
but had failed to order any of the ham. I did find Muscovy duck
prosciutto. At last I settled for Serrano ham, a Spanish
prosciutto, from Dean &AMP; Deluca, in New York. That site was easy to
use, and the ham arrived in two days, on time, packed in an ice
chest. But I paid $47.21 (yikes!), including shipping, for one
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Prosciutto was simple to find at the Italian deli a couple of
miles from my house. The guy behind the counter had suggested San
Daniele, for only $19.95 a pound. No shipping.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER: The store.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL TIME: 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL COST: $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATION: None.
</P>
<P>
   THE RETURN: Dean &AMP; Deluca would accept the return of the meat if
it was unopened, but I would have to pay shipping. The deli would
not accept the return of perishable food.
</P>
<P>
   TERMITE STAKES
</P>
<P>
   I have been fighting a chemical war with termites for two years.
So I clicked onto an America Online shopping link for
HomeTownStores.com, an online hardware store. The site required
that I register and select a password, which I immediately forgot.
</P>
<P>
   When I searched for ``termite'' I found termite paper and
termite shields. I had no idea what they did, and the site did not
tell me. I scrolled down and found termite stakes, which are placed
in the ground around the house to kill termite colonies. I ordered
and paid $67.37, including shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the stakes arrived almost a week later than
promised, but they weren't stakes. The box, in fact, contained four
washing-machine hoses. Somewhere there is a guy in dirty clothes
holding 20 termite stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot stocked the Terminate brand stakes, charging only $49
for 20.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER: The store.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL TIME: 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL COST: $52.60, with tax.
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATION: 2 (I forgot where I had parked my car).
</P>
<P>
   THE RETURN: Easy at Home Depot, except for the long line at the
return counter. I paid to ship the hoses back to
HomeTownStores.com, and it promised to credit my account.
</P>
<P>
   TOASTER OVEN
</P>
<P>
   Several months after my wife and I moved into our house, we
realized, thanks to the oven door's exploding open, that the gas
ignition was not working properly. Last month, the handle on our
toaster fell off. So we decided to buy a countertop toaster oven,
solving two problems at once.
</P>
<P>
   First we tried the Yahoo Kitchen and Home site. We chose a
DeLonghi convection toaster oven for $179.95, which was at least
$100 more than I had expected to pay, but it was Italian and
sounded sexy, so we got it.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I received an e-mail message saying that the
company was out of the ovens. That same morning, however, I had
seen an advertisement in a newspaper for a site called Tavolo.com.
I typed in the Web address, the site popped up, I searched for
DeLonghi ovens, and there they were.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other sites, Tavolo offered the option of not registering
an account with passwords and other information. I liked that. The
oven was also $179.95, so I bought it. With tax, I paid $193.04.
Tavolo did not charge for shipping. The oven showed up three days
later, as promised. A week later, Tavolo.com sent me free jam and
chocolate candy.
</P>
<P>
   I drove to a local Williams-Sonoma store and quickly found the
same oven. It was also $179.95. With tax, it would be $193.90.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER: A tie. Tavolo was easy and took less time, but I liked
the saleswoman at Williams-Sonoma, who showed me how to use the
oven.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL TIME: One hour for Williams-Sonoma; 15 minutes for
Tavolo.com.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL COST: $193.90.
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATION: 1.
</P>
<P>
   THE RETURN: Both items were simple to return. Williams-Sonoma's
policy is unconditional, as is Tavolo's. Tavolo will have the
appliance picked up under most circumstances. No charge for
shipping, though I was unable to make my computer print out the
no-postage coupon Tavolo sent by e-mail. On second try, Tavolo
faxed the coupon to me.
</P>
<P>
   COFFEE
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I buy our coffee at a warehouse store. It is not
great coffee, but it is about $8 for two pounds of whole beans, a
deal. I figured that the Web might offer better coffee at a good
price and that I might be able to subscribe to a service that would
ship coffee to my door every month.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites sell coffee, but few offer regular home delivery.
Then I found E-Java.com. It offered a choice of three coffees, each
in 12-ounce bags to be delivered monthly. I ordered Vienna Roast,
Guatemala Antigua and French Roast. Including shipping, I paid
$24.49 for the three bags, or 36 ounces. I also got a friendly
e-mail message confirming the order, and when the coffee arrived on
time two days later, the box included two samples as well as coffee
candy.
</P>
<P>
   Because the site did not sell the cut-rate beans I was after, I
compared the E-Java.com deal with what was available at a local
gourmet roaster. The shop sold beans by the pound. Vienna Roast,
French Roast and Guatemala beans were $10 a pound each; 48 ounces
cost $30, no tax.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER: A close call, but the store was cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL TIME: 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL COST: $30.
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATION: 2. (I got caught in traffic and realized I could
not afford good coffee from either source.)
</P>
<P>
   THE RETURN: E-Java would accept the return and credit my
account, but I would have to pay the shipping costs. The roaster
did not accept returns.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK
</P>
<P>
   When I told people I had never bought anything online, they
responded, ``Not even a book?'' So I clicked onto Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   I considered buying ``Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to
Technology,'' by Neil Postman, a techno-skeptic and cultural
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to click the buy button, I recalled all the people who had
considered me a rube. I also thought of John McCain and my nation's
economy. So I raised a white flag and ordered ``The Complete
Idiot's Guide to Internet Shopping'' for $18.43, including
shipping. It arrived two days later, on time.
</P>
<P>
   I then drove to a large bookstore, but the book was out of
stock. The store could order it in four or five days for $18.26,
including tax, but I would have to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER: Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL TIME: 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL COST: $18.43.
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATION: 1. (I took a point off for the brief identity
crisis I suffered upon re-entering the site: ``Hello, Brian
Alexander! If you are not Brian Alexander, click here.'')
</P>
<P>
   THE RETURN: I paid the shipping costs to return the book to
Amazon.com. The store would accept returns if the book was in its
original condition.
</P>
<P>
   POSTSCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   One week after my shopping excursion, I bowed to the inevitable
and ordered a 700 megahertz computer at the Hewlett-Packard Web
site. I am also signing up for a digital subscriber line. Now let
them smirk.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Come on, admit it. Who does not love getting a deal, no matter
how much it costs?
</P>
<P>
   Marketers depend on consumers' desires to go after deals, even
for things we would never buy without a dollar-off coupon. Online
retailers are equally savvy, offering all types of discounts for
shopping on their sites. The fact is that online discounts are much
like their real-store counterparts: they lure us in, get us to
spend more than we planned and send us home reassured that we got a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But keep this in mind: Online retailers are not charities. Even
Web sites will need to make money some day.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there have been bona fide deals, especially around
the recent holidays. In December, for instance, many sites offered
free shipping and deep discounts that undercut prices at their very
own brick-and-mortar stores.
</P>
<P>
   But as post-holiday reality set in, discounts reverted to more
typical forms: most were 9 percent to 16 percent off the regular
price, but many retailers compensated with costly shipping and
handling, or by charging fees for returns. Retailers make higher
profits on shipping charges than on merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites make comparison shopping arduous by forcing you to
click through multiple screens to find out what a sweater really
costs, all told, with tax, shipping and handling. Retailers hope
you will invest so much time that you will go ahead and make the
purchase, discounted or not.
</P>
<P>
   In case that makes you want to head for the malls, here are some
of the newest players in the online retail contest: sites that help
you get a good deal at other sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reverse auctions. Sites like priceline.com, buyersedge.com and
liquidprice.com have popularized the concept of searching for a
retailer to match the price you are willing to pay. Often such
sites automatically charge the item to your credit card if a
retailer agrees to your price (so you had better want it). Others
allow retailers to bid against each other until one prevails with
the lowest price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Group purchasing. Buytogether.com, mercata.com and
accompany.com gather buyers who are interested in the same product
and offer a group discount. The price goes down as more buyers
enter the group until a specified deadline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online coupons. Hotcoupons.com and clickrewards.com, among
other sites, give you incentives ranging from frequent-flier miles
to online coupons for local stores.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are sites that help you navigate through the discount
jungle. Most people do not even know they exist. A study of 5,831
online shoppers revealed that only 34 percent were aware of sites
that compare prices, according to Forrester Research, a consulting
firm in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Price-comparison sites will sift through discounters when you
specify the item you want. Automated shopping robots, or bots, like
mysimon.com and hotbot.com, scan the Web for the lowest price on
the item. Pricing engines like dealtime.com, bottomdollar.com,
deals.com and pricegrabber.com list online retailers who carry the
item and offer merchant ratings and delivery information.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like bizrate.com, offer rating systems that
evaluate an online retailer's prices, promptness of delivery and
shipping charges.
</P>
<P>
   All this assistance, however, does not necessarily mean that
there are great deals to be had. Experts say, for example, that the
bargains carry costs of their own.
</P>
<P>
   David Cooperstein, the director of online retail research at
Forrester, says that by and large, Web discounters are worth
looking at when you are buying an item that costs a few hundred
dollars or more. If you can save 5 percent by shopping
comparatively for 15 minutes, it is usually worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Time, for instance. How long does it take to find a good price,
and how long until delivery? Do you really want a weeklong delay
for a Zip disk drive to travel via ground transport just because
the out-of-state purchase allows you to skirt sales tax?
</P>
<P>
   Some online retailers offer a good deal if you are willing to
give information about yourself and do not mind having your name
circulating among marketers. You can get anything from rebates to a
free mouse pad for filling out customer surveys and product
registration information.
</P>
<P>
   If you like your privacy, you should save your money another
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers make consumers choose,'' Cooperstein said. ``To get
discounts you have to give some data or spend your time
researching.''
</P>
<P>
   Web shopping is no place for suckers. The discounting sites
shout at you with bold colors and spinning logos, prodding you to
jump at the low, low prices. Some retailers pay to advertise on
price comparison sites, fooling you into thinking that their price
is the best. Sometimes deep discounts are real, albeit temporary _
meant to build loyalty and subliminally lure you to buy full-price
items later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sites in the health- and beauty-aids business may offer
incredible discounts on over-the-counter items to hook you so
you'll come back to buy more expensive items,'' said Alan Alper, an
analyst with Gomez Advisors in Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Brand-name items like the Sony Walkman or the Apple iMac are
less likely to have wide swings in prices, whether online or in a
retail store.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not care about buying a brand name, your chances of
finding a deep discount are greater. Your chances of being
enormously confused are, unfortunately, also greater, because your
searches will turn up hundreds of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Online shopping, of course, is in its infancy. It has the
potential to offer one-stop shopping through sites that can build
profiles for shoppers to be used to troll the Web for sales, deals
and new online retailers that will match shoppers' exact
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   That is still a leap into the future. But one thing is certain.
For people who seek a deal, Internet shopping provides one more way
to persuade themselves that they have found one.

 By LESLIE KAUFMAN  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A century from now, Internet archaeologists may look back at the
last several years and liken them to an electronic Precambrian era:
a time when new life exploded in spectacular abundance. But as in
that prehistoric era, not all the creatures emerging from the
fecund swamps are equally adapted for survival.
</P>
<P>
   When the Net was still new and all potential (about six months
ago), it seemed that practically everyone who had a half-baked idea
or worse was starting a dot-com enterprise, raising a truckload of
cash, going public and becoming a millionaire. So many prospered so
easily because investors, both public and private, were willing to
buy into companies with enormous losses on promises of great future
returns.
</P>
<P>
   This could not go on forever, and, in fact, since the new year
it has been clear that the venture capitalists and the public
markets alike are becoming skeptical of promises of fabulous future
earnings and are starting to tighten the capital flow to
e-retailers. There is still money flowing, but it is often going to
ventures that facilitate commerce among businesses, a rather more
stable proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The pull of real-world gravity has been widely felt. From
service providers like Juno to community sites like iVillage,
e-businesses have seen their stock prices sink from celestial
levels. But the punishment has been particularly brutal to
retailers that do business solely on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do those merchants have to contend with an increasingly
crowded field, but they also have to battle clicks-and-mortar
retailers like Wal-mart.com and Macys.com, which were slow to enter
the Internet game but are now wielding their well-established brand
names like clubbed tails.
</P>
<P>
   In this tougher environment, the evolutionary winnowing should
begin pretty quickly. Companies that cannot show a plausible way to
stanch the outflow of cash are going to be very vulnerable very
soon. ``Come April, we are going to be watching first-quarter
results very closely,'' said Steve Westly, a vice president for
business development at the profitable online auction site eBay,
his voice purring with the contentment of a predator about to be
well fed. ``We think after the news of the disappointing results
gets out, there will be a lot of bargains out there'' for bigger
companies looking to expand by acquiring smaller ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the gold-rush mentality has started to fade, and it is
apparent that not every company with a dot-com in its name will
strike the mother lode, serious players _ venture capitalists,
stock analysts, company executives _ are beginning to evaluate
survivability in a more systematic manner. Of the organisms that
have crawled out of the primordial electronic muck, a rough
consensus has emerged as to which types are eventually going to be
profitable. Of course, evolution on the World Wide Web is happening
so fast that generalizations get out of date quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Today, people who shop on the Web are used to getting bargains.
Drugstore sites will sell, say, a large package of disposable
diapers, a tube of toothpaste, vitamins and athlete's-foot powder,
all for $3.50 (only a small exaggeration). Electronics sites will
sell DVD players for $169.95 each, less than their cost, and then
ship them free overnight. ``It's too good to be true,'' you say to
yourself. And you're right!
</P>
<P>
   The first victims of tighter investment capital will be Web
sites that have been selling goods at a loss or giving them away
while they were, in effect, buying customers. Not long ago,
building market share at any cost was the mantra of the Web, but
the gratuitous cash-bleeding model is increasingly being viewed, to
quote that famous, now out-of-business, New York retail innovator,
Crazy Eddie, as ``Insane!''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of most sites that lose money on products _ the most
prominent example of which is Buy.com _ is to draw a huge customer
base and sell those eyeballs (and data on their buying habits) to
advertisers. Here is the problem with that model: most shoppers do
care about price, but they have other concerns, like credit-card
security, familiarity and reliability _ priorities that retailers
overlook in their chase for advertising dollars rather than sales
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it turns out that the number of people willing to give
away their souls for bargain-priced goods is smaller than was
anticipated _ and certainly smaller than the threshold for enticing
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of last year, Free-PC _ whose plan was to give
away computers to customers willing to accept two permanent strips
of company-controlled advertising space on either side of the
computer screen _ was bragging that it would be bigger than
Microsoft. But in November, Free-PC agreed to be acquired by
another computer manufacturer in a tacit admission that its
business plan had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed that to get the business model to work we needed
at least one million users,'' the founder, Bill Gross, said at the
time. ``At 10,000 a quarter, we couldn't get to one million fast
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another drawback to the below-cost model. It turns out
that consumers who care only about price are gone the moment they
smell a better deal. ``Price-loyalty people are the most fickle,''
said Ken Orton, the chief strategist at Cognitiative, an e-business
consulting firm in San Francisco. ``They are antibrand loyal. They
can't tell you where they bought their last toy or CD.''
</P>
<P>
   BRED FOR THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   The best business to have on the Web, logically, is a business
that cannot exist in the real world because such a venture faces
none of the very real, very fierce competition being perpetuated by
the clicks-and-mortar retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concepts that have the best chance of surviving,'' said
Henry Blodgett, an Internet analyst with Merrill Lynch, ``are those
whose content and services are not portered from traditional media
and retailing, but are purely Internet or interactive services.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that fit best into this slot are those that let
consumers negotiate their own price, and the best of these are
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, of course, has popularized the online auction model and is
still the biggest operator of such a site. It used the Web's
technology to bring together an audience that had previously been
hopelessly fragmented by geography. Suddenly, a collector of 1940s
soda bottles did not need to peruse every flea market on the
Eastern Seaboard to find the perfect World War II Coke bottle; he
just needed to search online.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of being a middleman, from the site operator's point
of view, is low overhead: no inventory, no shipping and primarily
word-of-mouth advertising, in return for a cut of each transaction.
Compare that with Amazon.com, which lost $720 million in 1999,
largely by investing in marketing and very expensive
infrastructure, like automated warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Most online retailers, if they want to service their customers
well, will have to do the same thing. But not eBay, which made $11
million in 1999. That is why its model is being duplicated widely.
Now Yahoo does auctions. Amazon does auctions. Ubid does auctions.
And so will anyone else with half a brain. Allowing customers to
sell to one another is a path to easy money.
</P>
<P>
   The real question now is whether there is another
alternative-pricing model that makes as much sense.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, has put money into
finding out. He is an investor in the two leading examples of such
models: Priceline.com and Mercata.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline is the best-known actor in the reverse-auction
business, where the consumer names a price and sellers bid to meet
it. To keep customers happy, the company used to make up the
difference (within reason) between what buyers bid and sellers will
accept. That translated into a $1 billion loss last year (ouch!)
and a stock price that has gyrated between $160 and the $50s.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata's plan is to allow consumers who want to buy the same
item to group together and negotiate a price from a seller: the
idea is that the bigger the sale, the lower the price. Despite
television ads comparing this power-buying concept to having sex,
Mercata has not aroused enough naturally existing passions to
bargain as much as eBay and other auctions do. But sometimes it
takes a while for kinkier practices to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   DANGER IN THE NICHES
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, entrepreneurs rushed to set up stores that
they inevitably promised would be the Amazon.com of
fill-in-the-blank: pet stuff, watches, beauty products, baby gear,
furniture, pig entrails (OK, that's made up), wine, ad infinitum.
Some of these stores are focusing on a startlingly narrow array of
merchandise. FogDog.com sells sportswear, but Chipshot.com just
sells golf clothes and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Word on the street is that the next big set of goners is a
majority of the niche retailers. That is because there are too many
in each category and many are in businesses where profit margins
are too thin to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we approach the third or fourth inning,'' said James W.
Breyer, a managing partner of Accel Partners, the Palo Alto,
Calif., venture capital firm, e-businesses without high
gross-profit margins will not succeed. ``One has to be highly
suspect of the pets portals that are about to go public,'' he said.
``I would run for the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   AGE MATTERS
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just the niche retailers who look vulnerable. It
is all the new Internet retailers that have no connection to or
history in the physical world. The big lesson from the most recent
Christmas shopping season is that a long-established brand name is
an unmatchable asset.
</P>
<P>
   To make their names known, dozens of dot-coms spent millions of
dollars each to advertise on programs like ``Ally McBeal'' and
``Monday Night Football.'' The outcome? The start-ups' cost per
customer was stratospheric, while Old World retailers new to the
medium walked away with the majority of customers.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 most-visited Web sites during Christmas read like a who's
who of land retailing. JCPenney.com, Barnesandnoble.com, Gap.com,
Wal-Mart.com and VictoriasSecret.com were among the
clicks-and-mortar merchants who made the grade. With few
exceptions, the dot-coms that thrived were already fixtures _
including eBay, Amazon and CDnow.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that in Silicon Valley, the hottest Web sites for
investing are hybrids of the new and old. Bluelight.com, for
example, is a joint venture of Kmart, Yahoo and venture
capitalists. The independent company, which will sell Kmart
merchandise and more, will make use of the chain's vast buying
power and giant customer base to lower its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Passing along those savings to shoppers may be critical to sales
volume. Steve Jurvetson, a managing partner of Draper, Fisher
Jurvetson, a venture capital firm, envisions a future where
consumers will shop through an electronic wallet service _ a place
where you keep credit-card information that follows you as you
browse the shelves at Amazon.com and Wal-Mart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Such a service would allow one-click shopping anywhere on the
Web, eliminating the time-consuming step of filling out forms on
the first visit to each e-store. But such a service could also be
used to do comparison shopping by offering the same product from a
competing merchant at a lower price.
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, retailers would not want to cooperate with
such a service. But if consumer demand forced them to comply, only
merchants selling brands they completely control would be safe from
price-cutting wars. If, for example, a customer wants Nike
sneakers, and Nike sneakers can only be purchased at FogDog.com, no
amount of competitive comparison would have an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Such an e-tailing plan is at least five years off, Jurvetson
said. And one never knows what fierce creature might spring from
the fertile Web-based loam and change the rules all over again.

   Expedia, the giant online travel agency that is owned primarily
by Microsoft, prides itself on customer service. In a gesture to
uneasy visitors to its Web site (www.expedia.msn.com), it recently
stopped insisting that they register and provide personal
information before browsing for flights, car rentals and hotel
rooms. The site now requires registration only when a browser turns
into a purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   The site promises replies to e-mail messages within 24 hours,
offers immediate assistance by telephone at any time and
meticulously follows up sales with offers of further service.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after Expedia sold me two airline tickets to San
Juan, Puerto Rico, it followed up a week before departure with an
e-mail message suggesting that the itinerary be reviewed, and
offered to book a hotel room, arrange a car rental and even buy
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when I tried to look at the itinerary, I was
stymied. I had forgotten my ID and password, which were issued when
I bought the tickets. No wonder: I am registered with at least 50
Web sites and have many IDs and passwords.
</P>
<P>
   As the Web site advised, I dialed (800) Expedia (397-3342) for
help. After five minutes on hold, I was told that six calls were
ahead of mine. Four minutes later, ``Chuck'' responded, but the
connection was soon cut off. Six minutes later, I got through to
``Lawanda,'' who quickly e-mailed my user name and password.
</P>
<P>
   As online customer service goes, this experience was good. Web
businesses may be proliferating, but customer service varies
remarkably from site to site.
</P>
<P>
   As e-commerce is maturing, however, there is a new emphasis on
customer service, and virtually every online trade conference
addresses the issue. On the customer end, a recent report by
Forrester Research, the market research firm, found that 90 percent
of online shoppers consider good customer service to be critical
when choosing a Web merchant.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester calculated that 4.8 million people, or 37 percent of
those who have made purchases on the Web, had used customer
services while shopping on the Internet. The report cited
unhappiness with service as a main reason shoppers stopped using
Internet merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The growing importance of online shopping is most apparent in
travel. According to a November report issued by PhoCus-Wright
Inc., a travel research company, 45 percent of online buyers said
they had bought travel on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the number of Americans who had booked trips
online had soared more than 80 percent in 1999, to 11 million. It
estimated the value of the online travel market at $7 billion in
1999 and projected a rise to $20 billion in 2001. Improvements in
customer service and security were cited as reasons for the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that many people who browse online are
reluctant to buy because they object to the lack of human contact
and are uneasy about privacy and credit-card security.
</P>
<P>
   The more one reads about e-commerce customer service, the more
apparent it is that this can mean many things. It can mean the way
a business promotes its product (whether it gives a full, clear
description, answering the predictable questions without being
asked); the billing and checkout procedure (how simple is it, and
how secure?); the way a company responds to consumer problems and
questions. Is the purchase delivered as promised, with the customer
able to track it electronically before delivery? How easily can it
be returned for a replacement or credit?
</P>
<P>
   Some e-commerce sites go beyond satisfying a customer by
striving to build loyalty for future sales. Incentives include
frequent-flier miles and bonus miles to those who book an airline
on its own site. Some sites that sell beauty products send samples
to customers; others may send chocolates or flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some sites go to great lengths to promote loyalty. Two
years ago, I had Amazon.com send a book about Middle Eastern
history to Shlomo Sokol, my brother-in-law in Israel. The book was
charged to my Visa card. When I recently returned to Amazon to
order a book for myself, Amazon asked, ``Would you also like to
send this book to Shlomo Sokol?'' (My answer was no.)
</P>
<P>
   Customer service is handled in several ways: referring queries
to a telephone number (preferably toll-free); accepting or
soliciting e-mail messages and replying by e-mail; accepting e-mail
but replying by telephone; posting answers to predictable questions
on the Web site; and live online communication, or chats, between
the dealer and the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Live chats, or in Internet terms the exchange of written
messages, are among the most intriguing. The technique is used by
several large companies, like Lands' End, which sells clothing and
household goods through catalogs and online. Live chats work like
most chat rooms on the Web: One person types a question and clicks
``send,'' and the other replies. The aim is to have experts ready
to answer customers' questions.
</P>
<P>
   I recently tested this chat service on the Lands' End site
(www.landsend.com). Typing in my question, I received a message on
my computer screen that seemed remarkably like what I often hear on
the telephone: ``Your call is very important to us. Please continue
to hold and an agent will be with you momentarily. Thank you.''
Actually, the wait was not long, but the ensuing exchange took
longer than a discussion would have by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Asking questions by e-mail presents other problems. Some sites
promise quick replies and actually deliver them. Other sites take
much time, and some never respond. Among some sites that do
respond, it is clear from their generic or irrelevant replies that
little attention is paid to the questions.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively recent development is the subcontracting of
customer-service business. Companies like IBM
(www.ibm.com/solutions), LivePerson (www.liveperson.com),
PeopleSupport (www.peoplesupport.com) and Kana Communications
(www.kana.com) provide services for companies that prefer not to
manage their own. This means that when you have a live chat with
Lands' End, you will probably speak with a representative provided
by LivePerson.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a real person actually intrudes. A shopper may be
clicking on a retail site when suddenly word is received from a
sales clerk offering help. The clerk has been watching without the
shopper's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in customer-service communication online is by voice,
and that is important, because it is as close as you can get to
face-to-face communication. In an example, an online jewelry store,
Miadora (www.miadora.com), offers voice chats, instant messaging,
e-mail queries or toll-free telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   At almost every e-commerce site, customer service means, at
least partly, posting responses to ``frequently asked questions,''
or FAQs. Sometimes that is sufficient, but there are almost always
questions that cannot be answered this way. Forrester Research
found that only 19 percent of online shoppers with questions
searched for answers on the site, and only 11 percent went to the
FAQ's.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because a FAQ is not personal contact, researchers say.
They recognize that to answer all questions by e-mail or by
telephone would be costly. But they say that if e-retailers would
provide full product description, prompt shipment, delivery
tracking services and, for repeat customers, perks like free
express shipping, there would probably be fewer questions.

 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been two years since the Pentagon decided to
build a virtual shopping mall on the Internet, and although its
corridors are stocked with goods from rations and uniforms to paper
and floppy disks, the military's main venture into e-commerce has
been going a little more slowly than planned.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the ``electronic mall,'' as the Pentagon calls the
project, had sales of more than $50 million in 1999, and expects
them to grow substantially this year. Its catalog lists more than 2
million different items, which military buyers worldwide can
theoretically obtain either from the military's depots or directly
from commercial vendors, whose own Web pages are linked to the
Pentagon's ordering system.
</P>
<P>
   But just like dot-coms in the civilian world, the Pentagon's
e-commerce venture is not exactly breaking even. Even though
start-up costs are modest and the e-mall allows buyers to shop
around for the lowest prices, a recent study found that it would
not start saving the Pentagon money until 2003 and that the savings
by 2005 would amount to just $48.5 million _ compared with the
Pentagon's current procurement budget of $54.28 billion a year. And
even as the project grows, the Pentagon has discovered some vexing
barriers to wider acceptance of its e-mall.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recently released report by the Pentagon's
inspector general, the military, under orders ``to aggressively
adopt best business practices'' including e-commerce, rushed the
e-mall into being even though it knew that it was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Two consultants and the federal Office of Management and Budget
had warned against moving too fast, the inspector general said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes 30 years to get a customer and 30 seconds to lose
one,'' said one of the consultants, the Scranton Electronic
Resource Center. ``The e-mall must be as near perfect as possible.
Anything less will result in large-scale customer disinterest,
alienation and, finally, nonparticipation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what happened in the early days, as the military
services found that the operation did not live up to its billing.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem cited by the inspector general was that many
procurement offices still rely on older computer systems that are
not fully compatible with the e-mall's ordering systems. In some
cases that meant that customers would have to enter their orders
twice _ once on the e-mall system and then on their local computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Don O'Brien, one of the e-mall's managers at the Defense
Logistics Agency, said the program was working to accommodate
buyers' needs and that for many types of purchases, like the
thousands of transactions of less than $2,500 for office supplies,
maintenance hardware and other items that the Pentagon buys each
year, the system was already working well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out ahead of the power curve, and being a pioneer is
not always the best position to be in on something like this,''
O'Brien acknowledged. So far, he said, the vast majority _ perhaps
90 percent _ of all e-mall purchases are for uniforms. But he said
this limitation was comparable to Amazon.com's strategy of starting
with online book sales and expanding later into other markets.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the military, the federal government is moving across
the board toward a day when electronic commerce is a common way of
doing its business.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Government Services Administration, which
manages all kinds of government purchases, has a program called GSA
Advantage that allows government employees to order products and
services directly over the Internet at the preferred government
price. The number of items available grew 30 percent in 1999, and
sales grew 50 percent, to more than a million dollars a day in late
September.
</P>
<P>
   For companies that want to do business with the government,
there is the Electronic Posting System, where more than 29,000
vendors are registered to receive automatic notices of
opportunities to sell to the government, an increase of 24 percent
in a year. Last year, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the
Commerce Department joined the Government Services Administration,
NASA, the Department of Transportation and the Department of the
Air Force as participants, and more are expected to join this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department has set up the Phoenix Opportunity
System, which notifies minority-owned companies of potential
partnerships and other business opportunities. The department also
offers a one-day e-commerce course for minority-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Another course in e-commerce is being developed by the Small
Business Administration for its online classroom at
http://classroom.sba.gov. It also maintains a ``gateway'' for
procurement information, linking small businesses to purchasing
offices at http://pronet.sba.gov.
</P>
<P>
   And the Treasury's Financial Management Service is testing an
electronic check-payment system to pay vendors; the first e-check
was delivered in 1998 and 50 vendors receiving federal payments of
at least $1 million a day are now participating in the pilot
program.
</P>
<P>
   The big challenge for the government is to tie all these systems
together into a single, electronic Sears, Roebuck catalog, complete
with its own billing system. There are already steps in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, for instance, there is the Central Contractor
Registry _ a Web site where contractors provide basic information
to the government before doing business with the military. It
replaces paper forms and includes 140,000 contractors, which is
expected to grow to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the aerospace and other big industries are
moving toward online selling in civilian markets, don't expect the
Pentagon's e-mall to grow any time soon into an online system for
buying aircraft engines or radar electronics, O'Brien cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an internal debate about how far to take this,
and we are not talking that big,'' he said, citing considerations
like the security of information on the Internet. ``A lot of people
in the military have concerns about that, and their concerns are
well founded.''

   As you step off the elevator onto the sixth floor of 55 Broad
Street in downtown Manhattan, you see a sign that says ``Ernst &AMP;
Young.'' But the scene just says young.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling 20-something receptionist wears a name tag identifying
him as Elvis Presley, and a blast of Bob Marley music accompanies
an employee leaving a conference room. Actually, they are called
``huddle rooms'' and have plush easy chairs and white walls on
which employees can write. The ``college rooms'' nearby have
dormitory-style couches where workers on marathon shifts can take
naps.
</P>
<P>
   The office sound system can rival a dance club's, and there are
assortments of bagels, croissants and sandwiches at the numerous
sleek, black food counters.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young is the world's third-largest consulting and
auditing firm, but it was clear one recent weekday that workers
casually talking over pizza at communal workplaces were not
analyzing financial statements. They were putting the finishing
touches on PlusFunds.com, the Web site for a company that is
scheduled to start and then go public in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The pizza and the personnel are all part of Ernst &AMP; Young's
incubator, begun last June to help entrepreneurs develop Internet
companies. By this June, the incubator is expected to become part
of Cap Gemini, the French company that agreed last month to buy
Ernst's consulting business in a deal worth $11.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Online businesses have grown more complex than the basement
start-ups of the Web's early days. Now, starting a company often
means multimillion-dollar stock deals, and the rush to market is
on. This is where incubators come in, helping online entrepreneurs
build Web companies, often within several months.
</P>
<P>
   Incubators began appearing in Silicon Valley several years ago
but are now cropping up nationwide and are even being started at
some universities, including Yale University and New York
University. With Internet initial-offering fever running high on
Wall Street, New York City has been particularly fertile ground.
Dot-com entrepreneurs are racing to sell investors on what could be
the next big start-up company, and many New York businesses that
were engaged in e-commerce have turned instead to hatching new
Web-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 100 full-service incubators in the United States,
at least five are operating in New York and 20 others are forming,
said Seth Goldstein, a principal at Flatiron Partners, the New York
venture capital firm. With Internet companies spawning rapidly,
taking start-up ideas from the business plan into a fully formed
company is considered crucial to online success.
</P>
<P>
   The incubators provide entrepreneurs with financial, strategic
and technical support in exchange for a percentage of stock, hoping
the stock soars when the businesses are acquired or go public. The
incubators also offer business wisdom, connections to business
partners, access to venture capital and the all-important ``speed
to market'' _ the time needed to turn a business plan into a
working company.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young screens about 15 entrepreneurs a week over the
phone, said Alvi Abuaf, a partner at the firm and the founder and
director of the incubator, which employs 140 people. Some
entrepreneurs are invited before the ``idea-lator,'' a panel of
five experts. If the idea is approved, project managers from both
companies go through intense brainstorming sessions to develop
business and project strategies at Ernst's Accelerated Solutions
Environment on the second floor of 55 Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young clients come with substantial financial backing,
and incubator services are not cheap: A typical initial fee is
$500,000, half of which must be paid in advance. Then there is the
cost of creating the online company _ $5 million to $20 million,
part of which is in the form of equity.
</P>
<P>
   Accelerated Solutions looks like a day-care center, and
participants use toys, video cameras and schoolroom desks. Artists
draw the concepts being discussed on wall-size blackboards, and
entrepreneurs role-play, pretending to solicit financing from
venture capitalists played by actors. Keeping the projects under
wraps during early stages is crucial in the office, which is shared
by several clients at once. There are large private phone booths
and machines throughout the offices that make white noise.
</P>
<P>
   After the workshops, the scramble to get online begins. Over a
six-month phase of intense project development, both the site and
the business are built by people working around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, entrepreneurs entering the incubator _ usually
financial-service companies with some financial backing _ pay 50
percent of the estimated fee early on and pay the rest when the
company is up and running or issues its first shares, which is an
incentive to make the business successful. In return for deferring
the fee, Ernst usually receives an extra 25 percent of its fee in
stock. Similar deals are struck with various service vendors for
the project, such as law firms and branding services, which accept
stock in exchange for deferring part of their fees.
</P>
<P>
   This is the world that Gregory Pappajohn, 35, a hedge-fund
manager, stepped into in 1998. Although Pappajohn had no experience
running an Internet business, two of his biggest investors
persuaded him to start a Web site that would analyze hedge funds
online, giving constant updated evaluations of investments.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, with $2 million devoted to the project, the three
partners hired Ernst &AMP; Young for a flat fee to plan and consult on
strategy for PlusFunds.com and to help develop its Web site from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But as the project progressed, PlusFunds, one of the clients
that showed Ernst &AMP; Young the value of developing an incubator,
began having the firm do more, including hiring service vendors and
recruiting technical teams to work on the site. Ernst &AMP; Young used
company contacts to obtain insurance policies, lease hardware and
software, arrange for legal and accounting services, and line up
venture capitalists for future financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff takes a lot of time, and Ernst &AMP; Young already had
those relationships,'' Pappajohn said, ``so it became like one-stop
shopping for us, and we get a nice stable of financial-services
firms.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few months, like most start-ups, PlusFunds offered Ernst
&AMP; Young some stock in return for deferring some of its fee until
the project was able to go public. Now Ernst &AMP; Young was more than
just a consultant; it had a stake in the success of the start-up.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership expedited the project and cut costs, Pappajohn
said, and Ernst &AMP; Young's expertise in the hedge-fund industry has
helped. Also, he said, the firm's well-known name, displayed
prominently on the site, lends credibility to a new
financial-services site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hedge-fund site isn't one of those you can build out of your
garage,'' he said. ``If it had that image, people would giggle.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the same token, wouldn't Ernst &AMP; Young's name lend a
stodgy Old World feel to a site that calls itself revolutionary?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think it's like driving your father's
Oldsmobile,'' Abuaf of Ernst &AMP; Young said. ``It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing number of incubators, there are critics of
entrepreneurs who team with them.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, of Flatiron Partners, compared the
assembly-line-style minting of start-up companies to ``bringing a
high school athlete into the big leagues too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You rush ideas to launch to take advantage of the bullish
stock market, and the incubator just jumps to the next project,''
he said. ``In the long run, the entrepreneurs suffer from being
protected so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incubators are the safe route,'' he added. ``I call it
`entrepreneurship lite.' Real entrepreneurs take risks. In giving
you less chance to fail, incubators also give you less chance to
succeed. You tell an entrepreneur, `We'll take care of everything,
including the coffee cups,' and he misses out on the very culture
of his own company.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters argue that the initial stock offering _ not
company coziness _ is the name of the game. For that, it doesn't
hurt to connect with a firm that deals extensively with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the investment-banking
community and has relationships with many Fortune 500 companies,
Pappajohn said.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, groups of 20-something staff members of
Ernst &AMP; Young and PlusFunds worked out kinks in the data-delivery
systems, made sure Web pages were loading correctly and made
cosmetic adjustments to the site, which is scheduled to open for
business next month. An initial public offering is expected in
September.
</P>
<P>
   As work on the project winds down, Ernst employees are teaching
their jobs to PlusFunds employees. And then they will move on to
the next hot idea.

<P>
   The demographics of the Internet have changed. Where men once
ruled, women are taking over. They account for about half the Web's
audience, various studies find, and are signing on in greater
numbers than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, there were not that many women on the
Internet,'' said Carol Kovac, a vice president at the Watson
Research Center at IBM. ``Today, we're on there and using it for
everyday things.''
</P>
<P>
   Women are looking for different information and in different
ways from the traditional male audience, forcing Web site designers
to rethink their products, from the colors used to the tools
provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women report learning their way around the Internet with
the help of someone,'' said Juliet Habjan Boisselle, a research
librarian at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., speaking
at a recent seminar discussing women on the Web. ``Men report
learning solo. In other words, women will ask directions, men
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Women are more pressed in their personal and professional lives,
which also affects their use of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at women in the United States,'' Kovac said,
``most women work outside the home but still do most of the
housework. They have a second shift. The women on the Web are using
it to enrich their lives and get their work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Habjan Boisselle said many women were further hampered by
limited access to a computer connected to the Internet, logging on
through public libraries and other systems open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Steltmann, an IBM executive whose job is marketing
equipment to women over the Web, said, ``Research shows that women
put a higher value on service, reputation and quality. They also
value different kinds of information; they're not as interested in
raw horsepower.''
</P>
<P>
   Men, Steltmann explained, typically want to know the ``speeds
and feeds'' of the technology that IBM is offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``For women, our message is not only the technology but what it
can do for their businesses,'' she said. ``Women want to know how
it will make them more profitable and allow more work to be done in
less time.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM provides that sort of information in a special section of
its small-business Web site ``where we can communicate directly to
women business owners,'' Steltmann said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also advice columns from other women who own
businesses along with time-management tips and technology tools.
Although these could help any business owners, they are aimed at
women and geared to their reliance on peers and experts.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar fashion, Hifi.com has introduced Herhifi.com, which
sells the same stereos and televisions as the original Web site but
in a different way. Links to a plain-spoken expert are displayed
prominently. And, instead of listing products in traditional
categories such as home theater or video, with emphasis on the
gadget, Herhifi.com emphasizes context, selling products by room,
such as kitchen and home office.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that cater to women generally have more prominent search
tools, links to chat rooms and forums or other places where the
users can ask questions _ features that female Web users in surveys
say more sites should adopt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers should consider moving from a broadcasting model of
communication to an interactive and dynamic palette where users are
collaborators,'' Habjan Boisselle said. ``E-mail and forums are
information-seeking and gathering behaviors themselves, not just
socialization.''
</P>
<P>
   But as in the real world, not all women in cyberspace want the
same thing, which marketers ignore at their peril. Indeed, Heather
Wagner, a multimedia artist and former designer for HBO, said it is
often wrong to think of female Web users primarily as women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go to a site as a woman,'' Wagner said. ``I go to find
out financial information or something about the Knicks game. So,
I'm going as a financial person or a sports fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Newer sites that cater to women tend not to replicate the look
or the content of a supermarket tabloid, something many
female-oriented sites did at first.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Geller Ettenheim, the librarian for Femina.com, a
collection of women-oriented Web sites, said newer sites also
tightly integrate design and technology to speed performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``New sites geared to women are designed to load quickly and
help women navigate clearly to the information they are seeking,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites for women, such as Womenconnect.com and Silicon
Salley, take these lessons to heart, providing quick links on their
home pages to financial advice, for example. They include tips on
how to craft a resume, as well as chat rooms, e-mail and other
community-building features that were not available before the
Internet created site niches.
</P>
<P>
   But just as there is not a single type of site to serve all men
on the Web, neither is there a single quick fix to attract women
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any site, it is important to have strong design,'' Wagner
said. ``If you are presenting serious information, it is important
to be serious. You can't just go with pinks and purples.''

<P>
   ISSAQUAH, Wash. _ How can a company shoehorn the quintessential
big-box shopping experience onto the small screen of online
shopping?
</P>
<P>
   Carefully, if the Costco Wholesale Corp., the chain of enormous
and enormously successful warehouse stores, is any guide.
</P>
<P>
   While its competitors have taken high-profile plunges into
e-commerce _ Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is spinning off Walmart.com with
the venture capital firm Accel Partners, and Kmart has an online
venture with Yahoo called Bluelight.com _ Costco is sticking to a
slow but steady do-it-yourself strategy on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Costco.com went online with little fanfare in late 1998. The
company wanted to quietly test how customers would use the Web
site. It quickly discovered how lucrative e-commerce could be.
</P>
<P>
   The site generated $15 million in sales last fiscal year. This
year, Costco expects to sell about $95 million worth of products
online. That is about what each of the company's 320 stores sells
each year, on average. But within five years, the company projects
online revenues to be $500 million to $1 billion a year, the
equivalent of 5 to 10 stores' sales, at a fraction of the cost to
build and operate.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, that is still a tiny part of Costco's overall sales,
which are expected to be around $30 billion this year. Roughly the
same proportions can be applied to retail sales in general in the
United States: Only 1 percent occur on the Internet. But the number
is growing 200 percent to 300 percent a year, as in the case of
Costco. The growing success of its Web site is challenging Costco's
executives to think about how the big box and the small screen can
best work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge when they go online is to figure out who they
are,'' said George Strachan, a financial analyst for Goldman, Sachs
in New York. ``On land everyone knows who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Costco seems well poised to blend clicks and
mortar. Eighteen million members pay $35 a year to shop at Costco,
whether in stores or online; that includes 3.9 million small
businesses and nonprofit organizations, 78 percent of which already
use the Internet. And the Web could be another tool for what Costco
does best: lower costs to lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Costco has made a huge effort in recent years
to lure customers into its stores more often. Customers used to
visit the stores, on average, every four to eight weeks to stock up
on bulk supplies, such as gallons of olive oil and tubs of peanut
butter. Costco has added fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh-baked
bread, meat and even sushi to encourage more visits. It has worked.
Customers now visit a Costco about every two to four weeks. About 1
million people a day shop at Costcos in the United States, Britain,
Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Costco does not want these customers to drift away to the Web,
however, where everything is a click away, including Costco
competitors that are selling the same products at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Web site must succeed on its own, Richard
Galanti, Costco's chief financial officer, said in an interview at
the company's headquarters here in the suburbs of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the novel approach _ to make money at it,''
Galanti said.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent holidays, he went on, buyers for Costco
sometimes purchased consumer electronics from competitors who were
selling items below cost. Costco then resold these items on
Costco.com, adhering to the company's modus operandi of never
selling at a loss and never charging more than a 14 percent markup.
</P>
<P>
   Galanti said top executives at the company had rallied around
the site. But at first, James D. Sinegal, a Costco founder and its
chief executive, had to be persuaded that the Web was more than an
interesting but expensive bauble to adorn and perhaps distract from
the on-land business.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Craves, another founder of the company, was put in charge of
e-commerce. Craves likes to joke about being an old-fashioned
merchandiser and a klutz when it comes to technology. And he used a
traditional retailing gimmick to jump-start the Web site. Last
fall, customers in stores were offered 18 eggs in exchange for
their e-mail addresses; 1 million signed up.
</P>
<P>
   By the holidays, the site was generating steady sales,
especially of jewelry, electronics and computers. To keep the
momentum going, coupons for online sales were included in a booklet
mailed to members in January.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 1,800 items for sale on the site. And there is
growing overlap with items in the stores, although Costco
executives are still wary of cannibalizing the stores. Many
products are more expensive versions of products sold in the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the company plans to add thousands of office-supply
items, but like almost all of the products sold online, they will
be shipped directly from suppliers to online customers. Delivering
shipments of mixed items nationwide will require Costco to dedicate
some warehouse space to picking and packing goods for Web
customers.
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary Costco shoppers, tacking on delivery costs to bulk
purchases could cut into savings they might reap in loading up
their own cars at real stores.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, Costco has tried to replicate the experience of
shopping at its warehouse stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consciously made it bare bones,'' Galanti said. ``It's like
going into Costco.''
</P>
<P>
   But entering Costco.com is a markedly underwhelming experience
compared with entering a Costco warehouse store. The first thing a
visitor sees on the Web is a row of tiny pictures of special items
for sale: Zip drive disks, a Pokemon pinball machine and a
heart-shaped diamond pendant, among other things. This is an effort
to mimic what Costco calls the fence, oversize displays that
shoppers must pass upon entering a store.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, the fence looks much larger. Inside the Costco
warehouse across the street from corporate headquarters, hundreds
of rosebushes and giant stacks of Miracle-Gro greeted customers one
recent rainy afternoon, the display assaulting the senses. By
contrast, the tiny signs promoting the Web site are barely
noticeable. Customers seem to know about the site. But they prefer
to shop in the store, even if it means driving through a downpour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, online, I'm looking for one thing,'' said Tom
Conran, who was shopping with his wife, Marlene. ``I know what I
want and I go find it. Here we want this, but get that. It's more
spontaneous.''
</P>
<P>
   Conran was there to buy a walkie-talkie that was advertised
online at $49.99. Even though he had to pay $10 more for the
walkie-talkie at the store, he felt it was worth it because he
wanted it right away. Conran and his wife left the store pushing
two carts piled high, having spent $565.95.
</P>
<P>
   Another shopper, Daniel Higgins, was browsing the jewelry cases
to buy a gift for his wife's birthday. He knew that Costco sold
jewelry online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a brick-and-mortar guy,'' he said. ``Jewelry is an
intimate purchase. I would rather see it and touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Costco executives have discussed putting kiosks in stores with
computers connected to the Web site. But Galanti said they were
worried that they might be distracting.
</P>
<P>
   If Costco is anything, it is cautious about messing with a
proven formula for success: getting customers into the warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, perhaps, financial analysts such as Strachan of
Goldman, Sachs, who follow the company's traditional fortunes, and
e-commerce analysts who focus on future prospects, like Seema
Williams of Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., approve of
Costco's caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not beautiful, but it's a start,'' Williams said after
reviewing Costco.com.
</P>
<P>
   She said she shopped at Costco ``like a mad person once a
quarter to stock up on everything. Toilet-paper rolls, cat food,
socks, pants _ you can find most everything there,'' she said. ``I
would be delighted if they sold everything online.''
</P>
<P>
   The only rub is that Costco would like to get Williams into the
store more often, not less.

   Met Pledged Japan Art &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As soon as the last statues and scrolls, urns and
laquerware pieces were in place for the opening of ``Masterpieces
of Japanese Art From the Mary Griggs Burke Collection,'' a spring
exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum, Burke announced that she had
promised her entire collection to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, a trustee who has been involved with the Met since 1962,
has spent the last 37 years putting together what is now considered
the finest collection of Japanese art in private hands outside
Japan. ``This is one of the few private collections that is not
concentrated in one area,'' Philippe de Montebello, director of the
Met, said. ``It is truly encyclopedic.''
</P>
<P>
   Her collection includes about 300 works, everything from early
ceramic vessels from the middle Jomon period (circa 2500-1500 B.C.)
to ink paintings from the 14th century to 17th-century screens.
Fewer than 200 are in the current show.
</P>
<P>
   Burke and her late husband, Jackson Burke, a printer and
designer of typefaces who died in 1975, first became involved in
the Met in 1962. More than 100 works from their collection were
shown at the museum in 1975. In 1985 Burke lent her holdings to the
Tokyo National Museum, the first American collection to be shown in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has consistently lent art to the Metropolitan. Because so
many works in the Japanese galleries are light sensitive, the
curators rotate the collection several times a year and there are
always several of her objects on view.
</P>
<P>
   But the gift of her entire collection, de Montebello said,
``will transform the museum's collection in one stroke into one of
the greatest collections of Japanese art outside Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to present not just a good representative
cross-section of Japanese art,'' he said, ``but a sweeping panorama
of that great culture, and in many areas with great depth.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High Director &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a five-month search, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta has
announced that Michael E. Shapiro, its deputy director and chief
curator, will become the director. He replaces Ned Rifkin, who
became director of the Menil in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who was director of the Los Angeles County Museum for
10 months in 1994, joined the High the following year as director
of museum programs and its chief curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to maintain high-profile exhibitions,'' Shapiro said,
noting the six blockbuster shows, including ones on Matisse,
Picasso and Norman Rockwell, that have followed the exhibition the
museum put on during the Olympics. That 1996 show, ``Rings: Five
Passions in World Art,'' was organized by the High and J. Carter
Brown, director emeritus of the National Gallery of Art in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One coming show Shapiro expects will cause a stir is devoted to
Elton John's photography collection. John, a part-time resident of
Atlanta, has amassed one of the world's largest photography
collections. It includes about 2,000 vintage modern and
contemporary works, by artists like Berenice Abbott, Diane Arbus,
Henri Cartier-Bresson, Man Ray, Edward Steichen, Alfred Stieglitz,
Edward Weston and Tina Modotti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chorus of Light: Photographs From the Sir Elton John
Collection'' will be at the High Museum from Nov. 4 through Jan. 8,
2001. The exhibition, which will not travel elsewhere, will fill
the museum's fourth floor and will also spill over to the High's
downtown branch in the Georgia-Pacific Center. About 150 celebrity
photographs will be on view there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elton John feels an attachment to the city,'' Shapiro said.
``He has been a member of the museum's Director's Circle, which is
the highest level of membership.'' He is also recording the show's
audio tour. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asian Focus &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Asia Society's plans for its newly renovated home at 725
Park Ave., at 70th Street in Manhattan, include commissioning
site-specific works by Asian and Asian-American artists.
</P>
<P>
   Five arts professionals, working as a committee, will each
nominate two artists, who will be invited to submit two proposals
for installation pieces. Three to five of these proposed works will
be commissioned. The committee will submit their nominations by
June and the artists will be asked to submit proposals by August.
</P>
<P>
   The selections will be made by the fall. The goal is for the
works to be ready for installation next summer, in time for the
museum's re-opening next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pieces will be more or less permanent,'' said Vishakha N.
Desai, director of the Asia Society galleries and cultural
programs. ``Like the Calder at the National Gallery, we want pieces
that can be identified with the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Desi added that the invitational competition underscored the
institution's commitment to contemporary Asian art. The society has
also established a new curatorial post: associate curator of
contemporary Asian and Asian-American art. It will be a rotating
three-year position and the first curator will begin in early
2001. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harlem Moves &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over as director of the Studio Museum in Harlem,
Lowery Stokes Sims has come up with new ways to entice visitors _
especially while the museum's century-old building undergoes a
facelift.
</P>
<P>
   During the work, the 125th Street entrance will move from the
west door to the east door of 144 W. 125th St. The museum's store
will move, too. From Wednesday through Sept. 17, it will be in the
main galleries instead of in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we are inconveniencing the public, we will change our
admission from $5 to pay-what-you-wish,'' Sims said. The new policy
begins Friday and will continue through Sept. 17. The museum is
also permanently extending its hours. Starting Saturday, it will be
open Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Fridays, noon to 8
p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. It remains closed on
Mondays and Tuesdays.

 &UR; INDUSTRY STANDARDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Airplane Rule, Banana Problem.
</P>
<P>
   These terms apparently evolved independently, but are variations
of the same idea.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane rule is another version of the old ``Keep it
simple, stupid.'' The idea is that with hardware, software or Web
design, complexity can increase the possibilities of failure. A
two-engine plane is likely to have twice as many problems as one
with a single engine.
</P>
<P>
   The banana problem evolved from the old joke about spelling the
word ``banana'': You don't know when to stop. It refers to sites
where the designers, perhaps under orders to maximize the time
users stay, can't stop adding bells and whistles, until everything
is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   + Brochureware.
</P>
<P>
   Not the kindest of terms. It refers to a Web site that lacks
interactivity, that contains only basic information about a company
_ in short, a site that is little more than a brochure.
</P>
<P>
   + Disintermediation.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting out the middleman. A stodgy term, but it applies well to
selling on the Internet, which allows a manufacturer to have a
direct relationship with customers. And yes, the people who talk
about the next new thing are talking about re-intermediation.
</P>
<P>
   + Scalability.
</P>
<P>
   A good thing to have _ it means that your hardware and software
will keep working even as site visits or transactions soar.
Metaphorically, it applies to whether your whole concept will fly.
</P>
<P>
   + Viral Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Word-of-mouth marketing, Internet style. The customer does the
dirty work of spreading the news about a product or a service, as
with the notes that free services append to every e-mail message
telling recipients how to get the service.
</P>
<P>
   + Vortal.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively new term that only sounds like something the cat
dragged in. It's short for ``vertical portal,'' an Internet portal
for a narrow audience, such as Britney Spears fans.
</P>
<P>
   What's a portal? Such an old term hardly needs defining.

<P>
   Joan Kron, an editor at Allure magazine, did not think of
herself as a speculator when she registered some domain names in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But her Net-savvy son, Daniel, who is the founder and creative
director of SportsForWomen.com, convinced his mother that the time
was right to reserve a few addresses that she could use later to
promote a book that she was writing about plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Kron registered before-and-after.com and beforeandafter.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get `lift,' and it was owned by Otis Elevator,''
she says, laughing. Facelift.com was taken, too, so she claimed
face-lift.com for the Web site where she eventually posted reviews
of her book ``Lift: Wanting, Fearing and Having a Facelift''
(Viking, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later, she actually bought the nonhyphenated
name _ which is easier to type _ for $2,500, and the traffic to her
site rose instantly. Meanwhile, the calls she got from strangers
who wanted to buy beforeandafter.com only reinforced her feeling
that she was on to something. So began her participation in
domain-name acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The recent surge in advertising by dot-com companies has
heightened the demand for names that are simple, memorable and
immediately connote a marketable product or service. Many of those
coveted names are still available when followed by ``net'' and
``org,'' but most companies would rather have a dot-com name, the
equivalent of a storefront on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Web's beginning, there has been a rush to grab virtual
real estate. That rush has now turned into a free-for-all, with
many people and companies registering, buying and selling names,
sometimes for astronomical sums.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of business.com to Ecompanies, an incubator of Internet
businesses, for a record $7.5 million last November signified the
value of the right domain name. That is because an Internet domain
is an internationally unique address, a potential brand, positioner
and tag line all in one. In the best situation, it is also not
registered as a trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Start-up businesses are as likely to buy a dot-com domain name
as to create one. In the thriving aftermarket for such names, many
are on their third or fourth owners. Domains change hands both at
general-auction sites such as eBay and at new sites, such as
Afternic.com and GreatDomains.com, which are dedicated to such
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Some one- or two-word dot-com names are trading in the low six
figures. Afternic, started in November, listed more than 78,000
domains for sale in February _ at least 80 percent of them
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   How much is a dot-com name worth?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to find its true market value is to float it,
like any other commodity,'' says John Whalen, a chief operating
officer at Afternic. ``The New York Stock Exchange is an exchange
for securities _ well, we're an exchange for domain names.''
</P>
<P>
   If the market value is high, the seller will reap a windfall,
because it costs only $70 every two years to register rights to a
domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Muenyong, a 23-year-old entrepreneur from Diamond Bar,
Calif., recently put mad.com for sale on Afternic, and is looking
forward to reaping a substantial profit. The bidding had reached
$225,000 as this article went to press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an addiction,'' Muenyong says. ``You find a name. It
costs you $70. You sell it for 10 times more than that. You're
like, `That's unbelievable.'''
</P>
<P>
   It has become difficult at times to distinguish among
domain-name speculation, cybersquatting and outright theft.
Speculators reserve names with the potential for future brand
development.
</P>
<P>
   So-called cybersquatters register names they know are
trademarked, hoping to coerce payment from the trademark owners.
Such was the case in January, when the Federal District Court in
Manhattan ordered Sau Wong of Hillsborough, Calif., to relinquish
msdw.com to the securities firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Another tactic is to exploit public confusion by registering a
domain name closely resembling a high-profile name, to try to
increase traffic on the similar-sounding site. Web surfers who go
to WhiteHouse.com instead of WhiteHouse.gov, for example, wind up
at a pornographic site.
</P>
<P>
   But most speculators say they register their domain names in
good faith, often while brainstorming business ideas. The practice
becomes more controversial if they grab a couple of names
simultaneously. Such speculators spend hours searching Network
Solutions, a database of registered domains, to devise new ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1998, while he was researching the name of his
new site, iranks.com, Muenyong discovered that a series of domain
names with the prefix ``i'' had not been taken. Within weeks, he
had registered several hundred _ he is now selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Muenyong began operating mad.com as a site for the Massive Adult
Directory, a guide to the development of pornography sites, when he
was barely old enough to view those sites' content legally. A
future buyer of mad.com, however, may use the name for an entirely
different kind of site.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Lackert, a lawyer who handles domain-name dispute
resolution for the World Intellectual Property Organization, says
buyers are taking a risk if they purchase a domain name that
resembles someone else's registered trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Registering such a name on the Internet is easy, he says, but it
is ``not the same thing as clearing a trademark for availability
and use.''
</P>
<P>
   For those others, who, like Kron, are sitting on domain names
that do not infringe on a trademark, foresight may prove lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, I'm going to keep the name,'' she says of
facelift.com. ``I think it's an annuity for my children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a long-term investment,'' she adds, ``but I
didn't buy it for a long-term investment. I bought it for vanity,
for power, for the fun of ownership.''

 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Europe may be an Internet laggard, but the e-commerce sites that
seem to be succeeding are growing on European turf, not imported
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One German company, Bertelsmann Online (www.bol.com), is trying
to replicate the success of Amazon.com in Europe, with sites in
Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
Bertelsmann, the parent and media conglomerate, owns a stake of
barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Wermelinger, the chief executive of bol.com, discusses the
challenges of creating such an e-commerce site. Here are excerpts
from the conversation. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Bol.com is trying to appeal to customers in six countries. If
the Internet is global, why do you need separate sites?
</P>
<P>
   WERMELINGER: One really important issue for an e-commerce
company to successfully enter Europe is to be localized.
</P>
<P>
   You have this multicultural situation, not only with many
languages, but even with customers' payment behavior. In parts of
Europe, if you're only going to accept credit cards, you're lost.
In some places you'll lose 60 percent of your customers, simply
because they won't give you their credit-card number.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If each bol.com site is local, what is the benefit of
creating a Pan-European brand?
</P>
<P>
   WERMELINGER: Take, for instance, Holland and Belgium, which have
the same language. Sites in Europe can do cross-border business
using the same site.
</P>
<P>
   Take Germany and Switzerland. They have the same newspapers,
which talk about the same things, so we can do cross-border
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can a European brand crack the American self-centeredness on
the Web?
</P>
<P>
   WERMELINGER: Amazon is in Europe, but they haven't been able to
break into more than two countries. You can't find a French or
Spanish Amazon yet.
</P>
<P>
   Every country is so different that it's the local businesses
with local partners that I suspect will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Isn't it harder to reach many fragmented audiences?
</P>
<P>
   WERMELINGER: It doesn't make it harder. When you look into the
individual sites, the framework is the same.
</P>
<P>
   The content is local, and we have local people working for each
site, but the development costs are spread across all the sites.
You have three or four products on one site, and that's what you
have in every country, but the products are not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the United States, analysts predict that many Web
businesses will either merge or go bankrupt. With so many
micromarkets in Europe, are sites equally vulnerable?
</P>
<P>
   WERMELINGER: In every country we have many competitors. In the
end, there will be one or two big ones who will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The price of goods in Europe tends to be higher than in the
United States. Is it more expensive to operate in Europe than it is
across the pond?
</P>
<P>
   WERMELINGER: I don't think the costs are that different.
</P>
<P>
   On the labor issue, yes, you might have to pay higher wages. But
that is offset by the revenue generated from the products, which in
Europe are sold at a higher pricing level than in the States.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many e-commerce sites in the United States are financed
partly from sky-high valuations that were spawned by the frenzy for
initial public offerings. Is the European market ready for dot-com
mania?
</P>
<P>
   WERMELINGER: Doing an IPO in Europe is certainly newer than in
the States. But right now, with so much talk about the Internet,
I'm sure the markets will be receptive to IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Asia seems to be fertile ground for e-commerce expansion.
Indeed, bol.com is preparing a site in Japan. Will Americans
prevail there, will Europeans give them a fight or will local
companies dominate?
</P>
<P>
   WERMELINGER: Asia is an important market. When you look at
Japan, China, Korea, no big site is there yet.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the single biggest market for our business outside of
America. But, again, what's important in Japan is to not be
European or American. It's a very service-driven country, so being
localized will be the key.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Technology is changing, at different rates in different parts
of the world. How do you respond to the continuous changes?
</P>
<P>
   A : Some countries are going to skip the PC generation and move
directly into the mobile generation. For instance, there will be
more hand-held devices in China in two years than there will be in
all of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That is something that an e-commerce company has to be aware of,
and we will have to adjust our model and our technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will you adapt your business to accommodate hand-held
devices?
</P>
<P>
   WERMELINGER: The concept of doing e-commerce on a mobile is
different doing it on a computer. You can't put everything into
that small window on the mobile.
</P>
<P>
   The business model will change. It will become more promotional,
more search-engine-driven and more lists-driven. Mobile customers
will act faster _ they will need information faster. Therefore, you
will need to change the interface.
</P>
<P>
   However, the offerings will probably be more limited on mobile
devices.

THE GHOSTS OF MOUNT RAINIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT RAINIER, Wash. _ They are entombed by glacial ice, hidden
in towering, snow-covered forests, shrouded in mystery dense as
alpine clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of 65 men lie unrecovered in Mount Rainier National
Park _ fully a fifth of the 323 who have died in the park since it
was established a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of Mount Rainier belong to a fraternity whose
membership is based on geography, misfortune and circumstance. Some
courted danger, some were oblivious to risk, and some never
bargained on landing on a 14,411-foot mountain in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Several were Boeing Co. engineers. Almost half of them were
Marines who boarded a Curtiss Commando transport plane bound for
Seattle 54 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Six of them were named Bill. Three were named Duane.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of them died alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is the free-lance photographer who set off on a
picturesque hike near the eastern edge of the park in 1997. There
is the medical-school graduate from Plains, Ga., who sneaked in an
afternoon of snowboarding last year, two days before he was to
start his residency in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There are the erudite New York City birdwatcher, the
light-hearted Port Orchard skier, and the Hatfield, Pa., climber
who paused under an ice cliff in 1981 _ and died moments later with
10 others in the nation's worst mountaineering accident.
</P>
<P>
   They remain buried despite massive search-and-recovery efforts,
despite summer snowmelts, despite churning rivers of ice that move
boxcar-sized slabs down the mountain like an imperceptible conveyor
belt. Victims of nature or human error, they are enmeshed in the
physical landscape of the park and their stories and names are a
part of its lore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them died without leaving a clue to their whereabouts
and few are ever expected to be unearthed from the slopes of a
volcano that Tulalip tribal culture compares to an ill-tempered
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Rainier collects its own memories,'' observes avid
hiker and writer Bruce Barcott.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Rainier and outdoors enthusiasts such as Barcott rightly
tout the lush valleys, expansive snowfields and lofty peaks of the
wilderness that spreads across Pierce and Lewis counties. Awed,
they point out the grandeur of its 25 glaciers and the austerity of
its summit steam caves.
</P>
<P>
   But danger parallels beauty in a park where a popular vista
carries the name Paradise, and where treacherous cliffs bear the
name of Doug Vercoe, a man who fell from them.
</P>
<P>
   The glaciers and the heavy snowfall that creates them are key
reasons so many of Rainier's dead are unrecovered. Deep fissures,
called crevasses, open and close as glacial ice slowly moves down
the mountainside. Also, heavy snows, avalanches and the general
ruggedness of the terrain make discovery _ and recovery _
enormously difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the years dull the keen edge of your grief, perhaps you
will come to agree with the families of the 32 Marines who lie in
the South Tahoma Glacier, that he could not have a more
magnificently beautiful resting place,'' park Superintendent
Preston Macy wrote to the grieving mother of a snowshoer who
vanished above Paradise in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sentiment that resonates with Barcott, author of the
recent book, ``Measure of a Mountain: Beauty and Terror on Mount
Rainier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that is more hallowed and sacred about
Rainier that, in my mind, would make it psychologically easier to
think that someone had died (there) and not been found,'' he said.
``You'd be remembered in a way that you probably wouldn't be in the
Olympics or someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   But some relatives of the dead, who cling to hopes that the
mountain will one day reveal the bodies of their loved ones, take
little solace in its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never call it a closed book or chapter until they have a
burial like all the other average Americans,'' wrote a Kansas City
mother of a Marine killed in the 1946 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us the same thing, that if Joseph had to go, he
could not have chosen a more breathtaking place,'' recalls
Elizabeth Wood, whose son vanished last July while hiking toward
Mildred Point in the southwest corner of the park. ``But not
knowing what happened is the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Rainier's mysteries, Wood's disappearance last year is among
the most puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike snowshoer Lowell Linn, who set off down the mountain in a
blizzard, or skier Jim Kampe, who marched upward in a whiteout,
birdwatcher Joe Wood walked along a steeply sloping ridge in
perfect weather.
</P>
<P>
   He'd stolen away from a journalism conference in Seattle to see
the mountain goats, wildflowers and birds usually visible from Van
Trump Park in late June and early July.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, his friends alerted authorities when he failed
to show up to work at a New York City publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   By that point neither bloodhounds nor hundreds of volunteer
searchers could pinpoint where he strayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost people before that we have never found, but they
were always isolated incidents,'' said park ranger Rick Kirschner.
``Last year we lost one, two, three, four, five, six people and
only found two. ... it was a total feeling of `Are we doing
something wrong here, are we missing some clues?' It was really a
tough year for the rangers and for the families. No resolution for
any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Few understand the pain of mourning for Rainier's hidden victims
better than Kirschner.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the National Park Service, his signature can be
found at the bottom of scores of incident reports detailing
searches for missing and injured park visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by climbers whose bodies have never been located, he
carries around a tattered photocopied list of the belongings and
physical description of Kampe, the skier who schussed into a
whiteout on the Muir Snowfield a decade ago. A 5-inch wedge of
metal Kirschner spied at the bottom of a river basin a few years
ago sits in his office. It turned out to be a piece of the Marine
airplane that crashed in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, Kirschner speculates about what happened to
Wood, Kampe, photographer Chet Hansen, and climbing partners Chris
Hartonas and Raymond Vakili.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago park regular Gordon Thompson took a ski trip on
the mountain with Kampe and two other friends.
</P>
<P>
   Kampe ranged ahead of the other three in whiteout conditions,
and when the weather forced the others to turn back, they lost
contact with him. When the weather cleared, searchers found no
trace.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson still has a map from the search of Kampe's last known
location with an X marked near Wild Woman Rocks and a notation,
``Jim Kampe last seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old moth-eaten, U.S. Geological 7-minute topo map.
It's falling apart,'' Thompson says ruefully. ``It's not as if I'm
constantly thinking of Jim, but when I'm there or when I think of
somebody going missing, I think about him and where he is and I
think about the search effort and the job the rangers did
searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always second-guessing yourself, wondering what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner knows the feeling: ``The answer is usually the same
all around: You just don't know,'' he says solemnly as he peers
over a map of the 378-square-mile park.
</P>
<P>
   But off the top of his head, and without consulting the reams of
documents cataloging fatalities on Rainier since 1887, he can plot
most of the bodies the mountain has kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vercoe would be in a crevasse on the Cowlitz Glacier,''
Kirschner says, pointing to a white swath where gravity would have
dragged Vercoe when the cornice, or ice ledge, he was standing on
fell and triggered a massive avalanche. ``Allen Douglas, here in
the Carbon River area. A trail crew found his pack hanging from the
back of a tree near the Ispet Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Taylor would be here, somewhere, below Success Cleaver,''
he adds, marking a long rib of crumbling volcanic rock that rises
more than 7,000 feet from the base of Pyramid Peak to Point
Success.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to 23-year-old park ranger David Taylor, a Wooster,
Ohio, native who disappeared on the morning of Nov. 18, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He and fellow ranger Carl Fabiani were trying to become the
first climbers to summit by way of the Success Cleaver route in the
wintertime. They were unroped as they retreated from avalanches,
heavy snow and fog on the seldom-climbed route.
</P>
<P>
   As they descended to 9,500 feet, Taylor disappeared in snow
flurries. Once the visibility improved, Fabiani couldn't find
Taylor. He took shelter under rocks that night and rose early the
next morning to continue to search for his companion, whom he
described as a strong, resourceful climber. Then Fabiani spent the
next 40 hours climbing off the treacherous cleaver, crossing two
glaciers and trekking through woods to the west side of the
mountain and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers picked up the fruitless search. When they returned to
the Paradise ranger station, their whiskers and eyebrows were
frosted with snow and their parkas and packs armored in rime ice.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's father and stepmother had holed up at Longmire for
several days, waiting for the good news that rescuers found their
son.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers delivered the discouraging word instead.
</P>
<P>
   The message went something like what then-Superintendent Macy
wrote to an insurance company in the late '50s about Lowell Linn:
</P>
<P>
   ``To date the search has been futile. ... We have no reason to
doubt that the body is up there; we simply have been unable to find
it. In that rugged terrain one could walk within a few feet of it
without seeing it if it were wedged between large rocks or in a
snow or ice crevasse. There are also many places a body could have
become buried. The possibility of finding it in the near future is
becoming more remote every day. We have found no authentic clues,
but will continue a systematic search of all possible areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Working on a mountain that has its own weather system, where
harsh conditions move in without warning, Kirschner has had to pen
more than a few letters like this himself.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally, closure comes to a glacier.
</P>
<P>
   It did half a world away in 1991, when hikers discovered the
so-called ``Iceman from the Similaun.'' The remarkably
well-preserved Bronze Age hunter was found sticking out of the
glacier at about 10,000 feet in Austria's Tyrolean mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Last August it happened again in British Columbia's
Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Wilderness Park, nearly 1,000 miles
north of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters there stumbled over the equally well-preserved body of a
4,000-year-old man uncovered by a melting glacier.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists think the hunter died as a result of being wedged in
a tight ice crack _ like Jim Tuttle, who fell into a crevasse
during a summit climb on Mount Rainier's Ingraham Glacier in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Rainier is no different from the Austrian Alps or the mountains
of Northern Canada. Sometimes it, too, gives up its dead.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, lead climbing ranger Mike Gauthier watched in dismay
as a minute-long avalanche rumbled over the area where a skier had
fallen to his death hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   If weather conditions had been poor or avalanches continued on
the notorious Thermogenesis route, a 4,000-foot snow and ice gully
prone to frequent slides, David Mattias Perrson could easily have
remained buried there.
</P>
<P>
   But fair conditions allowed two military Chinook helicopters to
fly in before dawn with rangers who investigated a bloodstained
field of snow for the body of the Vancouver, B.C. man.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning arrived and the warmth of sunlight began the
melting process that often precedes avalanches, the rangers
considered calling off the search.
</P>
<P>
   Just then Gauthier's partner picked up a signal from the radio
Perrson carried. Homing in on the transmission, they found Perrson
buried under nearly a foot of snow and ice. After extricating his
body, they secured him into a chest harness and clipped it to a
rope attached to a helicopter hovering above.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the sunrise splash onto the Willis Wall, Gauthier knew
the rescue could have ended differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an underlying tone, almost a drone, that was the
background of knowing we (had gone) into a dangerous situation to
try to find the body of a man who died doing what most of us do for
fun, and try to give his family some closure,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Closure came seven years late for relatives of Julie Fillo.
</P>
<P>
   Fillo, a 20-year-old park employee, began a 19-mile hike along
the Cowlitz Divide portion of the Wonderland Trail on the sunny
Sunday morning of June 30, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   When she didn't show up for work two days later, her colleagues,
friends and relatives launched an aerial and foot search.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1984 that a late summer melt revealed a tattered
sleeping bag and a grouping of bones near a little-visited
waterfall on a branch of Needle Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner hurried to the site. He wasn't sure who the remains
belonged to until he noticed a glint of metal on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was a silver-topped green ballpoint pen, inscribed with the
words, Fillo Sales &AMP; Engineering Co., St. Louis, Mo. 63119. One
mystery had been solved.
</P>
<P>
   Another was resolved in 1992 with the discovery of a plane that
crashed in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner came across the fuselage the way Rainier's remains are
usually discovered _ by happenstance during a pleasure hike in the
park. He was trekking across a ridge with his wife when she spotted
a blue item in the snow below. His curiosity was piqued because it
was the general area where Kampe was believed to have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner returned the next day and climbed down to find the
item was a recently discarded plastic tarp. While he was down on
the valley floor with a colleague, he noticed another blue item
further afield. A few days later, while riding in an army plane
during a rescue drill, he asked the pilot to swing over the second
blue item. It also turned out to be insignificant, but as they
passed, he and the pilot spied what appeared to be an airplane
fuselage and wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plane was news to me. We had never even been aware that
it crashed in the park,'' he said. Down at the crash site,
Kirschner found bones in a boot still pressed on the foot pedal
inside the cockpit. Nearby, searchers uncovered an engraved ring.
From the tail N-number, park officials learned the plane had gone
missing 20 years earlier, in 1972, with three car dealers from
Spokane on board.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation officials had never guessed the plane might have
crashed in the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that there are planes that we haven't found,
people who we don't even know are missing,'' says Kirschner. ``But
my own gut feeling is that we'll find at least a couple of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday.

GLACIERS _ AND ENTOMBED BODIES _ SLOWLY SLIDING DOWN RAINIER

<P>
   MOUNT RAINIER, Wash. _ It might seem like magic if the remains
of two mountain climbers who vanished atop Mount Rainier almost a
century ago were to reappear at the base of one of its glaciers a
decade from now.
</P>
<P>
   But to glaciologists, the phenomenon would be pure science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that hypothetically, they could come out,''
hydrologist Carolyn Driedger says of climbers Joseph W. Stevens and
T.Y. Callaghan.
</P>
<P>
   Driedger, who works for the U.S. Geological Survey, is an expert
on the history of Rainier's 25 glaciers. She has spent a career
studying the seemingly unchanging structures that have dominated
the Puget Sound landscape for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Like the thousands of glaciers sprinkled around the world,
Rainier's glaciers are flowing, organic entities.
</P>
<P>
   Their movements are the reason Stevens and Callaghan, last seen
Aug. 14, 1909, as they approached the summit from the 12,660-foot
Gibraltar Rock, could eventually re-emerge thousands of feet lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glaciers creep downward like cold molasses moving downhill,''
Driedger said from her office inside the Cascades Volcano
Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Gravity is the main reason for the movement. So are the vast
amounts of snow that fall on the higher slopes of Rainier each
year. As new snowfall covers previously fallen snow and ice,
gravity drags the snow downward along the slope.
</P>
<P>
   When a body or a piece of climbing equipment falls into a crack
in the glacier's surface, known as a crevasse, it becomes part of
the flowing motion, explained Terri Mathews, an instructor in
geology at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that falls into the glacier will be carried along
until it reaches the end of the glacier,'' Mathews said. ``This may
take years.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaciologists have developed mathematical formulas to find out
when an object left on the summit surface would emerge near the
terminus, or snout, of a glacier. Based on the surface slope,
thickness of ice and the pressure the ice exerts on rockbed, the
formulas offer an estimate not unlike the one rangers made in 1909,
when Stevens and Callaghan disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan, an experienced woodsman from Oregon, and Stevens, a
vacationing contractor from Trenton, N.J., vanished during a
blizzard as they made their way without a guide to Camp Misery, at
the foot of Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather cleared, searchers discovered the pair's
alpenstocks and packs. Not far away, they found tracks leading over
shale rock near the crater and down the edge of a stomach-churning
ice cliff at the head of the White River Glacier, now known as
Ingraham Glacier. Park rangers surmised the two fell off the cliff,
possibly into a deep crevasse.
</P>
<P>
   Using a formula that predicted 10 inches of daily movement along
the six-mile-long glacier, rangers predicted the climbers'
ice-encased bodies would remain frozen until they arrived at the
snout 102 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' family so strongly believed the prediction that they
posted a $500 reward for the eventual recovery of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Driedger called the 90-year-old estimate ``pretty
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the math and it is quite possible they're in the lower
part of the terminus now, still in the ice or thawed. Seventy to
100 years is a real good estimate without having measured the
velocity of the glacier.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers could have been expected to recover some of the remains
in the 1980s if the men had fallen onto the glacier's surface and
been covered with snow.
</P>
<P>
   But bodies of climbers who tumble into crevasses take much
longer to emerge from the solid ice that makes up much of a
glacier's structure, Driedger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside a crevasse is a really drippy place. There's a lot of
water there. An object there is going to be subject to more ice,
more freezing and melting, than an object on the surface. And it
won't move downward at the same velocity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of 11 climbers killed in an icefall in 1981 may
illustrate the different velocities of glacial movement. Some of
those who were plowed under by truck-sized chunks of ice beneath
the Ingraham Falls landed inside a deep crevasse that filled with
rushing snow and ice. Others killed in the ice avalanche remained
on the surface of the slope.
</P>
<P>
   The personal effects and remains of the latter group could
resurface sooner than the former group, and more quickly than the
climbers lost in 1909, Driedger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fell in just above the equilibrium line, or the level on
the glacier to which the annual snowfall melts, so they're going to
come out to the surface before someone who went into the summit,''
she explained. ``But the actual `when' isn't clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Glacial movement, while imperceptible to the naked eye, has been
charted at Rainier for nearly 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma City Light Co. first began recording the movement of
Rainier's southern-facing Nisqually Glacier, now one of the most
studied glaciers in the world, in 1931. The power company's goal
was rooted in an interest in hydroelectric power, but its data has
helped scientists measure how the glacier has moved through the
years.
</P>
<P>
   During May 1970, the glacier was measured moving as fast as 29
inches per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has gone out and measured the velocity of other
glaciers, so they apply the lessons of Nisqually and use an average
of 10 inches a day,'' Driedger said. ``That's what they did in
1909.''

   TO: My friends in the San Francisco Bay Area, center of the
universe
</P>
<P>
   FROM: Matt
</P>
<P>
   SUBJECT: Search for Silicon Alley
</P>
<P>
   Friends, I write from the Big Apple, home to Broadway shows,
museums and unmatched cuisine. What a backwater!
</P>
<P>
   Unlike our enlightened and searingly focused Silicon Valley,
this place is distracted from the most important pursuit of our
era, the Internet revolution. Here, innovation is not a cause
celebre, tech entrepreneurs are scarce and, sadly, many people are
in their late 20s before they get their first stock option.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is said to be a place called Silicon Alley, New
York's answer to Northern California, a Manhattan enclave of
high-technology entrepreneurs. I decided to check it out, which
wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, many people I spoke with on the street cared
little about the digital revolution, and inexplicably have no plans
to quit their jobs, drop out of school or leave a spouse to start
an Internet company. More to the immediate point, they have no idea
where Silicon Alley is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it what?'' said Bashir Saleh, who sells coffee and
bagels just off Times Square, and who suggested I walk south.
``Maybe it's near Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't he just say he doesn't even want to be an Internet
billionaire?
</P>
<P>
   So I began my descent, walking through the garment district and
past Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Saleh wasn't the only person incapable of giving directions to
the Alley. I stopped, but got no satisfaction from, a police
officer, security guards, food vendors and numerous passers-by,
including a woman named Alison Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in Washington State,'' Bradford said. ``That's
where Bill Gates is from.''
</P>
<P>
   Have these people no shame?! I engaged her in word association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Bezos,'' I said reverently of the founder of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't heard of him,'' she admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``IPO,'' I said next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's when you get stock shares before someone
else,'' she muttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandwidth,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No idea,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   I gave up. This woman wasn't tech-savvy in the least. She
probably thinks Unix refers to people who have been neutered.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford was in a hurry, she said, because she had to get to a
taping of ``The Ricki Lake Show,'' a program whose appeal is
utterly beyond me, given that they rarely talk about day trading.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked farther south, and east, I met Maryann Finnegan.
``You've come to the wrong place if you want to talk computer
jargon,'' Finnegan said. I was, however, in the right place to talk
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   She owns Foliage Garden, a shop in the flower district.
Surrounded by beautiful azaleas in front of her shop, she said she
suspected Silicon Alley was just another commercial district in New
York, like the diamond or toy district, or a neighborhood, like
Chelsea or Little Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aha! It's just as I suspected. Silicon Alley is an afterthought
here. After all, Northern California has great activities, too, but
we don't let them subvert the Internet revolution. I would have
told Finnegan that, but I got directions to Little Italy instead. I
also asked for a restaurant recommendation, directions to the East
Village, tips on getting tickets to ``Cats'' and what it would be
like to get into the flower business.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case this e-commerce stuff doesn't pan out.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Finnegan has an interesting business model in
that she appears to be making a profit. This is something we may
want to experiment in the e-commerce space.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I was becoming discouraged, fearful that this backwater
might pull me in, a vision appeared across the horizon. As I
wandered south on Broadway, around 25th Street, munching on a giant
falafel from a street vendor, I saw a giant sign hanging from a
building two blocks away on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   It read ``DoubleClick welcomes you to Silicon Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   Success!
</P>
<P>
   Drawn like a Crusader to the Grail, but with much less chain
mail, I headed for the sign. I had arrived. There, beneath the
sign, was a familiar sight, a man strolling down the street working
on a Palm Pilot (albeit an outdated version). I called out to him,
high-tech brother to high-tech brother, ``Sir, can you tell me
where to find the heart of Silicon Alley?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of what?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Alley,'' I said, bewildered. ``Aren't we in Silicon
Alley?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never heard of it,'' he said, standing beneath the sign, which
he apparently had not seen or bothered to read. ``Maybe it's near
SoHo.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, Ben Bocardo, said we might or might not have been
standing in Silicon Alley, but he didn't know and didn't care. He
said he did know the music district, which is uptown. He said he
was a bass player. I asked him if he performed music for streaming
over the Internet or for downloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live,'' he explained. Sounds interesting, I thought. Maybe I
can check out his performance after I see ``Cats'' and visit the
Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   But I still wondered: Had I found Silicon Alley or not?
</P>
<P>
   I finally found out. I took a subway to Wall Street (fascinating
area; you should check it out sometime) and asked the participants
in a conference titled ``Silicon Alley Executive'' where I could
find the Alley.
</P>
<P>
   They confessed the truth: They were not sure either. The area
where I had been standing beneath the DoubleClick sign turned out
to be the original center of it all. But, they explained, it is now
a broader term for the community of Internet companies in the New
York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a general place,'' said Len Duckman, the sales manager
for Interactive Futures, a Web consulting firm. ``It's like
Brigadoon.''
</P>
<P>
   So it turns out Silicon Alley is both everywhere and nowhere,
and, in either case, merely a piece of New York, along with Wall
Street, Broadway, the flower district, nooks and neighborhoods,
fashion, falafel vendors, street-side food, artists and musicians
and even, in what they call the ``boroughs,'' places where people
actually make tangible things. In short, can you believe how myopic
this place is? It doesn't hold a candle to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   To find out how myopic, I plan to stay awhile to check out the
attractions. Anybody know the way to SoHo?
</P>

   ELIAN _ MIAMI _ A mood of public resistance was rising here as
the Thursday deadline approached for U.S. immigration officials to
begin the process of repatriating 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba
unless his relatives here agree to give the boy up if their legal
case to keep him fails. (Williams, Cox News Service)

   ELIAN-GORE _ WASHINGTON _ The Elian Gonzalez case could be a
political setback for Al Gore. Though Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
has the advantage in a state where his brother is governor, the
Clinton-Gore ticket won the state in 1996. That victory was partly
due to strong support from Miami's Cuban-American community,
however, and the Elian case threatens to sap that support.

   ELIAN-RENO _ WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno expressed
confidence Thursday that Cuban-Americans in Miami would not
obstruct government efforts to repatriate Elian Gonzalez if that
became necessary. ``I don't think they came to this country to
incite violence,'' Reno said. ``I think they came to this country
to be able to speak their mind, to follow the law, to respect
others, and to see that those processes were carried out. (Schultz,

administration's goal. The Pentagon remains the biggest offender,

billion in property, plant and equipment. (Malone, Cox News

   ALAMIN _ ATLANTA _ Evidence specialists will begin combing

vacuum up every speck of dirt and fiber in the car and examine it
all. Most of what they find will be meaningless. But evidence of
contraband, such as guns, would be a big score. The car, the tag
found nearby, might also provide clues about others who might have
helped him in Alabama. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   DABRAT _ The shooting outside rapper Da Brat's Buckhead
apartment complex two weeks ago had nothing to do with the singer,
according to authorities. ``This is just a terrible coincidence,''
said Sgt. Rick Chambers of the Atlanta police department's guns
unit. APD says the shooting was a drug-related hit that went awry
and they are trying to get the intended target to talk. Police
however are still looking for the two shooters, masked men in a
mid-90s silver Thunderbird. Meanwhile, in Miami DaBrat said she was
busy with her new music video and had never really thought much
about whether or worried that the shooter was targeting her. She
also said that her family moved her out of the area for safety
reasons. (Longa, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BUS-TRAIN _ TENNGA, Ga. _ Investigators began the tedious task
Thursday of recreating the train-school bus crash that killed three
children. Using a 1998 school bus matching the one hit Tuesday and
the same CSX locomotive involved in the accident, safety officals
spent the day making measurements to determine when driver Rhonda
Cloer should have been able to see and hear the oncoming train.

   BUSH-GUNS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ At sunup in an open field near
Houston, in a photo op, Bush learned how guns can banfire. Aiming
for publicity for a staged dove hunt, Bush knocked a protected
species from the sky. But overall, guns have served Bush's
political career well, inc luding his high-profile support for
concealed weapons bill, which helped propel him into state office.
Now the gun industry could help propel him to national office.

   ELIAN-GORE _ WASHINGTON _ The Elian Gonzalez case could be a
political setback for Al Gore. Though Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
has the advantage in a state where his brother is governor, the
Clinton-Gore ticket won the state in 1996. That victory was partly
due to strong support from Miami's Cuban-American community,
however, and the Elian case threatens to sap that support.

   BUSH-UNITER _ AUSTIN, Texas _ He is, he tells us constantly, a
``uniter, not a divider.'' But George W. Bush's self-proclaimed
big-tent credentials are under fire from the Log Cabin Republicans,
a gay group that says Bush's unwillingness to meet with them is
``no way to win converts, which Bush needs to do for the sake of
the GOP's chances of winning elections.'' (Herman, Austin

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,'' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes,
Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R,
101 minutes; winner of best foreign-language film Oscar). A whole
new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical
exaggeration of his earlier work have blossomed into a
sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt.
Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this
film weaves its own soap opera around ``A Streetcar Named Desire''
and tells of splendidly resilient women; Almodovar has aptly
described his material as ``screwball drama.'' Rich and
entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and
impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible San
Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named
Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey (winner of best actor
Oscar), Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch.
Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes;
winner of best picture, director, cinematography and
original-screenplay Oscars). With heavenly finesse Spacey plays a
buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``BOILER ROOM,'' starring Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Ben
Affleck. Written and directed by Ben Younger (R, 110 minutes).
Ribisi portrays a stockbroker in training at a fly-by-night company
called J.T. Marlin. Like Oliver Stone's ``Wall Street,'' ``Boiler
Room'' tells the story of an ambitious young man's rise, fall and
redemption. And like Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox, Ribisi's Seth carries
some heavy Oedipal baggage _ a troubled relationship with his
demanding, disapproving father _ onto the trading floor. At its
best, which is awfully good, ``Boiler Room'' avoids the thumping
moralism that has made Stone the least misunderstood director in
Hollywood. It's less about selling your soul than about feeling
your oats (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``BOYS DON'T CRY,'' starring Hilary Swank (winner of best
actress Oscar) and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R,
114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and
resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena
Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man.
Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on
screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy.
The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with
the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of last year's
best (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,'' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize
Theron, Delroy Lindo and Michael Caine (winner of best supporting
actor Oscar). Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with an
Oscar-winning Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned
into a lovely World War II-era fable about a young man venturing
into the world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent brought
up in an orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple
(Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940s
``David Copperfield'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``ERIN BROCKOVICH,'' starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 127 minutes). After a promising,
effective beginning, in which Roberts proves what a fine actress
she can be and Soderbergh demonstrates yet again that he is one of
the most thoughtful and original directors in Hollywood, ``Erin
Brockovich'' becomes a doggedly conventional crusader-for-justice
Hollywood melodrama, a smooth second-hand amalgam of ``Norma Rae''
and ``Silkwood,'' with vigorous nods to ``The Rainmaker'' and ``A
Civil Action.'' Roberts, playing a working-class single mother who
spearheads an effort to win justice for victims of corporate
negligence, aggressively solicits an Oscar nomination. After acting
for about 40 minutes, Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a
movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to
bursting with moral vanity and phony populism. It is as if she had
a clause in her contract strictly limiting anyone else's right to
be attractive or appealing on screen. Who could have foreseen that
Soderbergh, the most brilliantly unpredictable of filmmakers, could
have made a movie so utterly hokey and conventional? (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,'` starring Forest Whitaker.
Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes). In this film Jarmusch
does for the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did for
the western in ``Dead Man,'' his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of
cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Here he has composed a ruminative,
bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism, which
may frustrate audiences expecting more visceral thrills. ``Ghost
Dog'' is worth seeing for Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a
modern-day samurai caught up in a Mafia vendetta, for Jarmusch's
offbeat sense of cinematic style and for the hip-hop artist the
RZA's brilliant musical effects (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``MISSION TO MARS,'' starring Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins.
Directed by Brian De Palma (PG, 113 minutes). This film's visual
design is spectacular, and the scenes on the Martian surface look
so real that the picture could have been made on location. But the
movie is undermined by De Palma's uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe.
All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment
for adults out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity
on Mars. Sinise plays the depressed astronaut and his thoughtful
patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as
sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in
zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30
seconds. In space no one can hear you snore (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE NINTH GATE,'' starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella.
Directed by Roman Polanski (R, 133 minutes). For those with an
interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
look no further. This film, with its wizened decadence and its
tired stabs at comedy, is calling your name. Langella is Boris
Balkan, a wealthy and therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired
antiquities, who hires Dean Corso (Depp), a weedy rogue book
dealer, to find a volume called ``The Nine Gates.'' Will Balkan get
Satan's powers in his clutches through mastery of the book?
Polanski is out to cross ``Rosemary's Baby'' with his saucy spoof
``The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' but this movie is about as scary
as a sock-puppet re-enactment of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' and
not nearly as funny (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``NOT ONE LESS,'' starring Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike. Directed
by Zhang Yimou (not rated, 106 minutes). Zhang Yimou's drama
enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself
in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's
ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei
Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed
into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary
School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off
his parents' debts, Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can
keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title),
sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a
slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a
work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive
power of Vittorio De Sica's ``Bicycle Thief'' (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``TOPSY-TURVY,'' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes; winner of best costume and
makeup Oscars). Leigh's grandly entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one
of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and
delectable acting opportunities, much as ``Shakespeare in Love''
did. Instead of a love-struck young playwright, it presents the
curiously matched personalities of the librettist William Schwenk
Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust,
knowing, frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over
which they held sway (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``WAKING THE DEAD,'' starring Billy Crudup and Jennifer
Connelly. Directed by Keith Gordon (R, 106 minutes). Gordon's
earnest screen adaptation of Scott Spencer's popular novel about a
love that transcends death, aspires to be a kind of
intellectualized ``Love Story,'' set in the 1970's counterculture.
But the blend of history and heartbreak doesn't quite jell. Crudup,
as a rising Chicago politician, and Connelly, as his radical
activist girlfriend who dies in a car bombing, have good chemistry.
But the movie is so busy jumping back and forth between the past
and present that it is continually stumbling over itself and
breaking its own spell (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WHOLE NINE YARDS,'' starring Matthew Perry and Bruce
Willis. Directed by Jonathan Lynn (R, 100 minutes). Oz (Perry) is a
nice-guy dentist beaten down by his bored wife. When the confident
Jimmy (Willis) breezes into the house next door, Oz's anxieties are
ratcheted up several points on the Richter scale. It turns out that
Jimmy is a former Chicago organized-crime figure who ratted out his
associates. The movie has an intricate plot, with hit men, love
interests, large sums of money and allegiances constantly in
motion. But it is missing the verve of someone who can take a
simple idea to the extreme; it must have been directed by a
sleepwalker. Despite Perry's plucky slapstick and the treacherous
gunplay that account for the second half of the movie, ``Yards'' is
underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``WINTER SLEEPERS,'' starring Ulrich Matthes, Marie-Lou Sellem,
Floriane Daniel and Heino Ferch. Directed by Tom Tykwer (not rated,
124 minutes). Thrillingly virtuosic cinematic flourishes lend a
steady charge of adrenaline to this drama about the tangled
destinies of well-to-do German slackers in a picture-perfect skiing
village. Made just before the jet-propelled pop fantasy ``Run Lola
Run'' put Tykwer on the short list of major international
filmmakers, ``Winter Sleepers'' conveys the spiritual malaise
afflicting the generation now in its late 1920s and 1930s. But like
``Run Lola Run,'' the movie is also about how human destiny has
everything to do with split-second timing (Stephen Holden). &QL;

   FALLS CHURCH, Va. _ Census Director Kenneth Prewitt, rejecting
complaints that census questionnaires are so intrusive they ought
to be ignored, urged Americans Thursday to answer every question on
census surveys sent to nearly 118 million households.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt warned that if residents leave questions unanswered on
Census forms, field workers would follow up with a knock on the
door in the weeks ahead to urge cooperation or to take the
information in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel a constitutional obligation to count everyone
in this country and if we think that any set of activities is going
to keep us from doing that, then we will do whatever we can do by
way of correcting that,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt was responding to a firestorm of citizen complaints over
privacy that has prompted some members of Congress and radio talk
show hosts to urge Americans to ignore Census questions they deem
too intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Five out of six of the nation's roughly 118 million households
have received a short form questionnaire with seven questions _ the
shortest survey in 180 years.
</P>
<P>
   But one-sixth of the recipients _ or approximately 20 million
households _ have received a 53-question survey that asks
everything from marital status and ethnic origin to home telephone
number, personal income, monthly household expenses and the
disability status of residents.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt urged Americans to complete every question to enable the
federal government to properly finance existing federal programs
and address unmet social and economic challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said Congress had reviewed each question. The requested
information is either required by federal law or required to carry
out federal law, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the Census every 10 years are used not only to shift
the location of congressional districts for the 435-seat House of
Representatives to keep apace of population shifts but also to
target about $185 billion in federal funds awarded each year to
states and localities based on population statistics. The first
census was in 1790.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more that the Census is described as an inappropriate
activity, the more the American people are going to come to believe
that it is something which is either not needed or is inappropriate
or is intrusive or could somehow be turned against you,'' Prewitt
warned. ``I'm only hopeful that our leadership will stand up and
urge the American people to complete this Census form.''
</P>
<P>
   Citizen complaints about the scope of the questionnaire have
skyrocketed as residents fill out the forms before the April 1
mail-in deadline. Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Nick Smith,
R-Mich., as well as Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., have suggested that
people should be free to skip questions they consider too invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., raised such concerns
with Prewitt during a private meeting earlier this week. Prewitt
said that he told Lott that ``we very much needed this information
in order to carry out the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said Thursday that citizens
ought to fill out the questionnaires but added: ``If there's a
question that invades their privacy, they should leave it blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's home state of Mississippi trails the nation in responding
to the Census questionnaires, with only 32 percent of the surveyed
households having returned the questionnaires to the Census Bureau
by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has the highest rate of return _ 55 percent.
Nationwide, 46 percent of households have replied so far _ en route
to a Census Bureau goal of a 70 percent response by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said mixed signals from Congress about answering the
questionnaire imperil the Census goal of getting the complete
picture of America that is needed to target everything from
spending on fire and rescue operations to the location of veterans'
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that the message is not completely understood
and that it might get translated to, `Oh, well, this information
isn't very important after all,''' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize his point, Prewitt issued his appeal in front of a
red, white and blue ambulance at a fire station in a Washington
suburb where emergency personnel routinely rely on house-by-house
details gathered by the Census to help map their responses to
80,000 emergency calls a year.
</P>
<P>
   Confidential personal information gleaned from the Census
questionnaires will remain secure, Prewitt said, noting that
violators, including Census workers, would face 5 years in prison
and a $5,000 fine if convicted of breaching the confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Americans'
concerns over privacy stem in part from worries about keeping
personal information private in the age of the Internet. Americans
want to ``be careful about all matters regarding privacy these
days, especially because there are so many more invasive
opportunities that there have been in the past,'' Daschle
explained.

TOBACCO GIANT PROMOTING WAR AGAINST SPOUSAL ABUSE 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Philip Morris, long under fire as a purveyor of
disease and death among smokers, donned its white hat Thursday to
promote a national war against another kind of suffering _ domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Operators of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, which is
located in Austin, honored the cigarette maker for the millions of
dollars it has spent assisting victims of spousal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Philip Morris sponsored a national television ad
that highlighted the problem, and women seeking help flooded the
hot line with calls. The company also gave the hot line $400,000 to
help expand its staff and call center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education efforts like this save lives. Thousands of people,
for the first time, were exposed to our phone number, called and
got help,'' said Sheryl Cates, executive director of the Texas
Council on Family Violence, which operates the hot line
</P>
<P>
   But some anti-smoking activists counter that no amount of good
deeds can make up for the human suffering that has helped enrich
the tobacco giant. Philip Morris manufacturers 10 well-known brands
of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still the same company that addicts kids every day to
nicotine, and a large number of those kids end up dying early,''
said Carter Headrick, a spokesman for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
Kids. ``It's a smoke-and-mirrors campaign to make the public think
they're a good company.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Collamore, Philip Morris' vice president of public affairs,
said his company has been contributing to community efforts and
charitable causes for 40 years. But, he admitted, Philip Morris has
been making a greater effort to publicize its involvement in those
efforts since the tobacco industry came under strong attacks over
its products and marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the industry has spent billions of dollars
settling lawsuits brought by Texas and other states over marketing
practices and smoking-related health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Collamore said the company has a $100 million TV ad campaign
that includes the anti-domestic violence ad and a spot encouraging
teen-agers not to smoke. Two other ads in the package promote a
drive by Miller Brewing Co., a Philip Morris subsidiary, to provide
water to disaster victims, and a hunger relief effort by Kraft
Foods, another company subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is really about us trying to show the people who
the people of Philip Morris are,'' Collamore said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's domestic violence ad about ``Laura,'' based on the
true story of an abused woman, began airing last October and is
still running. It carries the hot line number and increased calls
to the center by almost 70 percent during the last three months of
last year, Cates said.
</P>
<P>
   The hot line now receives more than 11,000 calls a month.
Staffers, many of whom are survivors of domestic violence, help
victims and people calling on their behalf deal with crisises and
provide referrals to local service providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upsurge in call volume generated by the ad shows that
domestic violence is an epidemic in this country,'' Cates said,
challenging other businesses and groups to follow Philip Morris'
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cates said the Texas Council on Family Violence initially had
reservations about accepting Philip Morris' money, when the company
first proposed the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like that in order to be responsible to battered women
we obviously needed to come forward and do the right thing in terms
of this ad. We knew it was a call to action, and our primary
concern, of course, was battered women,'' she said. ``We also
looked at the leadership that Philip Morris was willing to take on
a controversial issue and become a partner with us, to allow us to
help save lives.''

SHAKESPEARE IN SUMMER; A POLITICAL REVIVAL; A BLUES FAIRYTALE;
HENLEY'S NEWEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)  (js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spring is just 10 days old, but some characters'
summer plans are already set.
</P>
<P>
   While the Joseph Papp Public Theater's starry version of
Chekhov's ``Sea Gull'' _ with Meryl Streep, Natalie Portman and
Kevin Kline _ has been postponed until next year, the company is
ready to announce this summer's Shakespeare in the Park schedule,
albeit without a scrap of casting. And though recent summers at the
Delacorte saw interlopers like Thornton Wilder and Moliere, this
summer looks to be all Will.
</P>
<P>
   First up is Shakespeare's ``Winter's Tale,'' which will begin
performances on June 21 (the summer solstice, of all times) and is
to be directed by Brian Kulick, whose last park gig was ``Timon of
Athens'' in 1996. It will be followed by ``Julius Caesar,''
directed by Barry Edelstein, the artistic director of the Classic
Stage Co. It will run from Aug. 8 to Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Farther uptown _ much farther _ the Williamstown Theater
Festival in Massachusetts is putting the final touches on its
summer schedule. Mainstage highlights look to include Jon Robin
Baitz's version of Ibsen's ``Hedda Gabler,'' which was first
produced last March at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, where
it starred Annette Bening. Bening, who, as nearly the whole world
knows, is pregnant, will not be playing Hedda in Williamstown. But
another ample talent has been signed: Kate Burton. Nicholas Martin
will direct.
</P>
<P>
   Other mainstage shows at Williamstown will include Lanford
Wilson's ``Hot L Baltimore,'' directed by Joe Mantello, and
``Tonight at 8:30,'' a pair of Noel Coward playlets, to be staged
by Ann Reinking and Michael Greif.
</P>
<P>
   Williamstown's second stage also has some spark, with plans for
the East Coast premiere of ``Orson's Shadow'' by Austin Pendleton.
This play, about the clashes of theatrical titans, Orson Welles and
the critic Kenneth Tynan, opened in January to strong reviews at
the Steppenwolf Garage in Chicago. Pendleton said on Wednesday that
the show would come to Williamstown in June with the Chicago cast
and its director, David Cromer. From there it will travel to the
Westport Playhouse in Connecticut. Then, said Pendleton, he hopes
it's on to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love for it to end up in New York,'' he said. ``And if
that doesn't happen, I want as many people to see it as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Ticket
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign may be in a post-McCain malaise, but
on Broadway plans are afoot to mount a most topical political
revival. The play in question is ``The Best Man'' by Gore Vidal, a
satire of a presidential campaign that was a surprise hit when it
opened at the Morosco 40 years ago Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called the play a
``political melodrama that comes close enough to the truth to be
both comic and exciting.'' The story follows two candidates (one
scrupulous, one not) during a presidential convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The script has been making the rounds at agents' offices.
Tentative plans are contingent on getting the right cast. If the
stars align, the play would start rehearsals in mid-June, open in
mid-July _ between the Republican and Democratic national
conventions _ and run for a limited term, ending just before the
general election on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Circuitous Blues
</P>
<P>
   New Haven. Minneapolis. Washington. Cincinnati. San Diego.
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Such has been the circuitous route of the blues musical
``Thunder Knockin' on the Door'' by Keith Glover, which at last has
found a theater in New York, the Minetta Lane, where an opening is
set for June 11.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, which had its debut at the Alabama Shakespeare
Festival in 1996, has undergone extensive revisions and comes to
town with a lengthy paper trail of strong reviews. Described as a
``blues fairy tale,'' it follows the travails of the Duprees, a
blues clan whose prodigal son, Jaguar, has decided to abandon the
family and its music for a brighter future in rock 'n' roll. His
straying, however, is met with more than a little resistance from
his family and a mysterious stranger named Thunder.
</P>
<P>
   The producers, Momentum Productions, had planned to bring the
show to Broadway, but no theaters were available. So it's on to the
Minetta Lane, where the current tenant, ``Fuddy Meers'' by David
Lindsay-Abaire, closes on April 16. Lindsay-Abaire shouldn't
despair; his newest play, ``Kimberly Akimbo,'' is set for a spring
2001 production at South Coast Repertory in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Talk, Talk, Talk
</P>
<P>
   Considering the world of high whimsy usually created by the
playwright Beth Henley, one would be hard pressed to find an
actress better suited to her work than the quirky comedian Carol
Kane. So it should come as little surprise that Kane is embarking
on her fifth Henley play, this time playing Rickey, the
free-spirited sister of a mental patient, in ``Family Week,''
Henley's new comedy, which began previews this week at the Century
Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The two women's working relationship dates back to 1986, when
Kane appeared in ``The Lucky Spot,'' playing Lacey, a
down-on-her-luck Depression-era taxi dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a tarty innocence,'' Henley said, describing her
initial impression of the actress.
</P>
<P>
   Kane rolled her eyes. ``She is insane,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their professional relationship has developed into a deep and
chatty friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell in love with a series of restaurants as they were
about to go out of business,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Henley added: ``The food was always bad, but there were always
booths free.''
</P>
<P>
   `Jitney' Stop
</P>
<P>
   Danny Glover, Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne are expected
at a benefit performance of August Wilson's ``Jitney'' at Second
Stage on April 8. Proceeds will benefit the African Grove Institute
for the Arts. Information: (973) 412-1907

ICEFALL ENTOMBED 11 CLIMBERS ON MOUNT RAINIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CANDY HATCHER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT RAINIER, Wash. _ First, the survivors remember the sounds.
And then they remember the silence.
</P>
<P>
   A thunderous crack from 800 feet above, then a roar, as though a
jet were taking off. Then five seconds of scrambling as 22 climbers
tried to avoid the cliff of ice hurtling toward them. It was as if
someone had sawed off a section of Mount Rainier and flung it right
at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run!'' the guides yelled. ``Run right!''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have time, really. A cloud of dust covered
everything. A wall of snow and ice barreled through. Blue glacial
chunks as big as desks hit the climbers and swept them down the
mountain, some of them into a 70-foot-deep crevasse.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was quiet. Absolutely quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, 11 people emerged from the rubble. The others
didn't. Within half an hour, guides who frantically searched the
crevasse knew it was hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain, it seemed, had opened up, swallowed 11 people, and
clamped shut, leaving only a piece of rope, a headlamp, a pair of
goggles, a hat. One climbing guide and 10 clients were buried
beneath tons of snow and ice, victims of the worst climbing tragedy
in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers endured treacherous conditions afterward, digging
through the moving river of snow and ice, picking through the swath
of avalanche rubble, hunting for backpacks, ice axes, anything that
would tell them they'd found the missing climbers. After two days,
they gave up trying to recover the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years after the icefall at dawn on Sunday, June 21,
1981, the 11 men are still entombed in the blue ice of Mount
Rainier. Geologists, rangers and climbing experts say the ice wall
that fell on the group was a fluke of nature, a freak thing that
could not have been predicted. Mount Rainier can be a dangerous,
fickle place, and the climbers knew the risks.
</P>
<P>
   The men _ who ranged in age from 19 to 42; who came from
Pennsylvania and Michigan, Arlington, Seattle and Bellevue; who
were fathers and teachers, insurance agents, a dentist and an Eagle
Scout _ are part of the mountain now.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 that Saturday morning, Craig Tippie had called his mom,
apologized for waking her up, and told her not to worry. Mount St.
Helens' latest eruptions would not affect his climb on Mount
Rainier, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his hiking buddy, Mark Ernlund, were making their second
summit attempt. Tippie, his mother said, ``just really liked the
feeling. There's nothing like getting to the top and looking down.
He wanted to get to the top of Mount Rainier.''
</P>
<P>
   That morning, Tippie, 29, an engineering supervisor at the
Sundstrand Corp., and Ernlund, 29, a customer-service employee at
CX Corp. in Seattle, joined 21 other weekend hikers and six guides
for a two-day summit attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Each person had completed a rigorous, one-day climbing course in
mountaineering techniques _ how to use ice axes, crampons, climbing
rope. They were confident. They believed their guides, Rainier
Mountaineering Inc. employees, were experienced, level-headed
professionals who knew the mountain inside and out _ just the
people to help them get to the top and back down safely.
</P>
<P>
   Tom O'Brien was one of the guides. The 19-year-old University of
Washington student was known for his skill, energy and sense of
humor. He was studying industrial design and was particularly
interested in improving the design of mountaineering equipment. He
hoped that one day, his name would be associated with outdoor gear.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 29 left the 5,400-foot-high Paradise Inn that
morning, climbed to 10,000 feet and spent the night at Camp Muir.
Between 3:30 and 4 a.m. Sunday, they started along the southeast
face toward the peak.
</P>
<P>
   The skies were clear, the moon was out, the walking surface
easy. Excellent conditions, lead guide John Ronald Day recalled.
Climbers crossed the Cowlitz Glacier, climbed Cathedral Rocks and
traversed the heavily crevassed Ingraham Glacier. Climber Larry St.
Peter remembered the trek as ``one of the most beautiful
experiences of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   They were 2,000 feet above the clouds, but the most difficult
climb was still to come. In the previous three weeks, 214 people
had attempted to reach the summit from the south side. Only 23 had
been successful.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m., three climbers turned back, saying they didn't
have the stamina to go to the top. A guide accompanied them back to
Camp Muir.
</P>
<P>
   Three other guides went ahead of the rest to assess the dangers
of crossing treacherous Disappointment Cleaver, an irregular,
exposed ridge of rock. They went to the nose of the cleaver, 3,400
feet from the summit, and dug two snow pits to check the danger of
avalanches. The group, they agreed, shouldn't continue. They
weren't experienced enough to cope with the steep slope and
unpredictable snow.
</P>
<P>
   Two other groups attempting to summit that day also turned back,
worried about avalanche conditions and deteriorating weather.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two guides and 20 clients had stayed on Ingraham
Flats, a moderately sloping part of Ingraham Glacier about 11,500
feet high. The flats appear as sort of an amphitheater between the
rock wall of Disappointment Cleaver and the massive Gibraltar Rock.
The men were roped together, five or six to a group, taking
pictures and marveling at the view.
</P>
<P>
   The guides, Ronald Gregory Wilson and O'Brien, gathered the
climbers around to explain how the other guides were checking the
conditions. They reminded climbers to ``keep an eye up above'' for
falling rocks or avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom and I had been looking at the ice from above, and there
was an outstanding ice block well off to the side,'' Wilson told
investigators later. ``And we were talking that it would be a
terrible thing to see come down.''
</P>
<P>
   And then it did.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of the mountain, ``just something big and awesome,''
guide Peter Whittaker recalled, simply fell away. It was tumbling
in a free-fall, and then it hit ground and exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker and the other two guides on the cleaver yelled, and
everybody was up and moving. O'Brien and Wilson directed people
toward the cleaver. Larry St. Peter remembered ``people running
every direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson recalled turning around twice to see where the avalanche
was coming from. ``The last thing I saw was a huge wave of snow in
front of me,'' he said. He reached for an ice axe to stop himself,
but the wall of snow knocked him on his back and rolled over him.
</P>
<P>
   Climber Dennis Robertson remembered being hit by a chunk of ice
and knocked ``head over heels. I was in the slide and remember
about what I was taught about snow slides and you swim, and that's
what I tried to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, it was over with, and I was just sitting there. We
looking around, and all of a sudden it was very quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Guide John Day, still on the cleaver, counted the climbers and
realized some were missing. Two rope teams were entangled, but
those people were alive. Wilson popped up from the rubble and
called to the others to pull on the ropes, hoping those who were
buried could use them as life lines. ``There were pieces of
equipment around, so I began probing around,'' he said, ``and
nothing came up. ... I went quickly through there looking for
remnants of clothing or people. There was nothing there. Then I
walked down in the crevasse. There was like a hat, some goggles. I
probed under thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   Day radioed the park service about 6:10 a.m. ``We have lost 11
people in an icefall on the approach to the cleaver,'' he said.
Need help.
</P>
<P>
   Rainier Mountaineering employees began rounding up sleeping
bags, shovels and people to go to the avalanche site.
</P>
<P>
   Day, another guide and one climber stayed at the crevasse; the
other two guides led the rest down to Camp Muir, about 1,000 feet
below the icefall. The wind had picked up; snow and ice were
falling; visibility was 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hope, Peter Whittaker told the rangers when he
arrived at camp. Day, still searching the crevasse, said the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Ranger Garry Olsen arrived at the crevasse about 9:30 a.m. and
described a 300-yard-wide path of debris, ice blocks as big as a
pickup truck and camper. He saw holes in the snow where searchers
had looked for possible survivors, and wands marking where people
had been sitting before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:40 a.m., he radioed the base. ``It would take a bulldozer
to find these people. My concern right now is the safety of the
searchers. Shovels and probes will be of no use. ... I see nothing
we can do up here. I am just sorry. We can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after 10 a.m., the surviving climbers arrived at the
Paradise Inn, having hiked down from Camp Muir in fog with
visibility between 30 and 50 feet and high winds whipping ice. The
men wandered into the office, looking for their wives, needing
treatment for cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, 24 RMI guides, rangers and mountain rescue
volunteers from Seattle and Tacoma had search-and-rescue parties
and were preparing to climb to Camp Muir. Snowfall and wind kept
them from reaching the crevasse Sunday night or Monday morning. By
Monday evening, the search party had dug trenches, sifted through
the rubble and found nothing. At 10 p.m., Rainier officials called
off the search.
</P>
<P>
   XXX
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Tippie heard about the accident from her mother on
Monday morning. She called the mountain, and rangers acknowledged
that some climbers from her son's group were missing. They told her
to stay at home, that they'd call when they had news.
</P>
<P>
   First she heard that some of the climbers had come down from the
mountain. She didn't know whether her son was among them. Then she
heard that some climbers had been too exhausted to continue their
ascent and had turned back, missing the icefall. She didn't believe
Craig Tippie would have done that.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she learned Craig was one of 11 missing, and that he
likely had died instantly. When rangers explained the danger in
trying to recover the bodies, that the crevasse was so deep and
unstable the searchers could die, she and the families of the other
victims agreed the men should be left on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the icefall, the National Park Service began its
inquiry into the deaths, standard procedure for fatalities on Mount
Rainier. The board found that the guides had led the group up the
safest, most heavily traveled route to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The board concluded that the guides ``showed good judgment'' and
left the 20 climbers and two guides ``at a location that is
considered safe this time of the year'' _ a protected area of
Ingraham Flats _ while they went to a more dangerous area to check
for avalanche possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The board determined the icefall was random and related to the
movement of the glacier. The recommendation: Mount Rainier
officials should work with glacier specialists to predict when the
victims' remains might surface at the end of Ingraham Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, after an unusually hot summer, a ranger flying a
helicopter over Ingraham Glacier spotted a red pack in a crevasse.
Another ranger, checking out the report, discovered parts of two or
three bodies sticking out of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, ranger Rick Kirschner and four climbers went there
to photograph the scene and recover what they could. About 100 feet
deep into a crevasse, they found one body 90 percent melted out of
the ice, and about four others in which a leg or boot were exposed.
``And then the body would disappear into the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   None was identifiable. All were wedged precariously in unstable
snow. Digging would likely cause them to fall another 100 feet
further into the crevasse _ and endanger the searchers. ``There was
a lot of rock falling,'' Kirschner wrote in his report, and no way
for the climbers to protect themselves. They dug up everything they
could without putting themselves in jeopardy _ a red backpack, a
headlamp, an ice axe.
</P>
<P>
   Then they made sure the remains weren't visible from the
climbing route and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know where they are,'' Kirschner said. ``That's where they
remain.''
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   A year after the tragedy, family members gathered at Paradise
for a memorial service. Betty and Harold Boulton read poems in
memory of their son David, 29, a Bellevue insurance agent.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen and Bob O'Brien, parents of Tom, showed slides. Edmund
Laitone, father of Jonathan, 27, of Ann Arbor, Mich.; Renee
Liedman, wife of Ira Liedman, 30, of Hatfield, Pa.; and Linda
Matthews, wife of Henry, 39, of Auburn, paid tribute to those who
died.
</P>
<P>
   They put up a plaque at the Paradise Visitor's Center. They
dedicated a photograph Jonathan Laitone had taken an hour before
the avalanche. And then they claimed the items their loved ones had
left at Camp Muir the morning they died:
</P>
<P>
   Seven sleeping bags. Several pairs of jeans, shirts, rain pants
and socks. A paperback copy of ``The Hobbit.'' Corned beef, noodle
soup and powdered milk. An Eddie Bauer hat. Four contact-lens
cases. A hotel room key, a toothbrush and SPF 15 sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Every June, Dorothy Tippie, who lives in Tacoma, takes fresh
flowers to Paradise to honor the 11 who died on Father's Day, 1981.
The families still exchange Christmas cards. ``We call ourselves
the `Mountain Family,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Tippie can see Mount Rainier from her house. ``On a
clear day when the sun is out, it's beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel close.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A potent low pressure zone will swirl over the Southwest
accompanied by scattered valley showers and mountain snow. The
heaviest snow will occur above 5,000 feet in southeastern Colorado
where amounts over a foot will be common by Friday night.
Intermittent snow will also occur in the high elevations of
northern New Mexico and Arizona. Meanwhile, strong winds from the
east along the northern flank of the storm system will course
through many mountain passes from Utah to California.
</P>
<P>
   A few strong thunderstorms, some with hail, will erupt Friday
afternoon from eastern New Mexico to the hills of western Texas.
Scattered thundershowers will also dampen western parts of Kansas
and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, high pressure will bring tranquil conditions, ample
sunshine and near seasonal temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DAMAGE SURVEY
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary damage survey by the National Weather Service in
Fort Worth, Texas, on Wednesday indicated that the tornado that
struck late Tuesday rated F2 on the Fujita scale, while the twister
that hit nearby Arlington ranked F3. By inspecting damage,
meteorologists can estimate the winds in the tornado by applying
principles of engineering and computing the force needed to knock
down walls or lift roofs off houses, for example. Based on such
forensic principles, a F2 twister packs winds between 113 and 157
mph, while an F3 tornado has winds between 158 and 206 mph.

THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF JOE WOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT RAINIER, Wash. _ Leftovers of a life linger in Joe Wood's
boyhood home.
</P>
<P>
   A chunk of coconut sits in the icebox, freezer-burned after
eight months. A brown handwoven shirt from India hangs on the back
of his closet door, waiting to be laundered. Hundreds of boxed
books line the walls in his basement, organized for a rummage sale.
</P>
<P>
   No one really expects Wood to eat the stale fruit, wash the
shirt, host the yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old New Yorker, a widely respected writer and
editor, is presumed dead. Last July, he came to Seattle for a
journalism conference, and decided to go bird-watching in Mount
Rainier National Park. He was last seen hiking toward the Mildred
Point trail spur on July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers believe Wood either fell through snow to a creek
bed or died of exposure after becoming lost. Unusually high snow
levels and impassable terrain are blamed for masking his remains.
</P>
<P>
   Under different circumstances, the rangers' assessment might
have been accepted by grieving family members who visited the park,
mourned and returned home.
</P>
<P>
   But Wood's disappearance is unlike any to precede it on a
mountain replete with disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he is the first black man to go missing on a
mountain that receives more than 2 million visitors a year. For
another, family members and politically astute friends pulled out
all stops to try to find him. And they are not satisfied with the
official theories.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to find Wood's remains, his loved ones have
called on state officials, private investigators and national
media. They even contacted White House sources, who asked park
officials to keep looking even longer than they normally would.
</P>
<P>
   That persistence has raised a few hackles in a cloistered,
homogeneous group of park rangers _ without resolving the mystery
of Joe Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Did he fall from a steep ridge, unable to climb or call for
help, as rangers believe? Or, as his mother says she still fears,
could he have been the victim of a racially motivated attack or
some other form of foul play?
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators, police detectives and private eyes on
both coasts have searched for answers since last summer. So have
friends, relatives, helicopter pilots, rangers and volunteers who
combed a heavily forested area in the southwest corner of the
378-square mile park for five days in July and again in August.
</P>
<P>
   All they found was a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it possible that a person who goes out for an afternoon
of bird-watching just vanishes into thin air?'' Elizabeth Wood asks
wearily.
</P>
<P>
   Before last year, the retired social worker from the Bronx would
never have imagined such a thing could happen. Now, she knows
better.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Joseph Sr., raised Joe and his sister
Pamela in the residential Baychester section of the New York City
borough. Joey was a thoughtful, studious and attentive child who
loved books and birds.
</P>
<P>
   His passion for birds propelled Wood into years as a Boy Scout.
His compassion for the downtrodden helped him obtain his Eagle
Scout badge, scouting's highest honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't forget it''
</P>
<P>
   At age 16, the ``lily-clean adolescent'' was profiled in a 1980
Daily News article for turning a chance encounter with local
shopping bag ladies into a yearlong volunteer project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught sight of one of these ladies as I waited at the bus
stop for a ride home,'' the precocious teen told the reporter.
``Her shuffling, her inattentive wandering eyes, her disinterest in
the hurried world around her aroused not just my curiosity, but
that weird sadness I felt for her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't forget it,'' he reflected after collecting dishes,
furniture, clothing and utensils to donate to a shelter for bag
ladies run by area nuns.
</P>
<P>
   A student at Riverdale Country, a private school overlooking the
Hudson River on the northernmost edge of the Bronx, Wood completed
two college applications before graduating with honors.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up rejecting Harvard Yard for the inner-city grandeur
of Yale, where he was also graduated with high honors.
</P>
<P>
   His love of books spurred him to apply for a 1990 fellowship
sponsored by the New York Foundation for the Arts. He used the
award to travel to Ghana in quest of his African American heritage
and returned to pen a travelogue titled ``Blood Whispers and Color
Lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Before settling into an editor's job at The Village Voice, he
wrote articles for The New York Times and Essence Magazine. Three
years ago he left to accept a job as editor at The New Press, an
alternative publishing house, where he edited a definitive
collection of writings on Malcolm X and ``Remembering Slavery,'' a
book and audio-tape collection of first-person accounts by former
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   He also edited ``Class Notes,'' a soon-to-be released collection
of essays by political theorist Adolph Reed Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Reed used the preface to memorialize his friend and editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's gone, many of us are pained and diminished by the
loss, but I know that he would insist that his demise should be
seen, except within his world of intimates, as no more tragic _
notwithstanding his impressive accomplishments, his even greater
promise, his visibility and Yale pedigree _ than that of anyone
else who meets an untimely or unfair end,'' Reed noted.
</P>
<P>
   Through her son's work, Elizabeth became fluent in the language
of publishing. Through his disappearance she has come to learn
terms of mountain dangers that would have been foreign to her a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Snow bridges and tree wells
</P>
<P>
   Wood picked a brilliant Thursday afternoon to string a pair of
binoculars around his neck and slip an Audubon guide book on
Pacific Northwest birds into his day pack.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, he had flown in from New York to attend Unity
'99, a national conference of 8,000 minority journalists in
Seattle. At dinner with acquaintances, Wood mentioned his plan to
hike and bird-watch on Rainier after attending a news breakfast
with presidential candidate Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the Timberland lace-up boots he wore to work in
Manhattan and the red Patagonia windbreaker he'd paid $189 for that
morning, Wood started up his white Mercury Marquis rental and
headed south.
</P>
<P>
   A park entrance receipt found later in the car showed he drove
into the park's Nisqually entrance just before 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   He parked in the Longmire parking lot and headed over to the
hiker center near the trailhead. Inside, he asked where he'd have a
good chance of spotting birds.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the proffered map, a two-sided yellow photocopy with
hand-drawn trails on one side and short explanations on the other,
Wood stepped outside, climbed six railroad ties into a sunlit
corridor lined with western hemlock and Douglas fir, and set off
toward Mildred Point.
</P>
<P>
   His boots crunched on top of several feet of hardpack snow
speckled with broken pine cones, branches and leaves. Overhead,
shafts of sunlight pierced the cool shade of 100-foot-tall
old-growth trees.
</P>
<P>
   There in the solitude of the park, Wood was rewarded with a
glimpse of a brilliantly colored western tanager.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned the bird a few moments later when he met a newly
retired Boeing Co. engineer on the five-mile trail.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Seattle man, who asked not to be named, had just
turned back toward Longmire when the two crossed paths on the
snow-covered trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was ... a little aimless or unsure of where he was when he
asked me how much farther does the trail go?'' the hiker said. ``He
actually said `Where am I?' And I showed him on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiker later told rangers that during the brief discussion,
they compared birds they had seen, and he warned Wood of a snow
bridge a short way ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The terminology wouldn't have been familiar to the Bronx native,
whose bird-watching previously had lured him to Central Park, to
well-trodden greenspaces in the Bronx and to Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Joe did not know what a tree well was. He did not
know what a snow bridge was. To say simply that there was a snow
bridge would not have done much,'' said Wood's former girlfriend,
New York Times reporter Somini Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   Still friends, Sengupta and Wood would have rehashed the
conference highlights after they flew back East on separate
flights.
</P>
<P>
   When he did not return by Sunday, July 11, Sengupta began to
worry. Two days later, she filed a missing-person report.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, park officials located Wood's white rental
car in the Longmire lot, but nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really hurt us with Joe Wood is that he didn't
tell anybody where he was really going, so essentially when the
friends and family called and said, `Where is he?' it had been a
week,'' said park ranger Steve Winslow. ``His family wanted to keep
pressing, searching. We went way beyond what we would normally do.
But we found nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time rangers launched their first massive search, warm
temperatures had melted more than 2 feet of snowpack near Van Trump
Trail. The changed landscape _ where knee-deep snow had been
replaced with mud, puddles and ice _ made it difficult to pinpoint
where Wood could have run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $50,000 Park Service investigation that encompassed a
10-square-mile area and used nearly 200 volunteer searchers, hours
of helicopter time and more than a dozen scent dogs, no trace of
him was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of Mount Rainier's great mysteries,'' says the hiker
who met Wood on the trail. ``Mildred Point is one of the most
benign parts of the park ... Most (missing hikers) disappeared
doing things far beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Warnings in the park
</P>
<P>
   Wood's sudden disappearance has given Sengupta and Elizabeth
Wood a shared purpose: together they dispute assumptions park
authorities make about what the average tourist knows before
venturing into Rainier's foothills.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern centers on the yellow square of paper Wood carried
on his hike.
</P>
<P>
   As maps go, the photocopied handout is rudimentary.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, hollow dashes mark the Wonderland Trail and solid
dashes mark the 7.5-mile route from the hiker center past the
Mildred Point Spur, Van Trump Park and Comet Falls to the Christine
Falls bridge. On the opposite side is a list of nine popular routes
with brief descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The hiking route that caught Wood's eye was described as a steep
trail that offers a view of the volcano, wildflowers and mountain
goats in late June or early July.
</P>
<P>
   The only warnings on the map advise hikers to stay on the trail
to protect fragile meadows and, for safety reasons, to avoid
walking on the bridge toward Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   But exceptionally heavy snowfall that winter, the third-heaviest
recorded in park history, had left 4 to 6 feet of packed snow along
the route, obscuring the trails and blanketing the steep landscape.
No signs warned that losing track of the snow-covered trail could
be treacherous. Nowhere does it remind hikers to carry the
ubiquitous 10 essentials: water, food, extra clothing, matches, a
map, compass, first-aid kit, flashlight, blanket and pocketknife.
Nor does it distinguish between easy and more challenging treks.
</P>
<P>
   Those omissions can cost lives, Sengupta believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think that it's incredibly irresponsible to allow
people to go on protected federal property and not be told of the
very real risks that they are taking,'' she says. ``This is not
Disneyland. The terrain can be life threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something very surreal about going to Rainier. You go
to the gift shop, and you see the same slogans on T-shirts and
refrigerator magnets, pitch(ing) the mountain as a beautiful, quiet
magnificent mountain that you can explore: `Escape to Rainier.'
Those words kind of take on an eerie meaning when you know a man
that you loved went to the mountain and never came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Better trail markings, a registration system to keep track of
lowland day hikers, reminders of park risks _ these measures are
what Sengupta and Elizabeth Wood say they've proposed to park
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Park ranger Mike Gauthier, a veteran of a decade of
search-and-recovery efforts at Rainier who has seen countless
hikers underestimate the terrain, sees value in their ideas:
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't Central Park. To some degree this is the Yukon
Territory. There are some places where you can be missing
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Other dangers
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Wood, who started her career at Tuskegee Institute in
Alabama, doesn't consider herself an especially suspicious person
by nature.
</P>
<P>
   But looking for closure, she's considered an array of factors
that might explain why Joe has never returned home, including news
stories about incidents involving white supremacists in national
parks, discrepancies in the accounts of the hiker who saw Joe, and
three recorded homicides at Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   The witness initially did not mention to rangers that Wood was
wearing a hat. Later, he described a hat in detail to a private
investigator. Rangers attribute that and other discrepancies in his
accounts to the normal variance in witness accounts after the
passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through all kinds of theories. Maybe someone came to
him and said I'll take you over where some birds are,'' she says
from a telephone in Joe's boyhood bedroom. ``He would have gone. He
was that kind of trusting person. He had that kind of innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   When she and her husband, Joseph Sr., arrived in Longmire to
help with the search, she was haunted by last February's triple
slaying at Yosemite National Park. A week after her return home,
the suspect in that case also was charged with beheading a
naturalist.
</P>
<P>
   So when a volunteer broached the subject about crime in the
park, Elizabeth passed on her concerns to a supervising ranger at
Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the rescue workers from Tacoma had talked to us and
said criminal things had happened and they just don't get
published,'' she said. ``But the ranger, he said, `Well, the only
people who come into the park are family-type people. We wouldn't
have a serial killer here.' I just cut him off. You can't look at a
face and see what a person is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fear that Wood may have been the victim of foul play wasn't
beyond the realm of possibility. Several homicides have occurred in
the park.
</P>
<P>
   The first suspicious death occurred in Mount Rainier National
Park in 1924, when the wife of a seven-time bigamist fell to her
death into Van Trump Creek, near the eastern base of the ridge
where Wood was last seen. Her husband was never charged.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded homicide occurred 13 years ago when park
visitors discovered the bullet-riddled body of a man alongside
Highway 123 in the southeast corner of the park. The FBI and
National Park Service conducted fruitless investigations. The
victim and his slayer remain unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 43-year-old Sheila Ann Kearns, a housekeeper at the
National Park Inn at Longmire, disappeared after work. Seven months
later a park volunteer found partial skeletal remains about a mile
from the inn near the old Longmire Campgrounds. A check of dental
records matched Kearns' but few clues remained to lead
investigators to her killer. That case also remains open.
</P>
<P>
   Late last July, Billy Don Boyd committed the third recorded
homicide in the park. The 36-year-old Tacoma carpenter pushed his
7-year-old Nicholas son off the Christine Falls Bridge, 125 feet
into Van Trump Creek. Then he jumped after him.
</P>
<P>
   Loose ends
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand miles from the trail Joe vanished on, Elizabeth
Wood finds reminders of her son in every room of her house.
</P>
<P>
   In the bedroom he had moved back into a few months earlier after
moving out of the apartment he and Sengupta shared in Brooklyn. In
the pile of books and folders stacked neatly on his desk. In the
row of 20 pepper plants _ Scotch Bonnet, jalapeno _ he asked his
mother to care for during his vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Still grieving, Elizabeth Wood has begun to reach out to others
who have lost kin or friends to Rainier. She scours reports of
search efforts on the mountain, looking for family names and
hometowns. Hoping to reach those who shy away from media inquiries,
she asks that her telephone number accompany her story:
718-231-1194. Healing, as she and husband Joseph envision it, may
come after mingling her grief with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a never-ending process. It never, ever stops,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   She still hasn't even been able to let go of mundane reminders
like the plastic freezer bag filled with coconut.
</P>
<P>
   Joe, an avid runner, usually stopped at the grocery store on the
return leg of his morning jog around Van Courtland Park to buy a
single, ripe mango for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The morning he departed for Seattle, Joe surprised her with the
fresh coconut.
</P>
<P>
   More than once she has considered and rejected the idea of
eating the plastic-wrapped fruit. Like the 3-foot-tall pile of
books and the pepper plants, Joe's remnants have taken on an
unexpected value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't bring myself to eat it,'' she said. ``When it's gone,
he's gone.''

HULL (Phoenix) - Republican officials are trying to keep the lid on
a controversy that features two familiar antagonists: Arizona Sen.
John McCain and Gov. Jane Hull. At stake is the seemingly innocuous
question of who will chair the Arizona delegation to the GOP
convention in August. But behind the scenes it is shaping up to be
a power struggle between Hull, who badly wants to fulfill her
traditional role as chairman of the group, and McCain, who controls
the delegates and is still nursing a grudge with Hull over Texas
Gov. George W. Bush. By KRIS MAYES. Story will move in the `A`

911CALLS (Phoenix) - Accidental 911 calls from cell phones are
clogging the Valley's 911 system. Phoenix averages 500 to 600
accidental cell-phone calls every day. Some 15 to 20 percent of all
911 calls are being dialed accidentally by people on cell phones,
putting a huge burden on the 911 system. By BEVERLY FORD. Story

NOSEY (Phoenix) - Suddenly the number of toilets people have is
sacred. As U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott calls for people
to not fill out the Census questions that violate their privacy,
many people already are following suit. But the census hasn't
become more invasive. In fact, it differs little from what it was
10 years ago. But our world has changed, with more people concerned
about privacy leading to Caller ID, unpublished numbers and worries
about identity theft. By LAURA TRUJILLO. Story will move in the `A`

   MOUNT RAINIER, Wash. _ Buried somewhere on the south side of
Mount Rainier is the body of a fearless, funny doctor who built
houses for the poor, kayaked rapids in his spare time and poured
ketchup on everything he ate.
</P>
<P>
   Tres Tietjen crammed adventure into every minute. He constantly
tested his limits, whether in the classroom, where he'd always made
straight A's, or the outdoors, where he conquered Class 5 rivers
and 19,000-foot peaks.
</P>
<P>
   When the 28-year-old moved to Seattle last June to begin a
residency program at Harborview Medical Center, he tackled life in
the Northwest with the same intensity.
</P>
<P>
   He and his parents arrived on Thursday, June 17, after driving
cross country from Plains, Ga. Within two days, Tietjen got his
Washington driver's license and car tags, arranged to take a karate
class, unloaded his rental truck and set up the apartment he was
sharing with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, he was itching to try out the snow on
Mount Rainier. It would be the last chance he'd get to snowboard;
on Tuesday, he would begin his residency. Tietjen called just about
everyone he knew in Seattle to see who wanted to go with him. No
one could.
</P>
<P>
   That night, friends of his parents had him to their suburban
Federal Way home for dinner. ``By the time he came over,'' Shirley
Hamilton recalled, ``he'd decided to just go up to Mount Rainier,
have an adventure and see what he could cram into one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen filled up on Southern cooking, gave Mrs. Hamilton a big
hug and drove back to Seattle to get ready for Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   His roommate, a friend from Georgia named Ken Turner, tried to
persuade Tietjen to go to Mount St. Helens instead. Tietjen, he
said, was a good snowboarder, but he hadn't done any backcountry
snowboarding, and he'd never been to Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   But then Turner remembered how crowded Rainier had been two
years earlier, when he'd climbed to the summit. ``I figured the
route would be clogged with people,'' he said. If Tietjen got into
trouble, there'd be plenty of people around. Besides, Turner
thought, at that point, nothing would have stopped his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Turner helped him pack. In Tietjen's day pack were a few layers
of clothes, a flashlight, a headlamp. He'd packed candy bars,
crackers, water, a map and compass. He would also carry the
ever-present plastic peanut butter jar filled with first-aid
supplies because, Turner said, ``he always played so hard that he
tore himself up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen planned to wear a hat, Gore-Tex jacket, climbing gloves,
snowboard pants and boots. He stuck his snowboard and snowshoes on
the back of his climbing pack and filled his car trunk with a
sleeping bag, tent and camping equipment. He planned to hike to
10,000 feet Sunday afternoon, then snowboard down. If the snow was
decent, he'd camp in the parking lot that night and go up again the
following morning.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. Sunday, June 20, he hopped in his Cavalier and drove
to Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   On paper, William L. Tietjen III was impressive. He majored in
physics at Georgia Institute of Technology, was valedictorian of
his class at Emory University School of Medicine, regularly
volunteered with Habitat for Humanity. He spoke Spanish fluently,
was a skilled outdoorsman and a soon-to-be resident in internal
medicine. His goal: to specialize in infectious diseases and help
people in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   But it's what wasn't on his resume that was most amazing.
Tietjen, pronounced TEE-jun, had an intensity, a spirit, a love of
learning that inspired everyone around him. His parents had raised
their only child, this Georgia boy with a Jimmy Carter drawl, to
appreciate and embrace other cultures. They'd taught him to take
advantage of opportunities and to go where life led him. As a
teenager, he headed to the Air Force Academy. When he wasn't happy
there, he transferred to Georgia Tech in Atlanta to study
aeronautical engineering, then physics.
</P>
<P>
   He joined an outdoors group on campus, went mountain biking,
climbing and taught hiking and kayaking. As a teacher, he stressed
safety, his friends said. No one was hurt on any of the trips he
led.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't have seen him doing or advocating unreasonable
things while he was teaching,'' said Suzi Beaumont, the outdoor
organization's training coordinator. ``But there are two different
levels of risk.'' One was as a teacher responsible for others'
safety; the other was as an individual responsible only for
himself. ``I've never seen Tres do something foolish,'' she said.
``I'd seen him do brazen things, but not stupid things.''
</P>
<P>
   After college, Tietjen, who friends say had a photographic
memory, won a full scholarship to medical school. He composed and
played a moving piece on saxophone at a memorial service for the
cadavers anatomy students had dissected. He played Ultimate Frisbee
every week. He went climbing and hiking and kayaking every chance
he got.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who knew Tietjen has a story about him living on the
edge. He had broken both ankles kayaking. He'd injured a knee
skiing. Once, while kayaking, Atlanta roommate Brian Ginn said,
Tietjen sliced open his hand with a pocket knife. He poured
antiseptic on the wound, closed it with duct tape and, when he
returned to Atlanta, refused to go to an emergency room because he
didn't want to pay for treatment. Instead, he called a fellow
medical student, who stitched him up with no anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was incredibly frugal,'' Turner, his Seattle roommate,
recalled. ``Well, OK, he was cheap. He'll admit he was cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen wore hiking boots to medical school interviews. Once, he
showed up for a black-tie affair in a loud tie and khaki jacket.
When he ran Atlanta's Fourth of July 10K race, he wore American
flag boxer shorts and a matching tie.
</P>
<P>
   But his eating habits were the most baffling. For breakfast,
Tietjen ate cereal with milk and ketchup. When he was home for
lunch or supper, he had whatever was in the cabinet _ crackers or
tuna _ with ketchup. At potluck dinners, one professor said, he was
known for his peanut-butter-and-tuna concoction.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonas Shulman, who became Tietjen's mentor, says Tietjen had
a hard time deciding what field he should specialize in because he
became engrossed in each of his rotations. When he began
considering infectious diseases, he took three months off in 1998
to go to Guatemala. He lived with families and learned Spanish. He
worked with the local office of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. He hiked and climbed.
</P>
<P>
   When friends told him they were going to Ecuador for a week
during Christmas break, he jumped at the opportunity to climb the
country's 19,000-foot peaks. But during a hike with a friend, two
bandits _ one with a gun, the other with a knife _ accosted the
students. They put the gun to his friend's head and the knife to
Tietjen's neck, gagged them, tied them up, robbed them and pushed
them down a hill. The two freed themselves by chewing through a
rope. When they walked into town, residents cleaned them up, fed
them and gave them money to get back to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   The experience didn't scar Tietjen. He came back telling stories
of the wonderful townspeople. And he resolved to learn martial arts
so such a thing could never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   By graduation, Tietjen ``seemed settled on wanting to do things
in other countries, for people less fortunate,'' Shulman said. ``He
never was thinking about the world of the HMO or where the next
dollar was coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose Harborview Medical Center's internal medicine program
and began to get excited about living in Seattle, where he could
kayak and climb and snowboard, a sport he'd learned the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   His parents helped him get settled in his Seattle apartment and
then went to Vancouver for the weekend. They planned to meet their
son _ and Turner and his father _ for dinner Monday night before
Tietjen began work the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   But Tietjen never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   It was overcast, 42 degrees and drizzling that Sunday, June 20,
when Tietjen began his hike to Camp Muir at 10,000 feet. He arrived
at the public shelter about 5:15 p.m., changed into dry clothes and
left 15 minutes later to snowboard down, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Fog covered the area; tracks were barely visible. A ranger at
Camp Muir invited Tietjen to join his group hiking down. Tietjen
declined. He wanted to snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen's first mistake was coming to the mountain alone when he
was unfamiliar with the terrain. But insisting on snowboarding was
his fatal error. He didn't realize ``what happens if you get
off-road,'' ranger Steve Winslow said. You need to stop, look for
tracks. ``Walking down is the way to go, not snowboarding. As soon
as you put skis or a snowboard on, you're moving too fast to be
able to pick up tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen probably wanted to get down as fast as possible. It was
late in the day and hard to see beyond his snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   The natural slope of the mountain leans west toward Nisqually
Glacier. ``You have to bend east,'' Winslow said, ``almost as
though you're going uphill.'' Otherwise, you wind up off the
cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem in fog is the possibility of falling into one
of the deep crevasses on Paradise Glacier. ``They can be 400 to 600
feet,'' ranger Rick Kirschner said. ``If you get into one that
wedges, you can't move. You're stuck. You might be upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen's parents worried Monday night when their son didn't
show up for dinner. About 10 p.m., Ken Turner called the Highway
Patrol, then rangers at Mount Rainier National Park. He wasn't
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `He's snowed in, hunkered down.' I figured he
was trapped at Muir.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, rangers found Tietjen's car parked at
Paradise. They searched east and west of his expected route from
Muir. Visibility, they reported, was 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Turner drove to the mountain Wednesday. He found Tietjen's spare
car key, opened the trunk and saw the full backpack, tent and
sleeping bag _ all dry and well packed. Tietjen hadn't been back to
his car on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was gone,'' he said. He didn't have any of the gear
_ his down jacket, cold weather clothes and crampons _ with him.
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen's parents stayed with their friends in Federal Way,
hoping their son would find his way out and reach a road where
someone would see him. ``If anyone could do it,'' William Tietjen
said, ``he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Searchers combed the area for three more days, encountering
crevasses, snow avalanches and rockfall. They found nothing. ``Not
a rope, not an ice axe, nothing,'' Winslow said. ``It leads me to
believe (Tietjen) and all his gear went down into a crevasse.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends in Georgia couldn't understand Tietjen being lost in the
snow. Turner knew better. ``I'd hiked over these crevasses. You
could put a bus down there and never see it again.''
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen was so large in life that the people who knew him well
still talk about him in present tense, nine months after he
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   They're angry with him for dying, for flirting with disaster
once too often. ``He had so much potential to do so much for so
many,'' Shulman said.
</P>
<P>
   They remember the way he lived his faith instead of talking
about it. They remember his quirks, particularly when they see a
ketchup bottle. They miss the way he used to spur them to do
better.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who ran track in high school, recalls Tietjen running
with him, pushing him to go faster. ``On his bad knee, he'd be
doing sub-seven-minute miles for six miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen's parents returned to Seattle last summer and visited
Mount Rainier. They took home a photograph of the mountain. Friends
of Tietjen are planning a memorial climb this year to honor the
beloved daredevil buried on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something poetic to be said about leaving him there,''
Ginn said. ``What better place to show his adventure and his love
for the outdoors?''

 &HT;    John Cusack slaps together a hands-down funny `Fidelity'
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Top Five Reasons Why I Love ``High Fidelity'':
</P>
<P>
   1. It's based on the beloved cult novel by Nick Hornby.
</P>
<P>
   2. John Cusack is perfect as the music-obsessed protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   3. The story is honest, touching and funny.
</P>
<P>
   4. The 59-song soundtrack is incredible.
</P>
<P>
   5. I've lived much of this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Frears' endearing film is a quirky and original
romantic comedy about rock music and relationships. Its central
character, Rob Gordon (Cusack), is a self-professed music junkie
who runs a semi-failing vinyl record store in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Rob and his two employees, Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack
Black), have an encyclopedic knowledge of music and are perpetually
creating top-5 lists of their all-time favorite songs for specific
situations, from Monday mornings to funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Rob, still single in his late 30s, also compiles a list of his
top-5 breakups _ inspired by his latest girlfriend, Laura (Iben
Hjejle), who walks out on him as the story opens.
</P>
<P>
   Laura met Rob when he was working as a club DJ, but she has
traded her punk look for a successful law career. Rob hasn't
changed so much as a pair of socks, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Confiding to the camera, Rob recounts his romantic travails _
which unfold in flashback vignettes _ to get to the root of his
lifetime of rejection. Meanwhile, he pursues sultry local singer
Marie De Salle (Lisa Bonet) while also trying to put things right
with Laura.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' is a hip and witty look at love, adapted by
Cusack and his ``Grosse Pointe Blank'' writing partners, D.V.
DeVincentis and Steve Pink, along with ``Con Air'' screenwriter
Scott Rosenberg. The tale has been transplanted from London to
Cusack's native Chicago, outraging some fans of Hornby's novel, but
otherwise it plays exactly like the book.
</P>
<P>
   Rob's constant asides to the audience are initially off-putting,
but his direct narration allows us to bond with the sad-sack
character so that we end up rooting for him.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the film is steadily amusing; the second half
is full-blown hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   When not agonizing over his love life or lack thereof, Rob
comically bickers with meek Dick and caustic Barry _ whom he dubs
the ``musical moron twins'' _ over pop-music minutiae. Rob also
dispenses the rules for making a great compilation tape, which he
uses as romantic overtures. The film's musical sources range from
The Kinks to The Beta Band.
</P>
<P>
   In one screamingly funny sequence, Rob considers a variety of
responses during a confrontation with Laura's pretentious new
boyfriend, Ian (Tim Robbins). Each escalates in cartoonish
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rob's ex-girlfriends are played by such top actresses as
Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor. Cusack's comedically gifted
sister, Joan, appears as Laura's best friend, Liz.
</P>
<P>
   A major rock star makes his movie debut in a surprise cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack, who co-produced the film with DeVincentis and Pink,
plays broke and grumpy Rob with self-deprecating charm.
</P>
<P>
   Black, the lead singer of Tenacious D and a longtime supporting
actor whose credits include ``Cradle Will Rock,'' steals every
scene he's in with the manic energy of John Belushi.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati native Louiso played a similarly music-driven
baby-sitter in ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I listen to pop music because I'm miserable or am I
miserable because I listen to pop music,'' Rob asks. Anyone who has
ever eased the pain of a broken heart with a stack of albums will
find it easy to relate.

 &HT;    `Road' paved with too much Hope (&AMP; Crosby)
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Tulio and Miguel are a cartoon Hope and Crosby,
in search of fortune, adventure and romance on ``The Road to El
Dorado.''
</P>
<P>
   The title of DreamWorks' animated musical pays tribute to the
seven highly successful ``Road'' pictures Bob Hope and Bing Crosby
made with Dorothy Lamour over three decades, from 1940's ``Road to
Singapore'' to 1962's ``The Road to Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Like their live-action counterparts, Tulio (the voice of Kevin
Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) are comical con men who become
involved in overseas shenanigans. As was often the case in the Hope
and Crosby movies, both men also go after same woman.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the cartoon buddy comedy isn't nearly as funny as
the films from which it draws inspiration. The tropical adventure's
colorful look is contrasted by a drab story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado'' boasts stronger character design than
DreamWorks' previous animated feature, ``The Prince of Egypt.'' The
film also features six terrific new songs from Elton John and Tim
Rice, who won an Academy Award for their collaboration on Disney's
``The Lion King.'' Composer Hans Zimmer won an Oscar for ``The Lion
King's'' score.
</P>
<P>
   Kline and Branagh are well-matched as the verbally sparring
protagonists _ never mind the Spanish characters' American and
British accents.
</P>
<P>
   But the characters' search for the legendary City of Gold is
tarnished by a rudimentary plot, in which Tulio and Miguel stumble
onto El Dorado and are proclaimed to be gods by nefarious High
Priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante).
</P>
<P>
   Tzekel-Kan has a taste for power and a thirst for human
sacrifice. He plots to use Tulio and Miguel's fortuitous arrival to
take power from the Chief (Edward James Olmos).
</P>
<P>
   The con men are only concerned with sustaining their ruse long
enough to escape with the gold, until a curvaceous native named
Chel (Rosie Perez) comes between them.
</P>
<P>
   The PG-rated story is too sophisticated and intense for young
viewers and too dull and simplistic for adults. Although it held
children's interest during the screening, the film could have used
more punch. It's mildly amusing, but there are few big laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a clever war horse named Altivo and a cute little
armadillo _ neither of which speak _ there are no comedic animal
sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the songs are performed by John to move along the
story, a la Disney's ``Tarzan.'' Kline and Branagh, who share a
winning chemistry, sing ``It's Tough to Be a God.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Rice are likely to be in the running come next year's
Oscar race. Animated musicals are a favorite in the best song
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado's'' high points have the supposedly
infallible Tulio and Miguel facing off against a team of large
warriors in an Aztec version of basketball, and later running for
their lives from a giant stone jaguar brought to life by
Tzekel-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Though the latter sequence features a beautiful shot of the
monster amid molten volcano lava, the film doesn't blaze any new
trails in animation. First-time directors Eric ``Bibo'' Bergeron
and Don Paul fail to integrate computer and traditional cel
animation as seamlessly as Disney did in ``Tarzan.'' It's fairly
obvious when the two are combined.
</P>
<P>
   The Peter Maxx-inspired title sequence recalls The Beatles'
``Yellow Submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers are sensitive to the Latin community, using
Hispanic voice actors such as Perez, Assante and Olmos and giving
Chel hips like Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   However, the movie skirts the limits of family entertainment
with much talk about human sacrifice, scenes of the stomping
jaguar's carnage and a brief ``Jaws'' homage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy ship!'' exclaims Tulio, when he, Miguel and Altivo go
overboard directly into the path of Cortes' galleon, en route to
the New World.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Dorado's'' path will likely be the road to home video.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore changes stance on Cuban boy
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Cuban-American vote critical in Florida and angry
Miami-area voters saying they will unite behind George W. Bush, Al
Gore came out Thursday in favor of permanent residence status for
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. Most of the area's 780,000
Cuban-Americans are furious at the Clinton administration for
ordering the boy's return to Cuba. Gore's stated position has been
that ``a custody matter for the courts to decide based on due
process, with a full hearing in which all parties are heard.'' Gore
said Thursday: ``It now appears that our immigration laws may not
be broad enough to allow for such an approach in Elian's case. That
is why I am urging ... permanent resident status to Elian, his
father, stepmother, half-brother, grandmothers, and grandfather, so
that this case can be adjudicated properly.''
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHERS HAD GOOD IDEAS, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from both John McCain and the Clinton administration,
George W. Bush proposed Thursday a big increase in the ``troops to
teachers'' program for turning retired military personnel into math
and science teachers. ``This is a signal that says there are a lot
of good people who should be welcomed into the ranks of teachers,''
Bush said. ``Senator McCain talked a lot about this in the course
of the primaries, and I appreciate him bringing this issue to our
collective attention.'' After a morning of finger-painting and
storytelling, Bush promoted his new package for teacher training,
recruitment and retention in a discussion with a dozen education
policymakers at a middle school in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE PAYOFF COME VEEP-PICKING TIME
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler has a new political action committee
and has given thousands of dollars to candidates for federal
office, an indication that the Republican is trying to boost his
national profile and influence. Without fanfare, the Governor
Engler Leadership Fund was established in July. It collected
$77,450 from 61 donors in its first six months, with 46
contributions coming from people living outside Michigan. The PAC
allows Engler to give up to $5,000 to a candidate _ rather than the
$1,000 per election he is limited to as an individual _ and pay for
his travel for appearances for various candidates.
</P>
<P>
   `BEING JOHN MCCAIN,' STARRING PAT BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's Pat Buchanan wants to follow John McCain's
lead in attracting voters to a maverick candidate. He said he
thought he would have wide appeal in Connecticut and other states
where McCain won seven Republican presidential primaries by running
as a non-establishment candidate. But Buchanan acknowledged a
problem: ``If you're a liberal Republican and you're doing very
well, you're probably not going to vote for Pat Buchanan.''
Buchanan was on a four-day swing through New England, including a
$100-a-person fund-raiser in Stratford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN READY TO HIT THE ROAD AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   John McCain will make his initial campaign foray on behalf of
House Republican candidates early next month. His first campaign
swing is expected to be in the Northeast _ campaigning for Mark
Nielsen, challenging Rep. Jim Maloney in Connecticut, and Greg
Becker, running against Rep. Carolyn McCarthy in New York. The
disclosure came shortly after McCain held an unannounced meeting in
his Senate office with Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, head of the
House GOP campaign committee. Last week, McCain offered to campaign
on behalf of Republican candidates. The meeting with Davis came one
day after McCain and George W. Bush talked by phone.
</P>
<P>
   SORRY, GRANNY, KEEP ON WALKING
</P>
<P>
   In talking about his being a born-again campaign finance
reformer, Al Gore has referred to 90-year-old ``Granny D.'' The
woman recently completed a yearlong coast-to-coast walk to draw
attention to the campaign reform issue. Gore called Granny D _
actually Doris Haddock _ the embodiment of a grass-roots effort.
National Public Radio, however, reported that Granny D. had sought
to talk to Gore during her trek, only to be told it would cost her
$500. NPR said the incident occurred in Arkansas when Granny D
presented herself at a Gore event that turned out to be a
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT SOMEONE . . .
</P>
<P>
   Al Sharpton turned up on the steps of the Republican National
Committee headquarters in Washington and announced he's suing the
RNC and its chairman, Jim Nicholson, over a letter Nicholson sent
to the Washington Post. Sharpton, charging that his reputation had
been besmirched, said he was suing for $30 million. In the letter,
published March 11, Nicholson objected to the newspaper describing
Sharpton as a ``civil rights leader.'' Nicholson called Sharpton a
hatemonger, an anti-Semite and a racist, and the Washington Times
said Nicholson stands by his statements.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN (STATE) LEAD GROW?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's bruising Republican primary contest against
John McCain has helped give Al Gore a commanding lead among New
Jersey voters, according to a poll released today. A day after Bush
visited the state where independent voters outnumber both
registered Republicans and Democrats, the survey by Quinnipiac
College in Hamden, Conn., showed Gore surging to a 50 to 37 point
lead. The same poll (2.9 percentage point margin of error) in
February had Gore with a 6-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   WINDOW DRESSING FOR THE FEC REPORTS
</P>
<P>
   Top Democrats are urging the rank and file to reach for their
checkbooks in the next few days so key candidates can have as much
money in the bank as possible when they file campaign fund-raising
reports March 31. ``Maximize your early support. Please remember to
help them as much as you can,'' Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode
Island wrote fellow Democrats. A fat bank balance provides more
than psychological comfort for a candidate. It also can scare off
potential challengers or discourage contributors from making
donations to a rival whose candidacy looks like it will be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   TORT REFORM AND TART CRITICISM
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Attorneys General Association, holding its annual
meeting in Austin, Texas, opposes industry-wide lawsuits, such as
those against tobacco companies and gun manufacturers, that have
cost some companies billions. Acting under the umbrella of the
Republican National Committee, the group seeks contributions to
help fund state attorneys general races around the country. But the
nonpartisan Texans for Public Justice, is criticizing RAGA's
fund-raising practices, saying it sells big donors immunity from
state lawsuits. ``The entire RAGA operation raises serious
questions of conflicts of interest and selling government access
and policy to the highest bidder,'' said Craig McDonald, head of
the watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-RILEY TIT FOR TAT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Education Secretary Richard Riley traded
charges over education, with Bush accusing the department of
spending taxpayer dollars to campaign against him and Riley saying
Bush had manipulated his words for political gain. Bush started it
by releasing a statement saying Riley had praised Bush's statewide
reading reforms as a model for the nation. In a statement of his
own, Riley accused Bush of claiming undue credit for administration
reading programs and manipulating the remarks from a 1996 Riley
speech to support those claims.
</P>
<P>
   UNDECIDED NOW, SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
</P>
<P>
   Voters in upstate New York may be the deciding factor in the
ever-tightening Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudy
Giuliani. Fourteen percent of upstate voters surveyed by the Marist
Institute for Public Opinion remain undecided between the
Democratic first lady and the Republican mayor of New York City.
Giuliani leads in the GOP-dominated upstate region, 49 percent to
37 percent, but the now-undecided voters there could swing the
race. Clinton is the clear favorite in New York City at 60 percent
to 34 percent; Giuliani is strong in the suburbs, 56 percent to 32
percent. The poll has a 4 percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   BROKER'S MONEY PAYING OFF
</P>
<P>
   A new poll shows ex-Wall Street brokerage Chairman Jon Corzine
closing the gap on ex-Gov. Jim Florio in the Democratic race to
succeed retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), probably because
of heavy television spending. A Quinnipiac College Poll said 50
percent of registered Democrats support Florio, 26 percent favor
Corzine. The poll was conducted March 21-27, right after Corzine
began a TV ad blitz aimed at boosting his name recognition. A
Quinnipiac poll the month before showed Florio leading 57-22
percent. Poll's margin of error: 4.9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   WATCHING HIS MOUTH IN NEW JERSEY
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Senate candidate Jon Corzine, running in a state
where one-quarter of Democrats are Italian-American, reportedly
made a disparaging remark about Italians two weeks ago. According
to the New York Times, Corzine said to an Italian-American
contractor: ``Oh, you make cement shoes!'' Corzine's rival for the
Democratic nomination is ex-governor Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYING THE NAME GAME
</P>
<P>
   It's Gebhardt vs. Gephardt in a Missouri congressional primary
that has the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, accusing
Republicans of dirty tricks. The 12-term St. Louis congressman drew
a Democratic primary challenge on the last day of filing from
Richard A. Gebhardt, a 65-year-old political newcomer from St.
Peters near Gephardt's home base of St. Louis. That prompted
Gephardt, who hopes to become speaker of the House if the Democrats
regain control, to submit paperwork changing his ballot name to
``Richard A. (Dick) Gephardt.'' Gebhardt entered the race for the
Democratic nomination in the 2nd District on Monday, but switched
the next day to the 3rd District. Residency in a congressional
district is not a requirement to run.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS AND TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton may be running in New York, but she
showed her support for women entrepreneurs at the Women's
Technology Cluster in San Francisco, an incubator for
Internet-related companies. Political candidates from across the
spectrum are frequent visitors to Northern California, hoping to
tap support from an industry flush with new wealth brought on by
the rise of the Internet in communication and commerce. Clinton's
roundtable discussion with leaders of several female-owned Internet
companies was not billed as a fund-raiser, but she also was
scheduled to attend a fund-raiser at the home of Apple Computer
founder Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   IN NEW YORK, IT'S NOT JUST DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudy Giuliani find themselves
confronting a series of decisions over the next two months that
might be as important as any they make between now and Election
Day: how to pick their way through a maze of six independent
parties listed on the New York state ballot, each clamoring for a
role in a contest in which third-party endorsements could make a
crucial difference. For years, the small-party dynamic in New York
amounted to the Liberal Party backing the Democratic candidate and
the Conservative Party cross-endorsing the Republican. But as of
now, both Clinton and Giuliani seem inclined to seek the support of
the Liberal Party and, perhaps, the more problematic Independence
Party, which is the New York incarnation of Ross Perot's
division-wracked Reform Party.

<P>
   TOUGH NUT TO CRACK IN KEYSTONE STATE
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins Pennsylvania's six-way Democratic primary for
Senate next month will face two obstacles in November: Republican
Sen. Rick Santorum and nearly 40 years of history. No Pennsylvania
Democrat has been elected to a full term in the Senate since Joseph
Clark in 1962. The primary has emerged as a too-close-to-call
three-way race among Rep. Ron Klink, former state Labor Secretary
Thomas Foley and state Sen. Allyson Schwartz. Philadelphia-area
lawyers Phil Berg, Murray Levin and Robert Rovner have failed to
register beyond single digits in any poll.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE, YOU GET BIGGER HELP
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton helped the Senate bid of Rep. Debbie Stabenow
(D-Mich.) by attending a cocktail party in Washington that raised
$250,000. Stabenow held a slight lead over Sen. Spencer Abraham, a
freshman Republican, in a Epic/MRA Inc. poll earlier this month.
Abraham's standing suffered partly because he had backed George W.
Bush when Michigan Republicans went for John McCain in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   EXTREMISM IN THE DEFENSE OF PRESS RELEASES IS NO `VICE'
</P>
<P>
   Just how closely are the Bush and Gore campaigns watching each
other? When a wire service dropped the word ``vice'' from Al Gore's
title in a press release, George W. Bush's aides likened the
mistake to other verbal slips or grand claims by Gore. ``Since he
invented the Internet, inspired ``Love Story'' and discovered Love
Canal, it's fitting that the vice president promote himself to
president,'' said Ari Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman. But it
was the Bush campaign that was overreaching: U.S. Newswire said it
made the error.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE FOR ME OR DIE
</P>
<P>
   A hacker cracked into Marquette University's Web site and
replaced the main page with a fake that falsely accused Al Gore of
making outrageous comments during his address to the school. The
sham Web page, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, had
counterfeit quotes about Gore's speech at Marquette on Monday,
claiming among other things that Gore said he plans to ``rid this
country of anyone who might question my motives, starting with
deporting all Christians.''

 &HT;    Hollywood's new ventures draw upon success of 1999's cartoon
hits
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hollywood is enjoying a 'toon boom.
</P>
<P>
   Not the sort of explosion that occurs when one of Wile E.
Coyote's ACME products goes awry, but an animation renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   On his year-end Top-10 list for 1999, Los Angeles Times film
critic Kenneth Turan named four animated films _ The Iron Giant,
Princess Mononoke, Tarzan and Toy Story 2 _ as the collective
first-place winner. ``It was the best year for animation in the
history of the movie industry,'' Turan told Premiere magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The major studios are releasing 10 animated features in 2000, up
from seven in 1999. That's a huge jump from the three cartoon
features released in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   This year's first animated feature, ``The Tigger Movie,'' has
made an impressive $43 million since its release in February _
outperforming such big-budget live-action films as ``Reindeer
Games'' and ``The Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado'' _ an animated musical adventure
featuring the voices of Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh and songs
by Elton John and Tim Rice _ opens today.
</P>
<P>
   Top stars such as Mel Gibson, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Drew
Barrymore, Alfre Woodard, Susan Sarandon and Bill Murray are also
lending their voices to forthcoming animated features.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the year's most anticipated live-action films _
``X-Men,'' ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' and ``How the
Grinch Stole Christmas'' _ are based on comics and cartoons. So,
too, are ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' and ``102
Dalmatians.''
</P>
<P>
   Feature animation drew almost $600 million at the box office in
1999, tripling the take for animated films from 1997, according to
industry figures. Disney's ``Tarzan'' and ``Toy Story 2'' combined
for almost $400 million and made millions more in merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' is the second highest-grossing animated film in
history, with $241 million and counting. The computer-animated
adventure will probably end up as the 16th highest-grossing film of
all-time, ahead of ``Twister'' and ``Raiders of the Lost Ark.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. acquired the Japanese ``Pokemon'' movie for $5
million, re-dubbed it into English, added a pop music soundtrack
and made $84 million domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' grossed $52 million,
more than double its $21 million budget, last year in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   All should substantially increase their profit margins on home
video.
</P>
<P>
   Disney spent about $100 million to make ``The Lion King,''
according to ``Variety,'' but made $1.2 billion in profit.
</P>
<P>
   Feature animation can pay off big, but the risks are equally
great. Studios must commit to projects years before they see the
results. Failures can be costly in terms of money, time and labor.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Animation Studios reportedly laid-off two thirds of its 320
animators in Phoenix, Ariz., where it produced ``Anastasia.'' The
1997 film cost $53 million to make and grossed a disappointing $58
million domestically, according to Internet Movie Database figures.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Animation will release ``Titan A.E.,'' a sci-fi adventure
featuring the voices of Damon, Barrymore and Bill Pullman, this
summer. It will compete with a crowded slate of 'toons that also
includes ``Dinosaur,'' ``Chicken Run'' and the 35mm release of
``Fantasia/2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at this year's animated features. Like Wile E.
Coyote's best-laid plans, release dates are subject to change.

   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Slide in a buck and punch 24-12 on the
Hyperbeam Laserdisc juke box in the bar at the Best Western motel.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen pops on, singing the sad truth:
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreman says these jobs are going, boys, and they ain't
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``To your home town.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Willie Martin's home town. He was born and reared in
this blue-collar community of textile mills and furniture factories
in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Played defensive end on
the high school football team. Hired on at the plant that made Sara
Lee brand clothing. Never wanted to live anywhere other than this
hilly settlement of 16,000 people in modest brick houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is home,'' he proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is 36 now. When he was growing up, Martinsville boasted
of being the ``Sweatshirt Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Sara Lee plant closed about seven years ago, he soon
got a job at Tultex Corp. making sweatshirts and sweat pants and
T-shirts and shorts for Sears, Nike, Reebok and other brands as
well as for Tultex's own Discus Athletic and Track Gear lines. He
worked the night shift, 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., four nights one week,
three nights the next. He liked the hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a morning person,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   Tultex paid about as well as any other employer in the region _
$11 to $12 an hour for the average worker.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three weeks before Christmas, Tultex declared bankruptcy.
Willie Martin was among 1,100 workers terminated without warning.
No severance check. No holiday bonus. No more company insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just dumped us out like we were nothing,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, there were no jobs awaiting laid-off workers. The
Sara Lee closing had been a harbinger. DuPont moved out of
Martinsville in 1998. Pluma closed its clothing plants here last
fall. Ashmore Industries shut down shortly thereafter. Then Hampton
Industries closed its sewing plant for sleepwear.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, the area lost about 3,400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now nearly one out of every five adults in Martinsville is
looking for work. The 18.4 percent unemployment rate could even go
higher when the last Tultex workers, now cleaning out the plants
and shipping out the final products, are let go.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell folks hereabouts about America's boom times. They
smile bitterly when asked about the Federal Reserve Board raising
interest rates to slow a surging economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan ought to come down and visit us for a while,''
said Mary Minter, a 54-year-old grandmother who is looking for a
new job after being laid off at Tultex.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In the new Southern economy that stretches from America Online
Inc.'s headquarters in Northern Virginia to Dell Computer Corp.'s
headquarters outside Austin, it's easy to overlook the old Southern
economy in places like Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the textile industry, located largely in Dixie, has
lost more than 100,000 jobs, leaving it with about 550,000. In the
apparel industry, the situation is worse, with nearly 300,000 jobs
lost in the same seven-year period, leaving fewer than 700,000 at
work making clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In Martinsville, folks blame the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that their jobs went to Mexico, where manufacturers
pay less for labor. Now President Clinton has asked Congress to
give China the same permanent trade benefits granted most other
nations. If that happens, workers here warn, the remaining textile
and apparel jobs are headed to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is more complicated than that, explained Gary
Shoesmith, an economist at Wake Forest University in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Automation has replaced about as many textile workers as foreign
trade has, he said. U.S. textile shipments have actually increased
slightly since NAFTA opened the continent's borders. Wages have
increased for the Southern textile workers in new high-tech mills.
</P>
<P>
   In the less automated apparel industry, dependent on people who
cut and sew, more jobs are headed to countries where labor costs
are lower, he predicted. But he says it would have happened with or
without NAFTA or permanent trade privileges for China.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, the textile and apparel industries will be wide open
worldwide, said Shoesmith. Free trade will benefit the overall
Southern economy, he said. Already, yarn spun in automated Carolina
mills is being used to make clothing in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While Dixie's textile and apparel industries have historically
paid relatively low wages, Shoesmith said, workers of the future
will be paid according to what they know and what they're willing
to do. They'll have to retrain several times over a lifetime of
work and be more mobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the 50-year-old man who walks out of the textile mill for
the last time, where does he go?'' asked Shoesmith. ``If he is
resistant to retraining, he may end up on the graveyard shift at
the 7-Eleven. Those are the sad stories.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Mary Minter lives one of those sad stories.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 years at Tultex, she was late only twice. Both times, she
was delayed when deer smashed into her pickup truck while she was
driving to work. Two of her four sons, as well as a brother, also
lost their jobs when Tultex abruptly shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine had worked there for 40 years. She had gone
to Tultex straight out of high school and had a year and a half
till she could retire. They told her that she had 20 minutes to
gather up her things and get out of the building,'' Minter
recalled. ``It was like a slap in the face to people who had worked
so hard for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's squeezing a living from an unemployment check of
about $200 a week, the grandchildren ``want to know why Nanny can't
buy'' any more Matchbox cars or Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, John, is disabled. He had a heart attack one
Christmas Eve in the parking lot of K-Mart and has since had
open-heart surgery and several operations on his back. They're
worried about how to pay for the pills that regulate John's
heartbeat. Their health insurance had been provided by Tultex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting more desperate as the weeks go by,'' said Mary.
She has put in applications at businesses all over the area, but so
have hundreds of other job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   She's looking forward to the NASCAR season opening at the
Martinsville Race Track, where she can earn some money working in
the concession stand on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The signs marking Martinsville's city limits now feature a
checkered flag motif rather than sweatshirt production. The city
council has offered to give away land to companies that will invest
in the community and create new jobs. So far, there are few takers.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Bassinger is worried.
</P>
<P>
   She worked in the cutting room at Tultex for nearly 13 years
until, at the age of 36, she lost her job ``with no warning or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bassinger tells it, for decades the town was run by a few
families who owned and operated textile mills or furniture
factories. They resisted other industries coming in because they
wanted to keep wages low. Eventually, the local textile owners sold
out to national corporations. Beset by foreign competition, the
corporations pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   But Bassinger doesn't want to pull out. She grew up in
Martinsville. Her parents still live here. Her three teenage
children are immersed in their high school. Her husband has a job
at a tire dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have roots,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's putting in job applications at furniture factories in
North Carolina. Sitting in the sunny back yard of her small brick
house, Bassinger said she's willing to drive an hour each way if
she can find a job. She doesn't want to move away from
Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   This is her home town.

   Bruce Springsteen pops on, singing the sad truth:
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreman says these jobs are going, boys, and they ain't
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``To your home town.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Willie Martin's home town. He was born and reared in
this blue-collar community of textile mills and furniture factories
in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Played defensive end on
the high school football team. Hired on at the plant that made Sara
Lee brand clothing. Never wanted to live anywhere other than this
hilly settlement of 16,000 people in modest brick houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is home,'' he proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is 36 now. When he was growing up, Martinsville boasted
of being the ``Sweatshirt Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Sara Lee plant closed about seven years ago, he soon
got a job at Tultex Corp. making sweatshirts and sweat pants and
T-shirts and shorts for Sears, Nike, Reebok and other brands as
well as for Tultex's own Discus Athletic and Track Gear lines. He
worked the night shift, 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., four nights one week,
three nights the next. He liked the hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a morning person,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   Tultex paid about as well as any other employer in the region _
$11 to $12 an hour for the average worker.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three weeks before Christmas, Tultex declared bankruptcy.
Willie Martin was among 1,100 workers terminated without warning.
No severance check. No holiday bonus. No more company insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just dumped us out like we were nothing,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, there were no jobs awaiting laid-off workers. The
Sara Lee closing had been a harbinger. DuPont moved out of
Martinsville in 1998. Pluma closed its clothing plants here last
fall. Ashmore Industries shut down shortly thereafter. Then Hampton
Industries closed its sewing plant for sleepwear.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, the area lost about 3,400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now nearly one out of every five adults in Martinsville is
looking for work. The 18.4 percent unemployment rate could even go
higher when the last Tultex workers, now cleaning out the plants
and shipping out the final products, are let go.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell folks hereabouts about America's boom times. They
smile bitterly when asked about the Federal Reserve Board raising
interest rates to slow a surging economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan ought to come down and visit us for a while,''
said Mary Minter, a 54-year-old grandmother who is looking for a
new job after being laid off at Tultex.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In the new Southern economy that stretches from America Online
Inc.'s headquarters in Northern Virginia to Dell Computer Corp.'s
headquarters outside Austin, it's easy to overlook the old Southern
economy in places like Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the textile industry, located largely in Dixie, has
lost more than 100,000 jobs, leaving it with about 550,000. In the
apparel industry, the situation is worse, with nearly 300,000 jobs
lost in the same seven-year period, leaving fewer than 700,000 at
work making clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In Martinsville, folks blame the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that their jobs went to Mexico, where manufacturers
pay less for labor. Now President Clinton has asked Congress to
give China the same permanent trade benefits granted most other
nations. If that happens, workers here warn, the remaining textile
and apparel jobs are headed to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is more complicated than that, explained Gary
Shoesmith, an economist at Wake Forest University in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Automation has replaced about as many textile workers as foreign
trade has, he said. U.S. textile shipments have actually increased
slightly since NAFTA opened the continent's borders. Wages have
increased for the Southern textile workers in new high-tech mills.
</P>
<P>
   In the less automated apparel industry, dependent on people who
cut and sew, more jobs are headed to countries where labor costs
are lower, he predicted. But he says it would have happened with or
without NAFTA or permanent trade privileges for China.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, the textile and apparel industries will be wide open
worldwide, said Shoesmith. Free trade will benefit the overall
Southern economy, he said. Already, yarn spun in automated Carolina
mills is being used to make clothing in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While Dixie's textile and apparel industries have historically
paid relatively low wages, Shoesmith said, workers of the future
will be paid according to what they know and what they're willing
to do. They'll have to retrain several times over a lifetime of
work and be more mobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the 50-year-old man who walks out of the textile mill for
the last time, where does he go?'' asked Shoesmith. ``If he is
resistant to retraining, he may end up on the graveyard shift at
the 7-Eleven. Those are the sad stories.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Mary Minter lives one of those sad stories.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 years at Tultex, she was late only twice. Both times, she
was delayed when deer smashed into her pickup truck while she was
driving to work. Two of her four sons, as well as a brother, also
lost their jobs when Tultex abruptly shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine had worked there for 40 years. She had gone
to Tultex straight out of high school and had a year and a half
till she could retire. They told her that she had 20 minutes to
gather up her things and get out of the building,'' Minter
recalled. ``It was like a slap in the face to people who had worked
so hard for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's squeezing a living from an unemployment check of
about $200 a week, the grandchildren ``want to know why Nanny can't
buy'' any more Matchbox cars or Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, John, is disabled. He had a heart attack one
Christmas Eve in the parking lot of K-Mart and has since had
open-heart surgery and several operations on his back. They're
worried about how to pay for the pills that regulate John's
heartbeat. Their health insurance had been provided by Tultex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting more desperate as the weeks go by,'' said Mary.
She has put in applications at businesses all over the area, but so
have hundreds of other job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   She's looking forward to the NASCAR season opening at the
Martinsville Race Track, where she can earn some money working in
the concession stand on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The signs marking Martinsville's city limits now feature a
checkered flag motif rather than sweatshirt production. The city
council has offered to give away land to companies that will invest
in the community and create new jobs. So far, there are few takers.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Bassinger is worried.
</P>
<P>
   She worked in the cutting room at Tultex for nearly 13 years
until, at the age of 36, she lost her job ``with no warning or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bassinger tells it, for decades the town was run by a few
families who owned and operated textile mills or furniture
factories. They resisted other industries coming in because they
wanted to keep wages low. Eventually, the local textile owners sold
out to national corporations. Beset by foreign competition, the
corporations pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   But Bassinger doesn't want to pull out. She grew up in
Martinsville. Her parents still live here. Her three teenage
children are immersed in their high school. Her husband has a job
at a tire dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have roots,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's putting in job applications at furniture factories in
North Carolina. Sitting in the sunny back yard of her small brick
house, Bassinger said she's willing to drive an hour each way if
she can find a job. She doesn't want to move away from
Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   This is her home town.

 &HT;    GORE, IN BREAK WITH CLINTON, SAHIFT STANCE ON ELIAN
 &HT;    490&AMP;add. Moving in (i) international and (p) politics
categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, in a politically strategic
break with the Clinton administration, endorsed legislation
Thursday that would grant Elian Gonzalez and his Cuban relatives
permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said Elian's case ``is a matter that should be decided
by courts that have the experience and expertise to resolve custody
cases.'' That position apparently aligns him with those who want
Florida family courts to decide the case rather than the Justice
Department or even the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's action _ and the immediate reaction it drew from Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee _ reflected the explosive political nature of the case and
the importance of Florida, the country's fourth largest state, in
this fall's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic Party's choice for president this year,
blamed ``the oppressive regime'' of Cuban leader Fidel Castro for
the controversy surrounding the case. It was a message apparently
aimed at Florida's politically active Cuban American community,
which has criticized the administration's handling of the case and
could tilt the state's political balance against Gore this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore urged Congress to pass a law that would grant permanent
resident status to the 6-year-old, his father, stepmother,
half-brother, grandmothers and grandfather, ``so that the case can
be adjudicated properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has supported by Bush, who reacted to the
vice president's action Thursday by challenging him to persuade
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno to join him in
supporting a court remedy of the case rather than one ordered by
the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he ought to do is convince the attorney general and the
president to accept the same position,'' Bush said. ``We'll see
what kind of influence he has in this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert said, ``The president and the
vice president have a different view'' on Elian's case. At his news
conference Wednesday, Clinton said the legal process should be
followed.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said Thursday that the Gonzalez case indicated U.S.
immigration laws ``may not be broad enough'' to allow the boy's
fate to be decided by courts ``that have the experience and
expertise to resolve custody cases _ with due process, and based on
Elian's best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was left stranded on an inner tube after his mother and 10
others drowned while trying to flee Cuba for the United States over
Thanksgiving weekend. His Miami relatives took custody of him even
though his father, still in Cuba, and Castro demanded his immediate
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian should never have been forced to choose between freedom
and his own father,'' Gore said Thursday. ``Now we must take
action, here on our own shores, to make sure that Elian's best
interests are served.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's already slim chance of carrying Florida in the November
presidential election has grown slimmer with the controversy over
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't help Al Gore,'' former senior White House
political adviser Paul Begala said Thursday before Gore's latest
position was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's electoral calculations in his anticipated fall contest
against Bush include the possibility of adding Florida's 25
electoral votes to Tennessee's 11, helping him break the GOP's grip
on the South, a region that is solidly Republican in presidential
voting.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore ticket carried Florida in 1996, 48 percent to
43 percent, against the GOP's Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   That surprise victory came largely as a result of Clinton's long
cultivation of Cuban-Americans, who number some 800,000, about 12
percent of the state's voting population, and are one the
Republican Party's most reliable voting blocs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carried 40 percent of Florida's Cuban-American vote in
1996, enough to become the first Democratic nominee to carry
Miami-Dade County since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the equivalent of a Republican carrying 40 percent of
the African American vote,'' said Begala.
</P>
<P>
   Very few polls have been conducted on the American public's
opinion of the case. The Gallup Organization found in January that
60 percent of Americans thought it was in the best interest of
Elian to return to Cuba to live with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an emotional issue that it's very hard to gauge in
terms of presidential politics,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of
the Pew Research Center, one of the nation's leading polling
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Gore may view Florida as a possible crack in the
GOP's Southern base, ``he can kiss that goodbye if (the Gonzalez
case) turns out really bad,'' said Charles Jones, a noted
presidential scholar with the Brookings Institution, a Washington
research center.
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts question how seriously Gore intends to
challenge Bush in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I looked there was a governor in Florida named
Bush,'' said Stephen Hess, a former Nixon White House adviser who
also is a Brookings political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brother, Jeb, was elected governor in 1998, giving the
Texan an even greater advantage in Florida than a Republican
presidential nominee would otherwise have in the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush has lost some of his popularity among black voters
because of his plan to end affirmative action in state
universities. But Gore has ``nothing to match'' the political
organization in Florida that Jeb Bush has put to work for his
brother, said University of Florida political science professor
Richard Scher.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore plans a campaign trip to West Palm Beach, Fla.,
and Miami next Thursday and Friday, an indication that he has not
written off the state.

 &HT;    GORE, IN BREAK WITH CLINTON, SAHIFT STANCE ON ELIAN
 &HT;    490&AMP;add. Moving in (i) international and (p) politics
categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, in a politically strategic
break with the Clinton administration, endorsed legislation
Thursday that would grant Elian Gonzalez and his Cuban relatives
permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said Elian's case ``is a matter that should be decided
by courts that have the experience and expertise to resolve custody
cases.'' That position apparently aligns him with those who want
Florida family courts to decide the case rather than the Justice
Department or even the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's action _ and the immediate reaction it drew from Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee _ reflected the explosive political nature of the case and
the importance of Florida, the country's fourth largest state, in
this fall's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic Party's choice for president this year,
blamed ``the oppressive regime'' of Cuban leader Fidel Castro for
the controversy surrounding the case. It was a message apparently
aimed at Florida's politically active Cuban American community,
which has criticized the administration's handling of the case and
could tilt the state's political balance against Gore this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore urged Congress to pass a law that would grant permanent
resident status to the 6-year-old, his father, stepmother,
half-brother, grandmothers and grandfather, ``so that the case can
be adjudicated properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has supported by Bush, who reacted to the
vice president's action Thursday by challenging him to persuade
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno to join him in
supporting a court remedy of the case rather than one ordered by
the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he ought to do is convince the attorney general and the
president to accept the same position,'' Bush said. ``We'll see
what kind of influence he has in this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert said, ``The president and the
vice president have a different view'' on Elian's case. At his news
conference Wednesday, Clinton said the legal process should be
followed.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said Thursday that the Gonzalez case indicated U.S.
immigration laws ``may not be broad enough'' to allow the boy's
fate to be decided by courts ``that have the experience and
expertise to resolve custody cases _ with due process, and based on
Elian's best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was left stranded on an inner tube after his mother and 10
others drowned while trying to flee Cuba for the United States over
Thanksgiving weekend. His Miami relatives took custody of him even
though his father, still in Cuba, and Castro demanded his immediate
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian should never have been forced to choose between freedom
and his own father,'' Gore said Thursday. ``Now we must take
action, here on our own shores, to make sure that Elian's best
interests are served.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's already slim chance of carrying Florida in the November
presidential election has grown slimmer with the controversy over
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't help Al Gore,'' former senior White House
political adviser Paul Begala said Thursday before Gore's latest
position was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's electoral calculations in his anticipated fall contest
against Bush include the possibility of adding Florida's 25
electoral votes to Tennessee's 11, helping him break the GOP's grip
on the South, a region that is solidly Republican in presidential
voting.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore ticket carried Florida in 1996, 48 percent to
43 percent, against the GOP's Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   That surprise victory came largely as a result of Clinton's long
cultivation of Cuban-Americans, who number some 800,000, about 12
percent of the state's voting population, and are one the
Republican Party's most reliable voting blocs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carried 40 percent of Florida's Cuban-American vote in
1996, enough to become the first Democratic nominee to carry
Miami-Dade County since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the equivalent of a Republican carrying 40 percent of
the African American vote,'' said Begala.
</P>
<P>
   Very few polls have been conducted on the American public's
opinion of the case. The Gallup Organization found in January that
60 percent of Americans thought it was in the best interest of
Elian to return to Cuba to live with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an emotional issue that it's very hard to gauge in

the Pew Research Center, one of the nation's leading polling

 &HT;    Life is beautiful for Dizdar's `People'
 &HT;    By Steve Uhler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Film pioneer D.W. Griffith believed moving
pictures to be the universal language, capable of transcending
cultural and class barriers to unify humanity. I think he would
have been delighted with ``Beautiful People,'' the enchanting and
stunning debut by writer-director Jasmin Dizdar.
</P>
<P>
   On a crowded cross-town bus in 1993 London, a Croat man
recognizes an old enemy, a Serb who came from the same village in
his homeland, and attacks him. Their fight sets off a chain of
events and encounters that make up this beguiling, labyrinthine
fable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful People,'' which opens today, combines multiple
storylines and characters, coalescing into a nearly perfect movie
mosaic: A compassionate obstetrician, whose wife has just deserted
him, tries to persuade a young Bosnian couple not to kill their
unborn baby; a doctor from an upper-class family falls in love with
her patient, an illegal immigrant; a somnambulistic working-class
junkie finds himself literally dropped into ground zero in Bosnia;
a BBC correspondent's compassion for war's victims unhinges his
grip on sanity.
</P>
<P>
   These and other stories intersect and overlap like an elaborate
cross-stitch, combining into a whole cloth greater than its parts.
It's like a great Robert Altman movie, with a hopeful agenda. It's
packed with small, perfect moments; its considerable humor and
depth come from the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful People'' boasts a large ensemble cast (there are
more than 50 major speaking roles). Each performance resonates with
the perfect pitch of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Dizdar, a Bosnian who has lived in London since 1989, has put
together a captivating and enriching movie. You will feel uplifted.
Maybe that's why Griffith called them ``moving pictures.''

ITALY'S MOPED DRIVERS MAY BE SAFER, BUT THEY'RE NOT HAPPIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The grumbling began at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   That was when a new, and by Italian standards, draconian law
requiring moped drivers to wear helmets went into effect. By
Thursday morning, the streets of Rome, always jammed with
motorbikes, displayed the novel, slightly surreal sight of riders
actually wearing helmets, most of them muttering bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worn one before and I think it is totally
unnecessary,'' Luca Raetano, 27, complained as he pulled off the
helmet he bought on Wednesday and held it out with distaste. ``It's
uncomfortable and hot. Now, summer is coming and it will be
completely unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic safety is a sore subject in Italy, a country where
studies show that only 10 percent of drivers fasten their
seatbelts, despite a 1988 law making seatbelt use mandatory. (In
law-abiding Germany, 92 percent of drivers buckle up.) Until now,
only a third of Italian moped drivers wore helmets, which were
obligatory for minors and drivers of mopeds with engines of 125
cubic centimeters or more. Italy _ where it is estimated that one
in five people drive a motorcycle or a moped, a smaller version of
a motorcycle _ is the last country in the European Union to pass a
helmet law for mopeds.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where mothers defy the law to ferry children to
school on mopeds and businessmen make business calls on cellphones
while steering their ``motorinos'' through chaotic traffic jams,
the new regulations requiring helmets have unleashed angst and
media agitation. The front page of every Italian newspaper Thursday
carried dire warnings about the consequences of going without a
helmet _ fines that range from $30 for an unbuckled helmet to $70
for no helmet at all. Minors caught without helmets are to be fined
$120 and risk a three-month confiscation of their mopeds.
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetic costs of the new law are taken even more
seriously. On Monday, the hosts of a morning television show
interviewed a hairstylist who demonstrated with flowing wigs how
women drivers could maintain a locks-blowing-in-the-wind look even
while wearing a helmet. Paolo di Pofi, a Roman hairdresser, advised
female readers of the daily newspaper La Stampa to maintain their
coiffures by twisting brightly colored sponge rollers into their
hair underneath their helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put them on and take them off in a minute and they look
adorable,'' di Pofi promised.
</P>
<P>
   La Stampa excitedly but incorrectly reported that top designers
like Armani and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana are unveiling chic helmets in their
next collections. But Gattinoni, a Rome-based designer, did receive
50 orders for his $300 ``Claire de Lune'' model, covered in a white
iridescent fabric and embossed with a giant G on the front.
</P>
<P>
   The physical risks of riding without a helmet have received less
attention, but the statistics are daunting. Every sixth automotive
death in Europe happens in Italy, where the road fatality rate is
twice as high as in Britain or Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the research shows that when you do not wear a helmet, you
double your risk of a fatal or serious injury,'' Jeanne Breen,
executive director of the European Transport Safety Council,
explained. ``We are delighted that Italy has made this move. But it
requires enforcement and a serious information campaign to get
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic police did hand out tickets to riders without helmets
Thursday morning. But enforcement was dampened Thursday in Rome by
2,000 traffic police officers who suspended work for three hours to
protest what they described as low pay, poor career advancement and
inadequate resources. (They had a point: Rome's vigili urbani have
70 motorini to help patrol traffic, but could not use them Thursday
because, due to bureaucratic delays, they did not have helmets.)
</P>
<P>
   In Naples, where helmet use is so rare the police often stop
helmeted riders, suspecting they are about to commit a crime, the
police handed out 890 tickets by mid afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All over Italy, citizens complied with the new law, but there
were some rather melodramatic examples of civil disobedience. The
news agency Ansa reported that a helmet-free couple in a suburb of
Naples were arrested after they tried to crash through a police
blockade and nearly mowed down one law enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   It would be almost impossible to live in Italy and not know
about the new law _ television programs and newspapers have been
holding tense countdowns to Thursday's deadline, which many moped
drivers have been bracing for with the kind of bitter anxiety
usually reserved for taxes or occupying armies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sell a single helmet until yesterday, then suddenly,
at the last minute, my store was jammed,'' said Maurizio Polidori,
59, owner of a motorcycle parts store in central Rome, whose
shelves and floors were piled with helmet boxes. ``But Italians do
everything at the last minute. Five customers came in this morning
with traffic tickets in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Polidori, who said he approved of the new law, said it would be
difficult to enforce it for long. ``In Germany, they pass a law and
people obey it,'' he said. ``But Italy is different than anyplace
else _ people make a point of honor to flout the law.''

 &HT;    Gore's a long way from being taken seriously on campaign finance
issue
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to marching the path of righteousness,
few do it with the determination of the reformed sinner. In that
context, a chastened Al Gore may eventually become the man to lead
the charge for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   But based on the reform plan he's now proposing, he's not quite
ready yet.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore did not violate the law in his zeal to collect money for
the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign, he surely pushed it to the limit
with his White House phone solicitations and his Buddhist temple
caper. He still has some explaining to do about e-mail messages
concerning 1996 fund-raising activities, messages that were
subpoenaed but somehow disappeared _ owing to a computer glitch,
his office says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an obvious political gambit meant to blunt the jabs of
his GOP rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Gore has promised to make
campaign finance reform his first priority if he is elected
president. That commitment _ practically a ``read my lips'' vow _
indicates that Gore at least recognizes the importance of the issue
to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the plan that Gore proposes to cure the problem
falls well short of what's necessary. To be blunt, it's unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of his reform effort is a proposal to establish a
privately funded $7 billion endowment, from which U.S. Senate and
House election campaigns would be financed starting in 2008. The
admirable goal of the fund is to create contests where a
candidate's qualifications and ideas are more important than how
much money he or she can raise from special interests seeking
influence in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plan doesn't offer a dime to finance primary
campaigns, where incumbents usually have the greatest financial
advantage over political newcomers. It's also unlikely that
political contributors can be coaxed to donate to an endowment that
gives equal financing to candidates from across the political
spectrum. Under the current system, people give money to acquire
influence with politicians. If there's no influence to be gained,
there won't be any money either. Even Gore's plan to offer a tax
write-off won't attract contributors who are used to donating to
champions of their causes, rather than shelling out for some
generalized public good.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has at least moved beyond the issue of whether the system
should be reformed; his plan should move the process to the next
stage, debating how that reform can be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that's more than can be said for Gov. Bush.

 &HT;    WHAT COULD HAPPEN NEXT TO MICROSOFT?
 &HT;    With COX-MICROSOFT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, April 2.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are seven possible outcomes that could eventually result
from a ruling that Microsoft violated antitrust laws or emerge from
a negotiated settlement:
</P>
<P>
   1. Microsoft is split into two or more separate companies. One
of them would market Windows, the firm's flagship product, while
another would sell its suite of applications, such as Word. Yet a
third company might be formed to offer Internet-based content and
services.
</P>
<P>
   2. Microsoft is split into several equal-sized entities,
popularly known as ``Baby Bills'' after chairman Bill Gates.
Initially, at least, each of the newly formed rivals would sell the
same software and products while competing against each other on
price and quality of service.
</P>
<P>
   3. Microsoft is broken up into several firms that target
different market segments. Under this plan, one such successor
company could tailor its products to consumers while another might
focus on large business customers. To ensure uniformity, a separate
company also could be formed to guarantee that divergent flavors of
Windows can still run the same basic applications.
</P>
<P>
   4. Microsoft is required to license Windows to its rivals. These
companies would then be free to market enhanced Windows clones that
would compete against Microsoft's ``classic'' version.
</P>
<P>
   5. Microsoft is required to provide detailed programming
``hooks'' into Windows to help its rivals compete. By opening up
the ``source code,'' they would become free to extend the Windows
operating system into such new areas as ``smart'' browsers, voice
or touch-screen commands, and next-generation audio and video
services.
</P>
<P>
   6. Microsoft is forced to ship a version of Windows that strips
away its built-in Internet browser. It could also be obliged to
offer other Windows versions that feature competing browsers.
</P>
<P>
   7. Microsoft is made to change its business practices. One
possibility: It would be barred from striking exclusive licensing
deals or required to publish a price list for its software and
services that would offer all comers the same deal, calling a halt
to current preferences.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE REACHEST A CROSSROADS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Midway through the Reagan administration, the
Justice Department settled a long-standing case against the
nation's telephone monopoly by creating the framework for its
eventual breakup into seven regional Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Now that a federal judge threatens to break up Microsoft Corp.
as a predatory monopolist, the combatants in this high-stakes legal
struggle wonder whether the beleaguered software giant could some
day recover _ as AT&AMP;T has _ from having been ground down in the
antitrust mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go by the historical precedent, investors would probably
benefit,'' said Wall Street analyst Donald Selkin, who has watched
Microsoft's shares more than double in value since the government
filed its landmark suit nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the combined value of the four surviving Baby
Bells and other major spin-offs is now roughly double that of
parent AT&AMP;T, whose shares in recent years have also soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumers' standpoint, I don't really think anybody
knows whether or not it's better if Microsoft is broken up or
not,'' Selkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, fear that dividing up Windows,
Microsoft's flagship product, which serves as the operating system
on 90 percent of the world's personal computers, will spawn chaos
on the intellectual property front rather than bring about a fresh
surge of technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of consumers would still like to dial zero and get
somebody on the other end of the phone,'' says Jonathan Zuck, head
of the Association for Competitive Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Zuck, whose group was founded in 1998 to combat the government
in the Microsoft suit, argues that ``the notion that somehow
breaking up Microsoft and splitting up product development teams,
creating multiple version of Windows without increasing the size of
the market is, I think, crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a good way to break them up, Microsoft could do
that themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is an argument to which the clutch of multi-billionaires
calling the shots at Microsoft strongly subscribe, even as they
strive to cut a deal with the government to forestall a final
ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. The judge
has postponed issuing a verdict, but probably only until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in an e-mail message, composed at the company's
sprawling Redmond, Wash., campus and aimed at more than 30,000
Microsoft employees around the world, Steve Ballmer, the company's
recently named chief executive officer, wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're very sure of our legal position and we're prepared
to take it all the way on appeal, we've learned that discretion is
the better part of valor, so we are working very hard to resolve
the case through settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, however, put down several markers of his own that, he
said, Microsoft will not cross _ at the risk of ultimately being
found guilty and exposed to potential triple damages in civil suits
that would inevitably follow an adverse verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we've put more on the table than the judicial
process would ultimately provide, even if we lost the case,'' he
wrote, adding: ``Any settlement must preserve our ability to
innovate and improve our products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine a scenario where you can work out details of a
very complex set of conduct remedies on Microsoft terms using a
Microsoft draft,'' said Ken Wasch, president of the Software and
Information Industry Association, which in February filed an
extensive brief with Jackson supporting the government and
suggesting the company be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You (have) got to be suspect when the defendant in a law
enforcement action proposes his own punishment,'' Wasch added.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanley Liebowitz, an economics professor at the University
of Texas and a critic of the government, believes Jackson has
pressed so hard for a last-minute settlement because he recognizes
the danger of imposing the kind of structural remedy once accepted
by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he wants to do anything that's too strong,
because it runs the risk of backfiring and getting him a reputation
in history as a judge who really messed up the economy,'' said
Liebowitz.
</P>
<P>
   For its own part, the government has also sent some ambivalent
signals in trying to settle the case. After a spate of reports the
Justice Department had given up on the notion of behavioral
remedies, new accounts surfaced that it was willing to stop short
of seeking an outright breakup.
</P>
<P>
   This apparently gentler and kinder strategy did not sit well
with some of 19 state attorneys general who are, in theory, full
partners in the historic litigation. The state officials were also
upset that Richard Posner, the tenacious judicial mediator in the
case, had failed to deal with them as equal players.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to placate state officials, Assistant U.S. Attorney
General Joel Klein reverted to a harsher tone in congressional
testimony last week.
</P>
<P>
   Said Klein: ``The findings of fact reveal a serious pattern of
anticompetitive conduct,'' referring to the 150-page ruling handed
down by Jackson last November. ``I think that a remedy ought to be
commensurate with those practices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiffs have always been willing to talk about a
(conduct-based) remedy with Microsoft, said Stephen Houck, the
former trial counsel for the states involved in the lawsuit and a
onetime antitrust prosecutor for the state of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Houck, now a private lawyer, believes the toughest problem in
crafting a settlement is making sure that Microsoft is forever
barred from doing to other companies what it once did to the former
Netscape Communications Corp., in using its huge Windows leverage
to tear down the market share of the competing browser offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the browser is a prime example of a tactic that
Microsoft has used, and I'm confident the government would not
settle a case unless there were some way to resolve issues like
this in the future,'' Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   If his view prevails, it means any settlement would have to set
firm restrictions on Microsoft's ability to integrate applications
with its dominant Windows operating system. But that may also mean
that a settlement, at this point, remains beyond reach.

<P>
   Here are seven possible outcomes that could eventually result
from a ruling that Microsoft violated antitrust laws or emerge from
a negotiated settlement:
</P>
<P>
   1. Microsoft is split into two or more separate companies. One
of them would market Windows, the firm's flagship product, while
another would sell its suite of applications, such as Word. Yet a
third company might be formed to offer Internet-based content and
services.
</P>
<P>
   2. Microsoft is split into several equal-sized entities,
popularly known as ``Baby Bills'' after chairman Bill Gates.
Initially, at least, each of the newly formed rivals would sell the
same software and products while competing against each other on
price and quality of service.
</P>
<P>
   3. Microsoft is broken up into several firms that target
different market segments. Under this plan, one such successor
company could tailor its products to consumers while another might
focus on large business customers. To ensure uniformity, a separate
company also could be formed to guarantee that divergent flavors of
Windows can still run the same basic applications.
</P>
<P>
   4. Microsoft is required to license Windows to its rivals. These
companies would then be free to market enhanced Windows clones that
would compete against Microsoft's ``classic'' version.
</P>
<P>
   5. Microsoft is required to provide detailed programming
``hooks'' into Windows to help its rivals compete. By opening up
the ``source code,'' they would become free to extend the Windows
operating system into such new areas as ``smart'' browsers, voice
or touch-screen commands, and next-generation audio and video
services.
</P>
<P>
   6. Microsoft is forced to ship a version of Windows that strips
away its built-in Internet browser. It could also be obliged to
offer other Windows versions that feature competing browsers.
</P>
<P>
   7. Microsoft is made to change its business practices. One
possibility: It would be barred from striking exclusive licensing
deals or required to publish a price list for its software and
services that would offer all comers the same deal, calling a halt
to current preferences.

<P>
   RUSHOJWA, Uganda _ The carnage in Uganda deepened again Thursday
as investigators unearthed 81 more bodies at the home here of a
member of a doomsday cult. Of the dead, packed tight in a mass
grave dug deeply into red soil, 44 were children.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the fourth day in a row that police here pulled
rotting corpses from the ground, as the death toll since March 17
rose to at least 725, with at least 229 of them being children. The
discoveries now follow a depressing pattern: The bodies, here as
elsewhere, were naked and had been dead for about a month. Some
showed signs of strangulation but many showed no marks at all.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most perplexing for investigators was that neighbors
here _ who live within a few feet of the small hilltop compound
owned by one of the cult elders _ said they saw or heard nothing
that would make them suspect people were being killed. Night
Nalongo, 22, who is married to the nephew of the house's owner,
said she often tried to peek inside because she was suspicious of
the comings and goings of the people who came to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she saw nothing, heard no screams and, until
Thursday, when police dug up the bodies, did not smell rotting
flesh. The house had been empty since the last of the members left
March 15 _ two days before more than 300 cult members, who believed
the world was ending, died in a fire at a church in Kanungu, some
20 miles to the southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they were going to a place where they would be taken
to heaven,'' Nalongo, who did not belong to the cult, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators _ overwhelmed and undertrained for the massive
task before them _ originally said they believed the church deaths
were a mass suicide. But since then, they have uncovered bodies at
three more sites, many of them with cords or banana leaves tied
around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   They are now treating the deaths as murder cases, and say it is
possible the leaders of the cult, the Movement for the Restoration
of the Ten Commandments of God, are still alive. But they have yet
to speculate publicly on how so many people could have been killed
and buried _ with no one apparently knowing about it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview late Wednesday, the Ugandan president, Yoweri
Museveni, said the group had been investigated several times by
local officials, who he said ``sat on'' the reports. ``Some
intelligence officers filed reports saying that this is a dangerous
group but at one level it was not forwarded, it was just ignored,''
Museveni told the BBC in London. He said that he had ordered an
investigation to determine why the reports were not taken more
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, police detained one local official accused of
suppressing those reports, the Rev. Amooti Mutazindwa, an assistant
district commissioner in southwest Uganda suspected of having
strong links to the cult. He was not apparently charged with any
crime, though officials said they hoped he could provide
information on the cult's activities and the whereabouts of any of
its living leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A local official here, Kapere Lauben, said he had initiated an
investigation of the group, in response to people's concerns about
the number of children in the house here without parents and about
the frequent comings and goings of cult members to the house. Most
of them, he said, were women and children. ``Their moves were so
frequent,'' Lauben, the chairman of the area, said. ``You would
find them there today. Tomorrow you would find an empty
household.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he first visited the house last April, asking to speak
with the owners and to see their credentials. He said the cult was
investigated at two higher governmental levels, called the parish
and the sub-county, though he said no action was taken as far as he
knew. ``I didn't see anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The house here, on a hill surrounded by banana trees and fields
for growing vegetables, was owned by Joseph Nyamurinda, described
as an elderly and fervent member of the sect. The grave was
discovered behind the middle of three small buildings, next to a
grove of banana trees.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, police found 3 adult males, 33 women, 27 girls and 17
boys, according to the Ugandan police department's only
pathologist, Thaddeus Barungi. The gender of one body could not be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the main leaders, Credonia Mwerinde _ a woman
who claimed to have visions of the Virgin Mary _ stayed at the
house from time to time, Nalongo said. She also said that Mwerinde
tried to get her to join the cult, but only if she would sell her
property and had more than 250,000 Ugandan shillings, about $175.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that last September, the cult members opened a
small shop in a nearby village, selling their clothes at cheap
prices. Then recently, Nalongo said, they stopped cultivating the
fields, where they normally grew cassava, beans and potatoes.
``They would say, `Now we are going to heaven. There is no need to
dig,''' she said. She also said that a pickup truck often came to
the house in the middle of the night, in January and February,
leading her and others in the village to now believe that the
victims buried here were killed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, after the bodies were reburied in the
grave after quick autopsies, Peter Muhumuza, a nephew of the owner,
locked up the house and spoke briefly about his own tragedy: His
wife Florence and their five children apparently died in the church
fire. He lives and works in the capital city, Kampala, about six
hours away, and said his family joined the cult secretly. He too
said he could not understand how so many people could die without
anyone finding out until now. ``I think they were poisoned,'' he
said. ``You can't kill those people without alarm.''

   KOSOVO-CONGRESS (Washington) _ After two days of often rancorous
debate, the House on Thursday approved a $12.6 billion spending
bill that commits the United States to help train and equip
Colombia's security forces, which are battling drug traffickers and
leftist guerrillas. Lawmakers, by a vote of 263-146, approved the
emergency aid package, which also includes money for the Pentagon
to pay for the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, and for disaster
relief in the Carolinas. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL-SEX-CHARGE (Washington) _ The Army's highest-ranking
woman, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, whose career is often cited as
an example of the expanding opportunities for women in uniform,
filed a sexual harassment complaint against another Army general,
accusing him of groping her in her office in 1996, Pentagon
officials said Thursday. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-COMPARE (Undated) _ George W. Bush likes to say that if
elected president he has no intention of serving as the nation's
education superintendent, dispatching the apparatchiks of the
federal government to play a role that is better left to school
board members. Al Gore suggests that it is teachers, and not
bureaucrats and politicians, who would be empowered and gain
respect in his administration. But whether Bush or Gore is elevated
to the White House in November, the federal government would
parachute behind the closed doors of American classrooms in ways
different from and beyond that of previous presidents. By Jacques
Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SENATE-FUNDRAISING (New York) _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani raised
nearly twice as much money as Hillary Rodham Clinton during the
first three months of this year, bringing his total fund-raising
figure so far to close to $20 million. The latest figures suggest
that Giuliani will significantly outraise and outspend the first
lady in the contest ahead for the U.S. Senate. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   NJ-SENATE-CORZINE (Trenton, N.J.) _ In his race for U.S. Senate,
Jon Corzine has spent millions of dollars to introduce himself to
voters, but on Thursday it suddenly seemed that many in New Jersey
would base their first impression of him not on his record as an
investment banker but on his joking slurs against Italian
Americans, the state's largest ethnic group. As Corzine sought to
put those derogatory references and even his apology for them
behind him on Thursday, Italian American leaders expressed outrage
and asked whether he had the sensitivity to serve in public office.
By David M. Halbfinger.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-GORE (Washington) _ Developing. Vice President Gore
calls for passage of legislation granting permanent residence
status to Elian Gonzalez, his father, stepfather and grandmothers.
Gore says he has always considered the case a custody matter, but
that now ``it appears our immigration laws may not be broad enough
to allow for such an approach in Elian's case.'' By Katharine Q.
Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   NY-POLICE-COMMUNITY (New York) _ From an expression of sympathy
to Patrick Dorismond's family to a wholesale evaluation of when the
police should draw their guns, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his
police commissioner have shifted to a softer tone in an attempt to
ease tensions over the fatal police shooting. Commissioner Howard
Safir met Thursday with Haitian Roman Catholic priests, including
the priest who officiated at Dorismond's funeral on Saturday, which
ended in a violent clash with police. The police commissioner has
also agreed this week to allow clergy from the Bronx to attend roll
calls to give police officers a sense of community concerns. And on
Wednesday he also gave an interview a radio station with a largely
black audience. By Eric Lipton.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS ECONOMY HAS EXTENDED LIFE OF MEDICARE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A vibrant economy has significantly improved the
financial condition of Medicare and Social Security, extending the
life of Medicare's hospital trust fund by eight years, to 2023, the
Clinton administration said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable accomplishment,'' said Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services. ``When this administration
took office, the Medicare trust fund was projected to be depleted
in 1999. We have extended the life of the trust fund a full 24
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore can use the new numbers to his advantage,
as evidence of the administration's record of helping the elderly,
an important and pivotal group of voters, whose traditional
allegiance to the Democratic Party has frayed in the last few
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures will make it easier to add a prescription drug
benefit to medicare, as President Clinton and lawmakers from both
parties want to do. The new estimates will also reduce the
political pressure for cutbacks or radical changes in the structure
of Medicare or Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report says the Social Security trust fund will not
be depleted until 2037, three years later than estimated last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Summers, secretary of the Treasury, said the improved
condition of Social Security and Medicare resulted from ``the
robust expansion of the economy and the continued brightening of
the long-term outlook as a consequence of technological progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final three months of 1999, the American economy grew at
an annual rate of 7.3 percent, the fastest growth rate in nearly 16
years, the government reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine million people get Medicare. More than 152 million
workers are covered under Social Security, and the program pays
benefits to 45 million people each month.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare trust fund has gained 22 years of life just since
1996, when the administration predicted that it would run out of
money in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the change include the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,
which curbed all types of Medicare spending, and a federal
crackdown on Medicare fraud, which has made doctors and hospitals
much more conservative in filing claims. Also, health care prices
have grown at a relatively modest pace, compared with past trends.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said she feared that the good news would invite
complacency, discouraging efforts to ``modernize Medicare.''
Hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and HMO's are already lobbying
Congress to restore money cut from their Medicare payments in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said, ``Today's report should take
the wind out of the sails'' of people who seek to raise the
eligibility age for Social Security or cut benefits in order to
finance risky individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Ball, who worked at the Social Security Administration
for more than three decades and was commissioner from 1962 to 1973,
said, ``Arguments for radical changes in our approach to Social
Security are weakened by today's report.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a
bipartisan fiscal watchdog group, said: ``People will use this
report as an excuse to say we don't really need to move too quickly
on these issues because there's less of an immediate crisis. But
people shouldn't be lulled into thinking that the problem has gone
away. The big problem is still out there. Social Security will
still run cash deficits in the long run.''

 &HT;    SENATORS READY TO MOVE ON RESIDENCY BILL FOR ELIAN
 &HT;    With ELIAN.
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Florida's two senators, Connie Mack and Bob Graham,
said Thursday that if the federal government revokes Elian
Gonzalez's permission to remain in the United States, they were
prepared to press legislation that would grant the boy and his
family permanent U.S. residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Elian's parole is lifted, then we will have to move forward
quickly with the legislation,'' said Mack, a Republican. He was
joined at a Capitol Hill news conference by Graham, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, also sponsored by Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., is
backed by the expected presidential nominees of both major parties.
It was first endorsed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a
Republican, and on Thursday also won the support of Vice President
Al Gore, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said the legislation faces a possible filibuster in the
Senate, but he was hopeful that the backing of Gore and other
officials will help get the 60 votes needed to bring the bill to a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has been introduced in the House by Rep. Bob
Menendez, D-N.J. That bill, introduced Jan. 24, would grant
permanent resident status only to Elian. It has been referred to
the House Judiciary Committee along with a number of other bills
concerning the case, including one that would grant citizenship to
the 6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to President Clinton, Mack urged the
administration to extend Elian's immigration status until all legal
proceedings regarding the child in federal and state courts,
including appeals, were complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department's daily threat to revoke Elian's legal
permission to remain in this country is an outrageous tactic,''
Mack said in the letter to Clinton. ``I am calling on you to stop
the Justice Department's harassment of this family.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Mack argued that Elian's case has turned into a legal
battle over immigration laws, and has lost sight of the issues of
child custody and what is in Elian's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he hoped the case made it to state court and was
examined on the basis of Elian's custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is a decision that needs to be made by someone
experienced in the matter of child custody judgments,'' Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Mack said they did not believe the federal government
should give custody of Elian to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
if he came to the United States on a temporary visa. Graham added
that giving the father custody while awaiting the appeals process
would take the custody decision away from the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Mack expressed his concerns about sending Elian back to Cuba,
saying, ``the boy would disappear from the public eye if allowed to
stay in the United States,'' but would be used as a symbol of
Castro's regime in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while he doesn't doubt love of a father for his
son, he believes that Juan Gonzalez and other Cuban family members
are not acting on their own, but are being influenced by Cuban
government officials.

&HT;     VENTURA SPEAKS FREELY TO CONGRESS ON FREE TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura urged Congress
Thursday not only to approve a bill that would permanently
normalize trade with China but also remove all trade embargoes on
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closed doors don't work,'' he testified before the House Ways
and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura made a strong plea for the lawmakers to back President
Clinton's request that the United States grant China the same low
tariffs it gives most other nations on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
   In a loud, deliberate voice he said granting such status ``is
the biggest economic decision of the 21st century. Please don't
blow it.''
</P>
<P>
   For each of the last 20 years, Congress has reviewed trade
status with China and, after many bitter disputes over Beijing's
poor human rights record, granted the status but only on an annual
basis. Permanent normal status would end Congress' yearly reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, especially Democrats, are under strong pressure to
oppose the China deal from many labor leaders who charge that
American jobs would be lost if trade with Beijing is expanded.
</P>
<P>
   But Ventura argued that boosting trade would not cost Americans
their jobs, citing 44,000 job o &Cx1f; penings in parts of Minnesota that
are now unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see one bit how union jobs are going to leave America
based on a trade relationship with China,'' the governor said.
``It's simply not going to happen and the statistics bear it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura told the committee that the United States does not need
to approve of China's human rights stance in order to continue
trading with its people. The opening of more Chinese markets to
U.S. goods would, over time, instill in the communist nation
American business practices, culture and democratic ideas, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreeing with some Clinton administration officials, Ventura
said China has enough support among World Trade Organization
nations to join the group regardless of whether the United States
backs its admission.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura also insisted that the United States should open trade
with Cuba. He contended that Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's regime
has lasted for four decades because closed trade has shut off U.S.
ideas about democracy from Cuba.
</P>

   He also said America should end embargoes against Cuban
products. ``I'm very tired of feeling like a criminal every time I
want a Cuban cigar,'' Ventura quipped.

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The population of Redmond, Wash., is under the impression that
the U.S. government takes the principles of antitrust rather
seriously. In places like Riyadh and Moscow and Oslo and Mexico
City and Vienna -- where OPEC and other oil producers meet to set
oil prices -- the very notion of U.S. antitrust principles must be
good for a horse laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major categories of behavior covered by the antitrust
laws, alleged misuse of a legally acquired monopoly (the issue in
the Microsoft case) is the murkiest area. Right and wrong are only
somewhat clearer when the issue is corporate mergers.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, when competitors merge it reduces competition.
On the other hand, there may be genuine efficiencies from the
combination that will benefit consumers. The one clear form of
misbehavior is price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   When competitors get together to fix prices or limit supply, you
get the stifled competition with no compensating efficiency. The
Sherman Antitrust Act forbids ``every contract, combination ... or
conspiracy in restraint of trade among the several States or with
foreign nations.'' Price-fixing is illegal ``per se,'' meaning
there's no need to prove harm or any other complication. Violators
can and do go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's big price-fixing case of the moment
involves Sotheby's and Christie's, the two big art auction houses.
The case seems to rest mainly on a suspicious pattern of one
company raising its commissions and the other following a few weeks
later. (It's not even clear what's so suspicious about this. Even
in competitive markets, rivals end up charging the same price when
they sell the same products or services.) The investigation has
been going on since 1997, and no charges have been brought, but the
heads of both firms have been forced to resign. Thank you, Uncle
Sam, for your vigilance in protecting rich art collectors from
excessive fees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Vienna, a price-fixing conspiracy of textbook
purity, involving a commodity that affects everyone, went on
unmolested. Strolling in and out of meetings, the conspirators
talked to reporters like coaches at halftime of a sports event. The
oil minister of the United Arab Emirates told The New York Times,
``We have not discussed all the possibilities and all the
options.''
</P>
<P>
   The Algerian oil minister says, ``I worry about a decline in
demand,'' but adds, ``If there is a consensus, we will support
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What went on in Vienna is flatly felonious behavior that is
lifting billions of dollars from the pockets of American citizens.
It may be beyond the reach of conventional antitrust enforcement,
but it is not beyond all American discipline. If these oil
ministers were bank robbers (``No, we haven't yet decided whether
to go for Chase Manhattan or Commerce Bank of Kansas City ...''),
the government would do more than send a Cabinet secretary like
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to plead for moderation. (``Look,
why not just take out a couple of suburban branches?'')
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, it makes no difference if a price-fixing
conspiracy attempts to raise prices or lower them and whether it
succeeds or fails. Raising prices too high can be self-defeating:
You get more per barrel, but you sell fewer barrels. If OPEC lowers
prices, it does so in search of the ``sweet spot'' where long-term
revenue is maximized. There is no win-win here: The interests of
the price-fixers and the interests of consumers are directly
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   So, Republicans are right to criticize the Clinton
administration for being lackadaisical in its response to the
latest oil heist. But it's pretty comical to hear House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay declare that ``this administration has no
credibility'' in pressuring OPEC to lower prices. No one could have
less credibility on this issue than a Republican politician from
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, when oil prices were dropping, Texas oil
producers screamed and two Republican administrations
not-too-subtly begged OPEC to get its act together and charge more.
A young oil man named George W. Bush was quoted in the Times hoping
for a bit of ``stability'' (code word then for higher prices, as it
is now for lower prices). George W.'s father took this nation to
war to save Saudi Arabia and Kuwait from Saddam Hussein, and didn't
make any effort to use that fairly impressive bit of leverage to
break up OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit hard to believe that Bush the younger, DeLay,
Majority Leader Dick Armey (also from Texas), and J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma (who completes the House leadership triumvirate) are
really so unhappy about the tripling of oil costs in the past year.
Certainly their most influential constituents are not. All they
have actually done about it, except to criticize President Clinton
for not doing enough, is to produce one of those empty bills with a
Canute-like title.
</P>
<P>
   This one's called the Oil Price Reduction Act. It operates like
the Chocolate Cake Has No Calories Act and the Dick Morris Goes
Away for Good Act. That is, it allows you to say you've voted for
it -- next problem? The Republicans even bagged their silly effort
to repeal the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax enacted in 1993,
possibly because it dawned on them that this was Part 2 of an
increase started by President Bush Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Are we serious about our antitrust principles or are we not? Do
we care that a price-fixing conspiracy is draining tens of billions
of dollars from our economy, or are we quietly just as pleased
since members of a powerful political interest group -- domestic
oil producers -- are ancillary beneficiaries?
</P>
<P>
   If we do care, we should make clear that we regard OPEC as a
criminal conspiracy, even if there are limits to what we can do
about it. We should find someone meaner than Bill Richardson to
deliver the message -- Louis Freeh perhaps. We should tell Norway
this is not what friends are for. We should tell Russia we don't
give aid to nations that are ripping us off. We should tell Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia that they get the Nobel Prize for ingratitude and
don't come crying to us the next time a local bully starts picking
on them. We should tell all these oil ministers they're subject to
arrest the next time they land in America and think they're heading
for the nearest Hotel Inter-Continental.
</P>
<P>
   If we're serious.

THE GHOSTS OF MOUNT RAINIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT RAINIER, Wash. _ They are entombed by glacial ice, hidden
in towering, snow-covered forests, shrouded in mystery dense as
alpine clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of 65 men lie unrecovered in Mount Rainier National
Park _ fully a fifth of the 323 who have died in the park since it
was established a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of Mount Rainier belong to a fraternity whose
membership is based on geography, misfortune and circumstance. Some
courted danger, some were oblivious to risk, and some never
bargained on landing on a 14,411-foot mountain in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Several were Boeing Co. engineers. Almost half of them were
Marines who boarded a Curtiss Commando transport plane bound for
Seattle 54 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Six of them were named Bill. Three were named Duane.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of them died alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is the free-lance photographer who set off on a
picturesque hike near the eastern edge of the park in 1997. There
is the medical-school graduate from Plains, Ga., who sneaked in an
afternoon of snowboarding last year, two days before he was to
start his residency in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There are the erudite New York City birdwatcher, the
light-hearted Port Orchard skier, and the Hatfield, Pa., climber
who paused under an ice cliff in 1981 _ and died moments later with
10 others in the nation's worst mountaineering accident.
</P>
<P>
   They remain buried despite massive search-and-recovery efforts,
despite summer snowmelts, despite churning rivers of ice that move
boxcar-sized slabs down the mountain like an imperceptible conveyor
belt. Victims of nature or human error, they are enmeshed in the
physical landscape of the park and their stories and names are a
part of its lore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them died without leaving a clue to their whereabouts
and few are ever expected to be unearthed from the slopes of a
volcano that Tulalip tribal culture compares to an ill-tempered
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Rainier collects its own memories,'' observes avid
hiker and writer Bruce Barcott.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Rainier and outdoors enthusiasts such as Barcott rightly
tout the lush valleys, expansive snowfields and lofty peaks of the
wilderness that spreads across Pierce and Lewis counties. Awed,
they point out the grandeur of its 25 glaciers and the austerity of
its summit steam caves.
</P>
<P>
   But danger parallels beauty in a park where a popular vista
carries the name Paradise, and where treacherous cliffs bear the
name of Doug Vercoe, a man who fell from them.
</P>
<P>
   The glaciers and the heavy snowfall that creates them are key
reasons so many of Rainier's dead are unrecovered. Deep fissures,
called crevasses, open and close as glacial ice slowly moves down
the mountainside. Also, heavy snows, avalanches and the general
ruggedness of the terrain make discovery _ and recovery _
enormously difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the years dull the keen edge of your grief, perhaps you
will come to agree with the families of the 32 Marines who lie in
the South Tahoma Glacier, that he could not have a more
magnificently beautiful resting place,'' park Superintendent
Preston Macy wrote to the grieving mother of a snowshoer who
vanished above Paradise in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sentiment that resonates with Barcott, author of the
recent book, ``Measure of a Mountain: Beauty and Terror on Mount
Rainier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that is more hallowed and sacred about
Rainier that, in my mind, would make it psychologically easier to
think that someone had died (there) and not been found,'' he said.
``You'd be remembered in a way that you probably wouldn't be in the
Olympics or someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   But some relatives of the dead, who cling to hopes that the
mountain will one day reveal the bodies of their loved ones, take
little solace in its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never call it a closed book or chapter until they have a
burial like all the other average Americans,'' wrote a Kansas City
mother of a Marine killed in the 1946 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us the same thing, that if Joseph had to go, he
could not have chosen a more breathtaking place,'' recalls
Elizabeth Wood, whose son vanished last July while hiking toward
Mildred Point in the southwest corner of the park. ``But not
knowing what happened is the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Rainier's mysteries, Wood's disappearance last year is among
the most puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike snowshoer Lowell Linn, who set off down the mountain in a
blizzard, or skier Jim Kampe, who marched upward in a whiteout,
birdwatcher Joe Wood walked along a steeply sloping ridge in
perfect weather.
</P>
<P>
   He'd stolen away from a journalism conference in Seattle to see
the mountain goats, wildflowers and birds usually visible from Van
Trump Park in late June and early July.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, his friends alerted authorities when he failed
to show up to work at a New York City publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   By that point neither bloodhounds nor hundreds of volunteer
searchers could pinpoint where he strayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost people before that we have never found, but they
were always isolated incidents,'' said park ranger Rick Kirschner.
``Last year we lost one, two, three, four, five, six people and
only found two. ... it was a total feeling of `Are we doing
something wrong here, are we missing some clues?' It was really a
tough year for the rangers and for the families. No resolution for
any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Few understand the pain of mourning for Rainier's hidden victims
better than Kirschner.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the National Park Service, his signature can be
found at the bottom of scores of incident reports detailing
searches for missing and injured park visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by climbers whose bodies have never been located, he
carries around a tattered photocopied list of the belongings and
physical description of Kampe, the skier who schussed into a
whiteout on the Muir Snowfield a decade ago. A 5-inch wedge of
metal Kirschner spied at the bottom of a river basin a few years
ago sits in his office. It turned out to be a piece of the Marine
airplane that crashed in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, Kirschner speculates about what happened to
Wood, Kampe, photographer Chet Hansen, and climbing partners Chris
Hartonas and Raymond Vakili.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago park regular Gordon Thompson took a ski trip on
the mountain with Kampe and two other friends.
</P>
<P>
   Kampe ranged ahead of the other three in whiteout conditions,
and when the weather forced the others to turn back, they lost
contact with him. When the weather cleared, searchers found no
trace.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson still has a map from the search of Kampe's last known
location with an X marked near Wild Woman Rocks and a notation,
``Jim Kampe last seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old moth-eaten, U.S. Geological 7-minute topo map.
It's falling apart,'' Thompson says ruefully. ``It's not as if I'm
constantly thinking of Jim, but when I'm there or when I think of
somebody going missing, I think about him and where he is and I
think about the search effort and the job the rangers did
searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always second-guessing yourself, wondering what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner knows the feeling: ``The answer is usually the same
all around: You just don't know,'' he says solemnly as he peers
over a map of the 378-square-mile park.
</P>
<P>
   But off the top of his head, and without consulting the reams of
documents cataloging fatalities on Rainier since 1887, he can plot
most of the bodies the mountain has kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vercoe would be in a crevasse on the Cowlitz Glacier,''
Kirschner says, pointing to a white swath where gravity would have
dragged Vercoe when the cornice, or ice ledge, he was standing on
fell and triggered a massive avalanche. ``Allen Douglas, here in
the Carbon River area. A trail crew found his pack hanging from the
back of a tree near the Ispet Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Taylor would be here, somewhere, below Success Cleaver,''
he adds, marking a long rib of crumbling volcanic rock that rises
more than 7,000 feet from the base of Pyramid Peak to Point
Success.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to 23-year-old park ranger David Taylor, a Wooster,
Ohio, native who disappeared on the morning of Nov. 18, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He and fellow ranger Carl Fabiani were trying to become the
first climbers to summit by way of the Success Cleaver route in the
wintertime. They were unroped as they retreated from avalanches,
heavy snow and fog on the seldom-climbed route.
</P>
<P>
   As they descended to 9,500 feet, Taylor disappeared in snow
flurries. Once the visibility improved, Fabiani couldn't find
Taylor. He took shelter under rocks that night and rose early the
next morning to continue to search for his companion, whom he
described as a strong, resourceful climber. Then Fabiani spent the
next 40 hours climbing off the treacherous cleaver, crossing two
glaciers and trekking through woods to the west side of the
mountain and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers picked up the fruitless search. When they returned to
the Paradise ranger station, their whiskers and eyebrows were
frosted with snow and their parkas and packs armored in rime ice.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's father and stepmother had holed up at Longmire for
several days, waiting for the good news that rescuers found their
son.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers delivered the discouraging word instead.
</P>
<P>
   The message went something like what then-Superintendent Macy
wrote to an insurance company in the late '50s about Lowell Linn:
</P>
<P>
   ``To date the search has been futile. ... We have no reason to
doubt that the body is up there; we simply have been unable to find
it. In that rugged terrain one could walk within a few feet of it
without seeing it if it were wedged between large rocks or in a
snow or ice crevasse. There are also many places a body could have
become buried. The possibility of finding it in the near future is
becoming more remote every day. We have found no authentic clues,
but will continue a systematic search of all possible areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Working on a mountain that has its own weather system, where
harsh conditions move in without warning, Kirschner has had to pen
more than a few letters like this himself.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally, closure comes to a glacier.
</P>
<P>
   It did half a world away in 1991, when hikers discovered the
so-called ``Iceman from the Similaun.'' The remarkably
well-preserved Bronze Age hunter was found sticking out of the
glacier at about 10,000 feet in Austria's Tyrolean mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Last August it happened again in British Columbia's
Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Wilderness Park, nearly 1,000 miles
north of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters there stumbled over the equally well-preserved body of a
4,000-year-old man uncovered by a melting glacier.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists think the hunter died as a result of being wedged in
a tight ice crack _ like Jim Tuttle, who fell into a crevasse
during a summit climb on Mount Rainier's Ingraham Glacier in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Rainier is no different from the Austrian Alps or the mountains
of Northern Canada. Sometimes it, too, gives up its dead.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, lead climbing ranger Mike Gauthier watched in dismay
as a minute-long avalanche rumbled over the area where a skier had
fallen to his death hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   If weather conditions had been poor or avalanches continued on
the notorious Thermogenesis route, a 4,000-foot snow and ice gully
prone to frequent slides, David Mattias Perrson could easily have
remained buried there.
</P>
<P>
   But fair conditions allowed two military Chinook helicopters to
fly in before dawn with rangers who investigated a bloodstained
field of snow for the body of the Vancouver, B.C. man.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning arrived and the warmth of sunlight began the
melting process that often precedes avalanches, the rangers
considered calling off the search.
</P>
<P>
   Just then Gauthier's partner picked up a signal from the radio
Perrson carried. Homing in on the transmission, they found Perrson
buried under nearly a foot of snow and ice. After extricating his
body, they secured him into a chest harness and clipped it to a
rope attached to a helicopter hovering above.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the sunrise splash onto the Willis Wall, Gauthier knew
the rescue could have ended differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an underlying tone, almost a drone, that was the
background of knowing we (had gone) into a dangerous situation to
try to find the body of a man who died doing what most of us do for
fun, and try to give his family some closure,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Closure came seven years late for relatives of Julie Fillo.
</P>
<P>
   Fillo, a 20-year-old park employee, began a 19-mile hike along
the Cowlitz Divide portion of the Wonderland Trail on the sunny
Sunday morning of June 30, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   When she didn't show up for work two days later, her colleagues,
friends and relatives launched an aerial and foot search.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1984 that a late summer melt revealed a tattered
sleeping bag and a grouping of bones near a little-visited
waterfall on a branch of Needle Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner hurried to the site. He wasn't sure who the remains
belonged to until he noticed a glint of metal on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was a silver-topped green ballpoint pen, inscribed with the
words, Fillo Sales &AMP; Engineering Co., St. Louis, Mo. 63119. One
mystery had been solved.
</P>
<P>
   Another was resolved in 1992 with the discovery of a plane that
crashed in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner came across the fuselage the way Rainier's remains are
usually discovered _ by happenstance during a pleasure hike in the
park. He was trekking across a ridge with his wife when she spotted
a blue item in the snow below. His curiosity was piqued because it
was the general area where Kampe was believed to have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner returned the next day and climbed down to find the
item was a recently discarded plastic tarp. While he was down on
the valley floor with a colleague, he noticed another blue item
further afield. A few days later, while riding in an army plane
during a rescue drill, he asked the pilot to swing over the second
blue item. It also turned out to be insignificant, but as they
passed, he and the pilot spied what appeared to be an airplane
fuselage and wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plane was news to me. We had never even been aware that
it crashed in the park,'' he said. Down at the crash site,
Kirschner found bones in a boot still pressed on the foot pedal
inside the cockpit. Nearby, searchers uncovered an engraved ring.
From the tail N-number, park officials learned the plane had gone
missing 20 years earlier, in 1972, with three car dealers from
Spokane on board.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation officials had never guessed the plane might have
crashed in the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that there are planes that we haven't found,
people who we don't even know are missing,'' says Kirschner. ``But
my own gut feeling is that we'll find at least a couple of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday.

TURKEY'S DEBATE OVER PRESIDENT SEEN AS THREAT TO STABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit boarded a
plane Thursday to begin a state visit to India, he left behind a
country that suddenly seemed on the edge of political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am in India, I shall reflect on many things, including
the continuation of the government,'' Ecevit said before departing.
``Let everyone think about that for the next four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit's warning followed a turbulent session of Turkey's
Parliament that lasted into the pre-dawn hours Thursday. The
session was called to consider a constitutional amendment that
would allow President Suleyman Demirel to serve another five years
in office, but it dissolved into a partisan battle that may bode
ill for the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
   It also opened up new possibilities for change in a country
where the political elite is widely viewed as highly conservative.
Ecevit had argued that Demirel, 75, should be re-elected because he
is ``a factor for stability,'' but Turks appear more eager for
change than stability. There was no public pressure on members of
Parliament, who choose Turkey's president, to support Demirel, and
Thursday, with his prospects suddenly in doubt, there were no signs
of regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Demirel will withdraw,'' predicted one of his oldest
political allies, Husamettin Cindoruk, a former speaker of
parliament, in an interview. ``He is an experienced statesman.
Parliament has shown its will, and he will not resist it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a crisis of stability in Turkey, but there is a
crisis of democracy,'' Cindoruk said. ``The system is in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Ecevit took power as prime minister last May at the head
of a delicately balanced left-right coalition, Turkey has had its
first stable government in years. The government has presided over
a virtual end to the long war with Kurdish rebels, won enactment of
economic reforms, and persuaded the European Union to name Turkey
an official candidate for membership.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks Ecevit has been warning that the end of Demirel's term
threatened to upset all that his government has achieved. He fears
that if a way is not found to keep Demirel in office, the scramble
to succeed him will release political passions that he has so far
managed to control.
</P>
<P>
   Because the constitution requires Demirel to step down when his
single seven-year term expires in May, a constitutional amendment
must be passed if he is to stay in office. Ecevit proposed such an
amendment in Parliament on Wednesday, hoping that it would win the
367 votes necessary for a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendment failed by a wide margin, winning only 253
votes. If it fails in a second vote next week, it will be dead and
Demirel will have to give up the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Various power blocs in Parliament evidently have their own
reasons for opposing the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic-oriented politicians say they will support it only if it
is accompanied by legal changes that would make it harder to close
political parties and ban people from public office. Their own
party is facing closure, and several of its leaders have been given
jail terms and political bans for making speeches that were
considered subversive.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the far-right party that is Ecevit's coalition
partner do not seem worried by the prospect that a bitter race to
succeed Demirel could bring down the government. They believe they
would emerge stronger from new elections, perhaps strong enough to
take over the government themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Parliament of Kurdish origin have vowed never
to support Demirel because of what they say is his hostility to
Kurdish aspirations. And groups backing ambitious politicians
apparently hope that in a deadlock, their favored figures might
have a chance to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been trying for a long time to protect political and
economic stability, but I am concerned about this now,'' Ecevit
said before leaving for India. ``I hope those who voted against the
amendment will think about what they are doing.''

GLACIERS _ AND ENTOMBED BODIES _ SLOWLY SLIDING DOWN RAINIER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOUNT RAINIER, Wash. _ It might seem like magic if the remains
of two mountain climbers who vanished atop Mount Rainier almost a
century ago were to reappear at the base of one of its glaciers a
decade from now.
</P>
<P>
   But to glaciologists, the phenomenon would be pure science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that hypothetically, they could come out,''
hydrologist Carolyn Driedger says of climbers Joseph W. Stevens and
T.Y. Callaghan.
</P>
<P>
   Driedger, who works for the U.S. Geological Survey, is an expert
on the history of Rainier's 25 glaciers. She has spent a career
studying the seemingly unchanging structures that have dominated
the Puget Sound landscape for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Like the thousands of glaciers sprinkled around the world,
Rainier's glaciers are flowing, organic entities.
</P>
<P>
   Their movements are the reason Stevens and Callaghan, last seen
Aug. 14, 1909, as they approached the summit from the 12,660-foot
Gibraltar Rock, could eventually re-emerge thousands of feet lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glaciers creep downward like cold molasses moving downhill,''
Driedger said from her office inside the Cascades Volcano
Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Gravity is the main reason for the movement. So are the vast
amounts of snow that fall on the higher slopes of Rainier each
year. As new snowfall covers previously fallen snow and ice,
gravity drags the snow downward along the slope.
</P>
<P>
   When a body or a piece of climbing equipment falls into a crack
in the glacier's surface, known as a crevasse, it becomes part of
the flowing motion, explained Terri Mathews, an instructor in
geology at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that falls into the glacier will be carried along
until it reaches the end of the glacier,'' Mathews said. ``This may
take years.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaciologists have developed mathematical formulas to find out
when an object left on the summit surface would emerge near the
terminus, or snout, of a glacier. Based on the surface slope,
thickness of ice and the pressure the ice exerts on rockbed, the
formulas offer an estimate not unlike the one rangers made in 1909,
when Stevens and Callaghan disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan, an experienced woodsman from Oregon, and Stevens, a
vacationing contractor from Trenton, N.J., vanished during a
blizzard as they made their way without a guide to Camp Misery, at
the foot of Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather cleared, searchers discovered the pair's
alpenstocks and packs. Not far away, they found tracks leading over
shale rock near the crater and down the edge of a stomach-churning
ice cliff at the head of the White River Glacier, now known as
Ingraham Glacier. Park rangers surmised the two fell off the cliff,
possibly into a deep crevasse.
</P>
<P>
   Using a formula that predicted 10 inches of daily movement along
the six-mile-long glacier, rangers predicted the climbers'
ice-encased bodies would remain frozen until they arrived at the
snout 102 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' family so strongly believed the prediction that they
posted a $500 reward for the eventual recovery of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Driedger called the 90-year-old estimate ``pretty
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the math and it is quite possible they're in the lower
part of the terminus now, still in the ice or thawed. Seventy to
100 years is a real good estimate without having measured the
velocity of the glacier.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers could have been expected to recover some of the remains
in the 1980s if the men had fallen onto the glacier's surface and
been covered with snow.
</P>
<P>
   But bodies of climbers who tumble into crevasses take much
longer to emerge from the solid ice that makes up much of a
glacier's structure, Driedger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside a crevasse is a really drippy place. There's a lot of
water there. An object there is going to be subject to more ice,
more freezing and melting, than an object on the surface. And it
won't move downward at the same velocity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of 11 climbers killed in an icefall in 1981 may
illustrate the different velocities of glacial movement. Some of
those who were plowed under by truck-sized chunks of ice beneath
the Ingraham Falls landed inside a deep crevasse that filled with
rushing snow and ice. Others killed in the ice avalanche remained
on the surface of the slope.
</P>
<P>
   The personal effects and remains of the latter group could
resurface sooner than the former group, and more quickly than the
climbers lost in 1909, Driedger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fell in just above the equilibrium line, or the level on
the glacier to which the annual snowfall melts, so they're going to
come out to the surface before someone who went into the summit,''
she explained. ``But the actual `when' isn't clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Glacial movement, while imperceptible to the naked eye, has been
charted at Rainier for nearly 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma City Light Co. first began recording the movement of
Rainier's southern-facing Nisqually Glacier, now one of the most
studied glaciers in the world, in 1931. The power company's goal
was rooted in an interest in hydroelectric power, but its data has
helped scientists measure how the glacier has moved through the
years.
</P>
<P>
   During May 1970, the glacier was measured moving as fast as 29
inches per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has gone out and measured the velocity of other
glaciers, so they apply the lessons of Nisqually and use an average
of 10 inches a day,'' Driedger said. ``That's what they did in
1909.''

RAINIER: `GOD'S MONUMENT' TO 32 MARINES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last half-hour, the pilot had been navigating solely by
instrument. Fog had completely obscured his view. And now it was
growing dark and the wings were icing over.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Marine pilots flying into the fog, heavy snow and
high winds that afternoon, Dec. 10, 1946, had turned back.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Robert V. Reilly, who had been flying for the Marines for
five years, pushed on. He radioed for permission to go higher than
9,000 feet, hoping for better conditions above the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was 30 miles south of Toledo, Wash., and would be
landing his twin-engine R5C in Seattle in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 70-mph winds had pushed the transport plane east. He
was somewhere around Randle, a town 63 miles east of Toledo in the
foothills of the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, his two crew members and 29 passengers were headed
straight for Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   The passengers, mostly fresh-faced Marines just out of boot
camp, had been assigned to this plane because they came at the end
of the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Simmons Jr. of Kalama, Wash., for example. Keith Tische
of Marne, Mich. Duane Edwin White of Ottawa, Kan. Like Simmons,
most of them were 18 and six months out of high school. Some had
never flown before. A few, like Simmons, were pilots themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Most were on their way to Seattle _ a 6-hour, non-stop flight
from San Diego _ to be assigned to a base.
</P>
<P>
   Six planes _ sturdy transports, each capable of flying 36
passengers and 4 tons of cargo 1,500 miles without stopping _ were
making the trip that Tuesday morning. Reilly's plane, R5C 39528,
was the second to take off.
</P>
<P>
   His plane was said to be transporting the official records for
all the Marines being reassigned in Seattle. Simmons had teased a
friend before leaving San Diego that he was on the higher-ranking
plane _ the one with all the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, who had just been chosen for officer training school,
was on furlough, headed to Kalama to surprise his parents and
sisters for Christmas. His father had given him $50 for a bus
ticket to come home the following week, but Simmons went Christmas
shopping with the money, then caught a free ride to Seattle aboard
the transport plane.
</P>
<P>
   He was bringing his 11-year-old sister a friendship bracelet. He
had bought his father a flight jacket. He had posed for portraits
in his dress blues and was giving his mother a fancy photograph of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was rough, noisy and very cold. When the plane
reached northern Oregon, a storm from the northwest required Reilly
to fly by instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, 29, was no stranger to difficult flying conditions.
During the war, he had been based in Guam. He'd been a glider
pilot, test pilot and commander of a special weapons division.
</P>
<P>
   Although four other Marine planes turned back and landed in
Portland, Reilly and another pilot, flying at 12,500 feet,
continued on.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:13 p.m., Reilly made a routine radio check with the Toledo
range station. He said he was 30 miles south. He said ice was
forming on the leading edges of the wings. He asked permission to
fly higher than 9,000 feet _ a normal request for a plane that
typically flies at 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   About 4:15, residents of Longmire and Paradise in Mount Rainier
National Park reported hearing a plane struggle.
</P>
<P>
   By 4:30, Reilly was supposed to have radioed the Civil
Aeronautics Administration in Everett. Navy, Army and civilian
stations called frantically, trying to reach him. His plane was due
to land at Sand Point Naval Air Station at 5:06 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   No one heard from the plane again.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   The missing Marine plane was the top story in the Longview Daily
News the next day. Leslie Ray Simmons Sr. read the story and
learned the plane was coming from El Toro Marine Air Station near
San Diego, where his son was based. He wondered aloud about the
possibility that Leslie Jr. was aboard. That would be just like
Leslie, he told his 11-year-old daughter, to come home early and
not tell his family.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons dismissed the idea because he knew his son was coming by
bus the following week.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible news arrived the next day. Edrie Simmons was at
home alone when the phone rang. Her son had been aboard R5C 39528.
Search teams were looking on Mount Rainier, but they had no idea
what had happened to the plane.
</P>
<P>
   In the next eight days, 10 feet of snow fell on Mount Rainier,
and heavy rains flooded Longmire and the lowlands. Army and Coast
Guard units couldn't search by air. Rangers were unable to cover
much ground because of blizzards.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the missing men held out hope that the plane had
landed, not crashed, and that the Marines were holed up somewhere
until the weather broke. Marines, after all, were tough. They were
skilled in survival techniques. If anyone could survive the
conditions, they could.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, crackpots were stomping painful messages in the
mountain's snow. ``We're all right,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   When two weeks of searches had produced nothing, a Boy Scout
Explorer post hiked the Carbon Glacier on Mount Rainier's north
side, looking for remnants of the plane. Meanwhile, Army and Navy
units, having combed the area between Toledo and Mount Rainier,
began an intensive aerial search of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Search efforts were scaled back in late December. Officials said
snow would have covered any signs of an aircraft. They promised
they'd begin looking again in the summer, when some of the snow had
melted.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Simmons had last seen her big brother in October. He'd
brought her a wallet, engraved with her name, for her 11th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Now everything was different. She didn't understand why her
mother always cringed when the phone rang. Or why Leslie _ who had
skied and wrestled and hiked and flown airplanes, who had packed
her school lunches and bossed her around, who had carried her on
his shoulders when he skied down the slopes _ couldn't come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember lying in bed thinking: `I'll never get to see
him again,''' the little sister, now Carolyn Pope, said recently.
``For a child, that's quite a realization.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Margaret Reilly was too young to understand even that. She
was 14 months old when her father's plane went down. He was
supposed to begin holiday leave that week. The family of three was
driving to St. Paul, Minn., his hometown, for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mary Margaret and her mom spent the holidays waiting
for word on her dad. Within a month, Reilly's wife learned she was
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   For many of the families, time stopped when the plane went down.
In February, two months after the plane disappeared, one mother
wrote of her anguish trying to reconcile the prevailing opinion
that her son was dead with the feeling that he might be out there
somewhere, needing her help.
</P>
<P>
   She asked rangers whether the Marines could be in one of the
ranger cabins on the mountain. ``My son cries to me to save him,
and I'm helpless in the face of all this,'' she wrote. ``We think
of them constantly and everything is stopped here til we do have
some trace of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The families offered a $5,000 reward for finding the plane.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1947, ranger Bill Butler, hiking on his day off,
discovered wreckage nine or 10 miles into his hike on Mount
Rainier's southwest side.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items found immediately were a Marine's health
records, fragments of a uniform and legible service records. They
identified the plane as the missing Marine transport and confirmed
the worst accident in Mount Rainier's history.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the plane, traveling 195 mph, likely struck
the cliff near the top of a glacier and crashed. Parts of the plane
were scattered over a quarter-mile, at about 8,500 feet on the
South Tahoma Glacier. There was no evidence it had burned.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons' father and cousin and several other Marine families
went to the mountain to watch the recovery efforts, and the Navy
flew four of the mothers over Mount Rainier, giving them a fairly
close view of the South Tahoma Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, someone spotted other pieces of the plane
more than a mile up the glacier, below Point Success. The wreckage,
covered by snow in July, was just emerging from the melting snow
and ice in mid-August. South Tahoma Glacier, 4 miles long and with
deep crevasses, had swallowed most everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers and Navy officers surveyed the scene and reported
recovery impossible without loss of life. A few family members
refused to accept that recommendation; some asked for a second
assessment by armed service and civilian mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officers complied, assembling 16 expert search-and-recovery
climbers in late August. As the group approached the site,
``boulders the size of a small house with the velocity of artillery
shells'' came down with a roar, a Navy officer reported. The slide
missed them by inches.
</P>
<P>
   Dodging rocks constantly, they found 11 decomposing bodies. The
crew was compressed in the twisted wreckage of the nose. Seven men
were still strapped to their seats, their lower bodies encased in
ice. The other 21 were so entangled in the wreckage or completely
imbedded in ice that they could not be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The men had died in an instant, the searchers determined. But
attempting to excavate the bodies would require as many as 75
people and days of digging in treacherous conditions. The searchers
considered the alternatives: attempt recovery of all remains; bury
the plane and bodies by dropping a bomb on the icefall above the
wreck; cremate the bodies by dropping napalm bombs; leave
everything and let nature take over.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuation of all bodies, they said, would be impossible.
Removing even a few would cause more deaths and could be delayed
indefinitely because of fog and snow. Dropping a bomb on the
icefall would affect a huge part of the mountain because the peak
was so badly disintegrated. And cremating the remains went against
the religious beliefs of some family members.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a Marine mantra _ Marines never leave their wounded
or dead behind _ they recommended leaving the men on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no predatory animals at this altitude and insects,
such as blowflies, cannot survive the cold nights, hence the mortal
remains of these men will not be molested,'' one of the rangers
wrote. ``If the wreckage and the bodies are not completely covered
by rock falls within a few days, they will definitely be covered by
15 to 25 feet of snow which will start to fall at that altitude
early in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``By next spring, this snow will be compressed into several feet
of glacier ice and there should be no visible evidence of this
tragedy left.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Marine families, unwilling for anyone to die trying to
recover the remains of their loved ones, agreed with the
recommendation. Eight families officially requested that recovery
efforts cease, that the men be buried together, and that the
glacier be closed to all traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August 1947, rangers and Navy officers removed as many
personal belongings as possible, then moved 11 bodies a short
distance from the wreck site. They were placed side by side on the
ice and covered with snow and ice.
</P>
<P>
   A few parents couldn't accept leaving their sons on the mountain
and tried to hire professional climbers to bring out the remains.
No one took their offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why couldn't they tunnel in this ice?'' one mother wrote from
the Midwest. ``Falling rocks then would pass on over. A cable
hanging from an airplane seems reasonable, with a hook and the
bodies socked in heavy canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote repeatedly, suggesting ways to recover her son's body.
``I think the rainfall will wash those bodies out of there or
loosen them so that huge icebergs may fall. ... I can never call it
a closed book or chapter until they have a burial like all other
average Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Another mother answered her. Why insist on recovering the body?
asked Ida Tische, whose son, Keith, was on the plane. ``Since he
must lie some place, why not leave him at rest on (the Marines')
mountainside, above the flower-bedecked slopes where the deer graze
quietly, and where the towering peak of Mount Rainier is God's own
monument to him and his companions?''
</P>
<P>
   The families tried to give the $5,000 reward to Bill Butler, the
ranger who found the plane. He refused it, saying he wouldn't
profit from their tragedy. So they bought him a Swiss watch.
</P>
<P>
   Family members also chipped in for a stone memorial on Round
Pass, facing South Tahoma Glacier. On Aug. 24, 1947, Marines and
family members gathered there for a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reilly's wife and daughter couldn't attend. That was the
day Robert Reilly II was born.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   The flowers began arriving in September 1947. Every month,
Rolland and Ida Tische sent a bouquet to the Mount Rainier National
Park administration building in memory of their son.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the families, so grateful to Butler for finding the
plane and the spot where their sons were buried, kept in touch with
the ranger for years. The parents became a support group. Edrie
Simmons was the unofficial secretary. She brought flowers to the
annual memorials. She made a scrapbook of everything related to the
crash. And when, in 1980, the park considered reopening South
Tahoma Glacier to climbers, she led lobbying efforts _ successfully
_ to keep out the curious.
</P>
<P>
   About seven years ago, rangers found pieces of the Marine
plane's fuselage miles from the crash site. The glacier, a mass of
ice that flows downward, splitting open and closing again as the
ice melts, then freezes, had spit one 5-inch piece of gray metal
into Tahoma Creek. Another, larger piece showed up by the Nisqually
River at the park boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, glaciologists say, the plane and the remains of
the Marines will move through the glacier, part of the mountain.
Metal and bones, having been ground among the ice and rocks for
decades, are unlikely to be recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Christmas cards exchanged among the Marine
relatives, already dwindling, will have stopped. Carolyn Simmons
Pope, a former flight attendant who is now 64, has inherited the
scrapbook, the names and addresses of Marine families, the interest
in keeping the memories alive. Not just for her brother, an
extraordinary athlete and pilot who ``had everybody convinced
planes were safer than cars,'' Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   The story _ the mountain's greatest tragedy _ is important for
the branches of 31 other families, for Marines, for anyone
interested in Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   xxx
</P>
<P>
   Mary Margaret Reilly, the 14-month-old toddler who lost her
father in the crash, is now a 54-year-old grandmother. For nearly
50 years, she didn't know the other Marine families were meeting
every year for memorial services. She, her mother and little
brother had moved a year after the crash, and a few years after
that, her mother remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, now Mary Greene, has read everything she can find about
her father's flight, the crash, the search for the plane. She knows
the bodies of the crew were identified and wonders what happened to
her father's dog tags. She knows now that her father was pilot of
the plane, not its co-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   She also knows that one of the other crew members had a wife and
four children. She doesn't know the names of those children or how
she'd find them, but she wants to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   At the 50th anniversary service in 1996, she introduced herself
to some of the families. She met a former Marine who had known her
father, who remembered him as a fun guy, a nice guy. The people on
that plane were just kids, she said. ``So many kids on that
airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, she and her brother attended the dedication of the
new Marine Memorial in Enumclaw. The original one overlooking South
Tahoma Glacier is inaccessible _ except to backpackers willing to
hike 4.5 miles _ because the road washed out several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Rainier detachment of the Marine Corps League agreed
in 1998 to duplicate the original. A couple gave the league a
10,000-pound rock, much like the one on the mountain. A crane
operator moved it, gratis, to Veterans Memorial Park, overlooking
Mount Rainier. League members themselves carved the rock to make a
flat face for the plaque.
</P>
<P>
   At the service Aug. 21, 1999, Jack Warren, adjutant of the Mount
Rainier detachment, talked about his fallen comrades and the
circumstances of their crash. He unveiled the new monument, then
called roll for the 32 who died.
</P>
<P>
   Warren had asked family members and friends to shout ``YO!''
when he read the name of their loved one. Silence followed 27
names.
</P>
<P>
   As has always been the case, Carolyn Pope was there to yell when
Leslie Simmons' name was called. But this time, Mary Greene and her
brother were there, too, to shout when they heard their father's
name.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reilly II carried a white carnation to the foot of the
monument, to honor the father he never knew.
</P>
<P>
   And then he and the other family members stood silently as
Marines fired a 21-gun salute and a band played taps.

   GERMAN-IDENTITY (Berlin) _ On the western facade of the
Reichstag is an old inscription: ``Dem Deutschen Volke'' _ ``To the
German People.'' But just how charged and divisive those words are
has been revealed by an outcry over a proposed work of art for the
refurbished parliamentary building. The problem, as usual in this
country, is who Germans are. Are they still a ``Volk?'' The word
was debased by Hitler with his clamor of ``Fuhrer, Volk und
Vaterland'' and further tarnished by the pervasive ``Volkspolizei''
of the East German Communist dictatorship. With 7 million
foreigners in their midst, have Germans moved beyond a ``Volkisch''
appreciation of nationality to a more embracing view of the German
soul? That is the central question posed by the work that Hans
Haacke, a German artist living in New York, has proposed for the
northern courtyard of the Reichstag. Above a trough filled with
earth from throughout Germany would appear the illuminated words
``Der Bevolkerung'' - ``To the Population.'' By Roger Cohen.

 &HT;    Guns have paid off nicely for Bush
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At sun-up in an open field near Houston in 1994, in a photo op
aimed at becoming governor of Texas, George W. Bush learned how
guns can backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, ostensibly after dove but really hunting for publicity,
fired seven times and connected once. He downed a killdeer, a
protected species.
</P>
<P>
   The gunplay cost him a $130 fine and a heap of campaign trail
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the long run, guns have paid off nicely for Bush. He
rode a gun-industry issue into his first term in office that year
and now, gun-industry money may help him ride into higher office.
Bundled in with the massive amounts of money that will boost his
candidacy, Bush will get help from from what is, so far, almost
$500,000 in soft money poured into Republican candidates and causes
by the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is in the hip holster of the NRA,'' Chris
Lehane, spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, Bush's November foe,
said Wednesday. ``He's in lockstep with the gun lobby, but he's out
of step with America.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Bush is in step with Texas, a state
where gun ownership is sacred to many, including some who see a
never-ending, international conspiracy to disarm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly support the proposition that no governmental
agency or the UN shall require citizens to register their
firearms,'' says the state GOP platform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's political career got a high-caliber boost from that kind
of Texas thinking. In June 1993, then-Gov. Ann Richards, still
popular by most measures, vetoed a measure calling for a nonbinding
statewide vote on whether Texans should be allowed to carry
concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed the concealed weapon referendum as ``nothing more
than game playing by a few legislators who appear intent on
embarrassing the great state as a place where gun-toting vigilantes
roam the street.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year later, Texans dismissed Richards and
replaced her with Bush, who said he saw no harm in allowing
law-abiding Texans to pack pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Richards now believes she was the victim of gun politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the race really over guns,'' she said on ``Larry King
Live'' several months ago. ``That was the number one issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed the concealed weapons bill into law during his first
legislative session in 1995. Since then, the state has issued
208,185 permits. Another 2,923 applications were denied, including
about 700 from convicted felons ineligible to carry concealed
weapons. Gun control advocates have blasted the state's record of
not investigating felons who, through their concealed weapon permit
applications, hinted they might be packing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are they convicted felons, now they're well-trained
convicted felons in possession of a firearm,'' Handgun Control Inc.
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ongoing opposition from gun-control advocates,
law-enforcement officials _ many of whom opposed the measure _
decline to say the concealed weapons law has produced the kind of
dire outcome some feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen open chaos in the streets,'' said Texas
Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike Cox, adding that it is
difficult to measure the crime-fighting success of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, is convinced the concealed weapons bill has
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the law we passed in Texas has made Texas a safer
place,'' he said last September near the scene of a Fort Worth
church shooting that left eight dead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush treats guns as products that are legal, useful and enjoyed
by many law-abiding citizens. His mindset tells him to find ways to
make sure law-abiding citizens can keep guns, rather than looking
for ways to restrict them.
</P>
<P>
   That mindset has been seen in his approval of a law banning
municipalities from suing gunmakers, his less-than-enthusiastic
support of pre-purchase background checks, his doubts about the
effectiveness of mandatory trigger locks and his support for
increased penalties for juveniles who use weapons in crimes.

GORE CALLS FOR EXPANDING TAX SUBSIDIES TO PROMOTE FUEL-EFFICIENT
CARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With sleek models of fuel-efficient cars on display
behind him, Vice President Al Gore called for expanding federal
government tax subsidies to make such vehicles affordable for
average motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with executives from the Big Three U.S. automakers
Thursday, the vice president said that encouraging the production
of fewer gas-guzzling cars was key to dealing with rising oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do more to ensure our independence from a source of
fuel that makes us vulnerable'' to rising high oil prices, Gore
said at the presentation by the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, which he helped launch in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The event also provided a forum for the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee to address the pressing political problem of
high gas prices as well as stroke the automobile industry, which
dominates a key election battleground state of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   With financial aid from the federal government,
Daimler-Chrysler, Ford and General Motors have strived to develop
cars that get 80 miles per gallon using hybrid technology that
combines gasoline or diesel powered engines with an electric
motors.
</P>
<P>
   While the auto companies have been successful in designing such
vehicles, they acknowledge that they still cannot make them cheaply
enough for mass production. Daimler Chrysler executive Jim Holden
said that his prototype would cost motorists an extra $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   To make such vehicles more enticing, Gore has proposed giving
auto buyers tax credits ranging between $2,000 and $4,000 if they
purchase vehicles, including SUVs, minivans and pickups, that use
fuel-efficient technology. The tax credit would cost the federal
treasury about $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the federal government gives a 10 percent credit, up
to $4,000, for the cost of qualified electric vehicles. However,
that credit begins to phase down in 2002 and does not include
hybrid vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   By using tax credits to voluntarily promote fuel-efficient cars,
Gore hopes to steer a pragmatic middle course between
environmentalists, who want to mandate higher fuel-efficiency
standards and the auto industry, which has opposed such controls.
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalists were unhappy with the voluntary
approach, arguing the automakers will not be motivated to put
fuel-efficient cars on the market until the government raises
standards, particularly for SUVs and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In a written release, the Sierra Club noted that since 1994, the
Republican-controlled Congress has barred the Clinton
administration from raising fuel-economy standards for light trucks
and SUVs to the same level as other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Corporate Average Fuel economy, called CAFE
standards, requires that cars average 27.5 miles per gallon while
light trucks and SUVs have to average 20.5 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club also pointed out that the American carmakers
have already been beaten by their Japanese counterparts who have
put vehicles, averaging 50 miles per gallon, on the market.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has long aligned himself with environmental causes,
he has not dwelled on some of his more controversial stands as he
tries to court voters in key Midwestern auto-producing states,
particularly Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican presidential opponent, George W. Bush, has
attacked Gore for at one time proposing that the combustion engine
be phased out to curb air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   While the automobile executives praised Gore at the
show-and-tell event, the traditionally Republican industry still
has been putting its money with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the automobile
industry executives and political action committees gave $934,199
to Bush's campaign in 1999. By contrast, they contributed $65,274
to Gore.

   BIRTHRATE-DECLINE (Los Angeles) _ Even though births have
increased nationwide for the first time since 1990, the baby boom
has missed Los Angeles - births here fell by 2 percent in 1998,
officials said Wednesday. Health experts attribute the decline
largely to efforts to stem teen pregnancy, but they said fear of

SHOPPING IN B.C.
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by LANG) 
(Eds: fact box follows story.) 
By MARY RAMOS 
c.2000 Dallas Morning News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Shopping in this city is, like the
city itself, laid-back, yet sophisticated _ a multicultural,
international experience. With Vancouver's mild climate year-round,
it's no wonder visitors to this largest city on the west coast of
Canada enjoy indulging in some adventurous shopping, going beyond
department stores and malls into the neighborhoods of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Vancouver shopping neighborhoods mentioned here has
its own distinctive flavor. All are easily walkable and fun to
explore. And with the exchange rate highly favorable to Americans,
they're full of potential bargains. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gastown &QL; 
This neighborhood is interesting for its architecture and also for
its place in Vancouver's history as the oldest commercial area in
town.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorian-era buildings were saved from demolition in the
1960s and `70s and restored for retail use. Gastown's location near
Vancouver's cruise-ship terminal makes it a magnet for visitors.
The graceful old buildings are filled with galleries offering
beautifully handcrafted native arts and crafts. There are also
boutiques, restaurants and bars interspersed with shops selling
cheaper, mass-produced crafts, trinkets and T-shirts. The
tree-shaded brick streets complete a charming picture.
</P>
<P>
   At the corner of Water and Cambie streets, the Gastown Steam
Clock is a bit of fun. It whistles _ with a puff of steam _ every
15 minutes and chimes, with even more steam, every hour. Although
it looks as old as the rest of Gastown,  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Punjabi Market
</P>
<P>
   Also called ``Little India,'' this three-block strip of shops
along Main Street between 48th and 51st streets is identified by
distinctive street signs.
</P>
<P>
   Spice shops, sweets shops and restaurants tantalize with the
aromas of Indian foods. Indian music spills out onto the sidewalks
from stores.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing shops predominate, however, with many offering women's
traditional saris and tunic/pant suits and little girls' frilly
dresses. One specialty shop displays elaborately elegant finery for
an entire wedding party, created in silks and velvets and enriched
with gold embroidery. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Yaletown &QL; 
One of the hottest new shopping areas in Vancouver is this
neighborhood of red brick warehouses on the north bank of False
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The area was developed in the 1880s around the Canadian Pacific
Railway's maintenance yards. Later it was the site of Expo '86,
after which it was neglected for many years. Today the loading
docks are peppered with umbrella-shaded, fresh-air restaurants and
bistros.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are being transformed into home-designer
showrooms, architects' and attorneys' offices, galleries,
boutiques, and pubs that attract a trendy clientele. Residential
high-rises edge False Creek, and an amazing, upscale grocery store,
Urban Fare, recently opened around the corner. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Robson
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best-known shopping street in Vancouver, Robson
concentrates on fashions, accessories and more fashion, with food,
gifts and jewelry thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   Covering about six square blocks in the middle of downtown
Vancouver, the Robson shopping area boasts a midprice to upscale
mix of American and Canadian chain stores, with a sprinkling of
shops with European panache: Banana Republic, Levi's, The Gap,
Armani, Club Monaco and Laura Ashley, as well as the very British
Marks and Spencer, and many others.
</P>
<P>
   And where else can you see one intersection (Robson and Thurlow
streets) with two _ count 'em, two _ Starbucks shops?
</P>
<P>
   But for truly elegant boutiques, check out the area around the
Hotel Vancouver, the Grand Dame of West Georgia Street. There you
find Fendi, Chanel, Valentino, Louis Vuitton, Aquascutum and other
equally chic shops. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Granville Island
</P>
<P>
   A wildly successful example of urban rehab, today's Granville
Island was created out of a district of decaying corrugated-metal
warehouses. The former industrial area is now a spot popular with
both locals and visitors; its quirky mix of businesses guarantees
something of interest to just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The focal center of the neighborhood is the Granville Island
Public Market, housed in a 50,000-square-foot complex that features
fresh produce, fish, poultry, meats, baked goods, gourmet coffees,
wines and a food court with a mouth-watering assortment of ethnic
fast foods. And there's nary a golden arch to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Tables at one end of the food court overlook False Creek harbor.
In good weather, diners spill onto the dock area outside. Shops and
galleries nearby feature art, crafts and gift items, and one
building is filled with shops offering merchandise for children.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant offerings on Granville Island range from seafood to
vegetarian. The island's other businesses include an art school, a
cement company, a hotel and several marine-maintenance specialists.
Access to the island (actually a peninsula) is by car, bus, private
pleasure boat, or the little passenger mini-ferries that depart
every few minutes from a dock behind the Aquatic Center at Thurlow
and Pacific streets. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chinatown
</P>
<P>
   Chinese laborers came to British Columbia in the 1880s to help
build the Canadian Pacific Railway. After the railroad was
completed, many stayed in Vancouver. Others who had come to work in
lumber camps and mines joined them. From that nucleus grew
Vancouver's present-day Chinatown, home to about 35,000 people of
Chinese descent.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being just a tourist attraction, Chinatown is a working
business and market center for the city's Chinese population. A
walk down the crowded, bustling sidewalks of this vibrant district
is like being transported to Hong Kong. Signs are mostly in
Chinese, and English is rarely spoken. Shops offering the daily
necessities _ pots and pans, shoes, plastic baskets _ alternate
with bakeries displaying Chinese cakes and poultry shops where
barbecued ducks hang in the windows. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD:
</P>
<P>
   Gastown stretches east of Canada Place, which is recognizable by
its trademark white ``sails'' on the north side of downtown
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Punjabi Market, take a bus or a taxi from downtown
Vancouver. The district extends along both sides of Main Street
from 48th to 51st streets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Yaletown is on the east side of downtown Vancouver, roughly bounded
by Homer Street on the west, Pacific Boulevard on the south, Beatty
on the east and  &QL; 
Robson Street on the north.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Robson Street is the center of this shopping hot spot, generally
from Jervis Street to Burrard Street, and the district also
stretches a block in each direction from Robson.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Granville Island is on a peninsula across False Creek from downtown
Vancouver. It can be reached by bus, taxi, car or passenger ferry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chinatown takes in the area roughly from Hastings Street south to
Keefer Street and from Carrall Street east to Gore Street. A staff
member at the Vancouver Tourist Info Centre warned us that though
the distance from there to Chinatown was not great, we should not
walk. A taxi or city bus is the safest way to the neighborhood
shopping areas of the district. Ask at the Info Centre for specific
information.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Vancouver Tourist Info Centre, on the Plaza
Level at 200 Burrard St., is a good first stop in Vancouver. The
friendly staffers can help with accommodations, sightseeing and
transportation reservations, free of charge. They have route maps
for Vancouver's transit, as well as a handy guide called ``Discover
Vancouver on Transit'' that tells you what buses, rail or ferries
will take you to the places you want to go. They also sell
comprehensive Vancouver transit route maps. Phone (604) 683-2000. &QL;

 &HT;    Southern buys stake in online seller of power
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co., jumping into e-commerce, announced an
investment Thursday in a California Internet company that plans to
market electricity online across the country.
</P>
<P>
   With its second major Internet-related announcement in as many
days, Southern becomes the preferred electricity supplier to a
2-year-old company that plans to market electricity to homes and
businesses in 23 states and the District of Columbia by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Company Energy Marketing, Southern's wholesale energy
trading arm, is taking a minority stake in Utility.com with rights
to expand the investment in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Southern was among 15 major utilities that announced plans
Wednesday for a buying consortium that will purchase supplies
ranging from gas turbines to paper clips over the Internet. This
week's announcements were Southern's first two major Internet
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The $350-billion-a-year U.S. utility industry has been slow to
embrace the Internet, in part because it was until recently
dominated by regulated monopolies with little incentive to
innovate.
</P>
<P>
   But as the industry is deregulated and opened to competition,
the pace will surely quicken, said Edward Tirello, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank. ``This is the tip of the iceberg,'' he said of the
two Southern announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Utility.com is currently selling electricity to ``tens of
thousands'' of retail customers in Pennsylvania and California,
said its chief executive, Chris King. The company is licensed to
sell power in Arizona, Massachusetts and Nevada and plans to expand
as other states are deregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers going to the Utility.com Web site at www.utility.com
can sign up for service in areas served by the company by typing in
name, address and utility account number. Payment is by checking
account deduction or credit card. Monthly statements come by
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The service is not available in Georgia, where Southern's
Georgia Power Co. subsidiary maintains a monopoly over most of the
state and deregulation is not expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   Utility.com is a privately held company with almost 100
employees based in Albany, Calif., north of San Francisco. The
company has been relying on volatile wholesale markets for its
electricity supplies.
</P>
<P>
   King said the Southern deal will lower costs for his company and
allow it to be more competitive. ``It will enable us to focus on
customers and allow Southern to manage risks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southern decided against entering retail power sales in
California when that state became the first to deregulate
electricity several years ago. The company has instead been buying
power plants in deregulating states and concentrating on sales to
other utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Morsches, president of Southern Company Energy
Marketing, said Thursday's deal ``helps us reach into the retail
energy markets.'' Southern Co. owns 60 percent of Southern Company
Energy Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates by Morgan Stanley investment bankers, 50
percent of American consumers will purchase electricity online by
2004.

FORMER MEXICO CITY MAYOR ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAXACA, Mexico _ A former Mexico City mayor, who is one of
President Ernesto Zedillo's closest associates, has been accused in
documents sent to Congress of embezzling $50 million during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against the former mayor, Oscar Espinoza
Villareal, who governed Mexico City for three years after Zedillo
appointed him in 1994, are the most serious corruption allegations
lodged against any member of the president's inner circle during
his six-year presidency, which ends this year.
</P>
<P>
   Capping a three-year investigation that began with the
inauguration of the city's first opposition mayor in 1997, the
accusations inject a riveting new scandal into the final 100 days
of a presidential campaign that many Mexicans view as a plebiscite
on 71 years of rule by Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party,
known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza, Zedillo and the PRI's presidential candidate,
Francisco Labastida, all responded to the accusations by the Mexico
City state's attorney by suggesting that they were timed to hurt
the PRI during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   After Espinoza left City Hall in 1997, the president appointed
him secretary of tourism, a cabinet post that protects him from
criminal prosecution. As a result, the state's attorney, Samuel Del
Villar, made the accusations against Espinoza public on Wednesday
by filing a formal request with the Mexican Congress to strip him
of his immunity. Opposition parties hold a razor-thin congressional
majority, but it is unclear if they will be able to muster enough
votes later this spring to approve Espinoza's indictment and trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although several PRI mayors have appeared in recent decades to
plunder city coffers, none has ever been formally charged, and no
member of Zedillo's cabinet has faced criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Documents that Del Villar filed with Congress accused Espinoza
of approving huge financial transfers from the city treasury to top
aides, two of whom have been previously charged with fraud and are
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Espinoza argued that some of the missing money was paid
to television stations for city advertising, but they have been
unable to document those transactions, prosecutors said. The
newspaper La Jornada reported that some of the missing $50 million
was paid in bribes to journalists covering City Hall during
Espinoza's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Espinoza read to a packed Mexico City news
conference on Wednesday, he complained that he and other PRI
leaders were being used as scapegoats by an opposition eager to
``discredit candidates who have served in PRI governments.'' He
refused to respond to questions.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's office issued a statement expressing the president's
``complete confidence'' that the accusations were ``legally
baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   But Del Villar, who earned a Ph.D. in law at Harvard, has won
crucial cases as the city's top prosecutor. After he filed fraud
charges in 1998 against several of Espinoza's subordinates in
connection with graft in a computer procurement deal, IBM de Mexico
agreed to return $37.5 million the city had paid for the computers.
</P>
<P>
   This month Del Villar stepped forward to defend the integrity of
Zedillo's attorney general, whose career was on the line after a
top deputy committed suicide rather than face graft charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City mayors were appointed by successive PRI presidents
until 1997. But after a constitutional amendment ushered in mayoral
elections that year, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was elected as the city's
first opposition mayor, and he appointed Del Villar his state's
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza's close ties to the president date to 1994, when as the
PRI's finance secretary during Zedillo's 1994 presidential
campaign, he encouraged a wealthy banker, Carlos Cabal Peniche, to
make large donations to Zedillo's campaign that opposition leaders
have described as illegal. Zedillo has built a reputation for
personal integrity, but he has blocked repeated opposition efforts
to investigate those transactions.

 &HT;    New of potential rival hits Healtheon/WebMD shares
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ News that six insurance companies are discussing an
alliance that may compete with Healtheon/WebMD drove shares of the
Atlanta-based firm to a 52-week low Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies _ Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Cigna, WellPoint Health
Systems, Oxford Health Plans, Foundation Health Systems and
PacifiCare Health Systems _ are tentatively calling the new venture
MedUnite.
</P>
<P>
   The effort could pose a threat to Healtheon/WebMD, which is
trying to link doctors, insurance companies and patients using the
Internet. The news helped send Healtheon/WebMD shares down almost
16 percent. They closed at $25.82, down $4.86.
</P>
<P>
   An Aetna spokeswoman said the insurers are considering ways to
link doctors and hospitals with insurance companies through the
Internet. That means both consumers and medical professionals could
handle some chores online instead of on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aetna U.S. Healthcare is in discussion with a number of other
major insurers,'' said Joyce Oberdorf, Aetna spokeswoman. ``We are
looking at this as something highly promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is pretty much in agreement as to the inefficiencies
in the health care industry,'' she said. ``This is an effort to
address those inefficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Arnold, Healtheon/WebMD's chief executive, said the online
health care industry is large enough for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said Healtheon's explosive growth-through-acquisition
strategy will slow anyone from entering the market in as large a
manner as Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made $16 billion worth of acquisitions. When the deals
close, we'll have 3,000 direct-sales people. We have 7 million
consumers coming to our Web site each month. We process 2 billion
transactions. The technology took us four years and 1,000 engineers
to develop,'' he said. ``And that's just the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we think the assets we've assembled are very
powerful, and this is a reaction to the things we've done,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Peters, an analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels, lowered his
rating Thursday on Healtheon stock to ``neutral'' from ``strong
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been building up,'' he said. ``With all the mergers
and acquisitions and rumors on consortiums coming in to compete
with this company, in the near term the market probably will be
more fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said he thinks more competition will enter the market and
cloud issues for the potential customers of Healtheon/WebMD's
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's all over for Healtheon. But in the near
term there's going to be trouble,'' he said. ``There should be a
lot more news of companies coming in to the market. But once it all
plays out, most will fall by the wayside, and Healtheon will be one
of the few left standing.''

ANALYSIS: CLINTON MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY EASED INDIA-PAKISTAN TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Without winning or conceding anything of
substance on his tour of South Asia last week, President Clinton
may still have helped modestly reduce the risk of war between
nuclear-armed India and Pakistan by talking sweet to India and
tough to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He spent five days courting India, the region's democratic
colossus and rising economic power, with the ardor of a smitten
suitor _ and half a day treating Pakistan, America's Cold War ally
and a nation yet again ruled by generals, like an old girlfriend
who is part of the past.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of estrangement, Clinton gambled that the best way
to build a closer relationship with India _ a nation of 1 billion
people that is hungry for respect, and to encourage it to act
soberly with regard to its smaller, but detested, rival, Pakistan _
was to give it a dose of unconditional affection.
</P>
<P>
   He demanded no quid pro quo for his visit here _ for example,
requiring India's signing of the nuclear test ban treaty. And he
seconded India's demand that Pakistan reduce the level of violence
by militants it supports in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory both
countries claim, as a step toward coaxing India back to peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats and experts on the region have become
increasingly worried that India, angered by intensified attacks by
Pakistani-backed guerrillas in Kashmir, will strike across the
so-called Line of Control that divides the Indian- and
Pakistan-held parts of Kashmir to hit at militant training camps in
Pakistani territory.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview , Brajesh Mishra, the national security
adviser to India's prime minister, said India had assured the
Americans that as long as there were no new large-scale Pakistani
incursions into Indian territory, ``we will not take any
provocative action on the other side of the Line of Control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we have to do to curb the militants will be on our
side of the Line of Control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. approach to Pakistan was motivated by a different
assumption: that Pakistani generals were operating under the
illusion that if they stirred up enough trouble in Kashmir, the
United States, fearing a conflict that could turn nuclear, would
step in and insist that India make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Pakistan-backed militants have become
increasingly bold. At the same time, the Indians have added to an
already immense military presence that has been criticized for
well-documented human rights violations against the civilian
population. Pakistan, weaker than India, has long pleaded for
international intervention _ and sought to provoke it by stoking
the militancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for many years they thought that might get us involved
and it won't,'' Clinton told Peter Jennings of ABC News days before
his trip to Pakistan. ``I'm not going to be dragged into something
that, first of all, that India doesn't want us to be part of and
secondly, that I got dragged into from deliberate acts of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sternly worded warnings, issued privately to Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, the army chief who has ruled Pakistan since an
Oct. 12 coup, and in a televised address to the nation, were meant
to leave the generals with no doubt that further violence in
Kashmir wwould deepen Pakistan's international isolation while
failing to bring America to the rescue.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the significance of the trip was not limited to issues of
war and peace. In a traveling exhibition of political performance
art, Clinton also began rebuilding America's long-estranged
relationship with India, the world's most populous democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In New Delhi, he wowed one of the world's most hard-boiled
groups of politicians, the Indian Parliament. ``As Clinton walked
to the exit, suddenly, as if the dam of hostility had been
breached, almost everyone wanted to shake his hand,'' the news
weekly India Today reported breathlessly.
</P>
<P>
   In Rajasthan, the president danced spontaneously with village
women. In Hyderabad, he sang the praises of India's fast-growing
software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook, a national magazine, said Clinton would be remembered
as ``a warmhearted, fun-loving man'' and described the president
expertly scooping up dal makhani _ a rich, creamy lentil dish _
with roti, a flat bread, then approvingly quoted him saying, ``I
wish I had two stomachs.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans in the embassy in New Delhi and those visiting from
Washington were almost giddy with relief and amazement that India
seemed to have fallen head over heels for Clinton. After all, the
president was in the final year of a second term tainted by
scandal, coming to a country that has had notoriously prickly
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the good feelings of this moment could quickly fade. That
has happened in the past. The Clinton administration had been
warming up to India in 1997 and 1998 _ planning the first visit to
India by a U.S. president in more than two decades _ when India
shocked the world by conducting nuclear tests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in the gulag for a couple of years and this was
their chance to rehabilitate themselves,'' said a U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the ground lost at the time of the tests was recovered
last week as the Americans simply agreed to disagree with India on
its development of a nuclear deterrent. But economic sanctions
imposed by the United States after the tests are still in place.
And the sensitivities of India, once a restive colony in the
British empire, to what it has often perceived as U.S.
highhandedness are still just below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   And it is far from certain that Clinton's trip will produce the
concrete long-term results he seeks: that both nations accede to
the test ban treaty, get back to the negotiating table, calm their
hostilities and slow down spending on nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not fundamentally change the U.S. position on
Kashmir, the length and warmth of his visit to India and the
brevity and coolness of his time in Pakistan left the impression in
both places that the United States has tilted toward India.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it became clear that Clinton would be tough with the
Pakistanis when he went to Islamabad _ as indeed he was _ India
smiled,'' said Dennis Kux, author of the definitive history of
Indian-U.S. relations, ``Estranged Democracies'' (Sage
Publications, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the end of the Cold War _ during which India drew
close to the Soviets and Pakistan to the Americans _ there is a
more solid foundation for cooperation between India and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Both are great, multicultural democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' thriving high technology industry has spawned
a crop of successful Indian-born entrepreneurs who are becoming a
force in U.S. politics. India itself has a growing software
industry that has rapidly rising sales to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, India's more open, market-driven economy is
producing opportunities for American investors, though the dollar
amounts remain relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was in India, U.S. companies _ among them Enron,
Motorola, and Hewlett-Packard _ signed deals worth about $4 billion
with Indian companies and state governments in the high technology
and power sectors, among others. U.S. officials said they helped
move some of these deals through the still ornate Indian
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India has accepted an
invitation to visit the White House before Clinton leaves office
and both governments have committed themselves to high-level
consultations on nuclear nonproliferation, trade, the environment
and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kux, the historian, cautioned that one good visit
is no guarantee of better relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only time will tell,'' he said, ``if Clinton and his
successor, whether Gore or Bush, and the Indians stay the course.''

 &HT;    Heels' Forte can handle it
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Forte follows a long line of illustrious baggage
handlers. Kids named Worthy and Jordan and Carter, freshmen of such
influence and precocity they were told to give their team a lift.
</P>
<P>
   When ordered to embrace a rich North Carolina tradition and
carry the green bag, how could Forte refuse?
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I needed humbling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Every upper-class teammate raised his hand one day in the fall,
and Forte became the bag man. All season long, he has carried the
green bag on road trips, lugging the trainer's duffel full of tape,
scissors and ointments to the bus, to the arena and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times,'' Forte said, ``I may have my Walkman on, walking to
the locker room, and the managers will tap me on the shoulder and
say, 'Come get the bag.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the afterglow of North Carolina's 59-55 victory over Tulsa in
the NCAA South Regional final, Bill Guthridge was asked if Forte's
bag days might be over. ``Oh, no,'' the Carolina coach said. ``We
might just put some bricks in there for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Forte doesn't hoist bricks, of any sort. It was
abundantly clear long before Sunday, when the 6-foot-4 shooting
guard got a temporary reprieve. When Carolina left the arena, a
student manager carried the green bag to the team bus. ``The guy
just dropped 28 on Tulsa,'' the manager explained. ``He's taking us
to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   To Indianapolis, where North Carolina (22-13) meets Florida
(28-7) in Saturday's second semifinal. For Carolina, an NCAA-record
15th Final Four is also its most improbable Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   And Forte is the tourney's leading scorer with 80 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no fool. I'm no Michael Jordan,'' he said. ``I haven't
even met Mr. Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Mr. Jordan, who capped his freshman season with the
jump shot that beat Georgetown 63-62 in the 1982 NCAA final,
crashed the NCAA Tournament party quite like Forte.
</P>
<P>
   After a ``nervous'' 13 points against Missouri, Forte's 17 led
UNC to an upset of top-seeded Stanford. He hit two 3-pointers in
the last five minutes after Guthridge had scolded, ``Stop shooting
it like you're scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's dramatic rally against Tennessee began with a late
3-pointer by Forte, who finished with 22 points. He scored a
career-high 28 against Tulsa, one point better than Jordan's best
tournament game. The silken shooter scored 10 of UNC's 14 points in
the decisive run and grabbed eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scores so easy,'' Tulsa coach Bill Self said. ``He's
probably the best freshman in the land, or at least had the best
year. Even though he made tough shots, he made them look easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte, averaging 16.7 points, is the first freshman to lead
North Carolina in scoring. He also is the ACC rookie of the year.
Now, he's in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   And all he wanted was to start as a freshman. ``That was really
big for me,'' he said. ``Not many freshmen got a chance to start at
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was a kid in Smyrna, Forte played rec ball in a
10-and-under league. By the eighth grade, he stood 6-foot-2 and
stood out in almost every way.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he was the focus of an intense recruiting battle
involving which high school he'd attend. Campbell, the school in
Forte's district, vowed to petition the board of education if he
chose another high school in the area. Some 95 coaches applied for
the coaching vacancy at Campbell. Wanda Hightower saw the furor
over her oldest son and, much like his North Carolina teammates
last fall, decided a little humility was in order.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower took a job transfer with Hewlett-Packard, moved to
Greenbelt, Md., and enrolled Forte at famed DeMatha High. She
already had persuaded Morgan Wooten, DeMatha's legendary coach, to
take Joseph. Wooten's idea of humility was having Forte spend the
ninth grade playing on the JV. By the time he graduated, Forte was
a USA Today All-American.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1999, he was a cocky, gifted freshman who looked
like a kid and was eager to start and impress. ``The baby-faced
bandit,'' center Brendan Haywood has called Forte. ``He looks like
he's 12.''
</P>
<P>
   During the informal pickup games before Carolina officially
started practice, he talked as if he already belonged. ``When we
were playing pickup games, I was like, 'I'm going to average
this,''' Forte said. ``Then everybody's like, 'Shut up, you're just
a freshman.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of hard to figure out,'' Haywood said. ``We were
just trying to figure out where he was coming from. But he's a good
person, just a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's confident,'' senior point guard Ed Cota said. ``He might
boast a little bit about the things he does well, but we just kick
him in the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   They patted him on the back after Forte debuted with 24 points
in the opener against Southern Cal, then was the MVP of the Maui
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when I started off, I was taking advantage of no one
knowing me and not giving me any respect because I was a
freshman,'' he said. ``Then I struggled a bit. But I think I did
well late in the season because of how I struggled earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte adapted to the college game. When Maryland held him to
seven points, Forte responded by averaging 24.2 points over the
next 10 games. Since he scored seven in a first-round ACC
Tournament loss to Wake Forest, Forte has averaged 20 in the NCAAs
and was named the top player in the South Regional.
</P>
<P>
   And this weekend in Indianapolis, Joseph Forte still will be
carrying on.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ If ever there was a movie that seemed too hip for
the room, it was ``The Matrix'' going into the 72nd annual Academy
Awards on Sunday at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly what we thought,'' said Joel Silver, the
producer of the genre-bending science-fiction thriller that became
one of last spring's biggest hits and the first in a string of
unlikely, word-of-mouth successes that defined the year, including
``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``The Sixth Sense'' and ``American
Beauty.'' But the room turned out hipper than expected.
</P>
<P>
   First, ``The Matrix'' won the Oscar for best sound. Then it won
for best sound-effects editing. Fine, both were technical
categories in a movie celebrated for its technical achievements.
But then ``The Matrix'' beat out George Lucas' ``Star Wars: Episode
I _ The Phantom Menace'' and its groundbreaking special effects for
the evening's best visual effects prize. And finally it beat out
``American Beauty,'' the eventual winner of the best picture prize
and four other Oscars, for the film editing award. At one point,
``The Matrix'' had won four Oscars _ every one it had been
nominated for _ and ``American Beauty'' had yet to win one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great news is that the academy recognized a totally unique
picture and validated it in a way that surprised some people,''
said Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of production at Warner
Brothers, which released the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt the picture was a groundbreaking picture and
that it was something special and warranted to be separated from
the pack and get some special accolades, but you never know what
will happen at the Academy Awards,'' Silver said. ``I just wanted
to get one award, because I felt that if you get one, then the
movie is always an Academy Award-winning movie and that would
follow it around forever. The sequel would become, sequel to the
Oscar-winning `Matrix,' and so on. One award would have been more
than I would have dreamed. But four? I was really surprised we got
the editing award.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sequels to ``The Matrix'' are in pre-production _ and will
reunite the co-directors Andy and Larry Wachowski with the star
Keanu Reeves. The plan is to shoot both simultaneously, about a
year from now. ``We'll be shooting two movies literally at the same
time,'' Silver said. ``Actually, what we're doing is we're shooting
one giant movie and then splitting it in half, releasing it in two
parts.'' The plan is for the first one, ``Matrix 2,'' to come out
around Christmas 2002, with ``Matrix 3'' following the next summer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly sweet night for Silver because 12 years
ago he produced another movie, ``Die Hard,'' that got many of the
same Oscar bids but came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that `The Matrix' was just a very smart action movie,
if that's not an oxymoron,'' Silver said. ``It was about more than
explosions and fistfights; it really raises the bar on these kind
of movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Here Today, Gone ...
</P>
<P>
   You may remember Keith Gordon from playing the owner of a
haunted car in John Carpenter's ``Christine'' or as Angie
Dickinson's techno-detective son in Brian De Palma's ``Dressed to
Kill,'' or even as Rodney Dangerfield's somewhat embarrassed son in
``Back to School.'' But Gordon has spent the last decade putting
together an increasingly accomplished career as a director of
independent films, not that he has anything against studio films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at the point where I have a development deal,'' said
Gordon, 39. ``My office is in my house. But I guess if a studio or
someone were to offer to pay for an office and for somebody to
answer my phone, well, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   His first film, ``The Chocolate War'' (1988), a decidedly creepy
drama set in a Catholic boys' school, was followed in 1991 with an
adaptation of William Wharton's antiwar novel set in 1944 France,
``A Midnight Clear.'' That film's cast of then largely unknowns has
a more familiar ring a decade later: Ethan Hawke, Gary Sinise,
Peter Berg, Frank Whaley, John C. McGinley. In 1996, Gordon
finished an adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's ``Mother Night,''
starring Nick Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's back with yet another adaptation, of Scott
Spencer's politically tinged romance ``Waking the Dead,'' starring
Billy Crudup as a liberal congressional candidate who begins to
have visions of a former lover (Jennifer Connelly) more radical
than he was in the early 1970s who supposedly died in an explosion.
The movie had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January
and opened in limited release on March 24 to mixed but generally
positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really been doing a lot of traveling for this, to about
eight or nine cities,'' Gordon said. ``Which is great, except you
visit all these places but never really get a chance to get out of
the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he'd been getting more worried about the future of
adult-oriented independent films, wondering whether the audience of
those who came of age during the great burst of American filmmaking
in the early 1970s are getting too old and settled to go to movies
as often as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is doing very well in New York and Los Angeles, but
in some other places it's more difficult,'' he said. ``I even have
some good friends who tell me, oh, great, the new movie is out, and
that they'll go see it in the next couple of weeks. And I have to
say, `No, you must go see it now, right now, or in two weeks it
will be gone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Canvass and Canvas
</P>
<P>
   When the director Carlos Avila went looking for a young man to
play one of Jimmy Smits' sons, an aspiring prizefighter, in his new
movie, ``The Price of Glory'', he put out the word through Los
Angeles' boxing clubs that he was more interested in a fresh face
with boxing talent than a young actor who could learn to box.
</P>
<P>
   He also put out the word on Spanish-language radio and
television stations in Los Angeles. The result was that more than
1,000 men showed up at the Conga Room, Smits' Los Angeles
nightclub, and each was given a chance to read. Some were young
actors who tried to pass as boxers, others were boxers who tried to
pass as actors, but one of them was Ernesto Hernandez, ``who was
incredibly charismatic and very distinctive looking,'' Avila said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez got the job.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a bonus. One 8-year-old boy, Gilbert Leal, came
with his father. The boy had been training to box since he was 5.
Avila decided to hire him to play Hernandez's character as a youth.
``One of the things I wanted to do,'' Avila said, ``was to expand
the pool of young Latino acting talent that is out there.''

2 MULTIMEDIA COMPANIES WILL DEVELOP INTERNET VENTURES FOR
PRIMEDIA'S MAGAZINES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teddy Bear magazine, make way for Teddy Bear Interactive, Teddy
Bear streaming video, Teddy Bear e-commerce and Teddy Bear, the
broadband version.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that marks a significant expansion for Primedia, a
magazine company once known for its highly specialized magazine
publications such as Teddy Bear, Drag Racing USA and National Hog
Farmer, the company's chairman and chief executive, Tom Rogers,
announced an agreement Thursday with two multimedia companies, who
will buy stakes in the company.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI Inc., an internet venture-fund company, and Liberty Media,
the cable-television programming company owned by AT&AMP;T, will each
purchase 5 percent stakes in Primedia _ for a total of about $400
million. The three companies will develop internet-based joint
ventures with Primedia's 250 magazine titles and develop Primedia's
newly formed broadband video division. Primedia is controlled by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., the leveraged-buyout firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primedia has a reputation as a sleepy media company that
hasn't done much,'' Rogers said Thursday, after making the
announcement in a conference call with analysts. ``We are going to
create a lot of activity. The company's asset base is perfectly
suited to translation to the new-media world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers told analysts that, ``in the future, you will no longer
refer to us as, Primedia, comma, a magazine publishing company.''
He stressed that the highly targeted niche titles of Primedia and
their enthusiast audiences are the key to the transformation of
Primedia to the new-media realm.
</P>
<P>
   Some analyst remain skeptical. Mark Mooradian, an internet
analyst at Jupiter Communications, said, ``The big question is
whether these categories are big enough to build stand-alone
ventures that really work, which is tough given the size of the
audience of most of the Primedia publications.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deal with Primedia, CMGI will receive 8 million Primedia
shares in exchange for 1.53 million of its own shares. CMGI
introduced a venture capital fund in January of $1 billion to focus
on companies that offer Internet technologies and infrastructure.
CMGI and Primedia will fund new internet entities focused on
categories including construction and digital entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Media will invest $200 million in cash in exchange for
the 5 percent stake and 1.5 million warrants, which will allow
Liberty to purchase 1.5 million shares of Primedia stock at $25 a
share over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Digital, the interactive television and internet company
owned by Liberty Media, also received an option to buy a 12.5
percent stake in Primedia Broadband Video, a new unit of the
company; Primedia, in exchange, will purchase $25 million of
Liberty Digital stock. Liberty and Primedia will work specifically
on developing interactive video. Primedia already owns video
properties like Channel One, the television news channel provided
on video to high schools around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over as chairman in September, Rogers, the former
president of NBC cable, has implemented plans to generate
e-commerce off the magazines' Web sites and to put the company's
video properties to use on the Internet. He has exchanged
advertising in the magazines for equity in new-media ventures like
Digital Media Online, PrintCafe.com and BabyPressConference.com.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Rainbow Media Holdings, the division of
Cablevision that produces MetroChannels, announced an agreement
with New York magazine, owned by Primedia, to create an Internet
site. The agreement will allow content from New York magazine to
appear on MetroChannels.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have responded with enthusiasm Thursday to Rogers'
plans. The stock jumped $6.375 a share, or 24 percent, to $33.50.

 &HT;    TALKS ON ELIAN GONZALEZ EXTENDED AGAIN
 &HT;    With ELIAN-GORE, ELIAN-CONGRESS and ELIAN-RENO.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A tense Miami edged away from the brink of explosive
protests Thursday as federal officials again extended a deadline on
Elian Gonzalez's immigration status and discussed a possible visit
by the boy's Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone really doubt that the time has come for this boy to
be reunited with his father?'' said Gregory Craig, a Washington
attorney who represents the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Craig consulted with State Department officials Thursday and
said he intends to apply for a visa that would allow Gonzalez to
come to the United States. It was unclear how soon the visit might
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives and federal
immigration officials held eight hours of negotiations over the
6-year-old boy's fate, but reached no agreement. They will resume
their talks Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration officials, who had already extended a deadline
for revoking Elian's permission to remain in the country until
Friday, set a new deadline of 9 a.m. ET Tuesday and said Elian
would be allowed to stay with his Miami relatives until at least
then.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials want the Miami family to pledge that they will
turn the boy over if they lose their federal court fight to keep
him in this country. The family has so far refused, saying they
want to keep open the possibility of taking the legal battle to a
Florida family court once their federal appeals have been
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   But the possible visit of Juan Gonzalez overshadowed other
developments Thursday. A spokesman for the Miami relatives said
they would welcome Elian's father to their home, but did not say
whether they would turn the boy over to him.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear how Miami's volatile Cuban exiles would
react to such a visit. Elian has become a symbol of their deep
hatred for Cuban leader Fidel Castro, and exile groups Thursday
practiced forming a human chain to block the boy from being removed
from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   One exile activist said protesters would allow Elian's father to
visit the boy in the Little Havana home of his Miami relatives, but
didn't say whether they would allow the boy to leave with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will tell everybody to stand aside and let that visit
happen,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the Democracy Action
group. ``This is a family issue, and we want them to have the
chance to sit down and talk it out as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was still unclear Thursday whether the visit of Elian's
father would actually take place. In announcing the proposal late
Wednesday, Castro said he wanted to send a 31-person entourage with
Gonzalez, including Elian's teacher, classmates and a team of
psychologists who would help the boy readapt to life with his Cuban
family.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said the group would live at the home of a top Cuban
diplomat near Washington, remaining there until the federal court
case over the issue was resolved. A hearing in the case has been
set for May 8 at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Castro insisted the visit would only take place if U.S.
officials promised they would put Elian in his father's custody for
the duration of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible stumbling block was the size of the entourage.
State Department officials said Thursday that while they could
process Gonzalez's visa application quickly, visas for the rest of
the entourage would have to go through normal channels, which could
take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's saga has now lasted more than four months. He was found
floating in an inner tube at sea on Thanksgiving Day, after his
mother and 10 other people drowned as they attempted to flee Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials decided in January that he should be returned
to his family in Cuba, but the Miami relatives who have cared for
Elian since he was rescued filed a federal lawsuit to block that
decision. Last week a Miami federal judge ruled against them, but
the family immediately filed an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case continued to make waves outside South Florida, as Vice
President Al Gore broke with the administration's position
Thursday. Florida is the nation's fourth most populous state, and
Cuban-Americans make up a significant block of voters.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration supports sending Elian back to
Cuba, Gore said he supports legislation that would grant permanent
resident status to the boy and his Cuban family _ a position
similar to that of his likely Republican opponent, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us be clear that the real fault in this case lies with the
oppressive regime of Fidel Castro,'' the vice president said in a
statement. Elian should never have been forced to choose between
freedom and his own father. Now we must take action, here on our
own shores, to make sure that Elian's best interests are served.''

COLUMN: EXPECTING THE TECHNOLOGY BUBBLE TO BURST
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Franco Modigliani says that the current mania for Internet and
other technology stocks is not irrational. But it is a bubble, and
it will burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can show, really precisely, that there are two warranted
prices for a share,'' Modigliani said in a telephone interview. The
one he prefers is based on such fundamentals as earnings and growth
rates.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``The bubble is rational in a certain sense.''
The expectation of growth ``produces the growth, which confirms the
expectation. People will buy it because it went up.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, he said, is that the bubble price is naturally
unstable. It can keep rising only so long as expectations keep
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once you are convinced it is not growing anymore, nobody
wants to hold a stock because it is overvalued,'' he said.
``Everybody wants to get out and it collapses, beyond the
fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Modigliani knows something about the fundamentals. Now 81 years
old, he won the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics in 1985 in part
because of his pioneering work in just what those fundamentals are.
One of his insights _ which seemed odd back in the 1950s when he
was first propounding it _ was that the value of a company's
securities, including stocks and bonds, should be based on expected
profits, discounted by an appropriate interest rate. That also
applies to the stock market as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   By that light, it is not easy to rationalize huge price-earnings
ratios. Modigliani argues that it is impossible for the economy to
grow as fast as the market seems to be forecasting, even if some
companies will do very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot believe that corporate earnings will rise forever
at 7 percent,'' he said. Eventually, ``the entire national income
will be taken by profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Such calculations can be ignored when investors think they see a
bright new era arriving, as happened in the 1920s with broadcasting
and is happening now with the Internet. President Clinton will host
the White House Conference on the New Economy next week.
</P>
<P>
   Modigliani is not a man given to frequent outbursts on the stock
market. I called him after I heard that he had talked about bubbles
in a speech to the Boston Security Analysts Society. At his only
previous address to that group, in 1976, he mocked Wall Street for
undervaluing stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the Dow Jones industrials could fall to 8,000 or
9,000, but that technology stocks are far more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of the Internet, it is so hard to establish
fundamentals, to understand how how much is a bubble,'' he said.
``In my view, it is very much a bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   And then? ``There is no bubble that quietly deflates. A bubble
by its nature will burst. I don't know when.'' But it will happen,
and the pain will be greater if the bubble has grown. He says the
Federal Reserve Board is right to raise interest rates, but may be
moving too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to find money managers who will privately admit
they are petrified but fully invested. Most of them studied
Modigliani's work in business school. Most also have seen peers who
did not buy the hot new stocks lose their jobs. Their nervousness
increases with the market's volatility. With Thursday's rout, the
Nasdaq composite has suffered back-to-back declines of more than 3
percent a day for the first time since the 1987 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Modigliani began selling stocks about a year ago, and has no
apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who did well in 1929 were those who sold too
soon,'' he said. ``The final test will be if the collapse comes. If
it doesn't come, I'm wrong.''

GULF BETWEEN BLACKS AND GOP NOT BEING CROSSED ANYTIME SOON

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nobody wants to publicly admit it, but the Republican Party can
forget about reaping the benefits of the black vote in the first
presidential election of this new millennium.
 &HT;    Come November 2000, African-Americans _ regardless of social
class or region _ will probably vote for Vice President Al Gore in
overwhelming percentages.
 &HT;    Although blacks have appeared as incorrigible Democrats since
the second term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the current
crystallization of black attitudes has been decades in the making.
In the minds of a large majority of black voters, the image of
present-day Republican leadership has become near permanently
etched as ``the enemy.''
 &HT;    In the old days, the black man's true enemies were Southern
Democrats, and their Northern allies, who were willing to maintain
or tolerate Jim Crow at any cost. The Southern-based enemy was
adamantly opposed to any governmental interference that might
assure equal voting rights, equal access to education, fair
employment, fair housing or even protection from lynch mobs.
 &HT;    Back then, blacks considered the word ``enemy'' as synonymous
with ``Southern Democrat.''
 &HT;    Even when Northern politicians of good will occupied the White
House, the Senate, the House of Representatives or the U.S. Supreme
Court, their private sentiments were consistently nullified by a
deference to Southern Democrats. Consequently, the horrendous lynch
mob activity of the 1920s never resulted in the passage of an
anti-lynching bill.
 &HT;    Yet, since Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s and 1940s blacks
have made great strides under the administrations of Presidents
Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton _
all Southern Democrats.
 &HT;    Step by step, the GOP's counter southern strategy has wrought
success. It broke up the ``Solid South'' by giving conservative
Democrats a new identity. Meet the New Southern Republican, who can
now work shamelessly in open concert in right-wing crusades that
cross all regional boundaries.
 &HT;    The heart of this political dynamic is not confined to the
right-to-life crusades against abortion, or the end of big
government and the cessation of big taxes. Slap dab in the middle
is the right to contain _ if not stop _ any further concessions or
``giveaways'' to blacks.
 &HT;    Stopping affirmative action is central to the Republican appeal.
Even when it tries to soften that goal by displaying a few blacks
in upfront positions, the strategy is in motion.
 &HT;    Time after time, at crucial moments, the Republican strategy has
been to send a clear, not-so-subtle message to the white South,
which declares: ``We sympathize with you on the race issue.'' Here
is a chronology for that message, which could not be missed by any
knowledgeable black.
 &HT;    When Gov. Ronald Reagan, patron saint of Republicanism, launched
his southern crusade for the presidency, he chose little
Philadelphia, Miss., to kickoff his drive.
 &HT;    Philadelphia's only previous claim to fame was providing a site
for the 1964 murder of three youthful civil workers: James E.
Chaney, a black, Michael H. Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, both
white.
 &HT;    When Richard Nixon announced his presidential bid in the
Midwest, he chose Pontiac, Mich., which had gained recent notoriety
by the highly publicized burning of integration-bound schoolbuses.
 &HT;    Who tried to scare the daylights out of white folks with the
likes of imprisoned killer Willie Horton turned loose to roam your
streets? None other than strategists for Vice President George
Bush, a group that used race to catapult Bush into the White House.
 &HT;    When in this new millennium Gov. George W. Bush chose Bob Jone's
University to launch his South Carolina campaign for the
presidency, he was not breaking ground. He merely was following
suit. His willing presence at the university was a proclamation.
 &HT;    After the Bob Jones scenario, it was patently evident that Bush
would chose ``neutrality'' on the Confederate flag flying over
South Carolina's capitol dome, thereby offering fresh solace to
this homage to slavery and racism.
 &HT;    Bush and all GOP presidential candidates simply acted out the
New Republican Tradition on Race.
 &HT;    It is racially offensive to suggest that African-Americans do
not see or understand what is going on. Don't be misled by the few
cheerful black faces occasionally seen on the evening news nodding
agreement with Republican speakers.
 &HT;    I have never seen any candidate for the presidency, however
repugnant his advocacy, who could not find a black supporter. But
last week I welcomed one hint of resistance from within the GOP as
I watched CNN's television coverage of California's black
anti-affirmative action campaigner Ward Connerly in Dallas.
 &HT;    Answering a question from his near all-white audience, Connerly
conceded that Congress' lone black Republican, Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, disagreed with Connerly's campaign, calling it ill-timed.
 &HT;    So, let us give thanks for even microscopic concessions to
reality. However, the die is cast because the GOP has too many
promises to keep with former Democrats.

 By Stanley T. Lee  
 &HT;    They said it couldn't be done.
 &HT;    A small technology startup dared to challenge the giants of the
telecommunications industry. Two years later, Bitro Communications
pronounced ``bee-tro,'' has proved that it can compete with the
likes of AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint.
 &HT;    The founders of the company chose the name Bitro, which in
Korean means ``toward the light,'' to symbolize the team's mission
to elevate the company to the upper echelons of the telecom field.
But this is an industry dominated by corporate household names and
other Fortune 500 companies. The key to Bitro's success was the
relentless pursuit made by seven young entrepreneurs for a direct
connection contract with Korean Telecom, the dominant telecom
carrier in South Korea _ the equivalent to AT&AMP;T. Several emerging
telecom companies, such as Frontier, Global Crossing and Qwest,
failed in their attempts to establish a relationship with Korea
Telecom, as the company decided to partner only with the Big Three.
 &HT;    But because of their tenacity, Bitro joined AT&AMP;T, MCI and Sprint
in providing long-distance phone service to Korea through Korea
Telecom.
 &HT;    Bitro soon emerged as a leading carrier of voice and data to and
from Korea, surpassing MCI and Sprint. During December 1999, Bitro
handled nearly as much AT&AMP;T, according to Korea Telecom sources.
Now, Bitro is earning over $1 million a month in revenue, with
prospects for future growth. Bitro will expand by merging and
acquiring other companies with direct connections throughout Asia.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, this is a far different picture from when the
company first started in April 1998.
 &HT;    Bitro's founders, composed primarily of 1.5- and
second-generation Korean Americans, struggled in the early months
of operation. Several of them gave up their salaries in order to
preserve every penny of scarce capital. There were numerous
occasions when consecutive nights were spent in the office with
little regard to personal hygiene.
 &HT;    They familiarized themselves with the telecommunications
technology, spending countless hours reading manuals and complex
technical guides. When they called Lucent Technologies for
technical assistance on a switch that they just bought, the Bitro
engineers were the ones that figured out how to make it function
properly, not the Lucent technicians.
 &HT;    Designing and implementing advanced telecommunications systems
presented an enormous challenge, but with sweat and a lot of luck,
their resilience paid off.
 &HT;    When the first call to Korea was made over their system to the
mother of Chris Lee, Bitro's chief financial officer and founder,
tears fell from the eyes of all the founders. Lee commented that
his mother's voice never sounded sweeter.
 &HT;    Bitro will now promote the use of advanced technology to offer
traditional voice and data products at competitive prices. Bitro
CEO and President Tae Joon Kim envisions integrating the Internet
with traditional phone products and new value-added services. One
thing the Bitro pioneers never wanted was to position the company
as a traditional telecom company, let alone a typical Korean
company. But one of the keys to Bitro's success is that it operates
as an American corporation with a strong understanding and
appreciation for Korean culture.
 &HT;    ``We are Koreans, and we are an American company,'' says Patrick
Kim, vice president.
 &HT;    By capitalizing on its dual cultural and philosophical
identities, Bitro hopes to innovate the ways people communicate
globally in the new millennium.

 By PATRICIA GUADALUPE  
 &HT;    Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is the highest-ranking Hispanic
in the Clinton Administration.
 &HT;    A former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and New Mexico
congressman, he helped secure congressional approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
 &HT;    Lately, he's been using his international contacts to press for
lower oil prices worldwide.
 &HT;    Richardson also is helping with Hispanic outreach for the Gore
for President campaign, and his name has been bandied about as a
possible vice-presidential candidate on the Gore ticket.
 &HT;    Here, he talks about politics and other matters.
 &HT;    ----
 &HT;     Q:  Is the country ready for a Hispanic vice president?
 &HT;     A:  Yes, absolutely. The American public is ready to accept a
Hispanic candidate. I think it would not only be a pleasant
surprise, it would be right on target and make sense.
 &HT;    If it doesn't happen in this election, it'll happen in the next.
But I won't speculate that I will be the one. It's a presidential
candidate's call. I'm not campaigning for the job. I don't think I
would be the only one to be considered.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What are some of the things you are doing as part of the
Gore campaign's outreach efforts within the Hispanic community?
 &HT;     A:  We have a group of Hispanic leaders and legislators,
Ganamos con Gore, and we have been meeting to get a strong
organization going in support of the vice president. He has good
support in the Hispanic community, but Bush and McCain have a
greater impact on the Hispanic community than other Republican
candidates.
 &HT;    I think we are going to win, but what we don't want is for the
Republicans to get more than 30 percent of the vote. If that
happens, it could negatively affect our numbers in several states.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Are you worried about the Republican candidates' appeal in
the Hispanic community?
 &HT;     A:  Yes, because Bush and McCain have run in states with large
Hispanic populations. They've been successful in appealing to
Hispanics and they haven't acted like other Republican candidates
who have been totally negative toward the Latino community. It's a
challenge.
 &HT;    The main challenge is making sure that their percentage of the
Latino vote doesn't rise. (The GOP's all-time high of 40 percent of
the Hispanic vote occurred with President Reagan in 1984.)
 &HT;    If the Republican candidate gets 40 percent of the vote, for
instance, that would be a serious problem for the Democratic Party,
because it would be in key states for us, like California, Florida,
Texas, Illinois, New York.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  The meetings that you are involved in with Ganamos con Gore
_ how are you developing a strategy targeted to the Hispanic
community?
 &HT;     A:  We've been traveling all over the place _ New Hampshire,
Iowa, California, New York. There are many members of the group who
are working as volunteers in those and other states.
 &HT;    Part of our plan is to organize every state and to also do some
fund raising for the campaign. And I'm not just talking about
getting elected officials involved. We want to have a real
grassroots campaign, and we're working to appeal to the younger
generation in our community, with issues like the global economy
and technology.
 &HT;    We also are talking to the community about a whole range of
issues, not just about ``Latino issues'' like civil rights and
bilingual education. Those are important issues, but we also talk
about mainstream issues, like the federal budget, defense, Social
Security, the economy. It's very important to talk about mainstream
issues as well as the issues we always talk about.
 &HT;    The Hispanic community is not homogeneous and not concentrated
on the same issues. The community is interested in a whole range of
issues.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  The Clinton administration has an almost eight-year-old
record in the Hispanic community. So why do you think that some
polls show Bush with greater support over Gore in the Hispanic
community?
 &HT;     A:  The polls I've seen show Gore ahead of Bush. The important
thing is the margin of victory. Bush is going to be a challenge, as
would McCain. What is key is to not take the Hispanic vote for
granted. We have to be really aggressive as far as getting the
Hispanic vote is concerned.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How do you even find the time to do this, with all the work
as energy secretary at the same time?
 &HT;     A:  Of course I don't have all the time I would like. But I'm
not the only person involved in reaching out to the Latino
community for the vice president. I'm probably the main one, but of
course not the only one.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Speaking of your day job, you recently unveiled a
departmental initiative to increase the number of Hispanics working
in the science field.
 &HT;     A:  We have a program to try to increase the number of Hispanic
scientists. We are working with several universities that have a
significant Latino population, and with groups that work with
Hispanic students, such as the Hispanic Association of Colleges and
Universities, establishing internships and scholarship programs.

 By JAMES GARCIA 
 &HT;    Colombia is not another Vietnam. But didn't the United States
learn anything from that war?
 &HT;    The policy toward Vietnam was fueled by fear and ignorance. The
U.S. government was afraid that communists were about to take over
the world. In our ignorance _ and arrogance _ we thought that
carpet bombing the North Vietnamese would convince communists
everywhere that American-style democracy was a better alternative.
 &HT;    Today, the Clinton administration and Congress worry that drug
traffickers in Colombia are trying to take over certain parts of
the world. In their ignorance, Clinton and his supporters suggest
that new legislation to send the Colombian government about $1.7
billion to battle drug traffickers _ and the Marxist rebels that
protect them _ will discourage drug lords from smuggling dangerous
narcotics into the United States.
 &HT;    As with the United States' ill-conceived plans to thwart
Communism in Vietnam, the U.S. drug policy in Colombia will fail.
 &HT;    Colombia's civil war has dragged on for 40 years. To date, about
35,000 people _ mostly civilians _ have been killed in the
conflict, and the death toll continues to mount. Meanwhile, the
U.S. government's involvement in Colombia continues to deepen.
 &HT;    U.S. military advisors routinely provide special training to
Colombia's armed forces. The Drug Enforcement Administration is
involved in extensive investigations there.
 &HT;    American lives have even been lost. In fact, more American
soldiers have died in Colombia than in the war in Kosovo.
 &HT;    Last July, five U.S. soldiers were killed in Colombia when their
airplane slammed into the Andes Mountains during an anti-drug spy
mission. Their deaths, however, attracted little attention by the
U.S. media.
 &HT;    On March 20, Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, explained the U.S. military's mission in Colombia.
 &HT;    ``One of the threats to America's interest is the large amount
of drugs that come in from that region,'' Shelton said during a
press conference at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, where the
soldiers who died were once stationed. ``It is in America's
interest, I think, to do whatever we can to slow the amount of
drugs coming in.''
 &HT;    Colombia produces about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in
the United States. It is also a major producer of heroin and
marijuana. Last year, Colombian traffickers earned an estimated
$3.5 billion dealing drugs. During that same period, according the
National Association of Financial Institutions, Colombia earned
$3.7 billion producing oil, its leading export.
 &HT;    Shelton did not mention Colombia's rebel armies, which control
about 50 percent of the countryside. We're not officially at war
with them. But no one believes that Colombia's military _ slated to
receive about 75 percent of the $1.7 billion in U.S. aid _ will not
hesitate to use the U.S.-made Blackhawk helicopters it plans to
purchase against rebels if given half a chance.
 &HT;    And since the guerrillas are led by the 17,000-strong
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which is known to
protect the drug traffickers, there should be plenty of
opportunities.
 &HT;    FARC officials who are involved in peace negotiations with the
Colombian government say the U.S. aid package will only fuel the
war. If the Colombian military uses the added resources to mount a
major military offensive, the rebels vow to strike back hard.
 &HT;    We should also ask ourselves if the Colombian government even
deserves to receive any U.S. aid, especially in light of its record
of military abuses against civilians.
 &HT;    In late February, the U.S. State Department issued a stinging
report charging that in 1999 ``government forces continued to
commit numerous, serious abuses'' that included murders and
torture. The report also documented formal links between the army
and right-wing paramilitary death squads, which, like the rebels,
have profited from the international drug trade. ``Paramilitary
forces find a ready support base within the military and police,''
the State Department concluded.
 &HT;    For his part, Colombian President Andres Pastrana, like his
predecessors, pledged to crack down on human-rights abuses
committed by the government's armed forces. Like his predecessors,
hehas failed to live up to that promise.
 &HT;    In December, Pastrana vetoed a bill that would have created a
government agency to search for thousands of missing leftists and
made genocide an official crime. The United Nations has been urging
Colombia to approve the legislation for the past 12 years. Critics
say Pastrana bowed to pressure from the military, which claimed the
proposed legislation would hamper its efforts against the rebels.
 &HT;    In the end, any money and equipment given to the Colombian
military will be used to fight the rebels and the drug traffickers.
As a result, the war will widen and many more Colombians will die.
 &HT;    As for the drug traffickers, they will simply wait to ship their
goods another day.

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nobody wants to publicly admit it, but the Republican Party can
forget about reaping the benefits of the black vote in the first
presidential election of this new millennium.
 &HT;    Come November 2000, African-Americans _ regardless of social
class or region _ will probably vote for Vice President Al Gore in
overwhelming percentages.
 &HT;    Although blacks have appeared as incorrigible Democrats since
the second term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the current
crystallization of black attitudes has been decades in the making.
In the minds of a large majority of black voters, the image of
present-day Republican leadership has become near permanently
etched as ``the enemy.''
 &HT;    In the old days, the black man's true enemies were Southern
Democrats, and their Northern allies, who were willing to maintain
or tolerate Jim Crow at any cost. The Southern-based enemy was
adamantly opposed to any governmental interference that might
assure equal voting rights, equal access to education, fair
employment, fair housing or even protection from lynch mobs.
 &HT;    Back then, blacks considered the word ``enemy'' as synonymous
with ``Southern Democrat.''
 &HT;    Even when Northern politicians of good will occupied the White
House, the Senate, the House of Representatives or the U.S. Supreme
Court, their private sentiments were consistently nullified by a
deference to Southern Democrats. Consequently, the horrendous lynch
mob activity of the 1920s never resulted in the passage of an
anti-lynching bill.
 &HT;    Yet, since Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s and 1940s blacks
have made great strides under the administrations of Presidents
Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton _
all Southern Democrats.
 &HT;    Step by step, the GOP's counter southern strategy has wrought
success. It broke up the ``Solid South'' by giving conservative
Democrats a new identity. Meet the New Southern Republican, who can
now work shamelessly in open concert in right-wing crusades that
cross all regional boundaries.
 &HT;    The heart of this political dynamic is not confined to the
right-to-life crusades against abortion, or the end of big
government and the cessation of big taxes. Slap dab in the middle
is the right to contain _ if not stop _ any further concessions or
``giveaways'' to blacks.
 &HT;    Stopping affirmative action is central to the Republican appeal.
Even when it tries to soften that goal by displaying a few blacks
in upfront positions, the strategy is in motion.
 &HT;    Time after time, at crucial moments, the Republican strategy has
been to send a clear, not-so-subtle message to the white South,
which declares: ``We sympathize with you on the race issue.'' Here
is a chronology for that message, which could not be missed by any
knowledgeable black.
 &HT;    When Gov. Ronald Reagan, patron saint of Republicanism, launched
his southern crusade for the presidency, he chose little
Philadelphia, Miss., to kickoff his drive.
 &HT;    Philadelphia's only previous claim to fame was providing a site
for the 1964 murder of three youthful civil workers: James E.
Chaney, a black, Michael H. Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, both
white.
 &HT;    When Richard Nixon announced his presidential bid in the
Midwest, he chose Pontiac, Mich., which had gained recent notoriety
by the highly publicized burning of integration-bound schoolbuses.
 &HT;    Who tried to scare the daylights out of white folks with the
likes of imprisoned killer Willie Horton turned loose to roam your
streets? None other than strategists for Vice President George
Bush, a group that used race to catapult Bush into the White House.
 &HT;    When in this new millennium Gov. George W. Bush chose Bob Jone's
University to launch his South Carolina campaign for the
presidency, he was not breaking ground. He merely was following
suit. His willing presence at the university was a proclamation.
 &HT;    After the Bob Jones scenario, it was patently evident that Bush
would chose ``neutrality'' on the Confederate flag flying over
South Carolina's capitol dome, thereby offering fresh solace to
this homage to slavery and racism.
 &HT;    Bush and all GOP presidential candidates simply acted out the
New Republican Tradition on Race.
 &HT;    It is racially offensive to suggest that African-Americans do
not see or understand what is going on. Don't be misled by the few
cheerful black faces occasionally seen on the evening news nodding
agreement with Republican speakers.
 &HT;    I have never seen any candidate for the presidency, however
repugnant his advocacy, who could not find a black supporter. But
last week I welcomed one hint of resistance from within the GOP as
I watched CNN's television coverage of California's black
anti-affirmative action campaigner Ward Connerly in Dallas.
 &HT;    Answering a question from his near all-white audience, Connerly
conceded that Congress' lone black Republican, Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, disagreed with Connerly's campaign, calling it ill-timed.
 &HT;    So, let us give thanks for even microscopic concessions to
reality. However, the die is cast because the GOP has too many
promises to keep with former Democrats.

Telecom, as the company decided to partner only with the Big Three.
 &HT;    But because of their tenacity, Bitro joined AT&AMP;T, MCI and Sprint
in providing long-distance phone service to Korea through Korea
Telecom.
 &HT;    Bitro soon emerged as a leading carrier of voice and data to and
from Korea, surpassing MCI and Sprint. During December 1999, Bitro
handled nearly as much AT&AMP;T, according to Korea Telecom sources.
Now, Bitro is earning over $1 million a month in revenue, with
prospects for future growth. Bitro will expand by merging and
acquiring other companies with direct connections throughout Asia.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, this is a far different picture from when the
company first started in April 1998.
 &HT;    Bitro's founders, composed primarily of 1.5- and
second-generation Korean Americans, struggled in the early months
of operation. Several of them gave up their salaries in order to
preserve every penny of scarce capital. There were numerous
occasions when consecutive nights were spent in the office with
little regard to personal hygiene.
 &HT;    They familiarized themselves with the telecommunications
technology, spending countless hours reading manuals and complex
technical guides. When they called Lucent Technologies for
technical assistance on a switch that they just bought, the Bitro
engineers were the ones that figured out how to make it function
properly, not the Lucent technicians.
 &HT;    Designing and implementing advanced telecommunications systems
presented an enormous challenge, but with sweat and a lot of luck,
their resilience paid off.
 &HT;    When the first call to Korea was made over their system to the
mother of Chris Lee, Bitro's chief financial officer and founder,
tears fell from the eyes of all the founders. Lee commented that
his mother's voice never sounded sweeter.
 &HT;    Bitro will now promote the use of advanced technology to offer
traditional voice and data products at competitive prices. Bitro
CEO and President Tae Joon Kim envisions integrating the Internet
with traditional phone products and new value-added services. One
thing the Bitro pioneers never wanted was to position the company
as a traditional telecom company, let alone a typical Korean
company. But one of the keys to Bitro's success is that it operates
as an American corporation with a strong understanding and
appreciation for Korean culture.
 &HT;    ``We are Koreans, and we are an American company,'' says Patrick
Kim, vice president.
 &HT;    By capitalizing on its dual cultural and philosophical
identities, Bitro hopes to innovate the ways people communicate
globally in the new millennium.

 By PATRICIA GUADALUPE  
 &HT;    Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is the highest-ranking Hispanic
in the Clinton Administration.
 &HT;    A former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and New Mexico
congressman, he helped secure congressional approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
 &HT;    Lately, he's been using his international contacts to press for
lower oil prices worldwide.
 &HT;    Richardson also is helping with Hispanic outreach for the Gore
for President campaign, and his name has been bandied about as a
possible vice-presidential candidate on the Gore ticket.
 &HT;    Here, he talks about politics and other matters.
 &HT;    ----
 &HT;     Q:  Is the country ready for a Hispanic vice president?
 &HT;     A:  Yes, absolutely. The American public is ready to accept a
Hispanic candidate. I think it would not only be a pleasant
surprise, it would be right on target and make sense.
 &HT;    If it doesn't happen in this election, it'll happen in the next.
But I won't speculate that I will be the one. It's a presidential
candidate's call. I'm not campaigning for the job. I don't think I
would be the only one to be considered.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What are some of the things you are doing as part of the
Gore campaign's outreach efforts within the Hispanic community?
 &HT;     A:  We have a group of Hispanic leaders and legislators,
Ganamos con Gore, and we have been meeting to get a strong
organization going in support of the vice president. He has good
support in the Hispanic community, but Bush and McCain have a
greater impact on the Hispanic community than other Republican
candidates.
 &HT;    I think we are going to win, but what we don't want is for the
Republicans to get more than 30 percent of the vote. If that
happens, it could negatively affect our numbers in several states.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Are you worried about the Republican candidates' appeal in
the Hispanic community?
 &HT;     A:  Yes, because Bush and McCain have run in states with large
Hispanic populations. They've been successful in appealing to
Hispanics and they haven't acted like other Republican candidates
who have been totally negative toward the Latino community. It's a
challenge.
 &HT;    The main challenge is making sure that their percentage of the
Latino vote doesn't rise. (The GOP's all-time high of 40 percent of
the Hispanic vote occurred with President Reagan in 1984.)
 &HT;    If the Republican candidate gets 40 percent of the vote, for
instance, that would be a serious problem for the Democratic Party,
because it would be in key states for us, like California, Florida,
Texas, Illinois, New York.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  The meetings that you are involved in with Ganamos con Gore
_ how are you developing a strategy targeted to the Hispanic
community?
 &HT;     A:  We've been traveling all over the place _ New Hampshire,
Iowa, California, New York. There are many members of the group who
are working as volunteers in those and other states.
 &HT;    Part of our plan is to organize every state and to also do some
fund raising for the campaign. And I'm not just talking about
getting elected officials involved. We want to have a real
grassroots campaign, and we're working to appeal to the younger
generation in our community, with issues like the global economy
and technology.
 &HT;    We also are talking to the community about a whole range of
issues, not just about ``Latino issues'' like civil rights and
bilingual education. Those are important issues, but we also talk
about mainstream issues, like the federal budget, defense, Social
Security, the economy. It's very important to talk about mainstream
issues as well as the issues we always talk about.
 &HT;    The Hispanic community is not homogeneous and not concentrated
on the same issues. The community is interested in a whole range of
issues.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  The Clinton administration has an almost eight-year-old
record in the Hispanic community. So why do you think that some
polls show Bush with greater support over Gore in the Hispanic
community?
 &HT;     A:  The polls I've seen show Gore ahead of Bush. The important
thing is the margin of victory. Bush is going to be a challenge, as
would McCain. What is key is to not take the Hispanic vote for
granted. We have to be really aggressive as far as getting the
Hispanic vote is concerned.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How do you even find the time to do this, with all the work
as energy secretary at the same time?
 &HT;     A:  Of course I don't have all the time I would like. But I'm
not the only person involved in reaching out to the Latino
community for the vice president. I'm probably the main one, but of
course not the only one.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Speaking of your day job, you recently unveiled a
departmental initiative to increase the number of Hispanics working
in the science field.
 &HT;     A:  We have a program to try to increase the number of Hispanic
scientists. We are working with several universities that have a
significant Latino population, and with groups that work with
Hispanic students, such as the Hispanic Association of Colleges and
Universities, establishing internships and scholarship programs.

 By JAMES GARCIA 
 &HT;    Colombia is not another Vietnam. But didn't the United States
learn anything from that war?
 &HT;    The policy toward Vietnam was fueled by fear and ignorance. The
U.S. government was afraid that communists were about to take over
the world. In our ignorance _ and arrogance _ we thought that
carpet bombing the North Vietnamese would convince communists
everywhere that American-style democracy was a better alternative.
 &HT;    Today, the Clinton administration and Congress worry that drug
traffickers in Colombia are trying to take over certain parts of
the world. In their ignorance, Clinton and his supporters suggest
that new legislation to send the Colombian government about $1.7
billion to battle drug traffickers _ and the Marxist rebels that
protect them _ will discourage drug lords from smuggling dangerous
narcotics into the United States.
 &HT;    As with the United States' ill-conceived plans to thwart
Communism in Vietnam, the U.S. drug policy in Colombia will fail.
 &HT;    Colombia's civil war has dragged on for 40 years. To date, about
35,000 people _ mostly civilians _ have been killed in the
conflict, and the death toll continues to mount. Meanwhile, the
U.S. government's involvement in Colombia continues to deepen.
 &HT;    U.S. military advisors routinely provide special training to
Colombia's armed forces. The Drug Enforcement Administration is
involved in extensive investigations there.
 &HT;    American lives have even been lost. In fact, more American
soldiers have died in Colombia than in the war in Kosovo.
 &HT;    Last July, five U.S. soldiers were killed in Colombia when their
airplane slammed into the Andes Mountains during an anti-drug spy
mission. Their deaths, however, attracted little attention by the
U.S. media.
 &HT;    On March 20, Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, explained the U.S. military's mission in Colombia.
 &HT;    ``One of the threats to America's interest is the large amount
of drugs that come in from that region,'' Shelton said during a
press conference at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, where the
soldiers who died were once stationed. ``It is in America's
interest, I think, to do whatever we can to slow the amount of
drugs coming in.''
 &HT;    Colombia produces about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in
the United States. It is also a major producer of heroin and
marijuana. Last year, Colombian traffickers earned an estimated
$3.5 billion dealing drugs. During that same period, according the
National Association of Financial Institutions, Colombia earned
$3.7 billion producing oil, its leading export.
 &HT;    Shelton did not mention Colombia's rebel armies, which control
about 50 percent of the countryside. We're not officially at war
with them. But no one believes that Colombia's military _ slated to
receive about 75 percent of the $1.7 billion in U.S. aid _ will not
hesitate to use the U.S.-made Blackhawk helicopters it plans to
purchase against rebels if given half a chance.
 &HT;    And since the guerrillas are led by the 17,000-strong
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which is known to
protect the drug traffickers, there should be plenty of
opportunities.
 &HT;    FARC officials who are involved in peace negotiations with the
Colombian government say the U.S. aid package will only fuel the
war. If the Colombian military uses the added resources to mount a
major military offensive, the rebels vow to strike back hard.
 &HT;    We should also ask ourselves if the Colombian government even
deserves to receive any U.S. aid, especially in light of its record
of military abuses against civilians.
 &HT;    In late February, the U.S. State Department issued a stinging
report charging that in 1999 ``government forces continued to
commit numerous, serious abuses'' that included murders and
torture. The report also documented formal links between the army
and right-wing paramilitary death squads, which, like the rebels,
have profited from the international drug trade. ``Paramilitary
forces find a ready support base within the military and police,''
the State Department concluded.
 &HT;    For his part, Colombian President Andres Pastrana, like his
predecessors, pledged to crack down on human-rights abuses
committed by the government's armed forces. Like his predecessors,
hehas failed to live up to that promise.
 &HT;    In December, Pastrana vetoed a bill that would have created a
government agency to search for thousands of missing leftists and
made genocide an official crime. The United Nations has been urging
Colombia to approve the legislation for the past 12 years. Critics
say Pastrana bowed to pressure from the military, which claimed the
proposed legislation would hamper its efforts against the rebels.
 &HT;    In the end, any money and equipment given to the Colombian
military will be used to fight the rebels and the drug traffickers.
As a result, the war will widen and many more Colombians will die.
 &HT;    As for the drug traffickers, they will simply wait to ship their
goods another day.

 &HT;    Community groups face competition from nonprofits for foundation
funds
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a record level of foundation giving,
community groups say they are scrambling for their share of the
funding pie.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound contradictory, given that the nation's
foundations shelled out 17 percent more last year than they did in
1998 _ nearly $23 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But community organizations say they are competing against a
growing number of nonprofit groups for the same dollars. And they
are facing an environment where foundations are targeting their
donations for specific causes.
</P>
<P>
   Where foundations once gave to social service organizations,
they are increasingly giving to groups that address narrow issues
such as building homes for the homeless or providing computer
training in inner city schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not this plethora of new money out there,'' said Rick
McKelvey, vice president for development of the Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra. ``Most community organizations are working harder than
ever to get a smaller share of funding.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason foundations are targeting their funding is to achieve
greater impact, said Sara Engelhardt, president of the Foundation
Center, a New York-based nonprofit organization that tracks
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many big social issues out there that any one
foundation is a relatively small piece of the answer,'' Engelhardt
said. ``So foundations try to bite off the piece that they think
will have the most impact.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is giving
$750 million over five years to vaccinate children in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But a reduction in government funding is another reason why
community groups are finding such a competitive environment,
Engelhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Jackson-Randolph, artistic director of Atlanta-based
Jomandi Productions, felt that hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based theater production company saw its funding
from the National Endowment of the Arts sliced in half over the
last four years. That, coupled with a loss in revenue, has left the
theater group with a $250,000 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that there is more money available than ever
before, yet so little spent on arts, Jackson-Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more money out there, but we are fighting to keep art
and culture in our lives,'' she said. ``There is a mentality out
there that arts and culture should be marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Causes such as improving education and revitalizing communities
should be funded, she said, but not at the expense of supporting
art and culture.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of nonprofits increasing by some 30,000 each
year, organizations must constantly search for new funding sources,
said Mark O'Connell, president of the United Way of Metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell understands why foundations are targeting their funds
for specific causes. He sees that they can have a greater impact.
But he worries that some foundations are limiting their donations
to groups that bring them greater name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to be a public relations grant, rather than a
community betterment grant,'' O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell is concerned that a number of foundations no longer
follow the creed of Robert W. Woodruff: ``There's no limit to what
a man can accomplish, or the good he can do, if he doesn't care who
gets the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture is changing,'' O'Connell said. ``It used to be
that you didn't give to look good, you gave to do good. Now they
want to do good and look good.''
</P>
<P>
   If nonprofits are going to be successful, they are going to have
to diversify their funding sources, said Alicia Philipp, president
of the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that community groups appeal to individuals rather
than relying on foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the worry over funding, Philipp said, the good news is
that there is more money out there. ``A rising tide lifts more
boats,'' she said.

 &HT;    DaBrat not the target of gunmen
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _A barrage of bullets fired at a limousine in the
parking lot of a Buckhead apartment complex this month was not
intended for Atlanta-based rapper Da Brat, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all just a terrible coincidence,'' said Sgt. Rick
Chambers of the Atlanta Police Department's guns unit. ``The
bullets were intended for someone else. It just so happened it was
in the apartment complex where she lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Several residents at the Post Chastain Apartments were shaken
from their beds in the wee hours of March 12 when a succession of
bullets was fired at a black Toyota stretch limousine trying to
make its way out of the apartment complex on Roswell Road.
</P>
<P>
   The complex is where Shawntae Harris, known as Da Brat, lived
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   At first, police speculated the assault was retaliation aimed at
Harris. But on Wednesday, Chambers said the attack was drug-related
and meant for someone else. The targeted person may not have been
in the limo, Chambers said. Detectives would not identify that
person.
</P>
<P>
   Occupants of the vehicle that morning said they went to the
complex to drop off one of the passengers whose boyfriend lives at
the 10-building property.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants _ two masked men in a silver late-model Ford
Thunderbird _ shot at the limousine 13 times, police said. Five of
the nine passengers were hit, including the driver, who bolted from
the limousine and jumped in a patch of woods adjacent to the
property. The shooters have not been caught.
</P>
<P>
   Carmille Plummer, one of those injured, said she and her friends
had gone to a birthday party at a private house nearby. They were
calling it a night and driving one of the women in their group to
Post Chastain. Plummer said neither she nor any of the other
passengers knew Harris lived in the building adjacent to the one
where they had left the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the incident, police at the scene said the
shooting was most likely payback for Harris. The 25-year-old rapper
had gotten into a brawl with another woman March 7 at the Buckhead
nightspot Chili Pepper. A police lieutenant taking statements from
the passengers said one of the victims told him they knew Harris
and that the shooters probably thought she was in the car. The next
day, investigators said the passengers claimed they did not know
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper, who moved from the complex three days after the
shooting, was in Cancun, Mexico, when the gunfire erupted. In Miami
this week after filming a new video in Mexico, Harris told The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution she was somewhat puzzled by the
incident, but had not thought about it much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what happened?'' Harris mused. ``You would have to
ask the people who did it _ if they ever catch them.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why she had left Post Chastain, where she had lived
in a comfortable townhouse, the singer replied: ``My family moved
me. They did it for my safety. And I love them for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Charged with aggravated battery in the Chili Pepper fight,
Harris is scheduled to appear in Atlanta Municipal Court on April
13, the day before her 26th birthday.

<P>
   On Tuesday, Oseguera was at work at Cici's Pizza in Lake Worth
when a deadly tornado roared through the area. As he ran outside to
move his shiny black Mazda LX to safety, a softball-size hailstone
struck his head. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He died Wednesday without regaining consciousness. He was 19.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, his nieces and nephews were using the truck as a
jungle gym, climbing in and out of the cab and bed while their
mourning parents talked about their little brother, Carlitos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of those people who, everything had to look nice.
He'd vacuum his car out twice a week, and he wouldn't let his shirt
get dirty at work. His favorite thing to wear was his black,
steel-toe boots, black pants and yellow shirt,'' said his
girlfriend, Jennifer Mallett.
</P>
<P>
   In his small, immaculate apartment behind his stepsister and
brother's house in north Fort Worth, Oseguera kept an ironing
board, black shoe polish, a brand new pair of soccer cleats still
in the box and a backpack full of schoolwork. In a note to himself,
he said he wanted to help his peers, and he underlined the acronym
``TAAS'' four times, indicating his goal of passing the state test
to obtain his high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very studious and responsible,'' said his sister, Maria
Fidelina, 26, with whom he lived for two years in Arlington after
immigrating from Honduras. Fidelina, as her family calls her, moved
to Colorado Springs with her husband three weeks ago and asked
Oseguera to go with her.
</P>
<P>
   But he decided to stay in Fort Worth with a stepsister, Lilian
Ayala, and his oldest brother, Antonio Marcos Oseguera.
</P>
<P>
   All the siblings were born in the mountainous, banana
tree-shaded town of Omonita San Manuel Cortes near El Progreso in
northwestern Honduras. Oseguera has five brothers and sisters
remaining at home with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wanted something better in life, and we always said,
all of us together could help our parents more,'' said his brother
Jose, 21, who lives in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the family must return his body to his birthplace.
Paramedics said Oseguera's skull was shattered. His stepsister and
girlfriend stayed with him through the night and day until he died
about 3 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is inconsolable,'' Fidelina said. ``He was her
favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallett, 16, said her relationship with Oseguera was secret at
first. But over the past three months, they had begun spending time
together at her house. She said they had also begun talking about
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lilian said he stayed here because of me,'' she said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An account has been established at Texas Bank to help with the
cost of returning Oseguera's body to Honduras. Donations may be
made to the Juan Carlos Fund, Account No. 2620003448, and will
accepted at any branch or by mail at Texas Bank, 300 W. Seventh
St., Fort Worth 76102.

ARTIST WHO SHOOK THE WHITNEY, NOW CHALLENGES GERMANY'S REICHSTAG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ On the western facade of the Reichstag is an old
inscription: ``Dem Deutschen Volke'' _ ``To the German People.''
Straightforward enough. But just how charged and divisive those
words are has been revealed by an outcry over a proposed work of
art for the refurbished parliamentary building.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as usual in this country, is who Germans are. Are
they still a ``Volk?'' The word is associated with
identity-through-blood, was debased by Hitler with his clamor of
``Fuhrer, Volk und Vaterland'' and further tarnished by the
pervasive ``Volkspolizei'' of the East German Communist
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Or, with 7 million foreigners in their midst and as many
restaurants offering Turkish Doner Kebab as Wurst, have Germans
moved beyond a ``volkisch'' appreciation of nationality to a more
embracing view of the German soul?
</P>
<P>
   That is the central question posed by the work that Hans Haacke,
a German artist living in New York, has proposed for the northern
courtyard of the Reichstag. Above a trough filled with earth from
throughout Germany would appear the illuminated words ``Der
Bevolkerung'' _ ``To the Population.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea has been approved, twice, by the art committee of the
parliament. According to his contract, Haacke should have already
installed the piece. But a storm of protest, involving suggestions
that the work is anticonstitutional, illegal and subversive, has
delayed its execution.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Volk,'' of course, is composed of German citizens. The
``Bevolkerung'' includes the 2.2 million Turks, more than 800,000
people from the former Yugoslavia, more than 600,000 Italians and
many others who live here.
</P>
<P>
   Haacke has touched a nerve by appearing to suggest that ``Volk''
is a discredited word and by questioning whom the German parliament
represents and for whom it should labor.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar reflects just how sensitive the issue of German
identity remains, even after the approval last year of a law making
it easier for immigrants and their children to obtain citizenship.
The suggestion that Germany is a ``land of immigration,'' a notion
strongly supported by the facts, still stirs widespread unease or
anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Germans don't altogether like being part of Germany, so
they have a lot of difficulty making up their minds about who
belongs here,'' suggested Matthias Mansen, an artist who finds the
inscription on the Reichstag disturbing. ``We have a rather twisted
relationship to our identity, which makes these issues particularly
explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, ``Bevolkerung'' does not seem a word pregnant with
explosive implications. No throb of patriotism lurks here. The word
resides more in the domain of the statistician than that of the
statesman. It means nothing more than the people, all of them, who
make up the population of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not how Peter Ramsauer and many other conservative
members of parliament see it. ``This is political art, a
provocative attempt to portray the words on the facade of the
Reichstag as nationalistic,'' he said. ``But `Volk' is just a
normal word; it's ridiculous to think Hitler tainted it forever.
German history is more than the 12 Nazi years.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the slogan of the protesting East Germans who
brought down the Berlin Wall a decade ago - ``Wir sind das Volk''
(``We are the People'') _ Ramsauer, a member of the Christian
Social Union, asked, ``Could you imagine Germany's division ending
to the cry of `We are the Population'?''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Haacke conceded that the word ``Volk''
has had some ``good meanings'' over the years. But he argued that
it was also charged with ominous connotations, thanks to the Nazis
and the East German leadership. To the artist, the word reeks of
myth, of tribes, of blood lines, of all that Germany should now
shun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juxtaposition of the two words would help make the
inscription on the Reichstag facade immune to nationalist
interpretation,'' Haacke said. ``The salutary quality of the word
`Bevolkerung' is that it is bureaucratic, dry and non-inspiring.
Because it is extremely precise, it resists myths.''
</P>
<P>
   In the artist's proposal, the words ``Der Bevolkerung'' appear
above a wood trough, 95 feet long and 23 feet wide, into which soil
from all constituencies of Germany would be shoveled by the
lawmakers representing the various areas.
</P>
<P>
   In this proposed procedure, or ceremony, the mocking allusion to
the Nazi obsession with German soil, evident in the slogan of
``Blut und Boden'' (``Blood and Soil''), seems clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   Haacke, who has aroused passions in New York through his recent
portrayal, in an exhibition at the Whitney, of Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani in a manner that seems to link some of his statements to
the Nazis, was asked in 1998 to prepare a work for the Reichstag,
which became the seat of the German parliament again last year.
</P>
<P>
   His project was approved by a vote of 9-1 in the art committee
of the parliament last November, and approved again by a smaller
margin in January after the first complaints emerged. It seemed
then that nothing could stop the execution of the $200,000
commission from one of Germany's best-known artists.
</P>
<P>
   But these votes have since been overruled by a parliamentary
body that oversees the committees, with the result that, in an
extraordinary procedure, Haacke's project is to be put to a vote of
the whole parliament, the Bundestag, probably next month. Michael
Naumann, Germany's top cultural official, opposes the work as ``an
overpriced provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most insistent arguments against the work have come
from legal scholars who have insisted it is anticonstitutional. One
of them, Dietrich Murswiek, argued that under the German
constitution, ``the German Volk, the people of the Federal Republic
of Germany, is the bearer of executive power and the subject of
politics: the function of the Bundestag is to represent the Volk.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, by suggesting that parliament should work for and
represent the Bevolkerung, Haacke's piece infringes ``the
sovereignty of the Volk and thus the fundamental principles of the
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Haacke, who has enough support here to ensure a close vote,
dismissed such arguments as absurd, saying that his work is
buttressed both by Article 3 of the constitution, which says nobody
may be prejudiced or favored because of ``his homeland and
origin,'' and by Article 5, which says art is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenuous link I see between the row over the Giuliani piece
in New York and the Reichstag work is that both involve
constitutional issues,'' he said. ``At the Whitney, I am concerned
with the First Amendment. And in Germany it seems that art is free
all over the country, except at the seat of parliament.''

&HT;     GORE SUPPORTS KEEPING CUBAN BOY IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking with President Clinton and Attorney
General Janet Reno, Vice President Al Gore urged Congress Thursday
to pass a law that would allow the fate of Elian Gonzalez to be
decided by a family court and not by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning move, Gore, the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee, took a position similar to that of his
Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the case of the
6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said Elian's case ``is a matter that should be decided
</P>
<P>
   by courts that have the experience and expertise to resolve
custody cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In a quick response, Bush said, ``I'm glad the vice president
has seen the wisdom'' of going to a state family court rather than
a federal immigration proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he ought to do is convince the attorney general and the
president to accept the same position. ... We'll see what kind of
influence he has in this administration.''The White House and
Justice Department had no comment on Gore's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's action and Bush's reaction reflected the explosive
political nature of the case and the importance of Florida, the
country's fourth largest state, in this fall's presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore blamed ``the oppressive regime'' of Cuban leader Fidel
Castro for the controversy surrounding the case, but many in the
Cuban-American community in south Florida have accused the Clinton
administration of mishandling the case.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was one of three survivors of a shipwreck in which his
mother, her boyfriend and nine others drowned when their boat sank
as they were trying to flee Cuba for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gore urged Congress to pass a law that would grant permanent
resident status to Elian and his father, stepmother, half-brother,
grandmothers and grandfather from Cuba, ``so that the case can be
adjudicated properly.''Such legislation has been introduced by Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla. A similar bill has been filed by Rep. Robert
Menendez, D-N.J. Moving toward his current position, Gore has said
previously he felt the case would be best resolved in a Florida
family court. Bush supports similar legislation introduced by
Graham's colleague, Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who also said
Thursday that the vice president should persuade Clinton and Reno
to change their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, on Thursday
applied for a visa to allow him to travel from Cuba to the United
States to take custody of his son. His move came as Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials failed to reach an agreement with
the boy's Miami relatives over how to end the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, lawyer for the Juan Gonzalez, said in Washington
that Elian's father was ``ready at a moment's notice'' to fly to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he will only come if he has assurances that he will have
custody of his son when he leaves,'' Craig said. ``The time is long
overdue for Elian to be with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, speaking at her weekly news conference at the
Justice Department, Reno declined to discuss what officials would
do if the boy's father travels to the United States.``I don't deal
in what-ifs,'' she told reporters. Since being rescued as he was
floating on an inner tube in the ocean on Nov. 25, Elian has been
living in Miami with his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has said
he would be willing to release Elian to his father if Juan Gonzalez
came to Florida from Cuba. Lazaro Gonzalez has repeatedly said he
would not deliver the boy to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently calling the great-uncle's bluff, Cuban President
Fidel Castro said Wednesday that not only would the father go to
the United States but would stay during the entire court process as
the Miami relatives appeal federal orders to surrender custody of
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Cuban government released a list of 31 people
who would accompany Juan Gonzalez, including his wife and their
6-month-old son _ Elian's half brother. The list included Ricardo
Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly and Castro's point
man on American affairs, who was listed as an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Reno called for calm in Miami's Cuban-American community _ where
many demonstrations have taken place since Elian's arrival _ but
she refused to back away from her decision to return Elian Gonzalez
to Cuba and his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a community I was born in, and raised in,'' she said at
the news conference. ``It's a community I love, and when it's
hurting, it hurts me.''Reno said she would continue to negotiate
with the Elian's Miami relatives for a ``cooperative'' agreement
that would decide the fate of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But she reiterated that the family and Miami's Cuban-American
community must respect the ``rule of law'' and abide by the ruling
of a federal district court that last week upheld the INS' decision
to return the boy to Cuba and his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been heartbreaking for everybody involved, but
we believe the law is clear,'' she said. ``The father must speak
for the little boy because there is a sacred bond that must be
honored and the boy must be reunited with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   INS officials had set a deadline of 9 a.m. Friday for an
agreement to be reached that would provide the government with
assurances that the Miami family members would give up the boy
should they lose their next court battle. The INS had threatened to
revoke Elian's temporary parole, or permission to stay in the
United States, and begin steps to deport the boy to Cuba if an
agreement wasn't reached by that time.
</P>
<P>
   But after daylong negotiations, the two sides agreed to postpone
that deadline until 9 a.m. next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the federal government is prepared ultimately to
enforce law, Reno replied, ``You bet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During her news conference, Reno also took offense at comments
by Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and other South Florida mayors
that they would hold President Clinton and Reno responsible if
violence broke out over the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I know in the Cuban community came to this country
and have contributed so much to it because they believe in the rule
of law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the INS announcement that it may revoke Elian's parole, a
growing crowd has gathered in front of the boy's home in Little
Havana to protest the government's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is provoking the community,'' Pensalas
said at rally in Miami. ``We do not condone inappropriate behavior.
But I have a responsibility to tell the federal government when
they've gone too far and they've gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelas and other mayors also have said that local law
enforcement officers would not assist federal authorities in
``repatriating the boy.'' However, the Miami mayor did give
assurances that local police would make sure that the protesters
``did not get out of hand.''

WINTER RESORTS SEARCHING FOR NEXT NEW THING
</HEADLINE>
  (mg)  
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when skiers have gotten used to a six-pack _ the six-seater
chairlift that scoops six people up at once _ along comes plans for
an eight-pack. And just when they learned to ski around big, noisy
snowmaking guns, along comes interest in making thousands of little
guns that would spread out like a sprinkling system.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of efforts by winter resorts to keep skiers and
snowboarders coming to the slopes. Fickle weather and swings in the
stock market make that job all the harder. Even with a brisk
economy, skier and snowboarder visits _ a universal quantifier
based on daily lift ticket usage _ have hovered at the 50 million
mark for nearly a decade. Who among the industry managers has an
idea for breaking up the ice?
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives are focusing on the personal likes and
dislikes of their guests, on and off the slopes. Others are banking
on the next generation, the children of the post-war baby boomers _
the so-called echo boomers. Many are preteen-agers and teen-agers
who thrive on skiing and snowboarding, skateboarding, inline
skating and motocross racing, all in the extreme sports genre.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few views of trends in the skiing industry as
expressed in telephone interviews with the management at four of
the largest resort companies in North America:
</P>
<P>
   Les Otten, American Skiing Co., Bethel, Maine.: Lack of snow
during the December holidays cut into the busiest time of the
season for American Skiing Co. So did Year 2000 computer worries,
which Otten, chairman of the company that owns nine ski resorts
nationwide, believes kept skiers at home. In the future, he sees
such short-term vagaries having less impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``What comes through for the future is an extraordinarily strong
trend in young people entering the sport of skiing and
snowboarding,'' Otten said. ``I think we'll see the trend continue
on over the horizon, and that's going to have a very positive
effect. It's the clearest bright spot that we can easily
identify.''
</P>
<P>
   George Gillet Jr., Booth Creek Holdings, Vail, Colo.: Gillet is
counting on the increasing importance of what he calls the boutique
ski areas _ those small-town, mostly out-of-the-way places that
develop a personality. Gillet's group owns eight resorts, including
Grand Targhee, Wyo., which it bought just recently, partly because
it is one of those destination resorts.
</P>
<P>
   He said that capital expenditures at ski areas _ such as adding
chairlifts, gondolas, restaurants and lodges _ is less important
than improving amenities. ``Capital expenditure was king, but now
the guest is back in,'' Gillet said. ``It's a total integration of
golfing, skiing, great food and hotels. I call it retro _ it may be
a little harder to get to such places, but people will probably
stay a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Pitoniak, Intrawest, Vancouver, British Columbia: Pitoniak
believes that the new generation will bring a change in style. The
industry estimates that half of all 16-year-olds who go to mountain
resorts are on snowboards rather than skis; that compares to
snowboarders of all ages making up about 23 percent of all skier
visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the choices in the last 10 years, especially for
girls, have been team sports,'' said Pitoniak, whose company owns
10 ski resorts. ``Now it's action sports. The kids live these
intense lives at school Monday through Friday, and on the weekends,
they just want to tear the lid off and let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Tebo, Boyne USA, Boyne Falls, Mich.: People want
alternatives in their holiday, said Tebo, whose company owns five
ski resorts. Access to the Internet in particular makes it more
difficult for resorts to attract skiers; with one or two clicks of
a mouse, a person can instantly find another place if they do not
like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the trend is going to be that people will look at us
on a daily basis to see what we're offering on any one day,'' he
said. ``We are a society who changes its minds constantly. We are
in the entertainment business now, not fitness.''

RARE HAIL DEATH OCCURRED DURING TEXAS TWISTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Defying odds, the storm that struck this
city Tuesday night caused one death and one injury from hail.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Oseguera, 19, died Wednesday from the head injury he
got from baseball-size hail produced by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   One of four people confirmed dead, Oseguera &UR;  &LR; was attempting to
move his truck outside the fast-food restaurant where he worked
when he was struck. Two of the people killed in the storm died from
falling debris and a third drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Studies cited by the National Weather Service show that while
hail causes more property damage yearly than any other natural
disaster, it results in fewer than five deaths nationally each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost surprising that it doesn't'' kill more people,
said Bill Proenza, southern regional director for the National
Weather Service in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider that a hailstone the size of a baseball is
harder than that baseball and is traveling at 100 mph plus, it's
not surprising that it could kill someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Proenza cited a study at the University of Oklahoma that shows
tornadoes cause 125 deaths annually; lightning, 110; flash floods,
165; and hail, ``fewer than 5.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, people can make it to shelter,'' said Proenza.
</P>
<P>
   David Johnson, 70, couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   When the storm struck, Johnson was working in the yard of his
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always heard the bathtub was the safest place to get in a
tornado and that's where I was headed when the hail struck,'' he
said. ``It was about golf-ball size, and it knocked me around.
Then, the west wall of my house fell over on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson received head injuries and bruises as a combination of
the hail and the collapsed wall. He was in good condition Thursday
at Harris Hospital and expected to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And, as search and rescue operations ended Thursday, city
officials said no further victims of the storms had been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We searched 10 of the major buildings without finding
anyone,'' said Fire &UR;  &LR; Chief &UR;  &LR; Larry McMillen. ``The search team
members have been sent home.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry officials estimate that up to $450 million in
damage was caused by two tornadoes that swept through this
metropolitan area of 1.3 million people, hitting hardest in
downtown Fort Worth and nearby neighborhoods in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   McMillen said the assessment of damage remained unchanged
Thursday, with eight commercial structures destroyed, 27 with major
damage and 15 with minor damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Cash America Building, the most extensively damaged office
building in the city, appeared to be a loss, said the chief. ``I'm
not an engineer, but I'd guess it will have to be demolished.''
</P>
<P>
   The building housed an FBI office, which lost many of its
documents when they were blown out the sixth-floor window. About 20
FBI agents wearing disposable gloves sifted through scraps of
debris, searching for sensitive files.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we don't know if we lost sensitive files,'' FBI

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you tune in Saturday afternoon to the Texaco Opera
Quiz, the popular intermission feature that is part of the live
radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, don't be surprised if
the three panelists sound rather young to be experts.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Speight, 15, is a sophomore in the vocal music department
of the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston.
Mahan Esfahani, 16, a classical pianist and theater enthusiast, is
a junior at Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, Md. Evan
Diamond, 17, a senior from East Meadow High School in New York who
plays saxophone in his school jazz band, has become an opera
enthusiast through taking college-level Italian courses.
</P>
<P>
   If these students are not yet experts, they are at least
experts-in-training. They are the Texaco Quiz Kids, as the
producers of the broadcasts are calling this first-ever panel of
high school students. Their knowledge and suitability have been
tested through a series of regional competitions in the New York,
Houston and Washington areas. A total of 57 students from 18
schools competed. Three semifinalists were selected in each region.
Final rounds in the three cities produced the three panelists who
will be on the air tomorrow during the second intermission of
Wagner's ``Walkure.'' (The quiz should start about 3:35 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   These panelists will hold the same seats once occupied by such
renowned authorities and raconteurs as the conductor Boris
Goldovsky, the critic and translator Andrew Porter and the
mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne.
</P>
<P>
   For making it to the panel, each student has won a crystal
trophy; gift certificates to Texaco's online store; a parcel of
CDs; a free trip to New York for themselves, a parent and a
teacher; seats in the Texaco box for Saturday's performance; a
private backstage tour of the Met; tickets to ``Kiss Me Kate'' on
Broadway; and, of course, the experience of being a panelist on the
quiz program, heard by millions of opera buffs on more than 325
stations in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and 27
European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The producer of the intermissions features, Michael Bronson,
thinks presenting what he expects to become an annual Texaco Quiz
Kids panel is a logical step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original mission statement from Texaco when the company
started sponsoring the broadcasts in 1940 was that the intermission
features should be entertaining and informative,'' Bronson said.
``One area I felt we could do better with was in making listeners
aware of the importance of music education: that young people can
and do enjoy opera. This is critical if we are going to have people
sitting in the seats 20 or 30 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronson said that his office often receives letters and quiz
questions from listeners seeking advice on how to introduce opera
to children. The idea of a student panel grew out of talks among
Bronson; Diane Herzman, who is the manager of the
Texaco-Metropolitan Opera sponsorship; and David Dick, the director
of education for the Metropolitan Opera Guild, which was founded in
1935 and is the oldest outreach department of any American opera
company.
</P>
<P>
   Bronson proudly reported that for the final round in Washington
in February, held at the auditorium of the American Film Institute
in the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a teacher from a
participating school brought her whole class to see the final
face-off. Esfahani, the winner, was presented his award by Supreme
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a big opera fan.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is the first year of the Texaco Quiz Kids project,
the organizers limited the search for panelists. ``The idea was to
reward schools that already included the study of opera, and the
attendance of operas, as part of their curriculums,'' Bronson said.
The Met's Opera Guild has long run such outreach programs, as has
the Houston Grand Opera and the Washington Opera, which is why
those cities were the first selected.
</P>
<P>
   A chance to see how the competition worked came in mid-February,
when the three semifinalists from the New York region assembled for
the showdown at the studios of WQXR in Manhattan, which carries the
opera broadcasts. The oldest regional semifinalist was Ali Kagan,
18, a soft-spoken and articulate woman who attends the Gunnery, a
private school in Washington, Conn. Her musical background is
limited to a few years of flute lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do listen to the opera broadcasts on occasion,'' she said
before the final round started. ``At least when I am not with
friends on Saturday who don't really appreciate opera as much as I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a young opera fan can still brand you among your peers,
she said. This is something the Texaco Quiz Kids project is working
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan was introduced to opera by the teacher who runs the
humanities program at her school, Tom Adolphson, whose dogs are
named Fasolt and Fafner after the giants in Wagner's ``Ring.'' He
organizes regular school trips to dress rehearsals at the Met.
``These kids are closer to this art form than they realize,''
Adolphson said. ``I always tell them that everything they see on
the opera stage in the evening is played out in terms of drama at
the student center every day.''
</P>
<P>
   William Zaientz, 17, is, like Diamond, a student at East Meadow
High. Though he has never studied music formally, he is a budding
opera fan who became interested while doing a research project on
Galileo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out that Galileo's father, the composer Vincenzo
Galilei, was a member of the Camerata Florentina, where opera
started,'' he said. Zaientz had never attended an opera until he
went on class trips to Met rehearsals of ``Cavalleria Rusticana''
and ``Pagliacci,'' and ``Rigoletto.'' He was amazed, he said.
``Going there live, not just hearing the music, but seeing the
staging, everything at once, the intense emotions which inspired
the audience, including me _ it was all incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond was introduced to opera through his teacher Frank
McLarney, who runs the foreign languages department at East Meadow
High and has used opera as a teaching tool for his Italian classes
since 1975. ``I was selected to compete for the Opera Quiz panel on
the basis of my Italian studies,'' Diamond said. ``I had come in
second in the United States and Canada in the American Association
of Teachers of Italian exam.'' The students in McLarney's Italian
classes study two librettos each year, coordinated to the Met's
schedule, so that they can attend the operas as well.
nn
</P>
<P>
   The final round for the New York region was essentially a tryout
opera quiz. The three students were seated before microphones in
the radio studio and asked questions by Dick of the Opera Guild.
Seated discreetly behind them were the judges: Thomas Bartunek, the
president of WQXR; Susan Braddock, the president of the
Metropolitan Opera Guild; and Mary Jo Lassen, who teaches
kindergarteners through fifth graders at Public School 314 in
Brooklyn, about opera, the only teacher in the New York City public
school system to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The judges were interested not just in what the students knew,
but also in whether they could share their knowledge with relaxed
enthusiasm. To reduce the tension, the students had been instructed
to focus their preparation on three operas: Mozart's ``Don
Giovanni,'' Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' and Verdi's
``Rigoletto.'' They were also given the first question in advance,
a standard inquiry about how they got into opera and what they
liked about it.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond seemed eager to answer this question. ``Opera is a
classic multimedia art form,'' he said. ``Look at the quartet from
`Rigoletto,' which Victor Hugo greatly admired. Opera is the only
art form that can express what four people are thinking at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaientz, whose subdued manner does not mask his strong opinions,
compared opera favorably to rock videos, which are so popular among
students at his school. ``Music videos are really quite routine,
remedial and emotionally vapid,'' he said. ``Opera is so rich with
excitement and tension. That's the draw for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the prepared question had been dealt with, Kagan was asked
about the types of love relationships in the three operas. She made
some telling points about the superficiality of Don Giovanni's
out-of-control passions, and also discussed the hurtful way Lucia
and her secret beloved are kept apart because of the hatred between
their families, comparing it to the outside pressure on their lives
that students feel today. Diamond was asked how anger and betrayal
play a role in the operas. His answer, in which he described family
betrayals in ``Rigoletto,'' class conflicts in ``Don Giovanni'' and
sectarian rivalries in ``Lucia,'' may have won him the day.
</P>
<P>
   When the questioning ended, the judges retired to another room
to deliberate, and then, with congratulations to all the
contestants, announced that Diamond would be going to the
broadcast. Applause and whoops filled the small room, and everyone
headed to a table of cookies, cheese and soda to celebrate. ``It
was a wonderful experience,'' Kagan confided, ``but I think I'm
relieved that it's Evan and not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's quiz may well be high-pressured. As always, the
questions have been sent in by listeners, but this time they have
been selected with a sensitivity to the abilities of the young
panelists, Bronson said. The questioner Saturday will be the critic
Martin Bernheimer, an avuncular and frequent quiz host, who is good
at getting stumped panelists to relax.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's Texaco Opera Quiz can be heard Saturday afternoon
on the Texaco-Metropolitan Opera International Radio Broadcast of
``Die Walkure,'' by Wagner, at the Metropolitan Opera House. The
opera, starring Jane Eaglen, Deborah Voigt, Hanna Schwarz, Placido
Domingo, James Morris and Eric Halfvarson, begins at 12:30 p.m. The
quiz takes place during the opera's second intermission, starting
around 3:35 p.m. . Information on broadcasts around the United
States and in more than 30 other countries is available at

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ With John McCain off the bus and back in the
Senate, and George W. Bush back in Texas and off to try to avenge
his father's 1992 defeat, reporters with time on their hands are
musing about whether Bush can woo McCain voters.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Bush had better hurry. Someone else has his eye on them.
Patrick J. Buchanan, the fearless storyteller, is known for
stirring the pot, challenging convention and going against the
grain. Now pursuing the presidential nomination of the Reform
Party, Buchanan is targeting the followers of McCain, who built a
presidential campaign on stirring the pot, challenging convention,
and going against the grain. A recent ``Newsweek'' poll suggests
that McCain voters are up for grabs. Only 41 percent of McCain
voters said they would support Bush, while 48 percent sooner would
back Al Gore. So much for the allure of campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alibi Al'' outdid himself when questioned about 45 illegal
phone calls made from his office. Gore, who has denied a
``controlling legal authority'' over the calls, told investigators
that he drank iced tea during briefings and could have been in the
men's room when the law was discussed: The vice president's defense
has gone from no legal control to no bladder control.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's control over McCain supporters is just as weak. Chaos
brings opportunity, and Buchanan sees in such chaos an opportunity
to market himself as the reformer in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan began the marketing campaign at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government. Gone was the humorless, combative and
intolerant firebrand who in 1992 declared the country engaged in a
``culture war.'' In his place, stood a kinder and gentler Pat
Buchanan eager to discuss what he called the ``only real issue'':
campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Like a boxer alternating between rights and lefts, Buchanan
rattled off abuses by both parties. Moving from Maria Tsia to the
Wyly brothers to the Buddist Temple, he confused the audience,
which must have felt like booing one minute and cheering the next.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Washington is hooked on money, and neither party
can kick the addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Beltway party is going to drain this swamp, because to
them it isn't a swamp at all, but a protected wetland and their
natural habitat,'' he told the audience. ``They swim in it, feed in
it and spawn in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan called for campaign contributions to be voluntary and
come from individuals, not corporations or unions. He also said
members of Congress should have to raise half of their funds within
their districts.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of students tried to use Buchanan's own words against
him with questions about things he had written. That was easy. The
guy's paper trail is a four-lane highway. Self-identified Democrats
who in 1992 excused Bill Clinton's marijuana use and draft-dodging
as youthful indiscretions rushed to judge Buchanan for words
scribbled 20 years ago. Buchanan didn't flinch, equivocate or claim
that he was in the bathroom. Asked about a column in which he wrote
that ethnic Catholics and Christians are underrepresented and
discriminated against at Harvard, Buchanan tossed the grenade back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply because you're at Harvard does not exempt you from the
same kind of rules and regulations that Harvard lovingly imposes
upon the rest of America,'' he said. ``Pat Buchanan is not a
beloved figure in America, but neither is Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan didn't take any guff from the Ivy Leaguers. And they
loved it. Given that a recent poll by the school's Shorenstein
Center found that 87 percent of respondents believed politicians
will say anything, Buchanan scored points for saying what he
believed and challenging listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Who does that sound like? No wonder Buchanan thinks he has a
shot at McCain supporters. If America really wants straight talk,
then the talk doesn't get any straighter than coming from Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The inference will be unsettling to McCain, who has been a harsh
critic of Buchanan. The lads can't even agree on World War II.
After Buchanan raised the question of whether the United States
needed to go to war against Hitler, McCain, whose grandfather
commanded operations in the Pacific, fumed. Asked by a reporter if
he thought Buchanan should leave the Republican Party, McCain said,
``Mr. Buchanan has already left my Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   When Buchanan did leave, McCain wished him good riddance with
the words of a country music song: ``Thank God and Greyhound,
you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The similarities, and differences, between the two men raise a
question: If Buchanan gets the Reform Party nomination, how will
his third-party candidacy go over in McCain's back yard of Arizona?
In a state divided into haves and have-not, Buchanan's populist
reform message may play well with those who feel disconnected from
the political process, like the poor, the young, and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast, says a former Arizonan who attended Buchanan's
speech. Anthony Chavez, a 1997 graduate of Arizona State University
and now a public-policy student at the Kennedy School, acknowledges
that Buchanan's message of reform, limited government and
protection for the working class might appeal to some in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Buchanan's makeover as a reformer can't cover up
his views on immigration, English-only or affirmative action _
views that will hurt him with Arizona Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   As will his criticism of government: To a lot of Hispanics,
government is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government helps people achieve their goals, and Buchanan's
anti-government rhetoric isn't likely to help him with those kinds
of voters,'' Chavez said. True enough. Buchanan's dug his grave
with some folks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Arizona and across the country, voters aren't as
easily shocked as they used to be. They're tired of politics as
usual and of the usual politicians. As McCain proved, they don't
want pandering, but honesty and leadership. They want a change from
Clinton-Gore, but they may not be ready for another George Bush.
They do want choices. After years of going against the grain,
Patrick Buchanan now may be coming along at just the right time. &QL;

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE TIPPING POINT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were skeptical when we picked this up, having become adept
over the years at detecting books that aren't about anything
(they're like the emperor's new clothes _ they try to dazzle you,
but there's nothing to them). It wasn't long, however, before we
were hooked. If the premise does grow a bit thin _ Gladwell sounds
at times like an author inventing reasons to rattle on _ for the
most part it is thought-provoking and presented with an appealing
eye toward popular culture. The ``tipping point'' of the title is
the moment at which something becomes an epidemic, a word Gladwell
applies to fashion trends, fads, crime statistics, the success of a
bestselling book. His examination of how this happens is
dumbfoundingly interesting, and it includes discussion of the
resurgence of Hush Puppies (the shoes) in the mid-1990s, the
phenomenon of ``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' (the book)
when it was released in paperback in 1998, and the ``word-of-mouth
epidemic'' created by Paul Revere (the silversmith) in 1775.
Gladwell works for ``The New Yorker,'' in which the tipping-point
theory made its first appearance. &QL;

   ``Two Jewish rumors: There had been mass murders in Poland in
the course of withdrawals. On the other hand, Jews had been allowed
out of Hungary after a Hungarian agreement with the USA. We
consider Point 1 very likely; Point 2 can be correct only if
Hungary has broken away from Germany. Did it? We are tapping in the

diary during the hot, humid summer of 1944, as he and his wife
lived through the Nazi terror in Dresden. His remarkable diaries
(the first volume, which covers 1933 to 1941, was published in
1998) re-create the confusion, fear, humiliation and emotional
claustrophobia that ruled the lives of German Jews. Included in
this volume are rumors of the crimes at Auschwitz and other camps,
the fragile link to survival that Klemperer's marriage to an
``Aryan'' afforded him and an account of the bombing of Dresden.
It's a riveting and invaluable glimpse of what life was like for a

   Is there anyone left in America who does not own a villa in the

a presence there, the better to write books that make the rest of
us back home weak-kneed with envy. A prerequisite of this new life
in Italy, it seems, is that the villa in question must need work _
Frances Mayes and her boyfriend renovated theirs in her book
``Under the Tuscan Sun,'' and now Gervais (his novel
``Extraordinary People'' was nominated for a PEN/Faulkner award in
1991) and his companion do it here. The twist Gervais offers is
that the huge house they bought in 1982 in the small town of Massa
Macinaia in Lucca province came with its own huge, run-down garden.
This was new to Gervais, who grew up in New England and who knew
nothing of gardening, so he learned on the job, making lots of
mistakes until he hit upon a plan. We know he was successful,
because his book opens with a California horticultural foundation
booking his garden for its next tour. That's right _ foundation
members traveled 7,000 miles to see it. This is not as seductive as
the Mayes book, but it will make you jealous just the same.  &QL;

   Do not laugh. No, do not laugh. Yes, those are pigs on the cover
and they are handsome devils, don't you think? All of the animals
in this book are handsome, because they are bred to be.
Arthus-Bertrand offers grand portraits of prizewinning domestic
livestock (sheep, cattle, goats, horses and swine) posed with their
very proud owners, breeders or trainers. The creatures are
astonishing. They are also a little _ well, odd, to the untrained
eye. Huge in just about every respect, if you know what we mean.
Dauntingly larger than the human beings who stand with them
(there's a Blonde D'Aquitaine bull on Page 47 that looks like it
could take out Manhattan). Muscled, veined, groomed and dandy, they
pose as if they are fully aware of just how excellent they are.
This is, in case you have not surmised it by now, a strange but
endearing book. You might be tempted to laugh (but don't) as you
look through it, but you quickly get caught up in the spirit of the
thing. Except when you see the pigs. You can laugh at them.  &QL;

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE TIPPING POINT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were skeptical when we picked this up, having become adept
over the years at detecting books that aren't about anything
(they're like the emperor's new clothes _ they try to dazzle you,
but there's nothing to them). It wasn't long, however, before we
were hooked. If the premise does grow a bit thin _ Gladwell sounds
at times like an author inventing reasons to rattle on _ for the
most part it is thought-provoking and presented with an appealing
eye toward popular culture. The ``tipping point'' of the title is
the moment at which something becomes an epidemic, a word Gladwell
applies to fashion trends, fads, crime statistics, the success of a
bestselling book. His examination of how this happens is
dumbfoundingly interesting, and it includes discussion of the
resurgence of Hush Puppies (the shoes) in the mid-1990s, the
phenomenon of ``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' (the book)
when it was released in paperback in 1998, and the ``word-of-mouth
epidemic'' created by Paul Revere (the silversmith) in 1775.
Gladwell works for ``The New Yorker,'' in which the tipping-point
theory made its first appearance. &QL; 
 &UR; ``I WILL BEAR WITNESS: A DIARY OF THE NAZI YEARS,
 &UR; 1942-1945'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Victor Klemperer (Random House, $29.95) &QL;

IN SERIOUS PURSUIT OF TOP COMEDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Heard the one about the homeless guy with the cell
phone? I have. In fact, I've heard it over and over and over again.
(He's homeless _ and he's got a cell phone. Rimshot!) I've also
heard the one about how expensive New York is (it is apparently
quite expensive) and, of course, the one about the guy who can't
get a date (he can't get a date!). In fact, over the course of the
last month, I have heard hundreds of jokes, thousands of near
misses and even a couple of howlers, all perpetrated by the city's
crack corps of comedians.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the sheer number of comics and would-be jokesters,
it only stands to reason that New York is the wisecracking-est
place in the United States. There are nearly a dozen full-time
comedy clubs in the city, and scores of bars and restaurants across
the city regularly open their back rooms to those peculiar men and
women whose sole mission in life is to spread the joy of laughter _
and to book a spot on Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many ways the city's comedy circuit is in something
of a renaissance after years of losing its talent to sitcoms and
its audience to television. Older clubs like Caroline's have been
joined by newcomers like the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and
P.S. NBC, which give performance time to downtown acts that
challenge the traditional idea of what comedy should be. And where
it should be, for that matter. There are, no kidding, a weekly
comedy show set in a laundry (``Spin Cycle Comedy'' on Wednesdays)
and one in the back of a Times Square hamburger place (Gladys
Comedy Room in Hamburger Harry's). Even Soho, so serious, so chic,
has a regular comedy night, played out in Circa Tabac, a handsome
smoky lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who enjoyed the show,'' John Mooney, a Tabac regular,
told the audience, ``throw their Prada bags.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Kinds of Clubs
</P>
<P>
   The clubs in Manhattan fall into two categories: mainstream and
alternative. The differences are in price, approach and geography.
Most mainstream clubs, with the exception of the Comedy Cellar and
the Boston Comedy Club, are above 14th Street; most alternative
ones are below. And while uptown clubs generally mean work _ and
some pay _ for comics, downtown clubs generally just mean play.
</P>
<P>
   For cautious people, mainstream clubs like Caroline's, the
Comedy Cellar or the Comic Strip Live are probably the best places
to start. They are almost always a sure thing on the weekends,
stocked with professionals who can make pretty much anybody laugh,
and they have the added advantage of well-lubricated,
ready-to-giggle audiences. Not surprisingly, those clubs are also
the most expensive; you can expect to spend $25 to $50 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown acts are much cheaper, with nominal cover charges and
no drink minimums. The talent downtown is also more hit or miss.
(See the ``Sloopy'' incident below.) At the same time, downtown
jokesters are often far more experimental and intellectual than the
``take my wife'' comics, who still exist in older clubs. And the
crowds are younger, prettier and often tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody here like impressions?'' asks the slacker comic Sean
Conroy at a Monday night show at Luna Lounge on the Lower East
Side. ``OK, how about Impressionism?''
</P>
<P>
   In between the alternative and the mainstream are newer clubs
like Gotham Comedy Club in Chelsea, a sleek joint that has recently
been the home base of the quintessential New York comic, Robert
Klein. It has a young clientele (a lounge and smoking area are
downstairs) and special nights tailored to female, Latino and gay
comedians, a trend mirrored in larger clubs as well. A recent visit
found an appreciative audience for an evening of young female
comics like Laurie Kilmartin and Tina Georgio.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of adventure, I made it my mission to visit each
major club in the city and many of the smaller ones, a journey that
ranged from the hysterical to the bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   I saw dozens of comics crack up audiences with observations on
everything from strip clubs (``It's like Thanksgiving; there's a
plate of nice yummy turkey and all you can do is yell at it'') to
the mounted police. (``You're under arrest. Now hop on.'')
</P>
<P>
   Other times I saw comics just crack up. One night in the East
Village I watched as a middle-aged woman wiggled her way through an
interpretive dance to the strains of ``Hang On, Sloopy,'' just
moments after she had described a recent gynecological visit. It
was, unfortunately, an unforgettable experience.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, both uptown and down, the jokes were needlessly
cruel, coming at the expense of gays or ethnic groups or wallowing
in bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious pitfalls of open mikes and closed minds, the
comedy circuit shows plenty of vitality. And like a hobo with a
cell phone, you can find them pretty much anywhere, any night of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Rules of the Game
</P>
<P>
   There are a few rules that most stand-ups will recognize, if not
obey. Cursing is usually good for a laugh, but cursing alone is not
enough. Never let a heckler get the last word. And always end on a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the look of most mainstream clubs adheres pretty
closely to a brick-wall, ceiling-fan, tiny-stage aesthetic. Oh,
yeah, and lots of comedians' head shots on the wall; it gives a
place character.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are some radical differences in the feel of the
establishments. Caroline's, with classy digs near Times Square and
a swarming staff, has more of a family entertainment feel, with
lots of couples, tourists and well-known comics, like Craig
Shoemaker who waxed comedic on topics from minivans to war movies.
New York Comedy Club, on the other hand, on East 24th Street, is
like the club that time forgot. Pictures behind the bar feature
Johnny Carson, Bob Hope and Robert De Niro in the film ``King of
Comedy.'' Even the dust has dust.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the comics who make their living at it call at all the
clubs, traveling from one to another, sometimes hitting three or
more a night. On a recent Friday night, my brother Gabe and I set
out to emulate this experience as audience members.
</P>
<P>
   First Stop, the Village
</P>
<P>
   The first stop was Boston Comedy Club, a college favorite near
New York University in Greenwich Village. It is the home of the
comic Lewis Schaffer, a bespectacled MC who looks like Jerry Lewis'
long-lost nephew. His business card, which has a quarter taped to
it and the words ``Call Me,'' pretty much sums up his approach,
which also involves constantly denying that he is gay. This
evening's banter was typical.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ With John McCain off the bus and back in the
Senate, and George W. Bush back in Texas and off to try to avenge
his father's 1992 defeat, reporters with time on their hands are
musing about whether Bush can woo McCain voters.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Bush had better hurry. Someone else has his eye on them.
Patrick J. Buchanan, the fearless storyteller, is known for
stirring the pot, challenging convention and going against the
grain. Now pursuing the presidential nomination of the Reform
Party, Buchanan is targeting the followers of McCain, who built a
presidential campaign on stirring the pot, challenging convention,
and going against the grain. A recent ``Newsweek'' poll suggests
that McCain voters are up for grabs. Only 41 percent of McCain
voters said they would support Bush, while 48 percent sooner would
back Al Gore. So much for the allure of campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alibi Al'' outdid himself when questioned about 45 illegal
phone calls made from his office. Gore, who has denied a
``controlling legal authority'' over the calls, told investigators
that he drank iced tea during briefings and could have been in the
men's room when the law was discussed: The vice president's defense
has gone from no legal control to no bladder control.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's control over McCain supporters is just as weak. Chaos
brings opportunity, and Buchanan sees in such chaos an opportunity
to market himself as the reformer in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan began the marketing campaign at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government. Gone was the humorless, combative and
intolerant firebrand who in 1992 declared the country engaged in a
``culture war.'' In his place, stood a kinder and gentler Pat
Buchanan eager to discuss what he called the ``only real issue'':
campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Like a boxer alternating between rights and lefts, Buchanan
rattled off abuses by both parties. Moving from Maria Tsia to the
Wyly brothers to the Buddist Temple, he confused the audience,
which must have felt like booing one minute and cheering the next.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Washington is hooked on money, and neither party
can kick the addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Beltway party is going to drain this swamp, because to
them it isn't a swamp at all, but a protected wetland and their
natural habitat,'' he told the audience. ``They swim in it, feed in
it and spawn in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan called for campaign contributions to be voluntary and
come from individuals, not corporations or unions. He also said
members of Congress should have to raise half of their funds within
their districts.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of students tried to use Buchanan's own words against
him with questions about things he had written. That was easy. The
guy's paper trail is a four-lane highway. Self-identified Democrats
who in 1992 excused Bill Clinton's marijuana use and draft-dodging
as youthful indiscretions rushed to judge Buchanan for words
scribbled 20 years ago. Buchanan didn't flinch, equivocate or claim
that he was in the bathroom. Asked about a column in which he wrote
that ethnic Catholics and Christians are underrepresented and
discriminated against at Harvard, Buchanan tossed the grenade back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply because you're at Harvard does not exempt you from the
same kind of rules and regulations that Harvard lovingly imposes
upon the rest of America,'' he said. ``Pat Buchanan is not a
beloved figure in America, but neither is Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan didn't take any guff from the Ivy Leaguers. And they
loved it. Given that a recent poll by the school's Shorenstein
Center found that 87 percent of respondents believed politicians
will say anything, Buchanan scored points for saying what he
believed and challenging listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Who does that sound like? No wonder Buchanan thinks he has a
shot at McCain supporters. If America really wants straight talk,
then the talk doesn't get any straighter than coming from Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The inference will be unsettling to McCain, who has been a harsh
critic of Buchanan. The lads can't even agree on World War II.
After Buchanan raised the question of whether the United States
needed to go to war against Hitler, McCain, whose grandfather
commanded operations in the Pacific, fumed. Asked by a reporter if
he thought Buchanan should leave the Republican Party, McCain said,
``Mr. Buchanan has already left my Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   When Buchanan did leave, McCain wished him good riddance with
the words of a country music song: ``Thank God and Greyhound,
you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The similarities, and differences, between the two men raise a
question: If Buchanan gets the Reform Party nomination, how will
his third-party candidacy go over in McCain's back yard of Arizona?
In a state divided into haves and have-not, Buchanan's populist
reform message may play well with those who feel disconnected from
the political process, like the poor, the young, and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast, says a former Arizonan who attended Buchanan's
speech. Anthony Chavez, a 1997 graduate of Arizona State University
and now a public-policy student at the Kennedy School, acknowledges
that Buchanan's message of reform, limited government and
protection for the working class might appeal to some in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Buchanan's makeover as a reformer can't cover up
his views on immigration, English-only or affirmative action _
views that will hurt him with Arizona Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   As will his criticism of government: To a lot of Hispanics,
government is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government helps people achieve their goals, and Buchanan's
anti-government rhetoric isn't likely to help him with those kinds
of voters,'' Chavez said. True enough. Buchanan's dug his grave
with some folks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Arizona and across the country, voters aren't as
easily shocked as they used to be. They're tired of politics as
usual and of the usual politicians. As McCain proved, they don't
want pandering, but honesty and leadership. They want a change from
Clinton-Gore, but they may not be ready for another George Bush.
They do want choices. After years of going against the grain,
Patrick Buchanan now may be coming along at just the right time. &QL;

NEW YORK: was typical.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Do I seem gay to you?'' Schaffer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhat,'' answered an audience member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' Schaffer responds, seeming concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the audience member says.
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, we entered a crowd of about 25 people seated in
rows around a tiny stage adorned by Schaffer's head shot. It looked
like a self-help meeting of some sort, or perhaps a memorial
service.
</P>
<P>
   But there were more jokes than your usual wake; when we entered,
in fact, there was a guy telling a joke about a babushka.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either a head scarf or a grandmother,'' he says. ``I
don't which. Do you?'' There is no answer.
</P>
<P>
   The next comic, Sherrod Small, seems a little more comfortable
with the crowd. Looking at the decor _ ceiling fans, brick walls,
empty seats _ he commented: ``Look at this place. You can do
anything in here. You can smoke crack in this place and they
wouldn't raise a finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Another comic follows. He tells a joke about a homeless man with
a . . . enough said.
</P>
<P>
   The show's final act is Judah Friedlander, a large man whose
outfit never differs: red baseball cap, heavy dark glasses, blue
jeans. He looks like a redneck intellectual, and he knows it. His
routine goes fairly well but never catches fire. Finally near the
end of the set, he catches a break. A cell phone starts ringing and
the audience member, alarmed, answers it. Friedlander follows
another of comedy's golden rules: Use what you've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' he says, ``Excuse me. What are you doing? Do I
come to your workplace and make phone calls?'' The audience,
semi-somnolent till now, wakes up and laughs heartily.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been so embarrassed.

</P>
<P>
   The next stop was the Comedy Cellar, another Village club with a
good reputation for booking strong acts. Indeed, on this night, the
lineup was strong, led by the MC, Cynthia Koury, a pleasant
patterer who looks a little like Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's penultimate act was Greer Barnes, a charismatic
black comic with the type of stage ease that separates pros from
the pack. His material is smart, and aims to play off stereotypes,
not with them. His first words are something along the lines of:
``So I'm in the park last night mugging this white guy . . .'' And
the laughter explodes.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' joke highlighted one of the curious _ and convincing _
arguments for seeing comedy live: it is one of the few
entertainments popular with many racial groups. It is also often
one of the few places where races can openly laugh at themselves
and each other without fear of recrimination. It has enormous power
to put people at ease.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' set continued rolling, hitting topics from a stoned
President Clinton debating policy _ ``I like it, I really like it''
_ to gays in the military. It was only a 20-minute set, but by the
end the audience was exhausted by laughs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we made it to Dangerfield's on the Upper East Side,
a different type of exhaustion had set in. Dangerfield's, named for
the comedian Rodney Dangerfield, is something of an anachronism.
Waiters wear red tuxedo jackets, and each table has a small red
lamp. I felt as if I had died and gone to the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   The MC that night was a hefty woman in a tuxedo with a purple
bow tie. She was talking to the audience as we entered, trying to
tell them that although people think she's a lesbian, she's really
looking for the right man.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Schaffer, do I have a woman for you.
</P>
<P>
   The next night I set out alone to hit two clubs across town from
each other. The first was Stand Up New York, the Upper West Side's
only major club, on West 78th Street. The space is clean if
slightly industrial, and the atmosphere this Saturday was low-key.
While the club was nearly full, the staff wasn't picky about my
showing up late and waived the drink minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The comics, too, seemed at ease. One, a bald Texan named Steven
Kent, who calls himself Spanky, pretty much laughed his way through
his own set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a ticket on the way over, going 53 in a 35,'' Spanky
said. ``I told the cop I was dyslexic.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, until Spanky pulled a maneuver nobody saw coming:
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started here 11 years ago,'' he said, pulling on his black
jacket, ``and I just want to say: find the comedy in life. If you
do, you will live a long happy time.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience waited a second _ I don't think they were sure he
was serious _ and then broke into loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   I then moved to the Comic Strip Live, a venerable Upper East
Side institution that claims a whole roster of famous comics (Jerry
Seinfeld, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler) as its own. This
could not be independently confirmed, but when has a comic ever
lied?
</P>
<P>
   The club is a good example of how an efficient operation can
bring in big dollars. The Comic Strip runs three shows a night on
the weekends; most sell out. With more than 200 people at a show
spending $25 to $35 each, the potential profits are (warning: pun
ahead) no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   But an audience wants laughs for its money, meaning the Strip
keeps a steady roster of talent on call. This night the comics were
all good, but the MC was the real showman.
</P>
<P>
   His name is William Stephenson, and while he is a comic himself,
he is often hired to oversee the entertainment. Easy as that
sounds, it is something of an art form, requiring an ability to
unite a crowd _ all different ages, different backgrounds and
different tastes _ around each comic who appears. Perhaps more
important, he also feels out the audience, to provide fodder for
the comics' routines later in the night.
</P>
<P>
   How is this done? The first step is the ancient comedic
demographic test, i.e. ``So where are you from?'' or ``Anybody here
from New Jersey?'' Stephenson used both, made a few cracks, and
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the ``why are you here?'' question. In less time
than it takes to plead the Fifth, Stephenson had one table pegged
as a bachelor party and another as a 40th birthday fete. Rich
material indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the old ritual of teaching the audience how to
clap. Sounds easy, but Stephenson made it complex _ ``put your
hands together like this,'' he said slowly _ so complex the
audience found itself laughing at itself before it had heard a
single joke.
</P>
<P>
   His work done, Stephenson retreated to the sidelines to let the
show _ already well under way _ begin.

   Laughs on Week Nights
</P>
<P>
   While Sundays and Mondays at the city's mainstream clubs are
generally open-mike nights, where wannabes are sometimes expected
to bring three paying guests for the privilege of performing,
downtown clubs thrive during the week. This is particularly true at
Surf Reality, a small, ramshackle second-floor theater on the Lower
East Side, where on Sundays you can see up to eight hours of comedy
for $3.
</P>
<P>
   To perform all you need do is throw your name into a coffee can
and follow three simple rules laid out by Faceboy, the bald
20-something MC: ``No. 1, respect other performers. No. 2, no
heckling. And No. 3 and most important, don't set fire to the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Surf Reality was one of the neighborhood's trailblazers in
alternative comedy, along with the Luna Lounge, which blossomed in
the mid-1990s. Nowadays the neighborhood is bustling with bars
offering free yuks, including Tonic, Baby Jupiter, the Sidewalk
Cafe and the Parkside Lounge, where one night I watched an odd
young man calling himself Craig B. wrap himself in a Mexican
blanket and chug down seven increasingly hot bottles of pepper
sauce. His set ended moments later when he found it impossible to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown theater spaces like Todo Con Nada, Collective
Unconscious and PS 122 also periodically have comedy. The casual
movie house, Cinema Classics on East 11th Street, also offers
comedy of sorts with its 10 O'Clock Mock, when three local comics
crack wise about a bad movie as it is screened. (Devotees of
Mystery Science Theater 3000 will love it.)
</P>
<P>
   It's Comedy Every Night
</P>
<P>
   Surf Reality is also one of the few downtown clubs to program
comedy _ or some derivation thereof _ every night of the week. The
Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, opened in 1999 in an old
burlesque theater on West 22nd Street, is another, especially
popular with comics who know that producers from Comedy Central
often drop by. A similar idea is at work at PS NBC, a
four-night-a-week cabaret that recently opened at Here in the South
Village to develop talent for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Surf Reality may not draw as many talent scouts, but dozens of
downtown comics show up for Faceboyz Open Mike Night on Sundays,
signing up for eight-minute sets clocked on a kitchen timer. The
show begins around 8 p.m. and sometimes runs until 4 a.m. A sign on
the wall reads: ``Pray for Laughs.'' Few performers use their real
names.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is more party than performance. The audience _
many of whom will perform _ bring beer from the local delis.
Typical hallway conversation runs like this: ``I'll go on for three
minutes, then you break in with this poem . . .'' All performers
get a care package, which this night included a condom, a lollipop
and a mint.
</P>
<P>
   The first act was a large blond fellow who went by the name Big
Mike's Erectile Dysfunction. He was dressed all in black and, in an
odd sartorial flourish, wore a belt of small black flashlights. Big
Mike got to the microphone, unfurled several handwritten pages, and
started screaming about a conversation that he had overheard on the
subway.
</P>
<P>
   Ting. Eight minutes later another performer: Ivan Youngblood,
who read a poem and took questions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ting. Next was a comedian whose nerves caused her to bolt from
the room (ting). Then one whose Jackie Gleason imitation sounded
suspiciously like Christopher Walken (ting). And finally, that
infamous ``Hang On Sloopy'' woman (ting, ting, ting, ting!!!!)
</P>
<P>
   My companion leaned over and said, ``This is when you need a big
gong.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the evening moved along, more laughs came. (There were
several trips to the deli, mind you.)
</P>
<P>
   Hank Flynn, a Surf Reality regular, recited a poem, accompanied
by a Gordon Lightfoot song, celebrating his trip to the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, cab driver, for your incense and most direct
route,'' he intoned. He was interrupted several times by laughs and
by a fellow comedian, known as Johnny Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut it out, man,'' said Senor Spanish. ``That music is giving
me the creeps.''
</P>
<P>
   Faceboy himself did a dramatic reading of personal ads taken
from a pornographic magazine. It was, like much of that evening's
six hours, unprintable. And very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Brand New Jokes
</P>
<P>
   A slightly more sophisticated ethos is at work at the Luna
Lounge, where the Monday night comedy series, ``Eating It,'' is in
permanent residence. (The show's title is comedian slang for
bombing.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating It'' began in 1995 and has since become a downtown
institution, regularly drawing a standing-room-only crowd to Luna's
orange-walled back room. The rules for the comics are the same now
as they were then: nothing but brand new material is allowed. Many
acts, including bigger names like Janeane Garofalo and Colin Quinn,
take notebooks to the stage; sometimes, they eat it just like
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the scene was typical: a long line down the block,
with a large young crowd already piled in the back. A French lounge
singer _ accordion, accent, attitude _ entertained the crowd before
the show.
</P>
<P>
   The draw was a stunt act: the comedian Todd Barry had put a
personal ad in Time Out New York, and his blind date was coming to
the gig. The date, in fact, was the gig. A booth had been set up
with two candles, a menu for a Thai restaurant and two microphones.
Before the date arrived, Barry and his cohost, Jonathan Groff, had
a short predate discussion onstage. It was not a typical
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Groff quizzed Barry on his habit of growing hydroponic lettuce
in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No offense, Todd,'' Groff said, ``but your apartment is not
very big.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lettuce,'' replied Barry, mock offended, ``is not very big,
Jon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry swore that if he met the right woman, he would ``throw all
the lettuce stuff right out.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, the date, Karen Rabinovitz, a freelance journalist,
arrived. As she reached the stage, she made a remark to Groff.
``What,'' said Barry, ``are we fighting already?''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd loved it. It was unclear how Rabinovitz felt. Still,
for the next two hours, she sat with Barry, ate and watched the
show. Near the end of the show, which included Garofalo's funny
account of a punk rocker giving himself a concussion, Groff quizzed
the couple on how it all went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you embarrassed?'' Groff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Rabinovitz responded. ``I'll never see most of these
people again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny,'' Groff said. ``That's how I got through my entire
stand-up career.''
</P>
<P>
   And he ended, as he should, on a laugh.

&HT;     VENTURA URGES END TO CHINA, CUBA TRADE BARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: REPLACES headline)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura urged Congress
Thursday not only to approve a bill that would permanently
normalize trade with China but also remove all trade embargoes on
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closed doors don't work,'' he testified before the House Ways
and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura made a strong plea for the lawmakers to back President
Clinton's request that the United States grant China the same low
tariffs it gives most other nations on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
   In a loud, deliberate voice he said granting such status ``is
the biggest economic decision of the 21st century. Please don't
blow it.''
</P>
<P>
   For each of the last 20 years, Congress has reviewed trade
status with China and, after many bitter disputes over Beijing's
poor human rights record, granted the status but only on an annual
basis. Permanent normal status would end Congress' yearly reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, especially Democrats, are under strong pressure to
oppose the China deal from many labor leaders who charge that
American jobs would be lost if trade with Beijing is expanded.
</P>
<P>
   But Ventura argued that boosting trade would not cost Americans
their jobs, citing 44,000 job o &Cx1f; penings in parts of Minnesota that
are now unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see one bit how union jobs are going to leave America
based on a trade relationship with China,'' the governor said.
``It's simply not going to happen and the statistics bear it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura told the committee that the United States does not need
to approve of China's human rights stance in order to continue
trading with its people. The opening of more Chinese markets to
U.S. goods would, over time, instill in the communist nation
American business practices, culture and democratic ideas, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreeing with some Clinton administration officials, Ventura
said China has enough support among World Trade Organization
nations to join the group regardless of whether the United States
backs its admission.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura also insisted that the United States should open trade
with Cuba. He contended that Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's regime
has lasted for four decades because closed trade has shut off U.S.
ideas about democracy from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He also said America should end embargoes against Cuban
products. ``I'm very tired of feeling like a criminal every time I
want a Cuban cigar,'' Ventura quipped.

AUTO SAFETY: ROADSIDE USE OF NATIVE PLANTS; HIGH-RISK PASSENGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Making highways safe and environmentally sound
usually means planning for guardrails, oil runoff and the like. But
the Federal Highway Administration has a surprise success on its
hands with a book about a completely different aspect of the road:
the plantings along the shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   In January the agency, part of the U.S. Department of
Transportation, published a 665-page handbook, ``Roadside Use of
Native Plants,'' and all 5,000 copies flew out of the warehouse.
Most went to state and local highway departments, environmental
groups, universities, elementary schools and military bases.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for highway departments is to plant something that
will prevent erosion _ which can undermine roads or can let dirt
and rocks wash onto them _ but that will not grow into obstacles
that could kill someone in a car or truck that strays off the
pavement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem is to avoid plantings that will turn into roadside
hazards, like trees, or that will spread like kudzu, an East Asian
vine that has run wild in much of the South since it was brought in
for erosion control about 125 years ago. The Transportation
Department is quick to note that that particular error was made by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, highway departments make similar mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie L. Harper-Lore, who put the guidebook together, said, for
example, that many states now list crownvetch (Coronilla varia) as
a ``noxious weed,'' and some are trying to eradicate it. But, she
said, in their efforts to prevent erosion, ``it's hard to find a
state that hasn't tried crownvetch.''
</P>
<P>
   Other roadside pests include grasses, vines, shrubs and trees.
Still others are tall fescue grass, English ivy, English holly,
privet, Alianthus trees and Norway maples. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The guidebook divides each state into vegetation zones and lists
what is native to each. Connecticut has two such zones, but New
Jersey has five and New York has eight. Texas has 26. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A boiled-down version of the guide, handy for gardeners, appears
on the Web at www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment, under roadside
vegetation management. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plants that are not native, variously called ``invasive'' and
``alien,'' squeeze out native species, and experts complain that
they contribute to the sameness of the landscape, with the same
lack of regional variation as the endless vistas of gasoline
stations, chain stores and fast-food restaurants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Highway roadsides, the handbook notes, are some of the most
viewed natural environments in the country. And in some places
where everything else has been given over to malls, parking lots
and roads, roadway edges are the only remaining area for
vegetation; the U.S. Transportation Department said they should be
maintained in as natural a form as possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to protecting the environment along the
nation's highways,'' said Kenneth R. Wykle, the federal highway
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Use of native plants also can minimize the need for fertilizer
and water, experts said. That presumably leaves more resources
available to maintain the paved portion of the road. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Limiting Teen-age Passengers  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age drivers are more dangerous than older drivers,
statistics have long shown, but a recent study says that teen-agers
increase the risk of a crash in another way: by being passengers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing federal data on fatal crashes, researchers at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore found that for 16-year-old drivers,
the risk of dying behind the wheel rose 39 percent with one young
passenger, 86 percent with two passengers and 182 percent with
three or more passengers.
</P>
<P>
   For 17-year-old drivers, the risk increase was even larger; with
three or more passengers it was triple the risk of driving alone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, noted that a survey of high school seniors found
strong correlations between carrying passengers and various risky
behaviors, including speeding, swerving, purposely skidding or
running a red light, and driving after drinking or using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four states have set limits on younger drivers, called
graduated licensing, but only 10 regulate the number or age of the
passengers a teen-age driver may carry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, a bill introduced in Maryland would have limited
drivers age 16 and 17 to carrying no more than two passengers under
21. But the sponsor, state Delegate William Bronrott, acknowledging
that it would not pass a committee vote, agreed to water it down to
require simply that back-seat passengers, who in Maryland need not
wear a seat belt, must do so if the driver is under 18.
</P>
<P>
   That will at least limit the number of passengers to the number
of seat belts, he said, since front-seat passengers already must
wear belts under an older state law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the old days, when people would try to cram as many
people in a phone booth as you could?'' Bronrott said. ``Put it on
wheels, and that's what we see all to often on our roads.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other states also have been lukewarm. In Virginia two years ago,
one lawmaker proposed that if a 16-year-old or 17-year-old was
convicted of a moving violation, the driver should not be allowed
to carry other teen-agers. The Virginia Legislature, however,
settled on no more than three; before a violation, they can
transport as many as will fit.

<P>
   HEMINGWAY, S.C. _ Williamsburg County, a rural slice of the
Bible Belt an hour's drive from the Atlantic coast, is just the
place one expects to find religious radio. Roadside signs testify
that Jesus saves, and the steeples of Baptist and Pentecostal
churches can seem as ubiquitous as the tall pines and the Spanish
moss.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is just this setting that makes WLGI, a 50,000-watt FM
station outside this small town, such a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent morning it was broadcasting gospel music. But then
came a station break, and a woman said: ``Across America, Bahais
are tapping into the power of unity to build racial harmony in
their communities. The Bahai faith attracts people like you from
every race and nationality.'' The announcement included a toll-free
number for more information.
</P>
<P>
   To listeners, WLGI is known as Radio Bahai (pronounced buh-HI),
a 15-year-old project of one of the world's newer religions, a
monotheistic faith that emerged in 19th-century Persia, now Iran.
Bahai has gone global, with five million adherents in nearly 200
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Bahais follow the teachings of a Persian nobleman, a prominent
member of a popular religious movement of his time, who in 1863
declared that he was the Promised One, anticipated by all major
faiths. From then on, he was known as Baha'u'llah, Arabic for the
Glory of God.
</P>
<P>
   He taught that all humanity is a single race, that men and women
are equal and that the world's major religions are all true
expressions of God. Bahais accord him the status of divinely chosen
Messenger, the latest in a line that in their belief includes
Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad. Bahais believe
that all were sent by God in successive eras to teach humankind, a
process called progressive revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the musical programming, Baha'u'llah's words (along with
readings from the Bible and other sacred texts) can be heard on
WLGI, whose signal spans eastern South Carolina, touching
metropolitan Charleston and the resorts of Myrtle Beach, and
reaches into North Carolina as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say prayers for folks,'' said Ernest Hilton, 42, wthe
station's associate manager. ``A lot of folks call us in the
mornings for prayers for people who are ill or who have passed
on,'' he said, displaying a leather-bound Bahai prayer book.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahai faith counts about 130,000 members in the United
States. World headquarters are in Haifa, Israel, and American
administrative offices are in suburban Chicago. The faith operates
six radio stations. Only one is in North America _ in Hemingway.
The obvious question is, Why here?
</P>
<P>
   Well, this state is important to Bahais, and has been ever since
thousands of South Carolinians converted in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my understanding,'' said Lanita Barnes, a Bahai who moved
here from Southern California to administer many of the faith's
local programs, ``there was never a true civil rights movement in
South Carolina,'' at least nothing approaching the history-making
events of Montgomery or Selma.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bahais began working in the area, promoting their ideal
of racial unity with a religious rather than secular message, they
won a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton, who is black, grew up nearby and attended a Bahai youth
gathering in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat, I listened, and I was really impressed with the racial
makeup of the event,'' Hilton said. ``I thought back to Martin
Luther King's dream, because there were black kids, Persian kids,
white kids, Orientals. And these kids were talking about how they
could change the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bahais have had property here since 1972, when the faith
established a school focused on social and economic development.
Called the Louis G. Gregory Institute, it occupies a largely wooded
tract where the air is alive with dragonflies and the chatter of
birds.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who serves as administrator, says relations with
neighboring churches have been amicable, with ministers invited to
events at the institute. (What surely helps is that Bahais abstain
from aggressive proselytizing, teach a personal morality whose
standards _ no gambling or alcohol, for instance _ fit well in a
culturally conservative area and regard Christianity as a divinely
revealed faith. The station also runs free announcements about
local churches' events on its community calendar.)
</P>
<P>
   Bahai emphasizes religious service, and the institute attracts
volunteers, like Nancy Nawi, 19, of Norwood, N.J., who grew up in a
Bahai family and will enter Smith College next fall. ``I know
people who had come down here, who had volunteered down here,'' she
said. ``People would talk about Radio Bahai down in South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute (whose initials give WLGI its call letters) is
named for an early convert, a South Carolinian born in 1874 to
former slaves. He earned a law degree at Howard University in
Washington and flirted with black nationalism before finding the
faith in 1909. Thereafter, he traveled widely preaching racial
unity, often in the segregated South. Twice, Booker T. Washington
invited him to speak at Tuskegee Institute, the predominantly black
school that Washington founded in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   One recent graduate of Tuskegee (now a university) works at the
station. He is Jonathan Graham, who grew up in the nearby town of
Kingstree and embraced the faith at 15, after encountering a Bahai
youth group. Like Hilton, he was impressed with the message of
racial unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in the faith, it's all about us getting the world
together,'' said Graham, now 30. ``That's what appealed to me.''

COMMENTARY: SAVING THE LOST WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ELENA DE UAIREN, Venezuela _ In a few weeks many of the
Seattle protesters will reassemble in Washington D.C. to throw
rocks at the IMF and the World Bank, denouncing them as agents of
global corporate greed that is spoiling the environment and leaving
the poor behind. The protesters are no doubt sincere, but the truth
is the IMF and World Bank are neither the problem nor the solution.
They are bit players, of declining importance, in a much larger
drama.
</P>
<P>
   The real drama is on the ground in the developing world, not on
H Street; the real players are a diverse collection of companies,
indigenous peoples, endangered species and local governments; and
the real solution lies not with he who throws the biggest stone but
he who builds the most effective coalition to get these players
working together.
</P>
<P>
   I came to this remote spot on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border to
watch a team from Conservation International try to build such a
coalition. Their goal: to save the Guyana Shield, the largest
unbroken expanse of tropical rain forest in the world, running from
southern Venezuela across Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.
Flying over it in a small plane, this rain forest looks like an
endless expanse of broccoli, broken only by waterfalls _ including
Angel Falls, the tallest in the world _ and by tapuis, the
mesa-like rock formations that thrust 8,000 feet above the rain
forest floor. Save for local indigenous tribes, the area is ruled
entirely by the ``locals''; harpy eagles and Amazon parrots control
the skies, jaguars prowl the forest floor and ferocious peacock
bass run the lakes. No wonder Arthur Conan Doyle based his novel
``The Lost World'' on this region.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation International began by strategizing with the
indigenous Ye'kwana tribe on how to protect its homeland, which
lies at the heart of this remarkable ecosystem, from the Brazilian
and local miners who covet its gold and ore, from the Japanese
logging companies that covet its timber and from a debt-ridden
Venezuelan government with legitimate development needs. Throwing
stones at the IMF won't do it. This is not a teach-in. This is the
sort of real problem that needs to be solved, here and elsewhere,
if we want to protect the environment and support growth in the
third world.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation International and the Ye'kwana are developing a
``network solution.'' First they are proposing the creation of a
13-million-acre protected area and indigenous reserve on this
Venezuelan portion of the Guyana Shield. They have found an
unexpected ally in Venezuela's national oil company, Petroleos de
Venezuela, which owns Citgo in America. Petroleos has lost business
in the U.S. because of environmental critics. To improve its global
brand name, it has pledged to maintain strong environmental
standards in its own operations and, through its affiliate Bitor,
to provide funding and technical support to protect the Guyana
Shield's biodiversity and the Ye'kwana. As one company official put
it: ``As a global company, if you don't adapt to the growing trends
in the world today you're going to be out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Conservation International and its Venezuelan
allies are asking the government here to consider a debt-for-nature
swap, in which money raised from the environmental group's
supporters around the world would be used to help retire part of
Venezuela's national debt _ in return for the creation of the
13-million-acre reserve. If it can pull this off, one of the
planet's richest ecosystems gets saved, the Ye'kwana's home is
protected, Petroleos protects its global image and Venezuela
reduces its debt (if you want to help, go to www.conservation.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days everyone focused on how to get governments to
solve these problems by fighting the companies, because industry
had so much more power than you and me,'' remarked Glenn Prickett,
senior vice president for Conservation International. ``But thanks
to globalization and the Internet, power is now much more diffused,
global companies are now much more exposed, and organizations like
ours much better positioned to offer solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Without activist protesters, neither governments nor
corporations will be pushed to value the environment. But activists
today have the power to do more than say no. In a networked world
they now have the power, and the responsibility, to create
coalitions _ with business, government and affected communities _
that don't just make a point, but make a difference.

COMMENTARY: STARCHY IN RHODE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great thing about politics in the United States of America,
people, is that there's always something. If you find the
presidential campaign dreary, you look around and there's the state
of Rhode Island, embarking on a plan to decorate its landscape with
dozens of 6-foot-tall statues of Potato Head.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know, you're already asking yourself why your state
didn't think of this first.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island Tourism Division is rolling out a new marketing
program that stars Potato Head as the symbol of ``Rhode Island _
the Birthplace of Fun.'' Thanks to corporate sponsors, there are
already 43 giant depictions of or Potato Head scattered around the
state, most of which actually look more like 6-foot eggs with feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhode Island will peel ahead of the crop when it comes to
attracting visitors from around the world,'' said Gov. Lincoln
Almond, as he swore in Potato Head as the state's official travel
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   About the motto. The Tourism Division says Rhode Island is the
official Birthplace of Fun because it's the birthplace of Potato
Head, a fun guy conceived and manufactured in Pawtucket. Until this
very moment, most people probably thought of the state as the
birthplace of the TV series ``Providence'' and the Claus von Bulow
trial, but there you are. According to the governor's office, Rhode
Island is also the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, an
important but not really feel-good concept.
</P>
<P>
   All sorts of meaningless yet strangely intriguing stuff is going
on at the state level these days. New York, I am proud to report,
is about to celebrate its failure to pass a budget on time for the
16th straight year. The Empire State, in fact, regards itself as
the Birthplace of the Perpetually Overdue Spending Package. We just
haven't quite figured out how to turn it into a tourism campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee state legislature recently passed a bill making
the Tennessee walking horse its official horse. The measure is now
on the governor's desk, giving him something to think about when he
isn't engaged in overhauling the entire state tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is one of a number of states that's very much into
symbol clutter. It has six different official state songs, only one
of which is ``The Tennessee Waltz.'' (Try asking Al Gore to hum a
few bars of ``When It's Iris Time in Tennessee.'') The legislature
ought to take the bit in its teeth and give that walking horse full
State Animal bragging rights. The current occupant, the raccoon,
could be downgraded to Official State Varmint.
</P>
<P>
   What this country needs is a mandatory sunset law for state
Things. We could wipe the slate clean every five or 10 years and
start over. Refilling the symbol supply might give citizens a new
interest in state government; the state of Washington experienced
an unprecedented degree of attention a few years back when a disc
jockey started a movement to make ``Louie, Louie'' the official
state rock 'n' roll song.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, a lot of the current honorees don't seem to have
been given much thought. We have way too many cardinals and robins
out there in State Bird Land, and a lot of the mottos need work. I
am thinking of you, Maryland (``Manly deeds, womanly words''), and
Michigan, whose motto sounds as if it had been written by a real
estate developer. (``If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look around
you.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right, each generation should have the opportunity,''
agreed Sen Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. He is something of an
expert on this issue, having served in the state Senate back when
Connecticut was trying to come up with an official song, so bands
would stop playing ``Boola Boola'' whenever the governor entered
the room. After a lengthy songwriting competition that demonstrated
how difficult it was to fit repeated references to Connecticut into
a tune, the legislature wound up adopting ``Yankee Doodle.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Rhode Island's legislature went through an
intense fight between coffee milk and lemon ice for the title of
official state drink. The winner was the coffee milk, a beverage
made with a coffee extract that, like six-foot-statues of Potato
Head, can be found only in Rhode Island.

&HT;     JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OKS SAN FRANCISCO NEWSPAPER DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Updates with new material)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department gave the go-ahead Thursday
for the Hearst Corporation to acquire the San Francisco Chronicle
and sell the Hearst-owned San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But in a separate ruling, a federal judge in San Francisco
temporarily blocked the deal pending a hearing on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   The decision removed a major obstacle to the transaction that
was announced last August when the family that owned Chronicle
agreed to sell to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hearst said it would try to sell The Examiner,
published in the afternoon. If a buyer weren't found, Hearst said
it would merge the newspaper with the Chronicle and publish a
single newspaper, named the San Francisco Chronicle, in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Because both newspapers are partners in a 1965 joint operating
agreement administered by the Justice Department as an exception to
federal antitrust laws, the department had to give its approval to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department approval came after Hearst agreed to sell The
Examiner to members of the Fang family, publishers of the
thrice-weekly free newspaper, The Independent. The department
announcement said the sale of the Examiner ``has resolved the
department's antitrust concerns relating'' to Hearst's plan to buy
the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Hearst has agreed to provide the
Fangs with a $66 million subsidy over three years to publish the
Examiner as a morning paper. The Fangs agreed to purchase The
Examiner's name, archives, subscriber list, examiner.com Web site,
computers, office furniture, delivery trucks and newsracks. The
staff, buildings and printing presses were not included.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, publisher of The Independent, has said The Examiner
would publish as a daily newspaper sold through home subscriptions
and newsracks. After a four-month transition period, Fang said he
plans to switch the Examiner into the morning field and compete
directly with the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Joel I. Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, said the sale of the Examiner means that ``For
the first time in 35 years, San Francisco will have two independent
daily papers. Consumers, such as advertisers and readers, will
obtain the benefits of full competition between the two daily
morning papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in San Francisco
issued a temporary restraining order against the deal, saying that
serious questions had been raised about the ``viability of The
Examiner'' as an independent newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is to reconsider the case in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The action came in response to a request by Clint Reilly, an
unsuccessful candidate for mayor, who argued that the Fang-owned
Examiner would not have sufficient resources to survive in a battle
against the Hearst-owned Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit filed by Reilly seeks to stop the sale of the
Chronicle to Hearst. The suit contends that the purchase of the
Chronicle would result in higher advertising and subscription rates
and thus harm consumers. It also claims the purchase would violate
federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has denied those contentions and argued that the
transaction would boost competition between newspapers in Bay Area
suburbs and between electronic media. Gary Halling, Hearst's
lawyer, has asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has argued that it would cost far more for the Fangs to
publish The Examiner as a viable competitor to Hearst's Chronicle _
as much as $250 million over five years. He has called the Fang
deal a ``sham'' designed to destroy The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But Halling's brief for Hearst said, ``In fact, the transaction
is structured to provide incentives to continue The Examiner's
business. Hearst is only reimbursing actual expenses incurred in
publishing The Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs' profits increase with revenue from The Examiner, and
the newspaper's ultimate success depends on market forces, Halling
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle has a daily circulation of 464,535 and is Northern
California's largest paper. The Examiner's daily circulation is
108,968.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1965 joint operating agreement, both the Examiner and
the Chronicle were allowed to combine business operations while
keeping independent news staffs.

INVESTORS AGAIN SEEK SAFETY OF BONDS
</HEADLINE>

By ROBERT HURTADO

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Largely ignoring news that the economy grew at a pace
of 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, faster than
previously reported, bonds reacted instead to a decline in stocks
as investors sought the safety of Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds continue to be influenced by stocks, so when global stock
markets dropped before the opening of the markets in the United
States, Treasury yields fell to their lowest level in more than a
week. When the U.S. stock market opened on a relatively firm note,
Treasuries trimmed some of those earlier gains. But bonds advanced
later as the Nasdaq slumped on a selloff in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 1 21/32, to 105
9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the
price, fell to 5.87 percent from 5.97 percent on Wednesday, its
biggest one-day drop in almost two months. The yield is at its
lowest level since Aug. 24, when the Federal Reserve Board raised
its rate on overnight loans between banks by one-quarter point, the
second of five increases since last June designed to slow the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department's final estimate of gross domestic
product for the last quarter of 1999 reported a growth rate of 7.3
percent, revised from the previous estimate of 6.9 percent and
higher than economists' expectations of 7.1 percent. Even though it
was a strong number, some market participants felt it was not
necessarily new information.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said, ``The U.S. economy is in uncharted waters, roaring ahead at a
prodigious pace in the midst of the longest expansion on record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, GDP growth has accelerated over the past nine months
despite five pre-emptive tightening moves by the Federal Reserve,''
he said. ``And while the nation's economic momentum during the
first quarter of the year 2000 will not be quite as torrid as the
blistering 7.3 percent pace registered during the fourth quarter of
1999, it will still be in excess of the Fed's perceived maximum
non-inflationary 3.5 percent trend rate of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Fine said he believes the Fed will continue to
raise rates until it sees signs that the economy is moderating.
Most market participants expect the Fed policy-makers to raise
rates by another quarter point at the next meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Another recurring theme in the bond market is the effect of the
government budget surplus and buyback program, which have caused an
inverted yield curve, in which investors who take on more risk by
owning long-term debt are paid less than those holding short-term
instruments. The yield on a two-year note is now at 6.48 percent,
and yields on the longer maturities are lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition,'' Fine said, ``growing concerns about risks in
other sectors have, at times, produced a flight-to-quality movement
into Treasuries, and with asset allocations jumping around between
cash, bonds, traditional stocks and particularly tech-sector
equities, the markets appear to be searching for some kind of
anchor in what has recently become a rather volatile financial
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, corporate bonds got off to a bad start, with market
participants concerned that the government will not be responsible
for agencies like Fannie Mae if they default on their debt, which
has caused some unwinding of those positions. Those agencies have
only an implied backing from the government. Yield spreads between
corporate issues and comparable Treasuries with similar maturities
widened three to four basis points.

 &HT;    Lady Vols nor UConn cocky
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They both missed the Final Four a year ago.
Tennessee and Connecticut watched while the Purdue-Duke NCAA
championship game generated record television ratings and got
people thinking that perhaps women's college basketball was bigger
than two teams with a national profile.
</P>
<P>
   That theory has pretty much been discarded this season.
Tennessee and UConn split two nailbiting regular-season games and
occupied the top two spots in the national rankings most of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Their losses last year, however, taught them not to look too far
ahead. It is an approach they will share in their national
semifinal games tonight at the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (32-3), whose ambitions for four consecutive NCAA
titles were derailed in the Elite Eight a year ago, meets Rutgers
(26-7) in the 7 p.m. opener. The Lady Vols are on a 19-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   UConn (34-1), which has been ranked No. 1 all season and whose
only loss was to Tennessee by a single point, plays Penn State
(30-4) in the nightcap about 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basketball team is not assuming that,'' Tennessee coach
Pat Summitt said about a UConn rematch for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are certainly focused on playing Rutgers and
understanding the challenge that lies in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights, in their first NCAA Final Four after
knocking off Georgia on Monday, play a tenacious matchup zone that
befuddled the Lady Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Volunteers, who haven't lost since Georgia won a
decisive 78-51 contest in Athens on Jan. 17, have improved,
although they had to pull out a late win over Texas Tech on Monday
to get here.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State is making its first Final Four journey a relatively
close one. The Lady Lions, who lost to UConn by 13 points in
December, have plenty of senior experience and easily routed a more
athletic Louisiana Tech team to reach this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that teams aren't looking past us,'' Penn State
point guard Helen Darling said. ``We came here to win it, just like
everyone else is here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For UConn, getting to the Final Four after a four-year absence
has eased a tremendous burden. None of the current Huskies has
Final Four experience, but no team has more depth and scoring
balance or better pressure defense that routinely piles up baskets
in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking to that Tennessee matchup yet, but I've
heard a lot about it, and there's been a lot written about it,''
UConn guard Shea Ralph said. ``And you can really only expect a lot
of people to say that, because for so many years now it's been a
tradition. UConn-Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the rivalry dates back only to 1995, when the Huskies
went 35-0, beat Tennessee for the NCAA title and brought the
mainstream East Coast media into the picture. The Lady Vols
responded by winning the next three championships with the
now-departed Chamique Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
   Three coaches with Philadelphia roots will be returning to their
hometown: UConn's Geno Auriemma, C. Vivian Stringer of Rutgers and
Rene Portland of Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two weeks ago I told somebody that I'm not looking
forward to the hysteria that's going to be down here,'' said
Auriemma, whose family emigrated from Italy to nearby Norristown
when he was seven. ``But at the same time, I don't want to miss it.
I don't want to be sitting at home watching it.''

FOUR YOUNG MEN SENTENCED IN MICHIGAN DATE RAPE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Concluding a case that drew national attention to GHB,
a drug that has been linked to date rapes, a county judge sentenced
four young men to prison here Thursday for putting what proved to
be a fatal quantity of the substance in the soft drink of an
unsuspecting 15-year-old girl a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Maggie Drake of the Wayne County Circuit Court sentenced
Joshua Cole to seven to 15 years in jail for involuntary
manslaughter in the death of Samantha Reid, a high school freshman
from Rockwood.
</P>
<P>
   Cole had confessed to police immediately after the girl's death
that he put the drug in the drink at a small party.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Brayman and Nicholas Holtschlag, who were accused by
prosecutors of helping Cole, were each given jail sentences of five
years and nine months to 15 years, also for involuntary
manslaughter. And Erick Limmer, whom prosecutors accused of
insisting that no ambulance be called to help Samantha when she
passed out, was sentenced to three to five years for being an
accessory to manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The party was held at Limmer's apartment in Grosse Ile., like
Rockwood a suburb of Detroit. Cole was 19 at the time of the crime,
while both Brayman and Holtschlag were 18, and Limmer was 26.
</P>
<P>
   The men were convicted two weeks ago on these and lesser
charges, notably mixing a harmful substance in a drink. They
received separate, shorter sentences Thursday for the lesser
crimes, to be served concurrently with the manslaughter-related
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Brayman's lawyer, John Gates Jr., and Holtschlag's lawyer, Brian
Dailey, said that thir clients were innocent and would appeal
their convictions. Lawyers for the other two defendants did not
return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Brayman was the only defendant with a criminal record: He had
been convicted as a juvenile of malicious destruction of property,
a misdemeanor, for having demolished a mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Republicans used Samantha's death to push legislation
through Congress adding GHB to the federal list of the
most-controlled substances, joining heroin and LSD as a so-called
Schedule 1 drug.
</P>
<P>
   GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, can be made in a kitchen with
ingredients like furniture polish remover or drain-clearing agents,
using recipes available on the Internet. It has become popular in
recent years mainly as a recreational drug, but has also been used
in date rapes.
</P>
<P>
   The slightest variation in the quantity or purity of the drug
can cause unconsciousness and death; doctors recommend that anyone
who passes out after ingesting the drug receive immediate emergency
medical attention.

 &HT;    Coke getting in on the 'millionaire' craze
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. is giving away more than 10,000 cash
prizes _ including five $1 million prizes _ in a promotion this
summer to boost sales of its flagship Classic brand.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing effort, which will include partnerships with
Universal Studios and Universal Music, comes as the industry's
colas face intense competition from other carbonated and
noncarbonated beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Both Coca-Cola Classic, the nation's top-selling brand, and No.
2 Pepsi Cola lost market share last year, according to Beverage
Digest. Part of the decline was caused by price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola hopes its Summer 2000 promotion, which begins May 15
and runs through July 31, will reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of innovative program that Coke needs to do to
create some news and excitement both around Coke Classic and the
cola segment of the beverage industry,'' said John Sicher, editor
and publisher of Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   The ``You Win'' prizes will be under the lid of a new
``pop-top'' can, which is indistinguishable from an ordinary can of
Coke. The can was developed in Germany. Coke has the rights to its
use in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The winning cans will be randomly inserted in 12-, 18-, 20- and
24-can multipacks of Coke Classic and caffeine-free Coke Classic.
Prizes also will be behind labels on Classic bottles, but they will
not be in vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has already created a lot of excitement and enthusiasm
among our bottling partners and customers, and we believe this
promotion represents a tremendous opportunity for all of our
businesses,'' said Ralph Cooper, president of Coca-Cola North
America.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $1 million, $10,000 and $100 cash prizes, the
Atlanta-based company has teamed up with Universal Studios and
Universal Music to give away ``experiential'' prizes. These include
the chance to win walk-on roles in movies and music videos, and the
opportunity to cover a movie premiere as an on-camera
correspondent. There are also trips to Universal Studios theme
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Scott Williamson said the promotion is the
result of conversations with consumers who indicated they want
contests that are simple and straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like the idea of winning cash as well as prizes that are
unique and easy to understand,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time in a decade that Coke has tinkered
with the top of its can to offer prizes. Last year's summer
promotion involved the Coke Card, which gave consumers discounts at
participating retailers. ``It was successful in its own right,''
Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say how much this summer's promotion will cost
the company.

HOUSE BACKS SPENDING BILL THAT INCLUDES ANTI-DRUG SUPPORT FOR
COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: also moving in `i' category) 
(bl) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two days of debate, the House on Thursday
approved a $12.7 billion emergency spending bill whose centerpiece
commits the United States to train and equip Colombia's security
forces to combat drug traffickers in a country where the narcotics
trade and guerrilla insurgency have blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Central American civil wars of the 1980s has the
United States thrown such political, diplomatic and military
backing behind a crucial Latin American ally threatened by
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan House vote Thursday, 263-146, approved an
emergency aid package that also includes money for the Pentagon to
pay for the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, and for flood disaster
relief in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But most significantly, the House has cast judgment on a plan
backed by the Clinton administration to spend $1.7 billion during
two years to help Colombia and other Andean countries, despite
critics' complaints that the anti-drug plan is ill-conceived and
could drag the United States into an open-ended conflict that has
already cost tens of thousands of lives during the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program will strengthen democratic government, the rule
of law, economic stability and human rights in that beleaguered
country,'' said Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House's drug czar.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy those who warned of a Vietnam-like quagmire, the
House approved by voice vote an amendment to limit U.S. military
personnel sent to Colombia to 300 at any one time, unless more are
needed for a rescue mission. In promoting his amendment, Rep. Gene
Taylor, a conservative Mississippi Democrat, said, ``I expect they
want American kids to fight in the war they won't fight and
American taxpayers to pay for a war they won't pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid to Colombia, which is the source of 90 percent of the
cocaine and 65 percent of the heroin seized in the United States,
was the main lightning rod in the debate. But the overall spending
measure that includes the anti-drug program is imperiled in the
Senate because of opposition from the Senate's top two Republican
leaders, Trent Lott of Mississippi and Don Nickles of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators do not oppose the Kosovo or Colombia aid. But
Lott has vowed to block the bill, saying it has become ``bloated''
with pork and other non-urgent spending.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to roll the most pressing aid proposals _ including
those for Kosovo, Colombia, as well as millions of dollars in flood
relief for North Carolina farmers _ into Congress' annual
appropriations process.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's proponents say that approach would postpone badly
needed aid for months, leaving disaster-stricken Americans in the
lurch and jeopardizing Washington's commitment to the fragile
democracy in Colombia, the hemispheric hub for narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert made the anti-drug program one of
his top legislative priorities, and on Wednesday he took to the
House floor to give a rare speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must act now,'' Hastert said. ``We cannot wait. We have a
responsibility to stop drugs in Colombia, to stop them in transit,
to stop them at our border, and to stop them on our streets and in
our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which has been borrowing from other accounts to
pay for the Kosovo operation, says that if it does not get $2
billion by late April, the Army, in particular, will have to cancel
training and postpone maintenance, all steps that could hurt
military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's lopsided vote in the House and a brewing revolt by
influential Senate Republicans who favor the immediate dispatch of
the Kosovo and Colombia aid may force Lott to relent. Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, who heads the Appropriations Committee, said his
panel would take up a $9 billion spending bill, which includes the
Kosovo aid, in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The administration originally proposed a $5.2 billion emergency
spending bill, but the House Appropriations Committee added about
$3.8 billion more earlier this month. Lawmakers on Wednesday night
then loaded on $4 billion more in additional military spending to
cover unanticipated costs of spare parts, military healthcare and
safety maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects in the House bill that the White House did
not request _ and Lott is grumbling about _ include $600 million to
repair highways and bridges and $75 million to spruce up NASA's
fleet of Shuttles and $20 million to build a new Food and Drug
Administration building in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   All but $421 million of the bill would be paid for from this
year's projected $26 billion non-Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor Tuesday and Wednesday, lawmakers passionately
debated the plan to send $1.7 billion during two years to help
Colombia, as well as other Andean nations like Ecuador and Peru,
step up its fight against drug traffickers by reducing cocaine and
heroin production.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's final vote reflected divisions across party lines,
both over Colombia and the bill's ballooning cost: 143 Republicans
and 119 Democrats voted in favor, while 61 Republicans and 84
Democrats voted against. Each side drew the vote of an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the aid package framed their debate not only in
terms of supporting an embattled Latin American ally, but also as a
bold move in the war on drugs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more hundreds or thousands of our kids will get
hooked on drugs or die from overdoses?'' said Rep. C.W. Bill Young,
R-Fla., who heads the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But critics warned that the United States was being drawn more
deeply into a convoluted civil conflict in Colombia, a country with
two leftist guerrilla armies fighting the government, right-wing
paramilitary forces fighting the guerrillas, and civilians trapped
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the aid package is 30 Blackhawk and 33 Huey
helicopters for the Colombian army and police forces, as well as
$470 million for the Colombian army and $115.5 million for the
police, that would be used to train and equip three Army battalions
for anti-drug operations, two of which would be new.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The measure also offer farmers incentives to grow other crops,
and finance programs to promote human rights and judicial reform,
but that did not assuage critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting involved in a civil war for which we're going to
pay a price,'' said Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also balked at giving the bulk of the aid to the
Colombia military, which has ties to paramilitaries implicated in
human-rights abuses. Given these objections, many critics said the
aid would be better served treating patients for drug abuse in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't really get to the heart of the matter: the drug
problem in our country,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ``Some
5.5 million Americans need substance-abuse treatment, and only 2
million are getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall spending bill also includes $143 million in
emergency economic aid to Balkan countries and other nations in
southeast Europe. House members, by a vote of 219-200, defeated an
attempt to force President Clinton to start withdrawing U.S. troops
from Kosovo unless he certified that European NATO allies shoulder
their share of costs for international police, humanitarian aid and
economic reconstruction.

<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CALL it Phi Slama Scrama.
</P>
<P>
   This time there was no excited throng filling every nook and
cranny of the O'Quinn Great Hall for the announcement. Just Clyde
the Glide skating out the back door.
</P>
<P>
   Dynasties are like blenders, refrigerators and presidents these
days. They don't make them like they used to, and the Clyde Drexler
Coaching Era at the University of Houston came to a close just 28
years, 572 wins and five Final Four appearances short of Guy V.
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Family commitment, Drexler said, and no one dares question that
most heartfelt obligation. Only the notion that it never dawned on
Drexler until after he took the job that this coaching stuff is one
other thing in addition to drawing up X's and O's: hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Successful coaching requires long hours and dedication to the
details. It means breaking down game tape and devising strategies
on into the night. At the college level, it means getting off the
airplane following the season-ending loss in the conference
tournament and getting on another plane to visit an 18-year-old
recruit who wants you to tell him he'll become the next great
thing.
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, Drexler was a real sharp dresser. But he never had
the qualifications for the job, and the fact his run was shorter
than the lifespan of a firefly is by no means his fault alone.
</P>
<P>
   For athletic director Chet Gladchuk, Drexler was the popular,
easy choice two years ago, like asking the kids if they would like
to eat candy for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Such a grandstanding move prods the alums and the student body
to conjure up images of young colts named Clyde and Akeem who could
jump through the roof and Guy V. who had the know-how to pull it
all together.
</P>
<P>
   For Gladchuk, it was also the wrong, lazy choice, a box-office
gimmick that was more smoke and mirrors than Siegfried &AMP; Roy with
none of the tiger's bite.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind up-and-coming names such as Larry Eustachy and Bill
Self or others. Let them go to Iowa State and Tulsa or wherever and
make good by working to build a program. We'll just give them a
famous name, and they'll buy tickets and pack the house. And they
did. For one year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the homage to the legendary Lewis as it was billed,
it was an insult, an implicit statement that learning the craft is
not required, only a Hall of Fame resume from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   One does not become a coach simply by trading in your uniform
and high-tops for a designer suit and a whistle. It is a profession
that has to be in your blood. Even Larry Bird, who made a
successful transition at the pro level, is getting out after just
three years and says that if he had to do it all over, he would
prepare for several seasons as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   When asked recently if he had any inclination to become a coach,
Drexler's former teammate Hakeem Olajuwon shook his head quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you get to walk away when the game is over, win
or lose,'' he said. ``Do you see those coaches? They never stop.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his appointment, there were questions about how
Clyde would make the transition from ultra-rich superstar player to
coach of a college program that is not exactly flush with money. He
talked early of a desire to fly charter planes _ a la the NBA _ to
road games. But that is an extravagance that is not in the UH
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his first season on the job, word came out that
Clyde was phoning old NBA friends in San Antonio and Miami, seeking
to hitch on for a playoff ride. Would it have given him an
advantage over Bob Huggins and Denny Crum on the Conference USA
recruiting trail if he soared in for a slam dunk in the NBA Finals
with ``Come to UH'' on the soles of his sneakers? Not if he was
unwilling to put in the long hours away from the family.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did Drexler take the job? Naivete and perhaps a touch
of ego.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the matter of convenient timing. For in the
spring of 1998, when the NBA contracts of Drexler and his feuding
teammate Charles Barkley were set to expire, the Rockets were going
to re-sign only one. And it was Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Without saying a word in public, the Rockets' coaching staff
would speak volumes about which of the two they thought was better
to keep around and who was a more divisive influence in the locker
room. Thus, a chance to help save the old alma mater was a golden
parachute for Drexler's image.
</P>
<P>
   Until he hit the ground hard with 10-17 and 9-22 seasons and the
realization this was far more work than he had bargained for. So
Clyde glides.
</P>
<P>
   And Gladchuk is back where he was two years ago on the day he
gave the job to Drexler _ still in need of a real coach.

HOUSE BACKS SPENDING BILL THAT INCLUDES ANTI-DRUG SUPPORT FOR
COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: also moving in `w' category) 
(bl) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two days of debate, the House on Thursday
approved a $12.7 billion emergency spending bill whose centerpiece
commits the United States to train and equip Colombia's security
forces to combat drug traffickers in a country where the narcotics
trade and guerrilla insurgency have blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Central American civil wars of the 1980s has the
United States thrown such political, diplomatic and military
backing behind a crucial Latin American ally threatened by
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan House vote Thursday, 263-146, approved an
emergency aid package that also includes money for the Pentagon to
pay for the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, and for flood disaster
relief in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But most significantly, the House has cast judgment on a plan
backed by the Clinton administration to spend $1.7 billion during
two years to help Colombia and other Andean countries, despite
critics' complaints that the anti-drug plan is ill-conceived and
could drag the United States into an open-ended conflict that has
already cost tens of thousands of lives during the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program will strengthen democratic government, the rule
of law, economic stability and human rights in that beleaguered
country,'' said Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House's drug czar.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy those who warned of a Vietnam-like quagmire, the
House approved by voice vote an amendment to limit U.S. military
personnel sent to Colombia to 300 at any one time, unless more are
needed for a rescue mission. In promoting his amendment, Rep. Gene
Taylor, a conservative Mississippi Democrat, said, ``I expect they
want American kids to fight in the war they won't fight and
American taxpayers to pay for a war they won't pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid to Colombia, which is the source of 90 percent of the
cocaine and 65 percent of the heroin seized in the United States,
was the main lightning rod in the debate. But the overall spending
measure that includes the anti-drug program is imperiled in the
Senate because of opposition from the Senate's top two Republican
leaders, Trent Lott of Mississippi and Don Nickles of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators do not oppose the Kosovo or Colombia aid. But
Lott has vowed to block the bill, saying it has become ``bloated''
with pork and other non-urgent spending.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to roll the most pressing aid proposals _ including
those for Kosovo, Colombia, as well as millions of dollars in flood
relief for North Carolina farmers _ into Congress' annual
appropriations process.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's proponents say that approach would postpone badly
needed aid for months, leaving disaster-stricken Americans in the
lurch and jeopardizing Washington's commitment to the fragile
democracy in Colombia, the hemispheric hub for narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert made the anti-drug program one of
his top legislative priorities, and on Wednesday he took to the
House floor to give a rare speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must act now,'' Hastert said. ``We cannot wait. We have a
responsibility to stop drugs in Colombia, to stop them in transit,
to stop them at our border, and to stop them on our streets and in
our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which has been borrowing from other accounts to
pay for the Kosovo operation, says that if it does not get $2
billion by late April, the Army, in particular, will have to cancel
training and postpone maintenance, all steps that could hurt
military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's lopsided vote in the House and a brewing revolt by
influential Senate Republicans who favor the immediate dispatch of
the Kosovo and Colombia aid may force Lott to relent. Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, who heads the Appropriations Committee, said his
panel would take up a $9 billion spending bill, which includes the
Kosovo aid, in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The administration originally proposed a $5.2 billion emergency
spending bill, but the House Appropriations Committee added about
$3.8 billion more earlier this month. Lawmakers on Wednesday night
then loaded on $4 billion more in additional military spending to
cover unanticipated costs of spare parts, military healthcare and
safety maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects in the House bill that the White House did
not request _ and Lott is grumbling about _ include $600 million to
repair highways and bridges and $75 million to spruce up NASA's
fleet of Shuttles and $20 million to build a new Food and Drug
Administration building in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   All but $421 million of the bill would be paid for from this
year's projected $26 billion non-Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor Tuesday and Wednesday, lawmakers passionately
debated the plan to send $1.7 billion during two years to help
Colombia, as well as other Andean nations like Ecuador and Peru,
step up its fight against drug traffickers by reducing cocaine and
heroin production.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's final vote reflected divisions across party lines,
both over Colombia and the bill's ballooning cost: 143 Republicans
and 119 Democrats voted in favor, while 61 Republicans and 84
Democrats voted against. Each side drew the vote of an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the aid package framed their debate not only in
terms of supporting an embattled Latin American ally, but also as a
bold move in the war on drugs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more hundreds or thousands of our kids will get
hooked on drugs or die from overdoses?'' said Rep. C.W. Bill Young,
R-Fla., who heads the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But critics warned that the United States was being drawn more
deeply into a convoluted civil conflict in Colombia, a country with
two leftist guerrilla armies fighting the government, right-wing
paramilitary forces fighting the guerrillas, and civilians trapped
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the aid package is 30 Blackhawk and 33 Huey
helicopters for the Colombian army and police forces, as well as
$470 million for the Colombian army and $115.5 million for the
police, that would be used to train and equip three Army battalions
for anti-drug operations, two of which would be new.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The measure also offer farmers incentives to grow other crops,
and finance programs to promote human rights and judicial reform,
but that did not assuage critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting involved in a civil war for which we're going to
pay a price,'' said Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also balked at giving the bulk of the aid to the
Colombia military, which has ties to paramilitaries implicated in
human-rights abuses. Given these objections, many critics said the
aid would be better served treating patients for drug abuse in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't really get to the heart of the matter: the drug
problem in our country,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ``Some
5.5 million Americans need substance-abuse treatment, and only 2
million are getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall spending bill also includes $143 million in
emergency economic aid to Balkan countries and other nations in
southeast Europe. House members, by a vote of 219-200, defeated an
attempt to force President Clinton to start withdrawing U.S. troops
from Kosovo unless he certified that European NATO allies shoulder
their share of costs for international police, humanitarian aid and
economic reconstruction.

COURT OBJECTIONS FILED TO FEN-PHEN SETTLEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By MELODY PETERSEN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawyers opposed to the proposed settlement for the millions of
people who took the diet drug combination fen-phen filed objections
in federal court on Thursday charging that the plan was illegal and
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The objections were filed on the last day that users of the diet
drug could opt out of the national settlement and instead pursue
separate lawsuits against American Home Products, the drug company
in Madison, N.J., that sold half of the diet pill combination.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of the 6 million people who took fen-phen _ a
combination of American Home's Pondimin, its brand name for
fenfluramine, and phentermine, another diet drug _ have decided to
opt out of the proposed settlement. Under the settlement plan,
American Home has agreed to pay $3.75 billion to the plaintiffs,
ranging from small payments of $30 to $60 to those who took the
drug for less than two months to as much as $1.5 million to people
with significant injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for American Home said on Thursday that the company
did not yet know how many people had opted out. That number would
not be known for several weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't foresee a high percentage of claimants opting out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   If too many people opt out, American Home can terminate the
deal. But that would only continue the financial uncertainty that
has plagued the company since it pulled the diet drugs off the
market in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement is very important,'' said Neil B. Sweig, an
analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. If it fails, he said, ``it would have a
dramatically negative effect on American Home's stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 lawsuits are now pending against the company _ a
legal mess that is hurting the company's chances of merging with
one of its competitors. The drug industry is now in a frenzy of
consolidation and American Home has attempted three mergers in two
years, but failed at each one.
</P>
<P>
   The legal objections filed on Thursday in federal court in
Philadelphia joined those of other lawyers who are arguing that the
settlement should be abandoned because it does not adequately
compensate those who took the diet drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the objections filed on Thursday, by a group of lawyers
representing thousands of plaintiffs, argued that the settlement
would omit people who had not yet developed the heart defects
associated with fen-phen. The group of lawyers said that people
developing heart valve defects after the 18-month screening period
would not be able to pursue another claim against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers argued that the settlement was ``little more than a
series of traps'' for diet pill users that shifted part of American
Home's liability onto people who may fall ill in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The law firms also argued that the fees proposed to be paid to
the plaintiffs' lawyers overseeing the national settlement were
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Louis Bechtle of U.S. District Court in Philadelphia will
review the objections at hearings scheduled to begin on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Chesley, a lawyer in Cincinnati and a co-chair of the
committee of lawyers overseeing the settlement, disputed the claims
filed on Thursday. Chesley said that research has shown that diet
drug users who have not yet shown signs of heart defects are not
likely to become ill. And, he said that the legal fees of $430
million were fair, since they were less than 10 percent of the
total amount that American Home could ultimately pay out under the
proposed deal.

REVOLUTION NEED FINISHING TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Kicking a soccer ball into an 8-yard-by-8-foot net
is the most basic of sporting skills. A 2-year-old can accomplish
it with ease.
</P>
<P>
   But converting goals in a soccer game, against bunched defenses
and hot goalkeepers, is a different proposition. Then it becomes
one of sport's most difficult tasks, even for the most finely tuned
athletes, which is one reason goal scorers capture imaginations and
generate so much passion.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have been a good example of the vagaries of goal
scoring this season. They have had many excellent chances but have
scored only once and have 1 point after two games. And their
prospects are not great Saturday night since they visit the Los
Angeles Galaxy, among MLS's strongest teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always waiting for somebody else who is in better
position to score a goal,'' Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo said.
``We have to pull the trigger, become more selfish in the (penalty
area) instead of looking for a beautiful goal. You have to hit it
when nobody expects it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, scoring has never been the Revolution's greatest
problem. Three of the top five goal scorers in MLS history have
played for the Revolution. And the current strike force, Wolde
Harris and Eduardo Hurtado, should be among the most dangerous
combinations in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goal scoring takes a lot of confidence and a little luck,''
Harris said. ``I don't think anybody has higher expectations than
we have in ourselves. I put more pressure on myself than the
coaches do, and we all have that attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have high expectations. That is a challenge that
comes with the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution players are continuing to adjust to each other.
Of the starting midfielders, only Imad Baba was with the team two
years ago. But Baba, who converted off a Ted Chronopoulos free kick
in a season-opening 1-1 tie March 18 at Miami, has played only four
games since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And the Revolution are counting on the Harris-Hurtado
combination to provide finishing. Both are speedy, strong, and
comfortable with the ball at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Harris scored 26 goals in 83 games with Colorado before joining
the Revolution last month. Hurtado, who is in Quito, Ecuador, for
the Ecuador-Venezuela World Cup qualifier Thursday night, had 47
goals in 114 games with the Galaxy and MetroStars. Hurtado is also
the leading scorer in Ecuador national team history with 25 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hurtado) is mobile and he can hold possession, which gives me
time to find open spaces,'' Harris said. ``And I can do the same
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to find out where we work best together. We like
to play one- and two-touch and give-and-go, especially at the top
of the (penalty area). We need to combine better there.''
</P>
<P>
   The best Revolution goal scorers of the past _ Raul Diaz Arce,
Joe-Max Moore, and Giovanni Savarese _ were opportunists who often
converted out of chaotic situations. Now the Revolution are
attempting to play a more fluid style, and it paid off in several
excellent chances last Saturday at Tampa Bay. But those
opportunities were either parried by goalkeeper Scott Garlick or
squandered by inaccuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Miami, we were concentrating on defending and played
with one forward up front,'' Harris said. ``Against Tampa Bay,
everyone was working for everyone else. If you noticed, when we
lost the ball, everyone got back behind the ball. And that gave us
confidence to create. All we have to do now is finish our
chances.''

MICROSOFT'S SETTLEMENT OFFERS: AS ANTITRUST REMEDIES, TOO LITTLE,
TOO LATE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (News Analysis) 
(bl) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over and over again for the last several years,
Microsoft Corp. has asserted that separating its Web browser from
Windows was impossible. And yet, in settlement talks with the
government, the company has reportedly offered to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   One possible reason for this change of heart, some experts say,
is that it doesn't matter anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's closing the barn door after the horses are already out,''
said Stephen Houck, who was the chief lawyer for the 19 states that
filed suit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Trial evidence showed that Microsoft built its browser, Internet
Explorer, into Windows as a tactic to put its chief competitor,
Netscape Communications Corp., at a disadvantage. But the browser
war is over. Microsoft won. Industry studies show that Netscape's
share of the market _ about 50 percent when the antitrust trial
opened two years ago _ has precipitously declined since then,
though the precise estimates vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great remedy in 1995, but now Netscape Navigator
has been defeated; the battle's lost,'' said Steven Salop, a
professor of law and economics at Georgetown University who has at
times served as a consultant for some of Microsoft's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The manner by which Microsoft has offered to do this has not
been disclosed. The company has several options. But the most
likely method is the one Microsoft employed once before, in January
1998, in response to an earlier federal lawsuit. Then, the company
said it would hide or partly disable the browser, though the code
would remain in Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Felten, a Princeton University computer scientist, hid
and disabled the browser with a removal program he wrote while
serving as a government witness during the antitrust trial in 1998.
But in court, Microsoft adroitly demonstrated that, the way its
software is written, Internet Explorer shows up unexpectedly now
and then _ no matter how well the program is hidden _ backing its
contention that the browser is integral to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Several other proposals that Microsoft is said to have offered
in the settlement talks also have significant potential problems.
Experts also say that none of the remedies that have been discussed
as a solution to this case come without liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   One official close to the talks said the problems and
liabilities are the very issues under discussion now as the parties
exchange drafts of their settlement proposals in an effort to come
to an agreement by next Wednesday, the deadline set by a
court-appointed mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every single provision,'' the official said, ``there are a
lot of questions about how you define the terms, how you enforce
it, how they might try to evade it and how it addresses tomorrow's
issues, not just today's.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said the Justice Department has been a strong,
longtime advocate of one of Microsoft's ideas, to publish price
lists for the Windows operating system, so Microsoft could not use
prices to penalize companies that defy its will.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea is accepted, Microsoft would most likely formulate
standard, tiered prices for Windows. The more copies a computer
manufacturer bought, the lower the price. But that variation aside,
every manufacturer would pay the same price.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Economides, an economist at New York University, said
he likes the idea ``of having a uniform price list for all
customers'' to prevent price discrimination. But others see
significant pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Iowa
who serves as an occasional consultant for the state and federal
governments in this case, notes that there are myriad ways that
Microsoft could continue rewarding friends and punishing others,
even with a uniform price list.
</P>
<P>
   The company could make special joint marketing arrangements with
preferred customers, or give them special terms in
technical-support contracts. ``One of the things we know about
pricing is that firms are extremely creative about evading price
restrictions,'' Hovenkamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Salop added that ``if Microsoft can't punish them with the price
of Windows any more, they can punish them with the price of
Office,'' Microsoft's suite of application programs that also holds
more than a 90 percent share of its market. It is not a part of the
current legal case.
</P>
<P>
   Houck, who is now in private practice, raised an additional
concern. Maybe Microsoft would no longer be able use prices as
punishment. Conversely, however, companies would no longer be able
to negotiate the best price, ``and I think that will lead to higher
Windows prices overall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under another major Microsoft proposal, the company would make
available all of the interface codes that allow software developers
to write programs for Windows. Microsoft has argued for years that
it already does that because making the codes widely available is
in the company's interest. That way more software companies will
write programs for Windows, Microsoft says.
</P>
<P>
   But trial evidence showed that Microsoft's enthusiasm for making
the codes public varied by circumstance. Salop notes that Microsoft
seems less willing to publish the codes for use by software
programs that are serious competitors to Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new development, something they haven't offered
before,'' Houck said. ``But it's extremely complex. They can bury
the codes deeper and deeper. It's very hard to figure out what they
are doing, and you will have to have a detailed regulatory regimen
to keep up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that is the chief complaint all of the experts offered
about the whole package _ those that have been discussed in the
media and others that are still not publicly known.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of this,'' Salop said, ``you're going to need ongoing
cooperation from Microsoft, and you'll be unlikely to get it
voluntarily.'' He and others said they feared that, trying to
enforce the settlement agreement, the government would continually
find itself back in court.

SENATE TO TAKE UP PROPOSAL TO SUSPEND 4.3-CENT-A-GALLON GAS TAX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate agreed Thursday to take up a proposal by
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that would temporarily suspend
the 4.3-cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax enacted in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the procedural motion, passed by a vote of 86-11, was no
guarantee that the bill will ever be seriously debated or moved to
a final vote since many Republicans have split ranks to join with
most Democrats in opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the vote suggested that lawmakers do not want to be
seen as opposing a tax rollback in an election year. By keeping the
measure alive members will also have more time to consider how to
respond, if at all, to the high gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lott insisted on moving ahead with his bill despite a decision
this week by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
boost oil production. The OPEC move is expected by this summer to
lower and stabilize prices at the pump, which now average about
$1.50 per gallon nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's proposal, dubbed the ``fuel tax holiday'' bill, would
suspend the 4.3-cent tax until Jan. 1. It also contains a provision
that would trigger the suspension of the remaining 14.1-cent a
gallon federal tax if gasoline prices reach $2.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said his measure would ``do something immediately'' to
ensure that ``people aren't hammered'' by high gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said the measure would provide little, if any,
relief for car-dependent Americans and accused Lott of using the
issue in an attempt to focus blame for the high prices on the
Clinton administration and Vice President Al Gore. Lott has often
referred to the federal gasoline tax as the ``Gore tax'' because
the vice president, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee,
cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to make it law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear that repeal of the gas tax is really an
effort to make a political statement,'' said Sen. Harry Reid,
D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP House members also shrugged off the Lott proposal as
``political theatrics,'' noting that it has little chance of
passing in that chamber even if approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, made that clear
earlier this week when he told reporters that Lott's proposal would
provide ``scant relief'' to motorists. Armey said the plan also
presents ``a real dilemma'' for Republicans who only last year
signed off on a measure guaranteeing that the federal gas tax would
be put into the National Highway Trust Fund and dedicated to
helping states maintain and improve their road systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot repeal the trust fund after we've just restored the
trust find. We cannot turn around from the commitment we've made on
it,'' Armey said, echoing a view held by many GOP House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumed Republican presidential
nominee, has apparently adopted a similar position. However, he has
suggested that a ``temporary repeal'' of the gas tax might be one
option he would explore as president to deal with rising prices.
Bush speaks cautiously about the idea because Texas and other
states could be forced to make up lost revenues if federal gas tax
funds are cut off, if only temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is now one of largest recipients of federal highway money.
It recoups nearly 95 cents of every dollar it pays into the trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Up until last year, most of the trust fund money _ $7 billion to
$8 billion a year _ was being siphoned off by Congress for use in
other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan measure sponsored by Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., outlawed that practice as part of the
national transportation program that was reauthorized last year by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said he would not vote to ``undue the Byrd-Gramm bill,''
but he would support ``a temporary set-aside'' if it can be made up
from other funding sources.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said his proposal would make up the loss of the gas tax
money by shifting other federal funds around in the 2001 budget and
using anticipated surpluses to replenish the trust fund on Dec. 31
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., labeled that approach a
``hocus pocus'' way to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even have a budget (for the 2001 fiscal year), let
alone a budget surplus,'' she said in a floor speech.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The financial markets humble ordinary investors all
the time. In Julian H. Robertson Jr., head of Tiger Management,
they have humbled an investing giant.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of generating superlative investment returns by
buying stocks that were undervalued and selling short those that
carried excessive valuations, Robertson confirmed Thursday that he
is shutting Tiger's operations. He has essentially decided to stop
driving the wrong way down the one-way tech thoroughfare that Wall
Street has become.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference room of his sumptuous Manhattan offices
Thursday just after he had written his farewell letter to the
roughly 700 investors in his six funds, Robertson mused cheerfully
about his career in the stock market, the joys and perils of
managing other peoples' money and the end of the era in which his
investment calls regularly moved markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not capitulating,'' he said. ``I'm not going to quit
investing. But it will be nice to get out of the public eye. I
don't mind people calling me an old economy investor, but it
doesn't go over well with the clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does losing money, of course, which is what forced
Robertson to fold Tiger's tent. The difficulties began in the early
fall of 1998 when Russia defaulted on its debt. Tiger lost $1.6
billion in bad currency bets that year, producing a decline of
almost 4 percent for 1998. Things got worse the next year when
technology stocks roared and value shares tumbled. Tiger's returns
plunged 19 percent. So far this year, the funds are down 13.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a frustrated value investor, Robertson finds himself in good
company, like Warren Buffett, whose returns last year, measured by
Berkshire Hathaway's book value, rose a woeful 0.5 percent. Then
there's Robert Sanborn, a once-hot mutual fund manager, who
resigned last week from his stewardship of the Oakmark Fund after a
dismal 1999 in which the fund lost 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robertson's long-term record is a stand-out. An initial
investor in his fund would have seen his capital grow 85 times as
of earlier this year. Robertson's 25 percent annualized return
since his fund's inception in 1980 handily beats the 17.5 percent
average annual gains in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index, with
dividends reinvested, for the period. Tiger's returns also exceed
the 14.7 percent average annual gains in the Morgan Stanley total
return world index, a proxy for international equities.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, as Tiger's woes became pronounced in recent years,
investors grew nervous and quickened their withdrawals from his
hedge funds, which cater to institutional investors and wealthy
individuals. At its peak in 1998, Tiger managed more than $21
billion. Since August 1998, however, investors have withdrawn $7.65
billion, including $950 million in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is a testament to Robertson's management that even as word
spread of Tiger's closing, the financial markets remained calm.
That is because Robertson has been slowly liquidating his holdings
over the last 18 months and reducing the fund's use of borrowed
funds. As a result, Tiger's unwinding created none of the upheaval
that surrounded the near failure of Long Term Capital Management in
September 1998. Then, the prospect of the huge hedge fund dumping
its holdings into already damaged markets pushed the Federal
Reserve of New York to broker a deal to unwind the fund gradually
with the help of several big Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a long process,'' Robertson said. ``Since 1998,
we've been trying to take the leverage out of the funds. Because of
partner withdrawals, we've probably sold or bought between $60 and
$70 billion of securities.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he will have paid his clients 80 percent of what
they are owed by the end of April. Because he has been unwinding
his funds' positions over time, he said that 75 percent of the
refund will be in cash and an additional 5 percent in 11 stocks
that Tiger still owns. These are Bear Stearns Companies, Bowater
Inc., Federal-Mogul, Navistar, Niagara Mohawk Power, Pittston
Brinks Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Sealed Air, Starwood Hotels,
Tosco Corp and Unum Provident. Because the holdings represent
relatively small slivers of the total shares of these companies,
the prospect of some Tiger investors selling should not hang over
them too darkly.
</P>
<P>
   Another five stocks in which Tiger has a large stake represent
the remaining 20 percent owed to investors. These will be kept by
Tiger to be disposed of later, in blocks perhaps, at better prices
than the fund would get if it dumped them on the market at once.
The five are GTech Holdings, US Airways, United Asset Management,
Xtra Corp. and Normandy Mining Limited. Robertson said he had
fielded many calls over the last few days from investors or
corporate executives looking to buy his positions.
</P>
<P>
   It is not lost on Robertson that many of the same stocks he had
been betting against in recent months _ Internet shares, technology
stocks and other beloved new economy stocks _ have been in freefall
since Tiger's shutdown became public. In the last four trading
sessions, the Nasdaq composite has lost 10.2 percent. ``If we had
been in business this week, it would have been one of our best
weeks ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's exit from the hedge fund business makes some market
observers wonder if the bear market in value stocks may finally be
ending. ``I have great faith that this too will pass,'' he wrote in
letter Thursday to investors. ``The difficulty is predicting when
this change will occur and in this regard I have no advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson may have been bloodied by the mania for technology
stocks and shares of untested and unprofitable Internet companies.
But he remains unbowed in his belief that value stocks will make a
comeback. ``The key to Tiger's success over the years has been a
steady commitment to buying the best stocks and shorting the
worst,'' Robertson wrote to his clients. ``In a rational
environment, this strategy functions well. But in an irrational
market, where earnings and price considerations take a back seat to
mouse clicks and momentum, such logic, as we have learned, does not
count for much.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson fears for investors in stocks with little in the way
of history, earnings or even revenues when the current mania ends.
``Investors are rightly fascinated by the Internet.'' he said,
``but wrongly they do not include price in these equations. It's
going to end in a real bloodbath.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson was one of the last holdouts in value investing; many
others have gone against their beliefs and jumped onto the
technology bandwagon. ``Life and investing are long ballgames,''
Robertson said. ``The people who were cynical and jumped in and
played this boom are going to win this game. But to take the
cynical risk against your fundamental belief, I wonder if in the
long run that will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he will have more time on his hands, Robertson said he
may try to write a novel. ``I've got a great wife that I'm looking
forward to spending more time with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he supports the Strang Clinic for cancer research
and Lincoln Center, and in his hometown of Salisbury, N.C.,
population 25,000, he and his wife have created a charitable
foundation named for his father, who had a textile operation, and
his mother, known for her volunteer work. In just two years, the
Robertson Foundation has given more than $3.5 million to education,
community development and health programs. About half the
foundation's assets are in the Jaguar fund, run by Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Robertson's time will probably be spent with a
handful of Tiger employees hunting for undervalued stocks. ``I'm
looking forward to investing on my own,'' he said. ``I've not
believed in playing the markets. I've always believed fundamentals
will win out.''
</P>
<P>
   Against all the odds, he still does.

THE GENIUS AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ They did not waste his time, nor did they
engage him. They were just there, a collection of nuisances
standing before him in Minnesota uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   They bored him Thursday afternoon at City of Palms Park. It's a
wonder he didn't doze in the middle of his windup. It was the kind
of boredom you sometimes find on a date. You know the punchline
long before the first icebreaker joke has been told, but you sit
there politely and force a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez has heard the jokes before. He's a genius. Not a
comedic genius. He is the know-it-all with the ball. If these
spring ``games'' weren't so mundane, he would have told you how
mundane they are. But that would have been a waste of his time.
</P>
<P>
   His best sunny-day alternative Thursday was to pitch against the
Twins. It was his last warmup before Opening Day, Tuesday in
Seattle. He went five innings, threw 83 pitches, the Red Sox won,
6-5, and . . .
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second. You want numbers? You don't understand him if you
want numbers. They don't matter. The box score will show the Twins
roughed him up in the fifth. A homer. A triple. A run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
   A joke.
</P>
<P>
   He knew exactly what they were doing. Todd Walker hit a home run
_ the pitch was a cut fastball _ and the genius explained that the
ball ``stayed low and matched (Walker's) bat speed.'' There were
six strikeouts. There were six other hits, only one of which he
anointed as legitimate. A catcher named Marcus Jensen took a low
changeup and turned it into a single up the middle. Martinez
respected that hit. ``The rest were mediocre pitches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was calm as he spoke. You felt like you were interviewing a
computer programmer rather than a pitcher. You got the sense he
knew exactly where everything was supposed to be. He spoke, again,
of how boring spring training is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I didn't have to come to the field,'' he said. And that
statement roused an idea: This guy could literally mail in his
work. I'll bet that Martinez could sit at a computer, write out a
pitching plan _ including the mental and physical aspects of the
game _ and e-mail it to an aspiring Pedro clone. I say that clone
could stay competitive for six innings by following Martinez's
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if boredom overwhelms, Martinez will try that next spring.
Imagine: ``You've Got Mail . . . from Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Other pitchers, those not blessed with Martinez's gifts, shrug
when you ask them what went wrong in a game. They tell you it was a
bad day, they don't know what happened, and they'll have to move
on. Martinez knows what happened. If you ever meet him, watch the
way he looks at you. He studies you. He picks up your quirks,
patterns in your speech, everything. He then files them away. He's
always ahead.
</P>
<P>
   He was ahead before he left his native Dominican Republic for
the United States in 1990. He didn't speak English, but he studied
his older brother's English books. When he arrived in the US, he
made a habit of learning a new vocabulary word every day. Now he
knows English well enough to correct yours. He probably wouldn't do
that, but he could.
</P>
<P>
   Back to these games. Can't you give him a bigger challenge than
this? He says, yes, the Sox could win the World Series. He says the
Yankees won't intimidate him unless they ``bring in somebody from
Venus.'' He knows the routine.
</P>
<P>
   The genius dresses as carefully as he pitches: Dark blue
two-piece suit. Perfect material. Collarless antique-white shirt.
Meticulous black shoes. On the mound he wears No. 45, the same
number the dominating Bob Gibson wore. He says he doesn't know much
about Gibson. Finally, he's wrong. If he watches a tape of himself
at his best, he will have a better understanding of who Gibson was.
The only people who can truly understand his genius are other
living members of the Genius Tribunal, men such as Gibson, Sandy
Koufax, and Juan Marichal.
</P>
<P>
   His big brother understands, too. Ramon Martinez talked on a
cell phone as his 28-year-old brother tried to do the impossible:
explain what he does to those who don't do what he does. At times,
it sounded as if he were cocky. He's not. He is confident enough to
make insecure people believe that he is cocky.
</P>
<P>
   There is a question coming in from his right. The questioner
says something about Martinez historically beginning seasons well.
Whoa. The cool pitcher takes his hands out of his pockets, walks to
a wooden locker stall, and knocks on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you from Boston?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You trying to jinx me?''
</P>
<P>
   He continues.
</P>
<P>
   Really, what did people think he would do against the Twins? He
was hurt during last season's playoffs, but he is not hurting
anymore. He says he feels good. It will take three or four starts
before he gets his rhythm. He knows rhythm like Beethoven knew
sonatas. He will win a lot games this year, not walk many batters
(37 last season in 213 innings), and have a low ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be more consistent with my release point,'' he says.
``Do you know what a release point is? It's the point where you
release the ball. Very important.''
</P>
<P>
   He walks away, thinking of correcting these technical flaws in
his profession. Some of his contemporaries don't see what he sees.
That makes sense. He's a genius.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House counsel, Beth Nolan, testified before a
congressional committee Thursday that the large cache of misplaced
electronic mail at the center of a controversy would be recovered
and supplied to investigators within six months, far sooner than
her previous prediction of a two-year delay.
</P>
<P>
   But the contracts that the White House signed this week with
computer companies to recover the lost messages for an estimated $2
million did little to stem criticism from congressional
Republicans, who are furious that presidential aides did not
disclose the computer problem when they learned of it almost two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, top White House officials were told that their
computer system was not storing some e-mail correspondence properly
because of unintentional system errors. The problem was fixed in
November 1998 but thousands of messages received by presidential
aides before then were not put into an archival system that made
them available for searches in response to subpoenas by a variety
of investigating agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A separate flaw in the computer system in Vice President Gore's
office has affected incoming and outgoing e-mail correspondence.
Nolan said that computer specialists are still attempting to fix
the problem there; in the meantime, she said, aides to Gore have
been instructed to print out incoming messages in case they are
needed later.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure what is on the misplaced electronic
correspondence, which involves messages sent to White House
personnel from ourside the system and covers the period from 1996
to 1998, but investigations of several controversies, including
campaign finance and Monica Lewinsky, were underway during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Thursday before the House Government Reform
Committee, Nolan testified that White House officials learned of
the problem in 1998 but only recently became aware that it might
have kept the White House from turning over e-mails sought by
independent counsels, congressional committees and the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one attempted to hide responsive information from this
committee or from any other investigative body,'' said Nolan,
speaking for the executive office of the president. ``The EOP has
produced or identified to this committee all responsive information
that it located, including over 7,700 pages of e-mail records in
the campaign finance investigation alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nolan, who took over the White House's top legal job last
August and testified before Congress Thursday for the first time in
the post, came under harsh criticism from Republicans who did not
believe her account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seriously doubt that explanation,'' said Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., who is the committee's chairman. He vowed to introduce a
House resolution recommending that Attorney General Janet Reno name
a special counsel to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's campaign finance task force is already
conducting a criminal investigation of the controversy, including
contentions that White House officials threatened computer
specialists who discovered the problem to keep the matter under
wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, the committee chairman, is skeptical that the Justice
Department will vigorously investigate the matter. Still, he
recommended Thursday that the department prosecute a White House
computer specialist for committing perjury in connection with the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Barry, the specialist, filed an affidavit in a civil suit
in which he said that White House e-mail messages were being stored
by the Automated Records Management System, an archive that could
be searched for subpoenaed messages, since 1994. But in that
affidavit, he did not mention the problem that had resulted in
large numbers of e-mail messages not be properly captured.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan and Robert Raben, a Justice Department lawyer, testified
Thursday they did not know who assisted Barry in filing the
affidavit. Irritating congressional Republicans, Nolan also
maintained that while Barry's affidavit may not have disclosed
information about the missing e-mails, it was still literally true.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., accused his Republican colleagues
of overreaching in an effort to create another scandal. He said
that not enough information was known to determine whether White
House officials had illegally covered up the computer problems to
stymie investigations of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deliberate concealment would seem to be a case of obstruction
of justice,'' Waxman said. ``Honest confusion, on the other hand,
would be regrettable but understandable. And until we know the
facts, we should be careful about making unsubstantiated
accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said the question of what the e-mail messages contain may
be resolved within 170 days, after two Virginia-based contractors _
ECS Technologies and the System Research and Applications Corp. _
scan the messages from backup computer tapes. Nolan said that the
White House would turn over any relevant correspondence to
investigators starting in June.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are furious that they do not already have the
messages, and say they are concerned that the White House will try
to drag out the process of finding and turning over the e-mail
messages, perhaps until after the presidential election or after
Clinton leaves office.

<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. _ After promising to spend a million dollars a
week on television commercials to introduce himself to New Jersey
voters, Jon Corzine, a Democratic Senate candidate, on Thursday
found himself trying to distance himself from the kind of exposure
no candidate could buy or would want _ publicity about ethnic slurs
against Italian-Americans, the state's largest ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, whose appearances on the campaign trail have typically
been attended by a few print reporters, found himself looking into
11 television cameras Thursday morning as he apologized for making
derogatory references to Italians as recently as two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intended to cause embarrassment, and I never intended
to offend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's offhand remarks _ most recently, suggesting that a
contractor he had just met made ``cement shoes'' for a living _
drew loud protests Thursday from a number of Italian civic leaders
and even from the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were doubly damning for Corzine, a political
neophyte who became a multimillionaire as chairman of the
investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and is running against Jim
Florio, the former governor, in the June 6 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   First, the furor was the first time many voters paid attention
to him and to a race that is just taking shape. Second, they played
into questions even some of his own supporters have raised about
whether Corzine has the political skills and experience to
translate his millions into a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's done that on Wall Street,'' said Thomas P. Giblin,
the state Democratic chairman, who is supporting Corzine. ``But
this is the big leagues as far as politics are concerned. You can't
make another mistake like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine expressed hope that he would be given credit for owning
up to his mistakes immediately and candidly. ``I would hope that
people will find that Jon Corzine handles these things in a
straightforward way, consistent with integrity,'' he said. His
staff released a letter of support Thursday night signed by 24
Italian-American Democrats, saying: ``We accept Jon's apology as
sincere and heartfelt. Jon made the apology immediately last night
and repeated it twice today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli issued his own statement, saying: ``There
is a difference between an offhand comment and prejudice. Jon
Corzine is my friend and I bear some responsibility for his
candidacy. Neither would be the case if there was not genuine
mutual affection and an absence of any prejudice against
Italian-Americans or anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics were not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have an individual who is a decided underdog in the
campaign, and he's not thinking of the things that he says, where
you should be extra careful, trying to make friends,'' said A.
Joseph Fortunato, a former Democratic state legislator who is
publisher of The Italian Tribune, a weekly newspaper based in
Newark. ``Sometimes flippant remarks like that are indicative of
what his actual feelings are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Corzine's apology _ delivered at a news conference where he
received the endorsement of Unite, a union representing about
15,000 garment-industry workers statewide _ drew mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters to clarify his offensive statements,
Corzine declined, and became increasingly tongue-tied as he
deviated from a prepared statement. ``I shouldn't have said what I
am reported to have said,'' he said. ``And if I did, I apologized
for them, and I apologize for them again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Florio, who is Italian-American and who remains well ahead of
Corzine in the polls, seized on Corzine's missteps again Thursday.
``I know enough people who have been subject to bitter treatment
over their lives to not regard this as humorous,'' he said. ``I
don't think it is befitting anyone who would like to be a lawmaker
in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, supporters of Corzine on Thursday impugned the
motives of those who had come forward with the allegations about
his slurs against Italians.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Fumosa, a former president of the New Jersey Sons of Italy
who was one of several people who quoted Corzine making a
derogatory remark at a dinner with several Italian-Americans last
July, acknowledged Thursday that he had since been rebuffed in an
attempt to have the Corzine campaign hire a friend of his.
</P>
<P>
   But he said one had nothing to do with the other. ``It did
happen, though, really,'' he said of Corzine's slur.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Giblin, the state Democratic chairman, said that Fumosa had
asked him to put the same friend on the state Democratic
committee's payroll as recently as 10 days ago. ``Their hands
aren't clean either,'' Giblin said of Fumosa and other accusers of
Corzine. ``When you have this much indignation, how come you keep
it shelved for six months, and when you don't get a job, you use
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph V. Doria Jr., the assembly minority leader and mayor of
Bayonne, accused the Florio campaign of engineering the
disclosures, but offered no proof. ``I have Italian-American
credentials you don't have and no one else has,'' Doria said,
before listing his parentage of immigrants, his affiliations with
fraternal organizations, and his Legion of Merit award from the
Italian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``A politician having dinner, having a discussion, and making a
misstatement, that doesn't offend me,'' he said. ``It offends me
when people use it as an issue politically.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the strangest sideline to Thursday's drama of traded
accusations and reciprocal indignation, Corzine (pronounced
CORE-zyne), who grew up on a farm in Illinois, provided a little
more information about his own roots. the question, however,
remained, how he could have survived 25 years making small talk in
a state as ethnically diverse as New Jersey without finding out for
sure.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said that his mother's lineage was English, and that his
grandmother was a member of the Daughters of the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   As for his surname: ``My father used to argue that we were
French,'' he said. ``Everyone else says we're Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he think he is, Corzine was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``For certain,'' he said with a sheepish grin, ``I am Italian.''

 &HT;    Plaintiffs give Coke a proposal
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola has received a detailed settlement proposal
from the plaintiffs in a racial discrimination lawsuit and is in
the process of formulating a counterproposal.
</P>
<P>
   That process is taking place as pressure for a speedy settlement
continues to build _ from both the investment and civil rights
arenas.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a large institutional investor that owns $370
million in Coke stock urged the company to act quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, for the second day in a row, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson met with high-ranking company officials to push for a
settlement. Jackson, president of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, was
joined by Larry Jones, a former company manager who is organizing a
bus ``ride for justice'' to Coca-Cola's annual meeting in
Wilimington, Del., on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure Coke is carefully weighing their options,'' said
Janice Mathis, Rainbow/PUSH's chief of staff and general counsel,
who also attended Thursday's meeting at the company's Atlanta
headquarters. ``I think they want to get this behind them. ... But
there are lots of issues to be resolved, and they're complicated
issues. I do think both sides are motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   The company could be a little more motivated after it received a
letter Thursday from New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who
is the sole trustee of the state's common retirement fund. The fund
owns 7.4 million Coca-Cola shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit has already damaged Coca-Cola's reputation and
its shareholder value,'' McCall wrote in a letter to Chairman Doug
Daft. ``It is important that you take the steps necessary to halt
this damage and strengthen Coca-Cola's commitment to tolerance and
inclusion in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Company observers and analysts said it's possible for McCall's
letter to spur other large public pension funds into taking similar
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Ware, the company's executive vice president of global
public affairs and administration, spoke with McCall after
receiving the letter, said company spokesman Chuck Reece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always attentive to the concerns of our shareholders,''
Reece said. According to Reece, Ware told McCall that he would
continue to keep McCall informed as the company works ``toward a
quick and equitable resolution of the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ware was busy working on the fallout from the lawsuit Thursday.
He, along with President Jack Stahl and Vice President Ingrid
Saunders Jones, met for more than two hours with Jackson,Jones,
Mathis and Joe Beasley, Rainbow/PUSH's regional director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a candid and productive discussion,'' said company
spokesman Ben Deutsch. ``We welcome Rev. Jackson's input and
counsel, and we expect to continue these discussions as we move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis said Jackson left Atlanta on Thursday but is willing to
return if he can help move the settlement process along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my understanding that the plaintiffs have forwarded a
settlement proposal to the company,'' Mathis said. ``The company
can settle. They can fight. They have to decide how to respond to
the plaintiffs' proposal to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The formal negotiating process between the company and
plaintiffs' attorneys is confidential, so neither side has
commented publicly on what is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   But Mathis provided details of the informal meeting she attended
Thursday. A lot of the discussion, she said, was dominated by Ware
and Jones, who was laid off last month after 15 years at the
company. Jones is organizing a three-bus convoy that will hold
ralllies in three cities before reaching the shareholders meeting
in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mathis, who took notes during the meeting, Ware
said he has a mandate to change the company to create a new
environment that will be more open and responsive to employee
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones told Ware, according to Mathis, that it will be
difficult to rebuild the trust lost because of the way
African-Americans have been treated at the company.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mathis, Jones also said the bus trip was taking on
a life of its own and that he is not sure he could stop it, even if
the suit was settled prior to the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed by eight former and current employees,
alleges that the company has discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
The plaintiffs seek class-action status to represent 2,000 current
and former black employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the suit's allegations and opposed
efforts to make it a class-action case.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting with the company Thursday, Jackson met
with a few of the plaintiffs, as well as some of the bus trip
organizers, Mathis said.

CRANBERRY GROWERS SEEK LIMIT ON MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cranberry industry has asked the US Agriculture Department
to impose limits that could reduce this year's projected crop by
about 15 percent, or 500,000 barrels, Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc.
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed market limit is a bid to ease a crisis caused by a
huge cranberry glut. In only a few years, the price growers receive
could drop by nearly 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The restriction was agreed to in a meeting of industry leaders
in Minnesota Thursday. The proposal needs the approval of
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ocean Spray, a Lakeville-based cooperative of
growers, Glickman has promised to respond to the industry's
request, though no timetable has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Under the market-limit proposal, a complex formula would allow
cranberry growers to bring to market this year only about 85
percent of their average production from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Glickman were to approve the industry's recommendation,
Robert Hawthorne, Ocean Spray's president and chief executive,
cautioned that such market limits would ease the situation but not
resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   To boost demand, the industry agreed to invest an unspecified
amount of money into a joint marketing campaign to promote
cranberry consumption, Ocean Spray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cranberry industry has come together for the good of
growers,'' Hawthorne said in a statement. ``We have set aside our
competitive differences to meet this crisis head-on together.''
</P>
<P>
   Local growers were reluctant to comment Thursday on the
industry's proposal until they had time to scrutinize it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, at an earlier meeting, industry leaders failed to
reach a consensus on market limits. At that time, some local
growers expressed concern that some proposals on the table would
have benefitted Wisconsin at the expense of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Many cranberry operations in Massachusetts are much smaller than
those in Canada and Wisconsin, now the nation's largest
cranberry-growing state. According to some local growers, a market
limit could favor big growers.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Decas, a grower who also owns a cranberry processing
plant in Wareham, Mass., noted that cranberry production in
Massachusetts has held steady at just under 2 million barrels in
recent years. The surplus, he contended, has resulted from growers
in Wisconsin and Canada expanding operations.
</P>
<P>
   According to Decas, the market limit could force small, local
growers to subsidize the out-of-state growers who are largely
responsible for the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, many growers got more than $60 for a 100-pound barrel
of berries. This year, barrel prices could dip below $20.

 &HT;    Texas biotech company braves market drop, raises $76.5 million
in IPO
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin-based Luminex Corp. braved an unfavorable
stock market Thursday with its initial public stock offering, but
the company's shares still managed a 34.5 percent rise from the
opening price of $17.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old company raised $76.5 million in its offering of
4.5 million shares, the first IPO by a local biotech company. The
stock price rose as high as $26 before closing at $22.88, up $5.88
in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   But Luminex was one bright spot a cloudy day, as investors sent
many technology stocks tumbling. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell
186.78 to 4,457.89 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down
38.47 at 10,980.25. Local stocks also fell, led by NetSolve Inc.
and Crossroads Systems Inc., which dropped 13.3 and 8.5 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the market's weakness Thursday, investors have been
bullish recently on biotech companies, which are developing
promising drugs and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Luminex makes tools that simplify biological testing and that
can help in detecting genetic variations and diagnosing diseases.
The market for those tools, valued by some analysts at $7.8 billion
in 1998, is expected to grow annually by 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech is coming into its own because it's resulting in real
products, not just research like it was in the 1980s,'' said Gail
Bronson, senior analyst at investment research company IPO Monitor
in California. ``We're starting to see things move from a trickle
to a torrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every company wanted to tough it out in this week's soft
market for tech stocks, in which the Nasdaq index is down almost
400 points. Drugabuse Sciences Inc. postponed its IPO until next
week, a move some analysts attributed to the market drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always too uncertain as to when things are going to
improve again,'' Bronson said. ``But Luminex had to go out
sometime, and I think they just figured, 'What the heck.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the offering, led by Warburg Dillon Read, Luminex had 26.7
million outstanding shares worth roughly $611 million, based on the
day's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Mark Chandler owns 14.6 percent of the company.
Other major shareholders of record include investment banker G.
Walter Loewenbaum, who represents a partnership that owns a
14.3-percent stake, and Van Chandler, vice-president of
instruments, who owns 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company posted a net loss of $9.2 million in 1999 on revenue
of $3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's first ever biotech IPO offers evidence that the area's
long-awaited development of biotech companies may be taking root.
</P>
<P>
   For years, pundits pegged the Austin-San Marcos corridor as an
up-and-coming biotechnology center, but an Austin biotech boom
never took hold, in part because the area lacks a major medical
school.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Luminex debut and a related IPO _ Introgen
Therapeutics Inc. _ in the pipeline, the local biotech community
seems to be picking up steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to describe this as a major defining
moment,'' said Matt Winkler, chief executive of Austin's Ambion
Inc. ``We're past the stage of just founding biotech companies here
_ now they're starting to IPO.''

PROTESTERS PEACEFULLY HOLD FINAL BIO2000 MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As Bio2000 wound down Thursday, protesters dressed in
biohazard suits and carrying a black coffin labeled
``biodiversity'' made a final 20-minute march downtown.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 demonstrators opposed to wide use of genetically
altered foods peacefully met with a line of 20 police officers next
to the convention center where the five-day conference was held.
``We are just trying to save you,'' said one protester as she tried
to hand out pamphlets to street onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last day for us to make a statement,'' said Markus
Nechay, who was dressed in a blue lab coat with ``Doctor Gene''
written on the back. He got the lab coat from his mother, who was a
biochemist.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, which sponsored the conference, said those who
marched outside were actually the ``kind of people you can speak
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention center, demonstrators managed to get into
the last scheduled luncheon and disrupted actor David Lander _
Squiggy on the 1970s hit TV show ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' _during his
speech about a new biotech drug he is using to treat multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the protesters apparently had forged conference badges
and ran up on the speaker's stage to denounce corporations making
biotech drugs. They were immediately escorted away.
</P>
<P>
   Feldbaum said he applauded the Boston police for its
``sensitive'' job this week of keeping the peace while allowing
demonstrators the chance to voice their objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for one lone incident at lunch, it was utterly
peaceful. It was the industry's best meeting,'' said Feldbaum.

UNDER BUSH OR GORE, U.S. TO GET NEW ROLE IN EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush likes to say that if elected president he has no
intention of serving as the nation's schools superintendent,
dispatching the apparatchiks of the federal government to play a
role that is better left to school board members.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore suggests that it is teachers, and not bureaucrats and
politicians, who would be empowered and gain respect in his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But their protestations to the contrary, with Bush or Gore as
president, the federal government would have a more forceful
presence in U.S. classrooms than in previous administrations.
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant to suggest that Gore and Bush are in complete
accord on education. Bush's vision is much less expensive and
relies more heavily than Gore's on holding schools responsible for
student performance. Gore, who is more interested in testing
teachers than students, proposes a wider array of federal programs
than Bush does.
</P>
<P>
   But each is taking his party in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, taking a more hands-on approach than his conservative
Republican allies, this week proposed a national reading initiative
with the kind of sweep and urgency more likely to roll off the lips
of a Democrat. He would spend more than $1 billion a year for five
years to train teachers to diagnose illiteracy in young children
and to remedy such problems in individual classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he proposed nearly $600 million a year in
additional aid to education, most of it for teacher training, but
also to give teachers tax deductions for out-of-pocket expenses on
school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Photocopying and enlarging a page from the winning playbook he
wrote as governor of Texas, Bush had already announced that he
would encourage states to give standardized tests in reading and
math to all students in grades three through eight _ any state that
refused would lose five percent of its federal education money _
and would compel the districts to publish the results.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also the first leading Republican to call for increasing
the budget and responsibilities of the federal Department of
Education, which became a discrete Cabinet agency in the Carter
administration; for years, the Republican party has called for the
department's abolition.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat whose party has a long
history of supporting the Department of Education and of shaping
policy at the classroom level, would immerse his administration
even deeper into the day-to-day operations of districts and
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Taking, in effect, a seat at dozens of collective bargaining
tables around the country, he would award ``signing bonuses'' of
$10,000 each to 75,000 new teachers who agreed to work in
inner-city and rural schools, and he would increase salaries for
thousands of other veteran teachers whose districts mounted
aggressive improvement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would also lean on school districts to break their largest
high schools into smaller academies, giving financial incentives to
those that developed such blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems,'' said Michael Beschloss, a historian of
the presidency, ``that there is a general consensus between the two
sides that education is so important that even if, in general, you
feel it is a good thing for power to go away from Washington and to
states and localities, that here is a case in which ideology may
bend to necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   But each only bends so far.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush refrains from using the politically laden term
``vouchers,'' he has proposed making taxpayer spending on students
at failing public schools a ``portable'' expense. Bush would
provide students from low-ranking public schools that post no
improvement for three years with $1,500 annually to attend a
private school.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, supported heavily by teachers' unions, adamantly opposes
vouchers, which, the unions argue, would siphon money and jobs from
public education and would violate the Constitution by using the
state to subsidize the church.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would make available $25 billion in bonds to pay for new
school construction and modernization in urban and rural districts
where classrooms are falling apart from age. Bush, in keeping with
a Republican Congress that has steadfastly refused to take on such
a role, has made no such provision.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has spoken of raising federal education spending by $115
billion, about 50 percent, over 10 years. Bush has said his
investment would be significant but more modest, increasing
spending by $13 billion over five years, with money for his
``portability'' program shifted from existing education programs
for poor students.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Bush, and not Gore, who would attempt to hold schools
more accountable. Not only would Bush set financial penalties for
schools that did not demonstrate improvement on standardized tests,
but he would also insist that they separate the performance of
minority children so that diverse schools could not coast on the
high scores of some white children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in evaluating teachers, would rely more heavily on the
reviews they received from peers than on the test scores of their
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush beats Gore hands down on accountability,'' said Amy
Wilkins, a principal partner of the Education Trust, a nonpartisan
organization that closely monitors policies affecting poor
children. ``Gore beats Bush on money. If you mash them both
together, maybe you have something that will benefit kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither,'' she added, ``are sufficient answers in
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his party's resistance to federal interference at the
local level, it is Bush's position that is a more pronounced
departure from conventional thinking.
</P>
<P>
   To Beschloss, the historian, Bush's attempts to remake the
federal role hark back somewhat to Dwight Eisenhower. It was
Eisenhower who, concerned about the Soviet challenge represented by
the unmanned Sputnik spacecraft, defied the Republican Party by
concentrating far more on federal help for math and science
instruction than the party would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's involvement at the local level would have clear
limits. While arm-twisting states to give tests to students, for
example, he would leave it to the states themselves to write the
tests and define what constitutes improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Gore face stiff challenges in Congress, as each
would rely on the federal budget surplus to finance most school
initiatives, at a time when Congress has no shortage of designs on
that money.
</P>
<P>
   But each also faces the challenge of changing the perception of
the federal role: as it stands now, the $23.5 billion that the
federal government spends yearly on elementary and secondary
education represents just 8 cents of every dollar spent in schools.
That, many state and local superintendents believe, entitles the
president to a degree of influence that is directly proportional.

HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Texas, Ariz.)  (rk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army's highest-ranking woman, Lt. Gen. Claudia
Kennedy, whose career is often cited as an example of the expanding
opportunities for women in uniform, has filed a sexual harassment
complaint against another Army general, accusing him of groping her
in her office in 1996, Pentagon and government officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy complained informally to her superiors when the incident
allegedly occurred in 1996 and then filed a formal harassment
complaint late last year, when the other officer received a
prominent new assignment, according two officials familiar with the
case. In 1996, both officers held the lesser rank of major general,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's accusation threatens to become a huge new
embarrassment for the Army, which, like the other armed services,
has been roiled in recent years by sexual scandals, charges of
harassment and accusations of double standards when the accused is
a senior officer.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have in recent years sought to portray the
overwhelmingly male-dominated military as more open than ever to
women, even at the highest ranks. For a woman as senior as Kennedy
to have filed a complaint of harassment against another senior
officer seriously undercuts the impression they hoped to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a zero tolerance for harassment,'' the Pentagon's
spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Thursday during a news conference in
which he refused to identify the accused general and repeatedly
sidestepped questions about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy filed her complaint, the Army's inspector
general's office began an investigation and has since interviewed
several people who were involved or were familiar with the
circumstances, officials said. Because of the ranks of those
involved, the Department of Defense's inspector general is
overseeing the Army's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are continuing their work and have not yet reached
a conclusion on the merits of the accusation, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Army and Pentagon officials cited the privacy rights of the
accused general in declining to identify him. The Army declined to
discuss the case publicly at all, refusing to either confirm or
General Kennedy's complaint, which was first reported Thursday in
The Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't comment on the existence of investigations,'' said
Col. Edwin Veiga, an Army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is one of only three women in the military who now serve
as three-star officers. The others are Vice Adm. Patricia Tracey of
the Navy, who serves as deputy assistant secretary of defense for
personnel, and Lt. Gen. Leslie Kenne, commander of the Air Force's
Electronic System Center at Hanscom Air Force Base in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 52, has served as the Army's deputy chief of staff for
intelligence since her promotion to lieutenant general in May 1997.
She was the first woman to reach that rank in the Army. She
recently announced that she intends to retire later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kennedy served at the Pentagon as the Army's assistant
deputy chief of staff for intelligence. After the incident now in
question, she chose to handle the matter internally, reporting it
to her superiors in the Army staff, according to one official
familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Kennedy was satisfied with the results at the time.
It was only when the officer's name came up for a prominent
assignment last year, the official said, that she filed a complaint
with the Army's inspector general's office, which is supposed to
operate independently of the Army's chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by The New York Times for comment, Kennedy declined to
discuss her accusation.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews after her promotion to lieutenant general,
however, she said that she had experienced sexual harassment in her
career. In an interview with ABC in June 1997, she said she had
dealt with an incident earlier in her career ``individually'' and
then alluded to what appeared to be this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important thing about it was that early in my
career, what I did was I dealt with it individually,'' she said.
``And later in my career, in fact in the last _ just in the last _
within the last 10 years, my approach was to turn it over to my
boss. And I was very impressed with the way it was handled. In
other words, it was investigated carefully, and there was a very
positive response on the part of the Army. ``Anytime someone is
sexually harassed, it is a very serious matter,'' she continued.
``When we think about sexual harassment, sometimes we're distracted
by the word `sexual,' and we think that this is a matter of very
aggressive courting or dating or flirting. It has nothing to do
with the interactions between men and women that are of mutual
interest. This has everything to do with nonmutual activity.''

</P>
<P>
   Kennedy joined the Army in 1969 after receiving a bachelor's
degree in philosophy from what is now known as Rhodes College in
Tennessee. At the time of her induction, the Army had a separate
Women's Corps and opportunities for women were relatively limited.
</P>
<P>
   She rose through the ranks as a military intelligence officer,
one of the few elite career paths then open to women. She
eventually became commander of two military intelligence
battalions, in Germany and Hawaii, as well as commander of the San
Antonio Recruiting Battalion at Fort Sam Houston in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After being promoted to brigadier general in 1993, she held
staff positions in the intelligence field, serving for a time as
assistant commandant of the Army's Intelligence School at Fort
Huachuca, Az.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has been buffeted by controversies over sexual
behavior, including highly publicized rape and assault cases at the
Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland beginning in 1996 and
the sexual assault trial in 1997 of its senior enlisted man, Sgt.
Maj. Gene McKinney, who was acquitted at a court martial of all
charges except one of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the Army has twice demoted generals for having
adulterous affairs. Maj. Gen. John Maher 3rd was stripped of two
ranks and forced to retire last November after having affairs with
two subordinate officers' wives and ``an improper personnel
relationship'' with an enlisted soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. David R.E. Hale, was demoted one rank and fined after
pleading guilty to eight counts of misconduct stemming from affairs
he had with the wives of four subordinate officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Army had allowed Hale to retire quietly even though a
complaint about his behavior had been filed with the inspector
general's office. Once the accusations became public, the Army
called him out of retirement to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for expanding the role of women in the military said
Kennedy's complaint suggested the military still had far to go to
root out harassment and bias.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy ``broke the glass ceiling but still was not immune from
sexual harassment,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. ``It took
courage to come forward and file a complaint knowing her own
reputation would be the first on the line.''

ANNIVERSARY PROMPTS A LOOK AT THE LEGACY OF SELENA
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ The little girl stood under the arches
of the memorial overlooking Corpus Christi Bay, letting the strong
breeze hit her face and play with her hair.
</P>
<P>
   She turned and clambered atop the statue of Tejano singer
Selena, hugged it for a brief moment, and then outlined the face
with her fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Amris Chacon, 6, is an avid Selena fan. She listens to her CDs
and frequently watches the movie about the singer's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the part where she dies, so that's where I turn
it off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Selena Quintanilla Perez was fatally shot in a Corpus Christi
motel March 31, 1995, when Amris was 1 year old. Yolanda Saldivar,
the former manager of Selena's clothing boutiques and president of
her fan club, is serving a life sentence in a Texas prison.
</P>
<P>
   Amris is among the loyal fans who keep Selena's memory alive.
</P>
<P>
   Selena was a perennial winner at the Tejano Music Awards from
1986 to 1995. Her album ``Selena Live'' won a 1994 Grammy as
orchestra album of the year. One month before her death, she
performed before a record crowd of more than 61,000 people at the
Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   But many Americans learned of her only after her death at age
23, and the tremendous outpouring of mourning it spawned.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 people viewed the casket at the Bayfront Plaza
Convention Center in Corpus Christi. ``People'' magazine published
its first-ever regional cover, with Selena on the front in the
Southwest edition. The edition sold out in one day. A subsequent
Selena tribute issue sold 1 million copies nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rincon, research psychologist with the market research
firm Rincon &AMP; Associates in Dallas, said that Selena's popularity
greatly affected the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She demonstrated to the world that there are dollars
associated with Latinos, a population that many were used to
relating to negative things like poverty and voter apathy,'' Rincon
said. ``She made the connection between Latin entertainers and
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Selena's father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, agreed that
much of America was unaware of his daughter before her death, and
inattentive to the Hispanic market in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think corporate America had yet caught on to such a
large, untapped market,'' Quintanilla said. ``After Selena's tragic
death and the commotion in the media, they were freaking out. I
think that was the beginning of the `Latino explosion.' After all
this happened, everyone started paying attention to Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintanilla should know. He owns Q-Productions, a recording and
production studio that also represents eight bands, including the
Kumbia Kings, a band that mixes Latin rhythms with hip-hop, funk
and rhythm and blues. His son A.B. is a member of the band, created
after the death of Selena and the disintegration of her band Los
Dinos, in which he played bass and wrote many of the songs.
</P>
<P>
   The Kumbia Kings' album, ``Amor, Familia y Respeto,'' is eighth
on Billboard's Latin 50.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perez, Selena's widower, is also part of a new bilingual
rock band, the Chris Perez Band, which won a Grammy this year for
best Latin/alternative performance for its debut album,
``Resurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   But Perez, who has worked hard to re-establish himself as a
musician, believes that his success _ and that of other Latin
artists such as Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez _ has
more to do with talent than with an increased interest in Latin
music.
</P>
<P>
   For Selena's fans, talent is what made her a star.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Cotto, a longtime fan from Waco who was in Corpus Christi
to visit Selena's memorial, museum, gravesite and boutique, said
she admired the singer's versatility and musical prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a way with people,'' Cotto said. ``She had that
charisma about the audience, and she brought in the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think of where she could have been today. I think
she would have gone really far.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Miranda, public relations manager for ``People en
Espanol,'' said the reaction to Selena's solidified the decision to
launch the Spanish-language magazine. It had been in the research
phase at the time of Selena's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proved what some people in the company had been feeling all
along, that there was a dynamic market that did not have a national
magazine to call its own,'' she said. ``It told a great story that
Latinos were ready, that when you printed information that was
relevant, they would go out and buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rincon has noted that in the years since Selena's death, more
companies have become interested in the Hispanic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past five years we are seeing more internet companies
targeting Hispanics, more telecommunications companies,'' he said.
Companies such as SBC Communications, GE Directories and US West
have hired his firm to study the Hispanic market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery stores such as Fiesta and Carnival have been pioneers in
targeting Hispanics, Rincon said. In the Fort Worth/Dallas area,
Hispanics spent an estimated $1 billion on groceries last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, stores such as Albertson's are trying to access
the booming market, setting up stores in mostly ethnic
neighborhoods and advertising in Spanish-language media.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon also mentioned that, in the past five years, audience
shares for Spanish-language media have increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Navarrete , president of the Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber
of Commerce, said the huge media blitz focusing on Selena's death
prompted many companies to review information about the Hispanic
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely motivated people and made them aware of how
profitable the market can be,'' he said, adding that he recently
met with an architect interested in building affordable housing in
Fort Worth for Hispanic families, which he said tend to be younger
in age and larger than most Anglo families.
</P>
<P>
   For Rincon, Selena was representative of this growing market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hispanics are excited about something, they buy in record
numbers,'' he said. ``When we're passionate about something, we can
really make a lot of noise.''

 &HT;    Coke bus 'ride for justice' gains support
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A day after the Rev. Jesse Jackson said he would
support a bus ``ride for justice'' against Coca-Cola if a racial
bias suit is not settled soon, leaders of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference said they, too, would support such a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III, president of the SCLC, and the Rev.
Joseph Lowery, one of the group's founders, urged Coca-Cola to
settle the matter before the planned April 15-20 bus ride by former
and current Coca-Cola employees to the company's annual
shareholders meeting in Wilimington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strategy that the employees have come up with and
that we feel compelled to support,'' King said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody wants a showdown,'' he said, but added
that he will support even stronger measures, such as a boycott if
needed, to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said he has held ``casual conversations'' with Executive
Vice President Carl Ware, Coca-Cola's highest-ranking
African-American, about the suit, which accuses the company of
discrimination in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery criticized Coca-Cola for not paying attention to its own
findings several years ago, in a so-called Ware Report, that raised
concerns about racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have saved them a lot of heartache and millions of
dollars,'' Lowery said. ``A good board member recognizes that
treating employees fairly and justly is in the best interests of
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said he is ``willing and able'' to join the employees'
planned bus campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything,'' King said. ``The time is now for
Coca-Cola to respond.''

HATRED OF CASTRO COLORS DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The picture on their signs is of a little boy, but the
image seared on their souls is that of someone much older, a man
whose graying beard and military fatigues might as well be a pair
of horns and a tail.
</P>
<P>
   To most of the men, women, and children in the Cuban-American
community in South Florida, Fidel Castro is nothing less than the
devil. And there's no way to fully understand the extraordinary
events that have been unfolding here for more than four months
without grasping this fact.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, it helps explain why members of the Cuban
exile community insist _ contrary to many psychological studies,
common practice in other custody cases, and most other people's
instincts _ that it serves a 6-year-old boy's ``best interests'' to
remain severed from a father who, by all accounts, was loving and
devoted.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't with how Juan Miguel Gonzalez may treat his
son, but where he continues to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what the judges say, what the government
says, what anyone says. If we send Elian back to his father, we
will be sending an innocent child to a place ruled by the worst of
the worst there can be,'' explained Jose Barja, a 50-year-old
retailer who left Cuba in 1980 the same way Elian did, on a raft.
``We will be sending him to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to overstate the extent to which that belief shapes
the thinking and behavior of Barja and the other Cuban exiles who
stand vigil every day outside the simple, one-story stucco house in
which Elian has lived with his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and
other relatives since fishermen found the boy off the Florida coast
last November.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly are many Cuban-Americans who have either put
their pasts behind them or don't hold such hard-line opinions of
their homeland and its communist ruler. But many, if not most, of
the exiles endured genuine hardships when they lived in Cuba,
despise the totalitarianism of the Castro regime, and sometimes
risked their lives to escape it and create new lives in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   A new life is what they want for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   To them, whatever psychic or developmental problems the boy may
sustain from the international tug of war over his fate pale
compared with the benefits he would derive from an upbringing in
the United States. These exiles' view of Castro is so viscerally,
intensely negative that many fear for the boy's safety if he
returns home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will hurt him, kill him, something like that,'' said
Doris Gonzalez, a cosmetologist who is not related to Elian. All
around the woman, who was interviewed outside Lazaro Gonzalez's
home, other Cuban-Americans of all ages shook their heads and
cheered in agreement. ``Sending anyone on purpose to the devil is
evil, and we are not evil,'' a teenage boy shouted.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this context that the boy's personal well-being has
been subsumed. In between their obviously heartfelt expressions of
care for Elian, the Cuban-Americans here frequently reveal their
broader agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Many do that by hesitating, or even refusing to answer, when
asked how they would feel if they still lived in Cuba and couldn't
retain custody of their own children. And their political leaders
have often been explicit about their resolve to achieve a victory,
this time, over their most reviled enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy cannot become a trophy for Fidel,'' Jorge Mas Santos,
who heads the Cuban American National Foundation, said when he
first learned that the US government intended to return Elian to
his father. But in their zeal to deprive Castro of his prize _ and
the Cuban leader has clearly indicated that he views Elian as one _
the exile community in Florida appears to risk turning the boy into
a prize for them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, and probably more significant in the long term, the
intensity about Castro that has colored almost every aspect of the
Elian drama has also revealed a chasm between the section of South
Florida where Cuban-Americans, their families, and their supporters
dominate the culture and the politics, and the rest of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Polls everywhere else show a lopsided majority of Americans
believe that Cuba is an awful place to live, but that Elian
Gonzalez's father should get his son back. And politicians around
the nation strongly disagree with President Clinton on a host of
issues, but don't question his authority to carry out the duties of
his office.
</P>
<P>
   So it was stunning that the mayors of two dozen municipalities
in and around Miami this week not only declared that they will
refuse to send in their police forces if federal authorities
request help to gain custody of Elian, but essentially warned that
the administration would be responsible for inciting violence if it
tried to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it's playing in Peoria . . . but I would
suspect Miami doesn't look like it belongs to the legal system and
the cultural system of the rest of the country throughout this
whole saga,'' said Bernard Perlmutter, director of the Children and
Youth Law Clinic at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not casting aspersions on any immigrants,'' he added,
``but the way it's played out makes it seem like we're an island
cut off from the rest of the United States and its deeply ingrained
legal traditions, simply because of how passionately a group of
people here feel about Fidel Castro.''

COMMENTARY: STARCHY IN RHODE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to reinsert `Mr.' in `Mr. Potato Head' in grafs 1, 2, 4, 5
and last graf.) 
(jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great thing about politics in the United States of America,
people, is that there's always something. If you find the
presidential campaign dreary, you look around and there's the state
of Rhode Island, embarking on a plan to decorate its landscape with
dozens of 6-foot-tall statues of Mr. Potato Head.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know, you're already asking yourself why your state
didn't think of this first.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island Tourism Division is rolling out a new marketing
program that stars Mr. Potato Head as the symbol of ``Rhode Island
_ the Birthplace of Fun.'' Thanks to corporate sponsors, there are
already 43 giant depictions of or Mr. Potato Head scattered around
the state, most of which actually look more like 6-foot eggs with
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhode Island will peel ahead of the crop when it comes to
attracting visitors from around the world,'' said Gov. Lincoln
Almond, as he swore in Mr. Potato Head as the state's official
travel ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   About the motto. The Tourism Division says Rhode Island is the
official Birthplace of Fun because it's the birthplace of Mr.
Potato Head, a fun guy conceived and manufactured in Pawtucket.
Until this very moment, most people probably thought of the state
as the birthplace of the TV series ``Providence'' and the Claus von
Bulow trial, but there you are. According to the governor's office,
Rhode Island is also the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution,
an important but not really feel-good concept.
</P>
<P>
   All sorts of meaningless yet strangely intriguing stuff is going
on at the state level these days. New York, I am proud to report,
is about to celebrate its failure to pass a budget on time for the
16th straight year. The Empire State, in fact, regards itself as
the Birthplace of the Perpetually Overdue Spending Package. We just
haven't quite figured out how to turn it into a tourism campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee state legislature recently passed a bill making
the Tennessee walking horse its official horse. The measure is now
on the governor's desk, giving him something to think about when he
isn't engaged in overhauling the entire state tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is one of a number of states that's very much into
symbol clutter. It has six different official state songs, only one
of which is ``The Tennessee Waltz.'' (Try asking Al Gore to hum a
few bars of ``When It's Iris Time in Tennessee.'') The legislature
ought to take the bit in its teeth and give that walking horse full
State Animal bragging rights. The current occupant, the raccoon,
could be downgraded to Official State Varmint.
</P>
<P>
   What this country needs is a mandatory sunset law for state
Things. We could wipe the slate clean every five or 10 years and
start over. Refilling the symbol supply might give citizens a new
interest in state government; the state of Washington experienced
an unprecedented degree of attention a few years back when a disc
jockey started a movement to make ``Louie, Louie'' the official
state rock 'n' roll song.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, a lot of the current honorees don't seem to have
been given much thought. We have way too many cardinals and robins
out there in State Bird Land, and a lot of the mottos need work. I
am thinking of you, Maryland (``Manly deeds, womanly words''), and
Michigan, whose motto sounds as if it had been written by a real
estate developer. (``If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look around
you.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right, each generation should have the opportunity,''
agreed Sen Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. He is something of an
expert on this issue, having served in the state Senate back when
Connecticut was trying to come up with an official song, so bands
would stop playing ``Boola Boola'' whenever the governor entered
the room. After a lengthy songwriting competition that demonstrated
how difficult it was to fit repeated references to Connecticut into
a tune, the legislature wound up adopting ``Yankee Doodle.''

   A few years back, Rhode Island's legislature went through an
intense fight between coffee milk and lemon ice for the title of
official state drink. The winner was the coffee milk, a beverage
made with a coffee extract that, like six-foot-statues of Mr.
Potato Head, can be found only in Rhode Island.

POTENTIALLY LETHAL ASBESTOS FOUND IN SOME LAWN AND GARDEN
PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER and CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Federal investigators have found potentially lethal
asbestos in several lawn and garden products that contain
vermiculite, a mineral used in hundreds of such products
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stressed that its
findings are preliminary and that weeks of additional testing need
to be performed to determine how widespread and serious the problem
is.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial results raised alarms with public-health
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is cause for concern,'' said Dr. Christine
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, assistant clinical professor of medicine at Harvard
Medical School, who has about 600 patients with asbestos-caused
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no safe level of asbestos exposure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA findings could explain some of the so-called
``spontaneous'' tumors that arise in people who have no known
exposure to asbestos, Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contention is they are not arising spontaneously and these
data support that,'' she said. ``Who would have known asbestos was
in these products?''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA declined to name the brands tested, or to release the
levels of asbestos found. ``I can only say that some of the samples
showed asbestos at varying levels,'' says Phil Wong, who heads the
investigation and engineering unit in Seattle that did the tests.
Wong said the results are ``being turned over to the risk
assessment analysts, so we don't really know what the dangers
are.''
</P>
<P>
   No asbestos warnings
</P>
<P>
   None of the products tested carried labels warning consumers
that it contained asbestos, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   After the first results came in, the investigators repeated the
tests and confirmed the findings. The types of asbestos found were
fibrous actinolite and tremolite, both classified as carcinogens by
several government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've completed multiple tests of multiple products ... by two
different methods of microscopic examination, and asbestos was
found in several of the products,'' says Keven McDemott, who is
heading the team of EPA investigators examining the products.
</P>
<P>
   In its followup testing, the EPA will work with other agencies
to evaluate the level of health hazards from the commonly sold soil
additives.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the three vermiculite mines currently operating in the
United States will receive additional scrutiny from the EPA and the
Mine Safety and Health Administration, officials said. MSHA
recently initiated a new round of testing at the mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role is to protect human health. If there's something out
there that may be a risk to the public _ and asbestos is a major
concern right now _ our job is to address it,'' says Chuck Findley,
EPA deputy regional administrator in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committing whatever resources we have to get it right
the first time, and that's why we're doing this additional testing.
Obviously we'll continue to do what it takes at the regional and
national levels to address the public's concern about asbestos in
consumer products.''
</P>
<P>
   If asbestos is present in consumer products, even as a
contaminant, the bags should be labeled so people are aware of the
hazards, said Dr. Mike Harbut, chair of the
Occupational/Environmental Section of the American College of Chest
Physicians, and a clinical assistant professor of medicine at Wayne
State University in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fundamental,'' he said. ``It's an issue of ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern from mine stories
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the safety of vermiculite was sparked by
Post-Intelligencer stories in November about a now-closed W.R.
Grace &AMP; Co. mine in Libby, Mont., where more than 300 miners and
their family members contracted fatal diseases including
asbestosis, cancer and mesothelioma because of their exposure to
tremolite asbestos fibers in the vermiculite ore.
</P>
<P>
   EPA's results confirm similar tests of several brands of potting
soil, soil enhancers and vermiculite conducted by the
Post-Intelligencer from December through March as part of the
newspaper's ongoing investigation of asbestos dangers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got numerous calls from citizens who had read about the
deaths in Libby and asked if there was asbestos in garden products,
will they be exposed to it and will they become sick from it,''
McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We answered two of the three questions. Yes, there is asbestos
in some of the products. And, yes, in using the product the way
many people do, asbestos can be released. The last question, will
they be harmed if exposed to the asbestos, will have to be answered
by the health experts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those health authorities will be faced with assessing the
hazards of such activities as handling the products, picking or
eating plants grown with the products, and tilling previously
treated soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, if you used it even one time you could be at
risk. But the more times people are exposed, and the longer they
are around the product, the greater their risk of developing an
asbestos-related disease, including lung cancer,'' said Harvard's
Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Drew Brodkin, associate professor of internal medicine and
environmental health at the University of Washington, said there
shouldn't be asbestos in those products, but more study is needed
before public health officials can make any recommendations about
what consumers should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that everyone should run out and get a chest
x-ray,'' said Brodkin. ``It does take substantial exposure over
time (to cause disease.) That's not to say people are not at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For weekend gardeners, the risk may not be that significant,''
he said. ``However, the risk would be greater for people who did
extensive work with these products, such as nursery workers.''
</P>
<P>
   At New York's Mount Sinai Selikoff Center for Occupational and
Environmental Medicine, which did most of the major early studies
on the health hazards of asbestos, medical director Dr. Stephen
Levin says the dry, dusty composition of the vermiculite increases
the chance of inhalation of asbestos fibers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more of that stuff you inhale, over the course of a spring
and a summer, the greater your risk. The higher the fiber counts,
the worse the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A favorite with gardeners
</P>
<P>
   Horticultural industry analysts estimate that at least 65 local,
regional and national companies produce more then 375 different
lawn and garden products containing vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners have been using vermiculite for decades. The puffy
material is popular because of its ability to hold water and
fertilizer, pesticides and as an aid in aeration and drainage. No
fertilizers or pesticides have been tested yet, but are expected to
be included in subsequent tests.
</P>
<P>
   Vermiculite, which is mica-like in appearance, is a natural
material which has the unique characteristic of expanding 15 times
in size when exposed to heat.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that any of the manufacturers added
asbestos to their products. The lethal fibers are a contaminant of
the vermiculite used in the products.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest vermiculite mine is located in the
northeastern corner of South Africa. It produces ore that is highly
concentrated, and therefore more expensive. Some U.S. companies buy
it, but many say they purchase ore from the Grace mine in Enoree,
S.C., or from Virginia Vermiculite's mines in Louisa, Va., and near
Enoree, owned by Robert Sansom.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies insist that their ore is free of asbestos. Both
cite analysis that they paid for in laboratories in Canada, Denmark
and Scotland, which, they say, show no asbestos in their
vermiculite. Both companies point to tests by EPA and MSHA as
evidence to support their views.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 16 letter to the Post-Intelligencer, Sansom, a former
associate EPA administrator, pointed to ``MSHA test results from
1984 to 1998.'' Grace sent the Post-Intelligencer the results of
MSHA sampling done on workers at its South Carolina mine on March
7.
</P>
<P>
   No asbestos was detected in the air-collection cartridges used
to sample the air where the miners work.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean there is no asbestos in the ore? MSHA says no.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone is saying that our air sampling is giving them a
clean bill of health, of saying there is no asbestos in their ore,
it's totally inaccurate. It's ludicrous to think that clean results
on air sampling means that there is not asbestos or some other
contaminant in the ore,'' says Earnest Teaster, MSHA Administrator
for metal and non-metal mine safety and health.
</P>
<P>
   MSHA inspectors did gather samples of ore from stockpiles on the
Grace mine property, which showed no asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is not to issue a seal of approval for the quality or
lack of contamination of the ore they're selling,'' says Davitt
McAteer, MSHA's boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this testing means is that at that time and at that
location, no asbestos was detected. No one, not for a moment,
should interpret that to mean that this agency is certifying their
mine as asbestos-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the EPA regions responsible for Virginia and South
Carolina said there was no indication the agency had inspected any
of the vermiculite mines in recent years. EPA studies on
vermiculite mines were done in 1981, 1982 and 1991. The studies
showed the presence of asbestos at Grace's Enoree mine, but at
levels far lower than those at Libby.
</P>
<P>
   `We have an obligation'
</P>
<P>
   McAteer said his agency is eager to work with EPA to determine
whether there is asbestos contamination at the three mines, and
apparently, EPA is willing to check the mines out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asbestos is a toxic substance and if it's in commercial
products, we have an obligation to look as far back as it takes, to
get to the bottom of where it's coming from,'' said John Melone,
EPA director of National Programs, Chemical Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that product leaves the mine, someone is putting it into
commerce,'' Melone said. ``Whoever that someone is, whether they
own the mine or not, that person is responsible for knowing what is
in the product. And we have a right to ask for that information.''
</P>
<P>
   The vermiculite testing is part of a coast-to-coast EPA
examination of common household items. Additional testing of
non-horticultural products for asbestos is being conducted in
Dallas, Boston and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA ``has on-going concerns about asbestos in consumer
products'' and ``is undertaking a nationwide effort to sample and
evaluate a wide range of products to determine if they contain
levels of asbestos that pose significant risks to public health,''
says Jim Aidala, an acting assistant EPA administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the findings of the studies presently under way, EPA
stands ready to address the risks that may be identified,'' Aidala
added. ``Actions could range from the dissemination of consumer
information regarding these products to potential regulatory
controls.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA has a long, turbulent history of trying to regulate asbestos
and in the past has had a ban against asbestos overturned on a
technicality and other efforts stifled by the White House or
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   There is much hand-wringing in headquarters over the asbestos
testing being done in the field. Some agency officials fear that if
the Seattle results hold up, EPA will have to assume the costly
role of protecting the public from asbestos, a responsibility
abandoned years ago by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   When CPSC was asked in January whether it had checked garden
products containing vermiculite for asbestos, spokesman Ken Giles
said, ``We couldn't find anything in the files, but one scientist
remembered someone looking at garden products about 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they found anything,'' Giles said.

READY OR NOT, BUCKY GOES TO THE FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Bucky doesn't ordinarily do Final Fours.
</P>
<P>
   Bucky does Frozen Fours. Although, as all good Eagles know,
Boston College has shattered this year's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Bucky does Rose Bowls, too. What would New Year's Day be without
some nice camera shots of all those Cheeseheads?
</P>
<P>
   Bucky's grandfather won an NCAA basketball championship in 1941,
but our Bucky does not know from Final Fours. Not at a school that
has only had four 20-win seasons in its history, not at a school
whose team exited last year's NCAA tournament having scored a
gruesome 32 points, not at a school whose team was 11-10 at one
point this season, and not at a school where the coach's methods
have been met with near-universal skepticism from the day he was
hired.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, ``Bucky.'' This is the symbolic nickname of the
Wisconsin Badgers. You know, ``Bucky Badger.'' The school's
athletic teams are generally referred to this way, as in ``Bucky's
got to start doing better on third down,'' or ``Bucky let in some
soft goals against BC,'' or ``Did you see the way Bucky shut down
LSU?''
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, Bucky is going to the Final Four, and people
hereabouts don't need written instructions to learn the best way to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like a football game in here last Saturday
night,'' said Eric Suemmicht, who tends bar at the Nitty Gritty, an
eating and drinking establishment one block from Kohl Center, the
school's 17,000-seat showplace athletic arena. ``People were
calling from Milwaukee. They just wanted to be here, so they could
celebrate on State Street. That's the way it works here. Six days a
year, Madison is their town. They come in early. They start
drinking at 11 a.m., and they're still going strong at 6. That's
the way it was last Saturday. The (Purdue) game was late afternoon
here and we were full at 2 or 2:30. The game ended, and everybody
piled out to go celebrate on State Street. Then a half-hour later
everybody came back here and continued to celebrate. We don't
ordinarily have that going on for basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never been a big basketball state, and Wisconsin has
never been a big basketball school,'' said Marsh Shapiro, a Madison
native and longtime local sportscaster who owns the Nitty Gritty.
``It's always been difficult to find not just good players, but to
find some who could cut it academically.''
</P>
<P>
   But this group is demonstrating that Bucky can play basketball,
too, and when Bucky growls, the entire state of Wisconsin snaps to
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is having a terrific impact,'' said Clark Chesley, who
runs Badger Sporting Goods, a leading supplier of equipment for
Wisconsin high schools and colleges. ``I travel all over the state.
I just came back from Tomahawk, a small town about three hours
north of here. The first thing I would hear was `How about those
Badgers?' And not just the basketball team. It was also, `What
happened to the hockey team?' People care very deeply about
Wisconsin sports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everything,'' said Shapiro. ``This is the state capitol,
but there isn't a lot of industry. There's Oscar Mayer, Rayovac,
and some insurance companies. There are several major research
parks. But this is very much a university town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought about it,'' said junior guard Mike Kelley,
the acclaimed defensive pest. ``Wisconsin matters here. What we're
doing is real important. But it's been 59 years since we've won
anything. So you wonder, `Could we become a basketball state?' It's
a great thrill to see the smiles on everyone's faces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given people reason to be proud of the basketball
team,'' said junior forward Mark Vershaw. ``Now people can go out
and buy basketball shirts, instead of football jerseys. Kids can go
out in their back yards and pretend to be Mike Kelley or Andy
Kowske. People can get on the phone and tell their brother in LA
all about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley reveals that even if no one else believed a Wisconsin
basketball team could get this far, Dick Bennett and his coaching
staff certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we juniors were being recruited, they took us into the
locker room,'' said Kelley. ``They had jerseys with our names over
each locker. They played a mock play-by-play from a Final Four
scenario in which we were all involved. Kelley to Kowske to Linton
to Vershaw. He shoots. It's good! Wisconsin wins the national
championship!
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other and said, `Man!' Our heads were
spinning. Then we started playing as freshmen, and we realized just
how hard a thing like getting to the Final Four really was. But the
hope never really died, and here we are _ in the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kelley and his friends know all too well, nobody in
Madison was fantasizing about the Final Four when the team was
11-10, following a loss to Ohio State Feb. 2. The National
Invitation Tournament was starting to sound pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers seemed to be confirming the belief that Bennett was
the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just hated the team's playing style,'' said Paul Zach,
co-owner of the popular Avenue Bar, a definite Bucky kind of place.
``People were coming in here and saying you could never win with
that style and he could never get the athletes to compete in the
Big Ten. They said the system was outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the doubters was Bob Mueller, whose opinion counts for a
lot. Mueller was a freshman when Wisconsin won the NCAA
championship in 1941. He wasn't eligible to play, but he practiced
against Fred Rehm, John Kotz, Gene Englund, and all the rest, and
he has remained a loyal Badger follower, holding season tickets the
past 49 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I think we'd ever win with Dick Bennett?'' he said. ``You
want an honest opinion?''
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, Bob, what do you think?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is no. I was skeptical. I thought they played
defense so hard they couldn't relax and play offense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from the doubters and the rumblings as to whether
Dick Bennett has a future here to total ecstasy,'' said Shapiro,
who swears that he personally never lost faith. ``It's a total love
affair.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, people really wanted to like Bennett, who counts as
one of them even if he had the misfortune of being born in
Pittsburgh. He went to school here (Ripon), coached high school
basketball in Green Bay, coached nine years at the University of
Wisconsin-Stevens Point and 10 years at the University of
Wisconsin-Green Bay before getting the job of his dreams in 1995.
In ways that matter a great deal in this state, he is perfect for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Wisconsin-Platteville, a member of Bennett's
old Division 3 state college conference, lies about an hour and 15
minutes southwest of Madison. On a recent blustery day,
Wisconsin-Platteville's baseball team was practicing in the wind
and rain on Kendall Murray Field, but the players were more than
eager to talk about the Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone on the campus is excited,'' said Aaron Mack, a junior
from Madison who played high school basketball with Badgers guard
Roy Boone. ``We all feel a connection to Coach Bennett. After all,
he used to coach in this league. We feel his kids aren't really any
different than us. You really want to pull for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Badger followers, the Platteville kids have become
disciples of the Dick Bennett defensive philosophy. ``Defense is
getting them through,'' said catcher Tony Mitchell, a senior from
Walworth, Wis. ``I think high school coaches all over the state are
looking at this and realizing that defense is the way you win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Roy (Boone),'' said Mack. ``He was always a tough
offensive player, but he wasn't going to play for Coach Bennett
until he started playing the defense. Now he's really helping
out.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Wisconsin weren't excessively demanding. Football has
always come first. Hockey has dominated the winter for years. They
just wanted the basketball team to stop being an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be competitive,'' said Paul Zach of the Avenue
Bar, ``finish in the top half of the Big Ten. Just give us a nice
competitive team. Nobody was looking to go to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's where they are, and people in Wisconsin are trying to
put it in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny,'' said Suemmicht, the Nitty Gritty
bartender. ``All year long the hockey team was on Page 1 and the
basketball team was on Page 3. Now you've got to feel sorry for the
hockey players. I would say the football team going to the Rose
Bowl in '93 was the biggest thing around here, but this is very
close. Even with Ron Dayne winning the Heisman and the team going
back to the Rose Bowl, there was a feeling of `We've done that.'
And you could see the Rose Bowl building up. No one saw this
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This overshadows the second Rose Bowl,'' said Zach.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl and Final Four make for a pretty good parlay.
Let's hope Bucky isn't neglecting his studies.

 &HT;    Field where Al-Amin's car found may be key
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Authorities in White Hall _ the tiny Alabama town
where Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin was arrested last week _ said the
vacant field where the suspected cop killer's black Mercedes-Benz
was discovered belongs to the mother of White Hall Mayor John
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The car, considered a key piece of evidence in the shooting
death of Fulton County Deputy Ricky Kinchen and the injuring of his
partner, Aldranon English, was found in the field Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The land, off of County Road 17 in White Hall, is ``in close
proximity to Jackson's house,'' said Lowndes County Sheriff Willie
Vaughner. Jackson and Al-Amin, a former Black Panther known as H.
Rap Brown, have been acquainted for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, meanwhile, became enraged Thursday evening when he was
contacted. ``What do you mean am I being questioned by the FBI and
am I a suspect?'' Jackson yelled over the telephone. ``I'm the
mayor of this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson would not confirm the land belongs to his mother, saying
``I have given my statements to the Fulton County District
Attorney's Office. Ask them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the discovery of a Georgia license plate behind a
small cafe in White Hall earlier this week may lead federal agents
back to friends of Al-Amin's who live in the Islamic community in
the town, Vaughner said. The license plate was originally attached
to the Mercedes. The car, according to Atlanta police, is
registered to Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe _ called the Bismillah Cafe _ and the field where the
car was uncovered, are about a mile apart, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   The friends _ two men and two women _ were detained March 20
just before Al-Amin was arrested in a wooded area in the town. FBI
Special Agent Bill Imfeld said the friends were stopped and held
overnight after a tipster told federal authorities they were seen
in a black Cadillac Seville near the spot where Al-Amin reportedly
had shot at U.S. marshal.
</P>
<P>
   The friends have denied seeing Al-Amin after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The four were held overnight at the Montgomery County Jail, but
were released the next day after police decided there was no
evidence showing they had harbored Al-Amin in White Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``These friends of his are somehow associated with the cafe, and
I'm sure they'll be questioned a second time, seeing that the
license tag was found behind the restaurant,'' Vaughner said
Thursday. ``Then the Mercedes was found close by.''
</P>
<P>
   Extradition proceedings for Al-Amin could began as early as
today before Judge Lynn Bright in Montgomery District Court, where
indictment charges would be explained to him. Then his case would
move to Circuit Judge Charles Price's courtroom, where the actual
extradition hearing would occur. No date has been scheduled with
Price.
</P>
<P>
   As Al-Amin awaits extradition, the painstaking forensic
examination of his 1978 Mercedes may take several days. The results
could provide further evidence linking Al-Amin to the killing of a
Fulton County deputy, and perhaps provide evidence of a motive for
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said there are bullet holes in the car. The first
priority will be to recover as many of the bullets that made them
as possible. The bullets will be compared to test samples fired
from the guns of Kinchen and English. If they match, then the
Mercedes was at the murder scene and one more major piece of
evidence is added to the state's case against Al-Amin.

GIULIANI FAR AHEAD OF CLINTON IN FUND   RAISING FOR SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani raised nearly twice as much
money as Hillary Rodham Clinton during the first three months of
this year and has now collected a total of $19 million for his
Senate campaign, according to figures provided by both candidates
Thursday. The latest numbers leave little doubt that Giuliani will
significantly outraise and outspend the first lady in the race in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got a lot of people out there who don't like her,'' said
Bruce J. Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager, grinning as he
released the Republican mayor's side of what turned out by day's
end to be a fairly lopsided fund-raising picture.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said that more than half of Giuliani's total
contributions came from out of state, though he contended that the
strong showing _ news of which clearly unsettled some of Clinton's
supporters _ was as much a tribute to Giuliani as a testament to
Clinton's unpopularity.
</P>
<P>
   He said Giuliani had raised $7 million in the reporting period
required under federal law, from Jan. 1 to March 31, for a total of
$19 million for his campaign. Clinton's campaign aides said she had
raised about $4 million in the period, bringing her total to about
$12 million. The figures do not count millions in additional
so-called soft money contributions, which are largely unregulated,
that the two candidates have been energetically soliciting.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Giuliani was startling, not only because of its
size _ the mayor has already raised more money than Charles Schumer
collected for his entire Senate contest in 1998 _ but also because
the figures appeared to undercut what had once been a widespread
assumption of the contest: that Clinton would raise more money than
Giuliani. Earlier this year, Clinton's advisers had said they were
confident that she would raise $25 million for her campaign; she
has yet to reach the halfway point toward that.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, said
he was now certain that Giuliani would raise ``at least several
million more dollars'' than Clinton. ``We think they will have a
significant amount more than we have,'' de Blasio said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum called a formal news conference to announce the
figures, which he presented in a series of brightly colored charts,
filled with graphic illustrations that demonstrated the scope of
Giuliani's accomplishment for the sake of the television cameras at
the back of the room. By contrast, Clinton disclosed her figure in
a short statement e-mailed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani now seems certain to break the fund-raising record of
$21 million set in Virginia by a nonincumbent candidate for Senate,
Oliver North, in 1994. He has already surpassed Schumer, who raised
$17 million in his run for Senate in 1998, and his advisers say
they now think that he might end up raising close to $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The splurge of fund raising was condemned Thursday by Theodore
W. Kheel, the former labor negotiator who has taken the lead in
trying to work out an agreement between Clinton and Giuliani to
renounce voluntarily the use of unregulated soft money in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely terrible,'' Kheel said. ``It tells the public
that the electoral process depends on how much money you can raise.
The assumption is that more money will buy the election. It's
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The actual filing period does not end until midnight Friday.
Giuliani's aides said he was putting out the numbers a day early
because he would be in Arizona attending fund-raisers Friday. The
release of what the aides saw as a bit of good news also came as
the mayor has tried to tamp down criticism of his response to the
fatal police shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Because the figures were preliminary, neither campaign was able
to provide what is a critical way to measure the financial health
of a campaign: the amount of cash on hand. But Giuliani seems
likely to enjoy an advantage in this area. Unlike Clinton, Giuliani
has yet to hire much of a campaign staff, a reflection of the fact
that he has not done much campaign traveling and has a network of
City Hall aides. Teitelbaum said the campaign was about to begin
hiring more staff members within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani appears to be in a strong financial position, for
reasons going beyond the numbers in the latest report. Teitelbaum
said that more than half of the contributions came in response to
direct-mail solicitations, which meant that Giuliani, who has kept
a modest campaign schedule, did not have to leave City Hall much to
raise the cash. And Teitelbaum said the campaign now has gotten
contributions from 135,000 donors, most of whom have given below
the $1,000 legal contribution limit and whom the campaign can hit
again for more money.
</P>
<P>
   That said, political analysts cautioned Thursday that it would
be a mistake to read too much into the political position of either
candidate based on fund-raising figures. For one thing, no matter
how Clinton stands in comparison to Giuliani, she still has raised
what in any other Senate race would be a huge amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   And there is, Clinton's aides said, no corollary between a
candidate's fund-raising ability and victory, ``Senator D'Amato,
Senator North and Senator Huffington can all attest to the fact
that more money doesn't necessarily get you elected to the
Senate,'' said Howard Wolfson, Clinton's press secretary, referring
to unsuccessful Senate campaigns by Alfonse D'Amato in New York,
North in Virginia, and Michael Huffington in California.

N.H. NETWORKING-EQUIPMENT COMPANY TO LAY OFF 800 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares in Cabletron Systems Inc. sank 40 percent Thursday after
the company said it plans to lay off as many as 800 workers and
report restructuring costs of about $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron posted financial results in line with expectations for
the three months ended Feb 29. But its other disclosures, including
a projected operating loss of up to $45 million in the current
quarter, prompted a Goldman Sachs analyst to downgrade his rating
on the Rochester, N.H., networking-equipment company.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparently enough to send shares tumbling $19.875 to
$30 in New York Stock Exchange trading, wiping out $3.8 billion of
Cabletron's market value.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decline was even more remarkable as other securities
analysts maintained or reiterated their ratings on the company,
which, with 2,000 employees in New Hampshire, is one of the state's
largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron has about 4,500 employees altogether. It said it will
lay off 600 to 800 of them as it becomes a holding company that may
spin off up to four separate public units.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Mike Quinn said the company hasn't yet determined
where it will pare jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron's difficulties come as its chief executive, Piyush
Patel, struggles to turn around the company he was named to head
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron's components once were in high demand. But more
recently, the company has trailed Cisco Systems Inc. in the race to
produce gear that can transmit data at ever-faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
   With his plan to split up Cabletron, Patel hoped to improve its
focus and stimulate growth. Until Thursday, the market seemed to
buy the strategy. Shares reached $52 on Tuesday, up from around $27
in late January.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts emerged after the close of trading Wednesday when
Cabletron reported quarterly earnings of $28.1 million, up from
$3.8 million a year earlier. Sales rose 11 percent to $381.7
million from $345.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Patel said he was ``very pleased'' with the results. But Goldman
analyst Ajay Diwan wrote a research note citing concerns that
Patel's steps have reduced revenue expectations and that the stock
had already reached his $50 price target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disruption to business was the biggest risk in Cabletron's
restructuring, and this risk appears to have materialized,'' Diwan
wrote. Patel and other Cabletron executives were not available for
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts remain optimistic. Robertson Stephens analyst Paul
Johnson reiterated his ``buy'' rating, citing Cabletron's new
product line and loyal customer base.

METEOROLOGISTS TRACK TWISTER'S PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANITA BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After a half-day of searching from ground
and air Thursday, National Weather Service meteorologists said they
believe that the same tornado that cut a swath of destruction
through south Arlington danced its way into Grand Prairie to damage
56 additional homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to find where things began and ended, and what
I determined was this was not a separate tornado in Grand Prairie,
but a continuous track from Arlington,'' said Jim Stefkovich, a
warning coordination meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   At its worst in Grand Prairie, the tornado reached an F2
designation as it hit a housing subdivision between Pioneer Parkway
and Arkansas Lane. An F2 on the Fujita scale, which gauges damage,
has winds from 113 mph to 157 mph and can cause significant damage.
</P>
<P>
   At its birth in Arlington, the twister was at its strongest, an
F3, just southwest of the Cooper Street-Interstate 20 intersection.
In between, it rose and fell in intensity from F3 to F0, the latter
the weakest of tornadoes, as it spiraled across the southern end of
the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, an F5 _ the strongest tornado, with winds as high
as 318 mph _ left a trail of death and destruction across Oklahoma
on May 3, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington/Grand Prairie tornado was the second to touch down
Tuesday evening. Fort Worth got the first punch when an F2 tornado
formed near Castleberry High School just north of White Settlement
Road and cut through the city for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A weather damage team investigated Fort Worth and Arlington
damage Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stefkovich said the damage path of the Arlington/Grand Prairie
tornado was easy to follow as it cut across Arlington Municipal
Airport and destroyed homes and the Texas Department of Human
Services building on Bardin Road.
</P>
<P>
   When it crossed I-20, the path became more difficult to follow
across open fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stefkovich said that pictures of damage and the tornado's path
are posted on the Fort Worth's offices Internet Web page at
www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are really thankful for is the low loss of life and
low injuries as well,'' he said. ``That tells us a couple of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who did not hear warnings recognized the signs and
took the right action, Stefkovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, some have the mistaken idea that it is safe to
hide underneath bridges. Bridges funnel wind and debris underneath,
and there is nothing to hang onto, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth twister was the first to cut through the heart of
the city and the first to take lives in Tarrant County since 1927.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, a 16-month-old girl was killed when a tornado cut
through the rural Watson community, now part of south Arlington.

ASIAN VALUES, OVERTAKEN BY EVENTS  
 FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TOM REDBURN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happened to ``Asian values?''
</P>
<P>
   With the unexpectedly rapid revival of most of the economies in
East Asia, you would think that there would be a lot more talk
again in the region about the hardy superiority of Asia's often
more authoritarian and centralized approach to fostering economic
growth and running governments.
</P>
<P>
   But the avatars of Asian values _ Lee Kuan Yew, the patriarch
and former prime minister of Singapore, and Mohathir Mohamad, the
prime minister of Malaysia _ who were once so outspoken about the
dangers of individualism and the cultural failings of the West,
have barely been heard from lately. And few in Asia are listening
these days to sermons on ``Asian'' virtues of thrift, strong
extended families, personal connections and deference to elders.
Instead, the continent has fallen in love with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Jakarta, I
was struck repeatedly by the widespread enthusiasm for doing
business on the Web. The mania for the few dot-com stocks aimed at
the Asian market is just the most visible sign. More profound is
how quickly Asia's leaders are realizing that they can't flourish
in the new economy by doing business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no choice but to adapt an Asian version of the
American model of openness and entrepreneurialism,'' said Victor
Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
``Fortunately, that's where Hong Kong already has an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in China, where the freewheeling Internet threatens the
monolithic power of the Communist Party, the government solidly
backs building the infrastructure of a wired economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``China needs the Internet more than any other country in the
world,'' said Peter Yip, chief executive of China.com, a Hong-Kong
company of which the Beijing government is part-owner. ``It's the
only way to catch up with the rest of the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the emergence of the Internet is empowering a new
generation of Chinese entrepreneurs and luring home some of China's
best and brightest who have been studying and working abroad. One
evening in Shanghai, at an upscale Western-style restaurant called
M on the Bund, I had dinner with three young Chinese entrepreneurs
involved in various online ventures.
</P>
<P>
   From our table on the seventh floor of a neoclassical stone
office building built by foreigners before World War II, we were
able to look across the Huangpu River to dozens of modern glass
skyscrapers in the sprawling Pudong industrial and commercial area.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation, ranging from media gossip to contemporary art
to business strategies, could as easily have taken place in
Manhattan, London or Tokyo. Yes, these Web pioneers represent only
a thin slice of a tiny elite, but they are likely to be a wedge
that helps open China to the wider world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, I'm just another smart tech guy,'' said
Bo Y. Shao, founder and chairman of Eachnet.com, which is trying to
introduce a new form of person-to-person e-commerce to China.
``Here in Shanghai, my skills are unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Shao, 26, a Shanghai-born math whiz, went to Harvard to study,
but returned to China last year to build Eachnet from scratch.
While he adapts his business model to the vagaries of what is still
a primitive economic environment, he is raising money abroad and
planning a public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than in America, the online explosion in China is a
challenge to the business establishment, which has been on the
defensive since the Asian financial crisis broke in 1997. Many of
the most successful businesses _ and some of the most spectacular
failures _ are little more than the long shadows of powerful
families.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership and responsibility is closely held at the top, mostly
by fathers, sons and brothers. ``Guanxi,'' or connections that
sometimes spill over into payoffs and corruption, are an essential
element of the complex dance between business and government
elites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family businesses, crony businesses _ they all have to share
power and be restructured to be competitive,'' said Jimmy Lai,
chairman of Next Media, a publishing company that is becoming a
multimedia content provider and e-commerce vehicle. ``The Internet
has democratized business. It will inevitably democratize Asian
economies.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of hype associated with Internet ventures in
Asia, of course, just as there is in the United States. And there
are plenty of places in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand where
basic development remains frozen, leaving the Web little more than
a distant dream.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the region resumes its economic race, the idea that
Asia is fundamentally different has lost its resonance. The
information technology revolution is liberalizing an already
liberal West; the more traditional East seems destined for the
same.

   2 Sides of Banking Online &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Customers of traditional banks are not quite comfortable buying
stocks, bonds or mutual funds from them online. It is a somewhat
different story with customers of Internet-only banks, according to
a recent online survey of 207 consumers by the Stern Marketing
Group of Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of Internet-only bank customers thought that
their bank was a good place to make investments, the survey found.
Only 19 percent of traditional bank customers who visited both
their bank's branches and Web site said they felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the respondents said they would buy their next
financial product on the Internet. And 75 percent said they wanted
to get all their financial information and services in one place.
(The survey, which was conducted in February, had a margin of error
of plus or minus five percentage points.)
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Stern, president of Stern Marketing, said the results
indicated that virtual banks were solving a brand image problem _
namely, that banks in general are no place to buy investment
products. The survey also illustrated how consumers have changed
the way they shop for and buy financial services, Stern added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net has opened up the customer's perception of what a bank
can be, and customers feel that the virtual bank is more in tune
with the way they need to shop and buy financial services today,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional banks all have a Web site. But they have a long
way to go in changing their image as being more than a place to
open a checking account.'' &QL;

ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY SELLOFF SENDS NASDAQ INTO CORRECTION

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sharp selloff in technology stocks continued for
a third consecutive session Thursday, driving the Nasdaq composite
index into a correction, and analysts said the slide could very
well continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may really have crossed an important threshold here,'' said
Douglas R. Cliggott, domestic equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Securities. ``We could be talking about months rather than days or
weeks'' before reaching a floor.
</P>
<P>
   A late rebound lifted the Nasdaq off its lowest level of the day
_ a stunning decline of 289 points, or 6.2 percent _ and the index
finished down 186.78 points, or 4 percent, to 4,457.89, the
fifth-largest point decline ever for the Nasdaq. But the late rally
was not enough to keep the cumulative slide from reaching 10
percent, the benchmark Wall Street uses to define a correction. The
Nasdaq is now down 11.7 percent from the peak of 5,048.62 it set
less than three weeks ago, when nothing, not even the likelihood of
further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, seemed able
to dampen investor enthusiasm for stocks, especially those of
companies not yet generating significant profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which has declined every day this week, was led
lower by Qualcomm, which fell 12 17/64, to 145 15/64; Cisco
Systems, which dropped 2 7/16, to 73 5/8; Network Appliance, which
fell 12 11/16, to 79 1/8; and Citrix Systems, which slumped 13 3/4,
to 72 1/8, after an analyst warned it might miss revenue and profit
estimates for the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's session was the 10th this year in which the Nasdaq
fell at least 3 percent, already breaking the full-year record of
nine, set in 1998. It has fallen 500.56 points over the last three
days.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike many other recent sessions, when investors rotated
heavily into traditional growth and cyclical stocks, the Dow Jones
industrial average slumped, closing with a modest loss of 38.47
points, or 0.35 percent, to 10,980.25, after being up as much as
125 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, with a hefty weighting of
technology companies, sank 20.60 points, or 1.4 percent, to
1,487.92.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that while some of the selling was from customers
unwilling or unable to put up more cash in support of eroded
portfolios, it was not a significant factor in the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Some depressed onetime favorites did perk up Thursday, with
Gillette gaining 2 1/16, to 37 1/16; Coca-Cola rising 1 11/16, to
48 9/16; PepsiCo climbing 2 11/16, to 35 15/16; and IBM rising 3
3/4, to 122 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Riley Jr., a strategist at State Street Global Advisors,
said he thought this might mean that long-term investors who
stepped nervously to the sidelines while momentum buyers pushed
prices to ``truly idyllic'' levels, might have begun to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is still a growth orientation, it's with older,
established names,'' Riley said. ``Clearly, some of the excesses
are being corrected'' and the huge gap between Nasdaq highfliers
and the rest of the stock market is closing, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Already, nearly two-thirds of the stocks in Nasdaq have fallen
30 percent from their 52-week highs, said Jeffrey Warantz, a
Salomon Smith Barney strategist.
</P>
<P>
   This could lead Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to worry less
that newly created stock-market wealth will lead to revived
inflation. If so, that could relieve the upward pressure on
short-term interest rates, which eased substantially Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The markets paid little attention to the fact that the
government revised the pace of economic growth in the fourth
quarter to 7.3 percent, up from 6.9 percent, regarding it as
ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   But stock trading was still being affected, traders said, by
end-of-quarter maneuvering by portfolio managers and the prospect
of cascading offerings of stock by employees of fledgling companies
who will be free to sell at the expiration of lockup periods. Riley
said there were 126 such companies whose shares are expected to hit
the market over the next two months.
</P>

   Icahn Seeks to Take Control of Nabisco Group Holdings
</P>
<P>
   Just 15 days after being rebuffed by the board of Nabisco Group
Holdings, the investor Carl Icahn appealed to shareholders in a
campaign to take over the troubled maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz
crackers. In a letter to the board that was widely distributed to
others, Icahn offered shareholders a premium of 40 percent for 100
million shares that would give him control of the company. Once in
control, Icahn said, he would try to sell the company at what he
expects would be a ``very attractive price.''

FILLING SEATS WITH ONLINE DISCOUNTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2)

<P>
   Ticket discounts for online customers, already favored by the
airlines for filling empty seats, are rapidly spreading to sports _
and entertainment might be next. But the same technology that
allows discounts is also likely to allow higher prices for some of
the sports and entertainment seats that everyone wants.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association offer
discounts to anyone who signs up for ``Nets News'' online
bulletins. Last week, the team offered $50 seats to Sunday's
Detroit Pistons game for $20, and $20 seats for $17.
</P>
<P>
   Since last season, Texas Rangers followers who signed up on the
Web for the baseball team's fan club, Inside Pitch, have received
e-mail offers of steep discounts. Hockey fans get similar breaks
from the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly successful,'' said Jeff Cogan, executive vice
president of the Southwest Sports Group, a company led by the
Dallas investor Thomas O. Hicks that owns the Stars and Rangers.
Aided by data from online sales, Cogan is also considering higher
ticket prices for games on weekends or against popular rivals for
the Stars this fall and for the Rangers next year.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of online ticket sales makes it much easier for
sports teams or entertainment companies to gather data and set
prices according to demand. The newest technology will let online
buyers print their own tickets rather than having to wait for them
to arrive by mail or pick them up at box offices.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, fans attending sports events at the Staples
Center in Los Angeles, the First Union Center in Philadelphia and
22 other sites will be among the first in the nation to use tickets
they printed on their own computers. Within a year, that capability
is likely to spread to wired patrons of most major theater chains,
stadiums, arenas and performing arts centers.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting convenience is expected to help raise online
ticket sales from $300 million last year to $4 billion by 2004,
according to Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Sports and entertainment executives are already debating whether
they are entering a new era of pricing seats according to demand.
W. Thomas Gimble, chief executive of Tickets.com, based in Costa
Mesa, Calif., which has formed partnerships with the Stars and the
Rangers, has no doubts. ``When you can print your own tickets, it
busts apart the old rules of selling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But sports teams, promoters and entertainers, fearful of
alienating their fans, are proceeding cautiously, especially in
raising prices. In November, Tickets.com began auctioning some
prime seats for Elton John and Backstreet Boys concerts at an
average of 45 percent over face value, but the extra proceeds go to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Operators of movie theaters and some concert halls are openly
skeptical. Mark Pascucci, a senior vice president of Loews Cineplex
Entertainment, which has 2,900 screens, says that discounted movie
tickets for some shows would only steal audiences from others.
``There's no practical reason for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loews is joining the Regal and Edwards theater chains to begin
an online ticketing service this summer. Movietickets.com, based in
Boca Raton, Fla., and owned by the National Amusements theater
chain, AMC Theaters and CBS, plans to begin selling movie tickets
online over Memorial Day weekend. Both groups plan to let filmgoers
to print their tickets at home, beginning in December. To attract
customers, both sites plan to forgo service charges for at least
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets printed at home on standard paper and printers will
include bar codes that can be scanned by readers at theaters and
stadiums. The printouts might also include driving directions,
seating charts, parking coupons or restaurant advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and the Stars, however, have already gone a step
further, using software from Talus Solutions of Atlanta that helps
airlines and hotels gauge demand and set their rates. Marriott
International uses Talus software to set as many as 10 different
rates for identical hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium and team owners are especially eager to fill empty
seats, because so much of their revenue comes from food, drink and
souvenirs. ``To those owners, it's a big deal, regardless of what
patrons pay for the tickets,'' said Tom R. Madison, president of
Talus Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, wanting to fill some of the 15,000 seats that, on
average, remain empty in their stadium, are also offering breaks
like free extra tickets or coupons for discounted food and
beverages to frequent ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is the perfect opportunity to introduce dynamic
pricing because so many seats go unsold,'' said Gimble of
Tickets.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gimble's company also expects to allow ticket buyers to print
their own tickets beginning this summer for some of its 4,100 other
sites, which include those at Lincoln Center. But sports teams are
more likely to adopt variable pricing than the entertainment
industry, Gimble said.

OFFICIALS FALL FOR FAKE THREAT AGAINST FISHING CONTEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To bass anglers in East Texas, it sounded like an April Fools'
joke _ and it was.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials took the bait.
</P>
<P>
   PETA _ People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals _ threatened
Tuesday to sabotage Friday's Red Man Cowboy Division Fishing
Tournament at Lake Palestine by dumping sedatives into the lake,
which has an area of 25,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, the fish will be napping, not nibbling,'' the faxed
news releases stated, asserting that ``impaling'' bass on hooks is
painful and hardly sporting.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it would take millions of soluble tranquilizers
to sabotage the tourney, which takes place April 1, and that PETA's
spokeswoman was identified as ``April Phule.'' Officials at the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Upper Neches River
Municipal Water Authority took it all seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The officials went so far as to mobilize park rangers to catch
any drug-dumping activists this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the real PETA spokeswoman conceded that the
threat was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very impressed that somebody got it,'' said Dawn Carr of
Norfolk, Va., after initially declining to own up to the prank.
``But the important thing to remember is the fish have nothing to
laugh about.''
</P>
<P>
   A careful reading of the statements provided clues that PETA's
tongue was firmly in cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``April Phule'' was one clue. Another hint that the ``joke is on
you'' was ``Jo Kizonu,'' listed as a PETA official in a statement
sent to the Upper Neches River Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about that?'' said Tom Mallory, general manager of the
river authority, a state agency, when the hoax was pointed out to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of relieves me a little bit,'' Mallory said before
using a more colorful expression not usually printed in family
newspapers. ``I guess my reaction is, `Aren't they cute?' But a lot
of resources have been dedicated to this silly thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The premature April Fools' joke netted the activists bucketloads
of free publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Articles taking the sedative dumping seriously appeared in the
Tyler Morning Telegraph, the Palestine Herald-Press and The Dallas
Morning News as well as USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   While the threat was bogus, angler Gary Bostic said the bass
hadn't received the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not biting,'' said Bostic, 48, of Tyler, speaking by
cellular phone as he fished along the north end of the lake.
``They're acting like they've already been sedated.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Villages resort on Lake Palestine, where 200 boats are
expected for the fishing tournament, employees said they suspected
all along that PETA was pulling an April Fools' stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the resort is not letting down its guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know with this group,'' assistant manager Chris Site
said. ``Them saying it's an April Fools' Day joke could just be
another prank.''

KNIGHT STEALS THE HEADLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUNDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Final Four is here again and Thursday the man
who is not here was in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana coach Bob Knight has been under siege the past few weeks
amid reports of verbal and, at times, physical confrontations with
his players.
</P>
<P>
   That those reports came out years after the alleged incidents is
somewhat disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Knight having ``tough love'' encounters with his players is not
news. But the story in Thursday's Indianapolis Star kicked it up
another notch. The Star reported that following a loss to Ohio
State last month, Knight had words with Indiana athletic director
Clarence Doninger and it became so heated that a longtime friend of
Knight's had to step between the men.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who played for Knight at
Army, tiptoed through a question about his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Krzyzewski tried to joke about it. ``I got a lot of
stuff for my scholarship,'' he said. ``And I got paid and when I
graduated, he said, `I'm going to give you a tank.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Coach K chose the path most Knight supporters have followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Knight has been good for the game and done many positive
things for people who have played for him,'' said Krzyzewski.
``He's been very supportive for me and helped me immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question Knight can coach as well as anyone. He has
won three national championships, his players graduate, and he
plays by the rules. But he also coaches in a fishbowl, where his
temper has been well documented. Now we are hearing more about his
private displays of emotion . Indiana officials say they are
looking into these latest allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Less publicized are Knight's acts of kindness and generosity to
many of his former players and others.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are this will all be chalked up to ``Knight moves'' and
life will go on with ``The General,'' as Dick Vitale has labeled
him, still in charge.
</P>
<P>
   But in this day and age, when discipline is a four-letter word
to many, Knight's ways may seem out of date and boorish.
</P>
<P>
   It may indeed be past his time, but it would be unfortunate if
these allegations lead to the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coaching carousel
</P>
<P>
   Hartford is close to making a decision on its coaching opening
and UConn assistant Karl Hobbs is very much in the mix . . .
Nebraska is making a hard push at Tulsa coach Bill Self. Nebraska
officials flew to Tulsa earlier this week, reportedly ready to
offer Self a package between $800,000 and $1 million per year . . .
Michigan officials followed the UMass route when they came out
publicly and said coach Brian Ellerbe would be back next year. Even
though Ellerbe has four years remaining on his contract, rumors
about his future were so distracting that the school felt compelled
to issue a statement of support . . . Georgia Tech athletic
director Dave Braine continues his search for a coach to replace
Bobby Cremins. His original list of candidates included Self, Seton
Hall coach Tommy Amaker, and Miami coach Leonard Hamilton, but
those apparently are not going to pan out, so Dayton coach Oliver
Purnell became the unofficial leader in the clubhouse. That is
until Thursday, when Delaware's Mike Brey moved into the picture.
Brey would be a perfect fit. He has a Duke pedigree, an outgoing
personality, and a Washington D.C. background, which would help in
recruiting . . . NABC officials have talked about their hopes for
the continuation of summer recruiting, as opposed to the NCAA,
which wants it banned. The NABC wants to cut it from 24 to 20 days
. . . In a similar area, Krzyzewski said he would like to see the
NCAA open the scholarship umbrella for basketball players to get
something short of a cash stipend but more than the bare bones an
athletic scholarship provides. Coach K's point was that in 25 years
there have been a lot of changes in college basketball but what is
offered in a scholarship has not changed . . . North Carolina and
Wisconsin are unranked, the first time two such teams have made the
Final Four since 1980 (UCLA and Iowa) . . . When Wisconsin plays
Michigan State Saturday it will mark the second straight year the
Final Four has had two Big Ten teams, a first for the conference .
. . The last time two Big Ten teams met in the semifinals was in
1989, when Michigan and Illinois played in Seattle.

NCAA CONSIDERS ELIMINATING COACHES' SUMMER EVALUATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ If NCAA officials have their way, college
basketball coaches will have to spend their summers involved in
activities other than evaluating prospects.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said Thursday the governing body
is considering eliminating the summer evaluation period for coaches
as part of several initiatives designed to ``change the culture in
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches use summer basketball camps and tournaments to home in
on potential recruits, usually high school underclassmen or junior
high schoolers. But the NCAA, which Dempsey said is bothered by the
negative influences kids encounter during summer recruiting, would
like to do away with the process.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said the proposal, one of several matters to be
presented at the April meeting of management council in Division 1
and the governing body's board of directors, would call for
implementation of the legislation to be delayed for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would spend the year trying to rebuild a culture that is
more beneficial to prospective student-athletes, and we have the
right people influencing student-athletes in our future
direction,'' Dempsey said. He said the move would not affect
basketball camps run by the coaches, which are geared toward
younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey admitted the proposal will be controversial, but
declined to predict how it would be received.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a little premature,'' he said. ``We want to see
whether or not we can work with all the organizations, including
high school programs, and adopt a different culture of how we run
our summer programs. We'll encourage participation by all parties
and then we'll know better how much of an impact it is going to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer evaluation measure and other matters discussed
Thursday would lead one to believe that the NCAA has concerns about
the integrity of the sport _ as well as the proliferation of the
notion that it has become a unofficial minor league system for the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said the NCAA also is proposing providing financial aid
for incoming men's and women's non-qualifiers for a five-year
period and revisiting the non-qualifier rule to see whether it has
affected graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey also said the NCAA has been proactive in trying to get
anti-gambling legislation through Congress that would outlaw
betting on college sports, high school sports, and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very encouraged by the response we are getting from the
House and the Senate on the issue,'' he said. ``We recognize we
have strong opposition in the gaming association, but we are
somewhat confident if we can get it to the floor for a vote, we
will win the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey was asked to comment on a University of Michigan report
that polled Division 1 officials of men's and women's basketball
and football, and found that 84 percent say they have gambled
(mostly on lotteries and at casinos) and one fifth have bet on the
NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already started last year a background check on
officials,'' Dempsey said. ``Last year we had one official who was
not approved because of the background check process.''

IN MIAMI, THE ISSUE IS NOT A BOY, BUT A MAN: CASTRO

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Even miles away from sign-waving demonstrators who keep
vigil outside the tiny house in Little Havana where Elian Gonzalez
lives with his great-uncle, talk about the standoff between Elian's
Miami relatives and Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials pours hot and quick from coffee stands on Calle Ocho and
any other place Cuban Americans gather.
</P>
<P>
   In rapid-fire Spanish, so fast that even people who learned the
language in other Hispanic cultures can have trouble keeping up,
they villify Attorney General Janet Reno, President Clinton and
others who want to send the child back to his father in Cuba. And
they question _ or ridicule _ news that the boy's father is
planning to come here to retrieve his son.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Communist plot hatched by the hated dictator, Fidel
Castro, they say. If you are not Cuban, they said, you just would
not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't Cuba, the child should go to be with his
father,'' said Delfina Miranda, 49, who works at a beauty salon in
Little Havana. ``But it is Cuba. That kid will get nothing in Cuba.
Well, maybe electro-shock treatment, so they can brain-wash him.''
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, Cuban Americans said that outsiders who did not
suffer under the Castro regime simply could not understand their
passions in the Elian standoff.
</P>
<P>
   As talk on the streets swirled, talks between lawyers for
Elian's Miami relatives and government officials crept to an
uneventful close.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Immigration officials postponed until Tuesday morning any
action on revoking the boy's temporary permission to stay in the
United States, which would allow federal officials to, ultimately,
take the boy from his relatives' house and eventually return him to
Cuba. ``Like the family, we are monitoring developments concerning
the possible arrival of (Elian's father) Juan Miguel Gonzalez in
the United States,'' said Robert Wallis, INS director for the Miami
district.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials had threatened to revoke the boy's parole
if his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, did not sign a document
agreeing to hand Elian over to federal officials once the family's
appeal in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was decided.
</P>
<P>
   But that standoff became less important in the eyes of Cuban
Americans here after Castro announced Wednesday that the boy's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is ready to travel to the United
States to take his son home.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's lawyer, Greg Craig, asked for a visa Thursday for his
client for the expected visit, but was told by U.S. State
Department officials that Gonzalez himself had to apply for the
visa at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel Gonzalez is ready at a moment's notice to come to
the United States,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, many Cuban Americans said Castro is orchestrating
the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said Gonzalez would travel with his current wife and
their son, a top government official, doctors, nurses,
psychiatrists, Elian's Cuban kindergarten teacher, classmates and
his old school desk.A list of 31 people issued by the Cuban
government Thursday included Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's
National Assembly. Castro has suggested that Elian and his
relatives stay at the residence of Cuba's chief diplomat in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden in the entourage, cautioned Cuban Americans here, will be
Cuban security agents who will make sure that Gonzalez _ and
everyone else, for that matter _ does not defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming with everyone, including psychologists,'' said
Armando Sanjurjo, 73. ``You know why? To give Elian an injection
and take him back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanjurjo, sipping a cafecito in front of Versailles restaurant,
the nerve center for Cuban political discussions here in Little
Havana, is convinced, like many others here, the entourage is
designed to prevent any defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming with an entire court of people? What's that
about?'' said Angela Esparragera, 71.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda said Elian's father will be ``a virtual prisoner here if
he comes with all those people. He'll be surrounded by people if he
goes to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Estefan, the wildly popular singer of Cuban descent who
has become an entertainment and cultural icon, was also suspicious
of this visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact, Elian's father is permitted by the dictatorship of
Fidel Castro to come to the United States, then, as a Cuban
American, I welcome him and urge him to make all his decisions
based on the well being and best interest of his son, and not that
of the Cuban government,'' Estefan said.
</P>
<P>
   All week, elected officials in Washington, D.C., and at the
state capital in Tallahassee have issued statement of support for
Elian's Miami relatives, even Vice President Al Gore, breaking from
his own administration's stand. In Miami-Dade County, elected
officials went as far as to say they their police departments would
have no role in taking the boy from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Among non-Cuban Americans, there was a drastic shift in their
feelings on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send him back,'' said Marsha Raeber, 47, an airline employee.
``There are rules and regulations in this country. Some people are
born rich, some people are born poor. That's the luck of the draw.
Who's to say that he's better off at Disney World and eating fast
food here instead if breathing the fresh air of Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Pichardo, 44, is from Nicaragua, and said the
Cuban-Americans ``need to follow the law. What about all the other
poor kids in South and Central America?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Cuban-Americans insist that Elian be allowed to stay.
Diana de Cardenas, 33, was born in Cuba in 1984. ``I think he
deserves to be with his father,'' she said. ``It would be ideal if
his father came,'' and then stayed, in Miami.

TECH JITTERS STILL PULLING DOWN NASDAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq exchange continued its weeklong
descent Thursday, as uneasy investors sold off shares in new
economy stocks that have climbed sharply for months.
</P>
<P>
   For a time Thursday, the Nasdaq appeared headed for the worst
day in its history. With less than 30 minutes remaining in the
session, the exchange was down 289 points. But it rallied in late
trading and by day's end had fallen 186.78 points, or 4 percent, to
close at 4457.89.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the steep drop brings the weekly loss to 10 percent and
marks an official correction for the highly volatile exchange. The
Nasdaq suffered a similar plunge early this month, only to bounce
back, but analysts refrained from making any predictions about
which way the Nasdaq will head next. Some said this week's slide in
the sky-high prices of technology stocks was inevitable and
necessary to bring the markets back into balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hyperbolic performance over the past six and 12 months
clearly couldn't be sustained,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment
strategist for State Street Global Advisers, a division of State
Street Corp. ``Right now, we're getting the correction many people
felt was necessary for this market to establish a healthy
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average also fell Thursday. Its decline
was limited to 38.47 points, as many old-line consumer and
industrial companies, which are bargains compared with technology
shares, held firm. The Dow closed Thursday at 10,980.25, having
fallen less than half a percent all day.
</P>
<P>
   Computer, telecommunications, and software-industry stocks have
swung wildly since the Nasdaq reached its March 10 record of
5048.62. This week, however, the Nasdaq has plunged nearly 550
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's volatility reflects concerns that the values
accorded many new companies in the technology sector are
unrealistic, given that most of them still do not produce a profit.
Analysts note that, despite this week's sharp decline, the Nasdaq
is still up nearly 10 percent so far this year _ on top of an 86
percent gain in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the wild swings in the Nasdaq is ongoing
concern that the economy is growing too fast _ and that the Federal
Reserve will be forced to raise interest rates several more times
in an attempt to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced Thursday that the nation grew at a rate
of 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the fastest
growth rate in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seems unbelievable, doesn't it?'' said Cynthia
Latta, an economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. ``Certainly, it's a
rate that isn't going to be sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   While stock markets typically drop in reaction to such news,
which may point to future interest-rate hikes by the Fed, analysts
said Thursday's stock decline was unrelated. The fourth quarter is
long forgotten, said William Cheney, chief economist for John
Hancock Financial Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the stock market is reacting to that,'' Cheney
said. ``The fourth quarter of 1999 is outside the range of the
stock market's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the Nasdaq was spurred by investors who fear that
even the premier technology stocks cannot achieve the profits
necessary to justify sky-high stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the world's biggest networking company, Cisco Systems
Inc., dived $2.4375 a share, to $73.625. The world's biggest chip
maker, Intel Corp., dropped $4.875, to $127. And the world's
biggest software company, Microsoft Corp., fell $3.8125 to $103.375
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Nasdaq's slide came in the wake of another month of
record flows into mutual funds that invest in the stock market.
Investors put $39.1 billion in new money into mutual funds in
February, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But, William Lawrence, a portfolio manager for Beacon Fiduciary
Advisors, said fund managers and other institutional investors may
be selling their tech stocks as they participate in ``window
dressing'' for customers at the end of the quarter. Institutions
often sell stocks and rebalance portfolios before shareholder
reports are mailed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be seen to have an inordinately large
position in a stock that has been falling,'' Lawrence said. Despite
a bad week, however, he said the decline was a welcome adjustment
and noted, ``the Nasdaq is still up 85 percent from last fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors are getting edgy about a market in which almost
two-thirds of Nasdaq stocks are, according to Salomon Smith Barney
equity strategist Jeffrey Warantz, down 30 percent from their
52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   Where are things headed? Thomas O'Neill, chief investment
officer for FleetBoston Financial Advisors, said that technology
stocks are, as they have done repeatedly, capable of bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill said a correction is welcome. ``What's going on now
is more healthy for the long-term than what has preceded it.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was in many ways the strangest of outings.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen foreign envoys and Richard Holbrooke, the ubiquitous
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, visited Washington Thursday
as individual sightseers _ just 14 guys and one woman, Patricia
Durrant of Jamaica. It was not, they said emphatically, an official
visit by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from
distributing a press packet labeled ``Visit of the United Nations
Security Council to the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't stop Sergei Lavrov, the Russian ambassador, from
preparing his wardrobe for the chance of a meeting with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am wearing a white shirt, just in case,'' said Lavrov, who,
as it turned out, did not get to meet with Clinton, who was in New
York raising money for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The leisurely beginning of the day included a Senate history
lesson, a guided tour of the Capitol and a lavish lunch in the
Russell Senate office building, all arranged by Sen. Jesse Helms,
the North Carolina Republican who heads the committee, and its
ranking Democrat, Joseph Biden of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomatic gloves came off Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At a ``round table discussion'' _ remember, this wasn't an
official hearing _ _ one ambassador after another criticized the
Foreign Relations Committee for America's ambivalent leadership and
a law that pays $926 million of the U.S. debt, but only if the
United Nations takes steps to eliminate waste, a condition many
diplomats consider unwarranted micromanaging.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's ambassador, Robert Fowler, acknowledged that the United
Nations has 8,000 bureaucrats, but chided the Congress for having
more than 30,000 employees. ``We have overlap and duplication, and
so do you,'' said Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has agreed with Congress to try to lower U.S.
payments to the United Nations, another demand that has rankled.
Member nations, including some of Washington's closest allies, were
angered that the United States was making such demands when it was
violating treaty obligations that it pay its dues on time and in
full.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats are grudgingly considering Washington's positions
because they realize the United Nations cannot effectively exist
without the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not persuaded by your arguments, but by our own
enlightened self-interest,'' said Peter van Walsum, the Dutch
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. is looking to the United States for the same thing
that the states were looking to King George and didn't get: the
right balancing between representation and taxation,'' said Sir
Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative.
</P>
<P>
   But membership is a two-way street, the diplomats reminded the
senators, who sat with the diplomats around a long rectangular
table in the committee's main hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the only superpower, but you cannot
manage everything without the other countries of the world,'' said
Wang Yingfan, China's ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council members visited Capitol Hill to reciprocate
for a trip to New York by Helms in January, when he offered an
olive branch to diplomats, but in a mailed fist. At that meeting,
Helms asserted that Congress had the right to dictate conditions
for the payment of U.S. debts to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Helms was anything but antagonistic, playing the
courtly Southern host, and absorbing the verbal body blows that the
ambassadors flung with quiet aplomb, and not hinting at anger. ``He
said what he had to say in New York,'' said the senator's
spokesman, Marc Thiessen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the barbs, the atmosphere at Thursday's sequel
session was more diplomatic and good-humored than in the encounter
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As Thursday afternoon's 2 1-2 hour meeting was preparing to
adjourn, Fowler of Canada said Helms could make an immediate
contribution to a more efficient United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we have one of those gizmos?'' Fowler said, pointing to
the tricolor timing lights that the committee uses to alert
speakers when their allotted time is finished. ``That would
streamline Security Council meetings.''  &QL;

BUSH PROPOSES SPENDING $2.9 BILLION TO TRAIN AND RECRUIT TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EDUC-COMPARE) 
(DW) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has been promoting
his prescriptions for education in pilgrimages to classrooms across
the country, set his presidential campaign down Thursday amid the
stacks of a middle school library here to announce a five-year,
$2.9 billion plan to improve teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing teachers ``the whole lifeblood of the education
system,'' Bush said he would increase financing for teacher
training by $400 million annually, to $2.4 billion. He said he
would bolster a program that recruits retired military personnel to
become teachers, an idea originally championed by Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, who lost to Bush in the Republican primaries. Bush
would raise spending on the program to $30 million annually, from
$2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that teachers should be protected by law from
facing federal civil rights lawsuits for enforcing reasonable
rules, and proposed that they be allowed up to a $400 tax deduction
annually for spending their personal money on supplies. The tax
deduction would cost $150 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the five-year plan Thursday, at a forum with
educators, was the latest move by Bush to claim education as his
emblematic issue and deny his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, an
advantage on what is often seen as a Democratic preserve.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most interesting symbols of this strategy, Bush
for the second time this week even opened his remarks by
approvingly recalling an anecdote about Albert Shanker, the late
president of the American Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' unions have long been a bete noire of many
Republican politicians, who say the unions are obstacles to change.
In the 1996 presidential campaign, the Republican nominee, former
Sen. Bob Dole, often railed against the unions.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Shanker, Bush said: ``He went into a classroom and
said, `What do you think we ought to teach you to read?' And one
kid raised his hand and said, `What do the smart kids read?'
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' Bush continued, ``education excellence starts with
people knowing that every child can be a smart child. Secondly,
those of us at the table know that reforms come from the bottom up.
And therefore, we've got to align authority and responsibility at
the local level. It's impossible for the federal government to
dictate reform. It's impossible for a centralized authority to say
this is the way it's got to be, `cause you see, one size doesn't
fit all.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore are pressing their education agendas, mindful
that polls show that the issue is an important one for voters. But
the two men are taking markedly different tacks. With his plan
Thursday, Bush is calling for $13.4 billion in new federal
education spending from the budget surplus over five years, far
less than Gore's plan, which amounts to $115 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush called for a five-year, $5 billion program to
combat illiteracy among children. Earlier proposals by Bush
included making $3 billion in loan guarantees available for
establishing charter schools and raising the annual contributions
parents can make to education savings accounts to $5,000 from $500.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, citing the disparity between the overall size of
the two candidates' plans, the Gore campaign called the new Bush
teacher proposal timid, saying that the vice president wants to
spend far more for teacher training and other measures. As they
have done repeatedly in recent days as Bush has presented his
education proposals, Gore aides questioned whether any new spending
was possible if Bush's tax cut plan took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has focused not on money but on the issues of control and
accountability, saying that the federal government should give
states more latitude in spending federal money while also ensuring
that the money is not wasted. He sees himself as something of a
national cheerleader for successful education policies at the state
and local level, promoting strategies but not imposing them.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the creation of more charter schools, like the one he
visited Thursday in Milwaukee, the Fritsche Middle School, and
would like states to provide money to students at poorly performing
public schools so they can attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the forum, Bush brushed aside a
question about whether voters would find Gore's education plan more
appealing because it was larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not competing on money,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush spent most of the day talking about education, he did
visit a Harley-Davidson motorcycle factory in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was given a black leather biker jacket, which he put on,
and escorted to one of the company's sizable motorcycles, where he
stood for photographs. But despite the entreaties of reporters, he
declined to climb aboard.

<P>
   If you thought all the lists of the best this or that of the
last 100 or 1,000 years had been compiled, think again. While the
Car of the Century has been selected (the Ford Model T, annointed
by an international panel of experts), what about the flipside: of
the tens of thousands of automobile models produced since the
1880s, which were bad enough to warrant special recognition?
</P>
<P>
   The hosts of ``Car Talk'' on National Public Radio, Tom and Ray
Magliozzi _ also known as Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers _
invited listeners to vote for the ``worst cars of the millenium,''
vehicles that were, in their words, ``just stupid, in every
possible way.'' The results were announced this weekend on their
radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Votes were compiled on the show's Web site, www.cartalk.com. In
an interview last week, the brothers discussed the survey, the
losers-cum-winners and the selection process. As sharp-tongued on
the phone as on their show, they spoke rapidly and interchangeably;
much of the time, it was impossible to determine which Magliozzi
was talking.
</P>
<P>
   They described the chosen cars in the same salty language one
might hear in a repair shop where the owner of, say, a Chevy Vega
was getting another bit of bad news. Indeed, they characterized
some listeners as long-suffering victims bent on revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a scientific survey,'' said Ray (or was it Tom?).
``The voters are a self-selecting group of wackos, most of whom are
really aggravated by a bad experience with one of the cars, and
this is their chance to get even.'' In fact, all the finalists were
built within the last 35 years, the indignities they caused still
fresh in former owners' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hilary Swank won an Oscar for playing a woman who
lived as a man. The winner of this competition was a metallic
object with rubber tires that impersonated a car: the Yugo. ``This
was a cheap piece of junk, and built to stay that way,'' one of the
brothers said. ``The Yugo was just a dated Fiat 128 built on
worn-out equipment that Fiat sold to the Yugoslavs.'' The factory
was destroyed by Allied bombs during the Kosovo conflict, sparing
potential Yugo owners of future headaches.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yugo was the voters' choice, the Magliozzis would have
divided the top spot among three finalists: the Renault Dauphine,
the Chevrolet Chevette and a twin entry, the Dodge Aspen and
Plymouth Volare. ``At least the Yugo buyers knew they were getting
junk,'' Tom said. ``The three cars we thought were the worst
actually pretended to be real transportation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chevette, for instance, ``was a stupid design, and, just to
increase the insult to the customer, General Motors kept selling
them for a long time _ 12 years,'' one brother said. The other
added, ``Unfortunately, the engines were pretty good, which kept
the cars on the road that much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   They were no kinder to the Volare/Aspen, which hold a place in
history as the most-recalled cars ever. The Magliozzis described
them as ``cars that rusted even when they were rust-proofed,'' that
stalled in wet weather and stumbled under acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The Dauphine, from France, ``was designed to go about 30 miles
an hour, from one end of the village to the other'' _ not for long
trips like, say, crossing Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Ray acknowledged that two finalists, the Vega and the
Ford Pinto, were among the first American attempts to make small
cars at a time of rising gas prices and surging Japanese imports.
The Pinto was sound, they said, aside from its tendency to burst
into flames when hit in the rear. It wouldn't have made their own
list.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vega, in their view, was terrible in every way.
``General Motors is the largest car corporation in the world,'' Ray
(or Tom?) said. ``And the best that it could come up with was this
car with an engine that melted and a body that rusted so badly that
the cars sometimes broke in half.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Volkswagen Bus, one Magliozzi said it was a
sentimental favorite of many people because it reminded them of the
'60s. ``It was like having your own little apartment on wheels that
you could sneak into and smoke dope,'' he said. Unfortunately, the
rear-mounted, air-cooled engines overheated to the point of
destruction. The far-forward seats essentially forced one's legs to
serve as an auxiliary front bumper.
</P>
<P>
   The only ``luxury'' car on the list was the Cadillac Cimarron.
``Buyers felt cheated,'' Tom said. ``One fellow told me he had
wanted his whole life to have a Cadillac, bought a Cimarron and
discovered he owned a Chevy Cavalier with a Cadillac badge on its
nose.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They see a common thread among the 10 cars: none took advantage
of technology available when they were built. ``A 1972 Chevrolet
Impala was a good car when it was built, and it's still a good car
today,'' Ray said. ``But a Vega, built at the same time, was a
piece of junk when it was new.''
</P>
<P>
   Car shoppers should note that a few of all these models are
still out there in the back rows of the nation's used-car lots, at
prices that might seem ridiculously low.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say, ``Caveat emptor''? &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Turned out the free flight was on US Airways, which doesn't go

have had to make a stopover in Pittsburgh, Pa., for a total of 12
hours flying time.'' Excited about the experience but unwilling to
spend all day flying, she decided to pay for her own flight, plus,
as the contract had stipulated, hotel and food for the two-day
trip, plus car rental.
</P>
<P>
   Brichacek says that fewer than five winners showed up. Like
extras on most movies, they sat around for a good deal of the day.
When the cameras rolled, Brichacek says, she and her fellow brides
were ``not even in the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip cost the ``winner'' $450. ``I did see Jennifer Lopez,''
she writes, ``but was not allowed to take a picture. ... We never
got to meet the director or anybody affiliated with the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's like to be an extra,'' says the magazine's

FIND OF SMALL PLANETS FUELS HOPES FOR OTHER SUN-ORBITING WORLDS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Planet hunters searching the skies for evidence of distant solar
systems have detected two planets smaller than Jupiter or Saturn _
the most persuasive clue yet that far-off suns may indeed hold
orbiting Earth-sized worlds, perhaps much like our own.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only a few days for the two newfound planets to orbit
their parent stars, and they are so close to the suns that they are
forbiddingly hot, the astronomers who discovered them say.
</P>
<P>
   And like the 24 planets that the same team previously detected,
the new ones are most probably giant balls of gas with no solid
surface _ just as Jupiter and Saturn are in our own solar system.
</P>
<P>
   But the new ones are so much smaller than Jupiter and Saturn
that the excitement level of the astronomers has risen like a
rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The successful hunters are Geoffrey Marcy of the University of
California at Berkeley, R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution
in Washington, and Steven S. Vogt of UC-Santa Cruz. Marcy and
Butler announced their discovery Wednesday at a NASA news
conference in Washington, but before Marcy left Berkeley for the
conference, he voiced his delight at the team's discovery, saying
in an interview:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tremendously exciting to see smaller and smaller planets,
because they give us the promise that there must be countless
Earths out there in the galaxy, like our own `Pale Blue Dot,' just
waiting for us to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers have been working on their extremely difficult
task for 15 years, and found their first huge ``gas giants'' the
size of Jupiter only five years ago. But Marcy and his colleagues
are convinced that discovering the two far smaller ones shows they
are on the right track toward detecting still smaller rocky ones in
the coming decade _ once new planet-seeking space-born telescopes
are operating.
</P>
<P>
   The three astronomers cannot actually see any of the planets
they have found, but they detect them _ most recently through the
eye of the giant Keck telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii _ by
measuring the tiny wobbles of their parent stars as the gravity of
their orbiting planets tugs at them. The light from those stars
fluctuates regularly, and by measuring the tiny changes in the
stars' velocities the team can determine the mass and speed of the
planets around them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the planets orbits every 3.02 days around an obscure star
known only as HD161141 in the constellation Monoceros, about 109
light years from Earth. The other revolves around a star called 79
Ceti, in the constellation Cetus the Whale, about 117 light-years
away. It flies in a 75-day orbit _ similar to swiftly-orbiting
Mercury's flight around our own sun. (One light-year is roughly six
trillion miles.)
</P>
<P>
   Both planets must be extremely hot, Marcy estimated _ the one in
Monoceros probably averages about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, while
the planet orbiting 79 Ceti is a little cooler _ about 1,500
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The newfound planets could not have been detected at all, Marcy
said, if his colleague Steve Vogt had not developed an extremely
sensitive high-tech device called a spectrometer. The team
installed the device on the Keck telescope to make it even more
precise in measuring the speed of the parent stars' wobbles.
Pinning down those velocities _ about 3 meters per second, or some
6.7 miles an hour across more than 100 light-years of space _ is an
achievement in itself, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers have been examining the light from more than
1,000 stars to find candidates for solar systems, and they have
another 1,000 to go over the next few years. The team has already
pinpointed six to 10 other stars that appear ``promising'' as
targets for more planet-hunting right now, Marcy said.
</P>
<P>
   The group's findings so far, Butler said, ``suggests that
Earth-mass planets are extremely common in our galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   But such planets can never be found using the detection
techniques of Marcy's team, the astronomers conceded. Our own sun,
for example, wobbles under Earth's influence with a velocity of
only one-tenth of a meter per second _ far beyond the technology
available now _ so it will take direct observations by future
space-based telescopes to find any Earth-like planets, the team
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   A curious and unexplained difference between the planets of our
solar system and the gas planets detected by Marcy's team is the
nature of their orbits. In our solar system, the planets in general
revolve around the sun in nearly circular orbits, while the
newfound gas planets fly in ``eccentric'' elliptical orbits that
would alternately freeze and melt any Earth-like planets there if
they existed at all, Marcy said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings so far ``suggest that our solar system is somewhat
unusual,'' he said. And that, he said, ``may have something to do
with the fact that biology has flourished here.''

GORE FAVORS PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking with President Clinton on an issue
involving a key voter group, Vice President Al Gore on Thursday
announced he would support legislation giving permanent resident
status to Elian Gonzalez, his father in Cuba, and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, if passed, would switch the Gonzalez
controversy from an immigration issue, handled in the federal
courts, to a custody matter, handled by state courts. It would take
Elian's fate away from the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which has ordered the 6-year-old boy returned to his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, I have said that Elian Gonzalez's
case is at heart a custody matter,'' Gore said in a statement. ``It
is a matter that should be decided by courts that have the
experience and the expertise to resolve custody cases with due
process, and based on Elian's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now appears that our immigration laws may not be broad
enough to allow for such an approach in Elian's case,'' Gore said.
``That is why I am urging Congress to immediately pass legislation
. . . which would grant permanent resident status to Elian, his
father, stepmother, half-brother, grandmothers and grandfather so
that this case can be adjudicated properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments play to South Florida's Cuban-American community, a
critical and politically active group in Florida that has expressed
its deep anger at the Clinton-Gore administration's decision to
send Elian back to Cuba. Elian was found floating on an innertube
last November, a survivor of a perilous trip from Cuba that killed
his mother and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans typically vote Republican, and Florida _
governed by Jeb Bush, brother of Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush _ was once thought to be a lock for the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, the Gore campaign has seen Florida, with 25
electoral votes, as a state the vice president could win.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway denied that Gore's statement was
meant to appease Cuban-Americans. ``It's because he believes it
ought to go to family court,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who advocates full citizenship for Elian, called on Gore
to ``use his influence'' to get Clinton and Attorney General Janet
Reno to support the bill. The pending legislation backed by Gore,
sponsored by Senators Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, and
Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, would grant permanent resident
status for the Gonzalezes, not citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Wisconsin, Bush reiterated his view that the
youngster and his father should be permitted to stay in the United
States while Florida courts resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope if Mr. Gonzalez does come over, that he come over
as a person who's able to make a decision based on his desire, that
he be given a chance to feel in America what freedom means before
he makes any decision, and that decision be made in a family
court,'' Bush told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Gore's unexpected announcement stunned some of
his Democratic colleagues. Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat
of California, said the move made her question whether she would
continue to support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not like it. I do not think this should be handled in a
political manner,'' Waters, clearly taken off guard by the Gore
announcement, said during a live program on CNN. ``This is not a
custody case. It's an immigraion case.''
</P>
<P>
   David Abraham, a family law professor at the University of Miami
Law School, said that even if the Gonzalezes were granted resident
status, the matter should still be resolved in the Cuban courts.
Both case law and the US uniform child custody code support this
notion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert played down the policy split
between the president and the vice president. Clinton has said
publicly that the matter should be dealt with in the courts, and
that he hoped Elian's Miami relatives would abide by the INS's
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the vice president will have different views on
different issues from time to time,'' Siewert said. ``We're not
supporting any change in the law. We're trying to enforce the law
as it stands.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is uncomfortable with the use of a ``private
bill,'' legislation designed to help a particular individual or
individuals, in Elian's case, said a White House source. Usually,
such bills are passed only when every other legal remedy has been
exhausted. Elian's case is still under appeal.

TORNADO DAMAGE MAY HIT $450 million 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER AUTREY 
and GINGER D. RICHARDSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Damage estimates from the storms that roared
through Fort Worth and south Arlington on Tuesday could soar as
high as $450 million, insurance adjusters said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Fire Department ended its ground search for
Adele Warren, 62, whose car was washed away as she left Bell
Helicopter Textron at the height of the storm. The body of Warren's
grandson, Ashlyn B. Dickens, 24, was found Wednesday morning in a
creek bed.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department spokesman Kent Worley said firefighters will fly
over the creek area Friday in helicopters provided by Bell, where
Warren had worked for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Warren was among five people killed by the storms, which spawned
two tornadoes about 30 minutes apart. Dozens suffered minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Spence, 67, and Howard D. Thornton, 52, were crushed to
death on the outskirts of downtown. Juan C. Oseguera, 19, died
Wednesday from severe head injuries suffered when a softball-size
hailstone hit him in Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-block area of downtown Fort Worth remained impassable
Thursday as workers cleared broken glass from Bank One and other
damaged high-rise buildings, and neighborhoods west of the city
center looked like a wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Shards of glass rained from the tops of skyscrapers onto
deserted streets, and crews worked to remove uprooted trees and
overturned cars from the Linwood, Rivercrest and Monticello
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Fire Chief Larry McMillen said of downtown will
probably remain closed through the weekend. He said that eight
commercial buildings west of downtown are destroyed and that the
Cash America International building will probably have to be razed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a massive cleanup operation under way,'' said Hugo
Malanga, director of transportation and public works for Fort
Worth. ``We're hoping that we can get the major debris cleared by
the end of the day today or early tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials are expected to continue strictly enforcing the
no-access zone Friday. Thursday, they began requiring property
owners and contractors to obtain passes for access to restricted
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The permits are available on the south end of City Hall and will
be issued only to those who provide a driver's license and/or
company identification, point of destination and their reason for
needing access to the damaged areas, city spokesman Pat Svacina
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stress that this is not for the regular workers,''
he said. ``This is not for the rank-and-file people who work
downtown. They will not be allowed into the restricted areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County has not been declared a disaster area by the
federal government, and Federal Emergency Management Agency workers
are expected to arrive sometime next week after paperwork is
completed, officials said. Gov. George W. Bush's office declared
the county a disaster area Wednesday at the request of County Judge
Tom Vandergriff.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth officials estimate local commercial damage alone at
$154 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington Mayor Elzie Odom said city staffers are having trouble
breaking out damage estimates for Arlington, because most official
agencies are seeking countywide figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a wild estimate that may or may not be close to
accurate,'' Odom said. ``They are telling me that just Arlington
may be about $28 million. But I'm reluctant to throw any number out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 Arlington homes sustained major damage, and 1,000
received light to moderate damage. Thirty-three businesses were
damaged, including Lear Corp., Buz Post Auto Body Shop, a U.S. Post
Office, the Health and Human Services Center and Bell Helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In east Fort Worth on Thursday, firefighters, including members
of the department's dive team, combed a 2 1/2 mile stretch of creek
in a fruitless search for Warren. They were aided by volunteers,
search dogs and the Fort Worth police Mounted Patrol unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered everything we could the best way we could,'' Worley
said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who survived the storm, Thursday was a day of waiting
for insurance adjusters and city cleanup crews.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and Fort Worth city workers descended into the
heavily damaged Linwood and Monticello neighborhoods, armed with
water, axes, shovels and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents were outside, picking up trash from front lawns
and trying to patch windows with plastic, bedsheets and chunks of
plywood. As people worked in the chilly afternoon air, they
occasionally yelled to one another about their tornado experiences
or offered help.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Alvarado was driving home in his van when he saw the funnel
cloud barreling toward him from the west.
</P>
<P>
   He tore down Merrimac Street in Linwood to reach his home at 409
Foch St. and ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed and prayed,'' said Alvardo, who described himself as
a born-again Christian. ``This makes you believe in Christ real
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are asking that sightseers avoid the area, saying the
extra traffic is hindering cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup scene was similar in south Arlington for residents
along the Embercrest Drive and Chasemore Lane, among the
hardest-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
   Although much activity surrounded what remained of the homes _
workers nailing boards or cleanup crews dragging debris to the
street _ life appeared to be stalled for many residents as they
stood around waiting for the most popular person in town: the
insurance adjuster.
</P>
<P>
   They called out to passers-by: ``Are you an insurance adjuster?
Have you seen one for Allstate? Have you seen one for State Farm?''
Spray paint on makeshift signs or garage doors spelled out the
names of insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Chibli, 44, who lived at 4702 Osage Court until the
twister grabbed most of his roof, said he is frustrated that he
hasn't seen an adjuster sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're busy. Everybody is having the same problem,''
Chibli said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials also grew increasingly concerned Thursday about
scam artists, and warned residents not to pay contractors until
work is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want fly-by-night crews coming in and taking people's
money,'' Fort Worth Police Chief Ralph Mendoza said. ``Please only
deal with reputable businesses, and don't give anyone money
beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate offers of help have begun flooding in.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County College and the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce
are offering temporary office space to businesses displaced by the
storms. Lowe's, Home Depot, Payless Cashways and several other home
improvement stores are donating plywood.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take days for the city to regain some semblance
of normalcy, and months or longer before the damage is no longer
visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmetically, we will be impacted for a while,'' Fort Worth
Mayor Kenneth Barr said. ``The downtown buildings will have plywood
on them for at least five or six months.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir have in recent days shifted on both the policy and public
relations fronts to a softer tone in an effort to ease tensions
over the death of a man who was fatally shot during a scuffle with
undercover officers who had approached him about buying drugs.
Statements made as part of this shift have included an expression
of sympathy to the family of the man, Patrick M. Dorismond, to an
examination of when police should draw their guns.
</P>
<P>
   These entreaties have not all produced the desired results: 11
Brooklyn clergy members walked out of a meeting arranged by Safir
on Thursday, including the Haitian priest who officiated at
Dorismond's funeral Saturday, which ended in a violent clash with
the police.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were disappointed that Safir would not apologize
directly for the shooting, and left just as Giuliani was arriving
at One Police Plaza to join the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the rejection, the mayor reacted in an unusually
conciliatory manner, telling reporters at an impromptu news
conference at Police Headquarters that he was still prepared to
meet with the religious leaders. In departing from what sometimes
seems like a scripted, standard defense of the police, Giuliani
acknowledged room for change within the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``No institution is perfect,'' the mayor said. The Police
Department ``is a lot better here than in most places in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we can't improve,'' Giuliani said. ``It
doesn't mean we can't get better. It doesn't mean we can't do
things better.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of Giuliani's remarks shifted subtly, almost
imperceptibly, beginning Sunday, when the mayor for the first time
publicly said Dorismond's parents deserved condolences. It was 10
days after Dorismond had been shot to death. .
</P>
<P>
   By midweek, he acknowledged that the law was not entirely clear
regarding his decision to reveal Dorismond's record, including a
sealed juvenile record that Giuliani had disclosed earlier, saying
privacy rights did not extend beyond death.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the mayor's close advisers said the change in
Giuliani's public demeanor, and the steps he and Safir had taken to
ease tensions, were intentional. The shift followed criticism from
nearly all corners of the city and state, from people concerned
that the mayor's persistent attacks on Dorismond had gone too far
and merely served to exacerbate racial tension in the city.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the mayor has even dropped his repeated
references to the Rev. Al Sharpton and other persistent critics of
the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   A senior City Hall aide said that if the mayor's volume dial had
been set on ``10'' last week, it dropped to ``7'' by the end of
last weekend and was still on its way down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less of a smell of burning cordite in the city, and
everybody is on the way to calming down a bit,'' said Raymond B.
Harding, who is a close political adviser to the mayor and is the
leader of the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Safir has played a central role in the mayor's campaign to cool
tempers. The police commissioner agreed this week to allow clergy
members from the Bronx to attend police roll calls to let the
officers hear their concerns. On Wednesday, Safir gave an interview
on WLIB, a radio station with a largely black audience where
callers often criticize Giuliani. And both Safir and the mayor this
week backed a review of police department policies regarding when
it is appropriate for an officer to pull out a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was shot March 16 outside the Wakamba Lounge, a few
blocks south of the Times Square area, during a failed drug sting.
He and an undercover officer got into an altercation and a
detective coming to officer's assistance drew his gun, which the
police have said fired accidentally after he became involved in the
scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Thursday's evening meeting with clergy members,
Safir commented Thursday that he realized tensions between the
Haitians, other minority groups and the Police Department are in
part tied up with race, a comment that brought immediate praise by
longtime critics of the police, such as Manhattan Borough President
C. Virginia Fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around the country, the complaints that we hear in
New York city are the same complaints that you hear in Louisville,
Los Angeles and Miami and in lots of other cities,'' Safir said.
``And lets face it, we are all honest. This is about race.
Something we all have to face and something we all have to talk to
each other about.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift in tone by the mayor came following polls that showed
his eroding support in his bid for the United States Senate, in
part because of his repeated attacks on Dorismond. Giuliani's aides
said Thursday that many of the mayor's advisers had been calling on
him in recent weeks to tone down his rhetoric and perhaps even give
a forthright public address on community police relations in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   But other advisers noted that if he offered a direct apology to
Dorismond's family it would be characterized as a capitulation by
the mayor to his critics. So Giuliani has decided to respond in his
own way, modifying the tone and content of his language, while
still defending his earlier actions and statements.
</P>
<P>
   Following Thursday's meeting with the clergy, which Giuliani
tried to join just as they were walking out, the mayor said he is
ready to try to resolve differences between minority communities
and the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the meeting in good faith, and I assume in good
faith,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The religious leaders made it clear that they believed an
immediate apology was welcome, but they were clear that the are
open to future talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of our negotiations hinges on his acceptable
of an apology to mark a new beginning,''said Monsignor Guy Sansari
of St. Jerome Church in Flatbush ``We said we would be happy to
meet with him again when the apology comes.''

ON THE WHEELS OF THEIR DREAM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., N.J.)   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   From a remote campground in southern New Mexico, Jim and Kendra
Golden are talking to me via cell phone about their nomadic life.
Their motor home is now their only home. All 32 feet of it.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the Goldens, both 52, left their jobs in New Jersey
_ he was an electrical engineer, she a lawyer _ and sold their more
conventional house in Bergen County. They took to the open road,
looking for less stress, for new careers with rewards beyond money
and for a new home. They hope to make a decision, at least about
where to live, in August. One option, they say, is to stay on the
road indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's story will soon be told on an interesting Web site,
www.2young2retire.com, along with a score of others about people
who, instead of accepting traditional retirement, have made
transitions to new and what they consider more interesting careers
and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   These are people who continue to work, but on their own terms.
They range from a sales representative who became an alpaca rancher
to a salesman who fulfilled his dream of becoming a drama coach.
</P>
<P>
   The noncommercial site, which started in 1998 and gets as many
as 2,000 hits a week, is run by Howard and Marika Stone of
Weehawken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is the Stones' equivalent of the Goldens'
Winnebago. Stone, 64, left a marketing career at a publisher, while
his wife, 58, is a former freelance business writer who now
teachers yoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired of the pace of business and all that business
travel, but the idea of retirement didn't really appeal to me,''
Stone told me. ``At the same time, I wanted to be involved in
something that would make a difference. I think the Web site has
turned out to be a help to people, because it tells stories that
relate to their changing concerns and aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also suggests a growing phenomenon that is not happy
news for American business. Faced with a very tight labor market
and an aging population, many companies are trying to hire or
retain older workers. Both Stone and Golden said their employers
wanted them to remain longer at their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But for more and more workers in their 50s and 60s _ their
children grown, their financial responsibilities diminished and
their 401(k) plans fattened by the stock market _ such corporate
overtures are easier to resist.
</P>
<P>
   For older workers who make the transition to new lives or
careers, two themes emerge: a desire to escape career stress and a
need to ``make a difference'' _ to do something positive for
society or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldens, for example, plan to spend time this summer working
on Habitat for Humanity projects in Washington State and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a way to live more simply in jobs that are
more rewarding, that bring value to society and ourselves,'' Golden
said. ``Our former jobs were mentally challenging, but we didn't
always have a good sense when we went to bed at night that we were
doing good for humanity or having a good life. For example, my job
as a partner in a law firm involved a lot of foreclosure work. That
was very stressful. Nobody's ever happy to see you coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden cherishes the freedom of his current life. ``What has
appealed to me has been not putting an automatic time limit on our
travel, to just travel until it feels right to settle down,'' he
said. ``This has been a refreshing experience. My back and neck
used to hurt from stress, but not any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, changing your lifestyle to encompass your passion
doesn't necessarily mean that you work less.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, Sands Belizzi, 55, and her husband, Paul,
45, formed the Alpaca Mining Co. and now tend a herd of 24 alpacas
on five acres in Grass Valley, Calif., 45 miles northeast of
Sacramento. She had been a sales representative in Orange County,
in Southern California, specializing in adventure travel, but she
grew tired of traveling; he had been a construction worker.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are helping to form a cooperative to sell alpaca fur
from ranches in their area.
</P>
<P>
   The couple often end a busy day by having a glass of wine in the
pasture, near the alpacas. ``We want them to become accustomed to
our presence so we can better handle them,'' Belizzi said. ``We
also enjoy their company. It's wonderful. My blood pressure has
gone down as the result of our experience here.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking from from administration policy on a
highly volatile issue, Vice President Al Gore said Thursday that
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and several family members should be
given permanent residency status in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement seemed to take some officials in the Clinton
administration by surprise, coming as it did in the midst of
negotiations between immigration officials, who want to return the
boy to his father in Cuba, and relatives who have been caring for
him in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the government agreed to extend until at least next
Tuesday the relatives' temporary custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Gore said he was supporting legislation
sponsored by Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Connie Mack, R-Fla., and
Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., that would allow Elian to stay in the
United States while his case is adjudicated in family court.
</P>
<P>
   If the court decided that he should be with his father, Elian
would return to Cuba. But when he reached adulthood, he could then
decide, Cuba willing, to return to the United States, where he
would resume permanent residency status. A step short of
citizenship, that status denies a person voting rights, the ability
to serve on a jury and in the military and access to certain
welfare benefits. It also makes him subject to deportation if he
commits a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, I have said that Elian Gonzalez's
case is at heart a custody matter,'' Gore said in the statement.
``It is a matter that should be decided by courts that have the
experience and expertise to resolve custody cases, with due
process, and based on Elian's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now appears that our immigration laws may not be broad
enough to allow for such an approach in Elian's case. That is why I
am urging Congress to immediately pass legislation that is being
sponsored by Senators Bob Graham and Bob Smith, which would grant
permanent resident status to Elian, his father, stepmother,
half-brother, grandmothers and grandfather, so that this case can
be adjudicated properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement marks his strongest breach yet with the
administration and comes as Cuban exiles and officials in Miami are
threatening massive protests if the administration sends the boy
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gore said his statement Thursday stemmed logically
from his earlier position that the matter should be treated as a
custody case.
</P>
<P>
   But it stunned several members of his own party, including those
within the administration, who said they could not fathom his
timing or his reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, it's unbelievable!'' one administration official
blurted out in a private conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vocal about her surprise was Rep. Maxine Waters,
a liberal California Democrat, who said that Gore's position was
making her reconsider her support for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was introduced by Graham, an oft-mentioned vice
presidential possibility for Gore, and Mack. Smith, who met with
the boy earlier, told reporters that Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, had indicated to them that the Senate might be
reluctant to support citizenship for Elian, as Graham and Smith had
proposed earlier, but that lawmakers might be amenable to this
proposal for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lott could not be reached for comment and there was no
indication of the prospects of such a bill or whether Lott would
allow it to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, a similar measure has been introduced by Rep.
Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the only other state with a significant
Cuban population. Menendez's bill would give permanent residency
status only to Elian, not to his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's statement, the most definitive he has made
in the four-month-old case, is certain to appeal to Florida's
800,000 Cuban-Americans, who could swing the electorate in November
in the nation's fourth-largest state.
</P>
<P>
   And it brings Gore into line with the position outlined in
January by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival for
the presidency, who said then that he supported citizenship for
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the vice president now supports legal residency for
Elian Gonzalez,'' Bush said Thursday. ``I wish he could convince
the rest of the administration of the wisdom of that approach. The
vice president is an influential member of this administration. I
hope he'll use his influence to encourage the president and the
attorney general to follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Waters said in an interview: ``I was totally blindsided. The
calculation doesn't make sense. If Gore did it because he's trying
to get the anti-Castro Cubans, first of all, they're not going to
vote for him anyway. These are Republicans. And number two, the
last polls I saw a month ago showed the American public is on the
side of sending Elian back to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was surprised and disappointed that Gore had been
so definitive in his statement, and that she was considering not
participating in the presidential election. ``I do have somewhere
to go,'' she said. ``Nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, on the other hand, said that Gore had indicated all
along that he wanted the matter treated as a custody case and that
what was new was his support for permanent residency status. Graham
said in an interview that if the family court determined that Elian
should be with his father in Cuba _ and the prevailing presumption
in the United States is that a child generally belongs with a
natural parent _ he and the vice president would support returning
the boy to Cuba until he reached adulthood.

 &HT;    Field where Al-Amin's car found may be key
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Authorities in White Hall _ the tiny Alabama town
where Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin was arrested last week _ said the
vacant field where the suspected cop killer's black Mercedes-Benz
was discovered belongs to the mother of White Hall Mayor John
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The car, considered a key piece of evidence in the shooting
death of Fulton County Deputy Ricky Kinchen and the injuring of his
partner, Aldranon English, was found in the field Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The land, off of County Road 17 in White Hall, is ``in close
proximity to Jackson's house,'' said Lowndes County Sheriff Willie
Vaughner. Jackson and Al-Amin, a former Black Panther known as H.
Rap Brown, have been acquainted for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson would not confirm the land belongs to his mother
Thursday, saying ``I have given my statements to the Fulton County
District Attorney's Office. Ask them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the discovery of a Georgia license plate behind a
small cafe in White Hall earlier this week may lead federal agents
back to friends of Al-Amin's who live in the Islamic community in
the town, Vaughner said. The license plate was originally attached
to the Mercedes. The car, according to Atlanta police, is
registered to Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe _ called the Bismillah Cafe _ and the field where the
car was uncovered, are about a mile apart, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   The friends _ two men and two women _ were detained March 20
just before Al-Amin was arrested in a wooded area in the town. FBI
Special Agent Bill Imfeld said the friends were stopped and held
overnight after a tipster told federal authorities they were seen
in a black Cadillac Seville near the spot where Al-Amin reportedly
had shot at U.S. marshal.
</P>
<P>
   The friends have denied seeing Al-Amin after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The four were held overnight at the Montgomery County Jail, but
were released the next day after police decided there was no
evidence showing they had harbored Al-Amin in White Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``These friends of his are somehow associated with the cafe, and
I'm sure they'll be questioned a second time, seeing that the
license tag was found behind the restaurant,'' Vaughner said
Thursday. ``Then the Mercedes was found close by.''
</P>
<P>
   Extradition proceedings for Al-Amin could began as early as
today before Judge Lynn Bright in Montgomery District Court, where
indictment charges would be explained to him. Then his case would
move to Circuit Judge Charles Price's courtroom, where the actual
extradition hearing would occur. No date has been scheduled with
Price.
</P>
<P>
   As Al-Amin awaits extradition, the painstaking forensic
examination of his 1978 Mercedes may take several days. The results
could provide further evidence linking Al-Amin to the killing of a
Fulton County deputy, and perhaps provide evidence of a motive for
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said there are bullet holes in the car. The first
priority will be to recover as many of the bullets that made them
as possible. The bullets will be compared to test samples fired
from the guns of Kinchen and English. If they match, then the
Mercedes was at the murder scene and one more major piece of
evidence is added to the state's case against Al-Amin.

TORNADO DAMAGE MAY HIT $450 million 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER AUTREY 
and GINGER D. RICHARDSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Damage estimates from the storms that roared
through Fort Worth and south Arlington on Tuesday could soar as
high as $450 million, insurance adjusters said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Fire Department ended its ground search for
Adele Warren, 62, whose car was washed away as she left Bell
Helicopter Textron at the height of the storm. The body of Warren's
grandson, Ashlyn B. Dickens, 24, was found Wednesday morning in a
creek bed.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department spokesman Kent Worley said firefighters will fly
over the creek area Friday in helicopters provided by Bell, where
Warren had worked for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Warren was among five people killed by the storms, which spawned
two tornadoes about 30 minutes apart. Dozens suffered minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Spence, 67, and Howard D. Thornton, 52, were crushed to
death on the outskirts of downtown. Juan C. Oseguera, 19, died
Wednesday from severe head injuries suffered when a softball-size
hailstone hit him in Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-block area of downtown Fort Worth remained impassable
Thursday as workers cleared broken glass from Bank One and other
damaged high-rise buildings, and neighborhoods west of the city
center looked like a wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Shards of glass rained from the tops of skyscrapers onto
deserted streets, and crews worked to remove uprooted trees and
overturned cars from the Linwood, Rivercrest and Monticello
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Fire Chief Larry McMillen said most of downtown will
probably remain closed through the weekend. He said that eight
commercial buildings west of downtown are destroyed and that the
Cash America International building will probably have to be razed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a massive cleanup operation under way,'' said Hugo
Malanga, director of transportation and public works for Fort
Worth. ``We're hoping that we can get the major debris cleared by
the end of the day today or early tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials are expected to continue strictly enforcing the
no-access zone Friday. Thursday, they began requiring property
owners and contractors to obtain passes for access to restricted
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The permits are available on the south end of City Hall and will
be issued only to those who provide a driver's license and/or
company identification, point of destination and their reason for
needing access to the damaged areas, city spokesman Pat Svacina
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stress that this is not for the regular workers,''
he said. ``This is not for the rank-and-file people who work
downtown. They will not be allowed into the restricted areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County has not been declared a disaster area by the
federal government, and Federal Emergency Management Agency workers
are expected to arrive sometime next week after paperwork is
completed, officials said. Gov. George W. Bush's office declared
the county a disaster area Wednesday at the request of County Judge
Tom Vandergriff.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth officials estimate local commercial damage alone at
$154 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington Mayor Elzie Odom said city staffers are having trouble
breaking out damage estimates for Arlington, because most official
agencies are seeking countywide figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a wild estimate that may or may not be close to
accurate,'' Odom said. ``They are telling me that just Arlington
may be about $28 million. But I'm reluctant to throw any number out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 Arlington homes sustained major damage, and 1,000
received light to moderate damage. Thirty-three businesses were
damaged, including Lear Corp., Buz Post Auto Body Shop, a U.S. Post
Office, the Health and Human Services Center and Bell Helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In east Fort Worth on Thursday, firefighters, including members
of the department's dive team, combed a 2 1/2 mile stretch of creek
in a fruitless search for Warren. They were aided by volunteers,
search dogs and the Fort Worth police Mounted Patrol unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered everything we could the best way we could,'' Worley
said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who survived the storm, Thursday was a day of waiting
for insurance adjusters and city cleanup crews.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and Fort Worth city workers descended into the
heavily damaged Linwood and Monticello neighborhoods, armed with
water, axes, shovels and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents were outside, picking up trash from front lawns
and trying to patch windows with plastic, bedsheets and chunks of
plywood. As people worked in the chilly afternoon air, they
occasionally yelled to one another about their tornado experiences
or offered help.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Alvarado was driving home in his van when he saw the funnel
cloud barreling toward him from the west.
</P>
<P>
   He tore down Merrimac Street in Linwood to reach his home at 409
Foch St. and ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed and prayed,'' said Alvardo, who described himself as
a born-again Christian. ``This makes you believe in Christ real
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are asking that sightseers avoid the area, saying the
extra traffic is hindering cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup scene was similar in south Arlington for residents
along the Embercrest Drive and Chasemore Lane, among the
hardest-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
   Although much activity surrounded what remained of the homes _
workers nailing boards or cleanup crews dragging debris to the
street _ life appeared to be stalled for many residents as they
stood around waiting for the most popular person in town: the
insurance adjuster.
</P>
<P>
   They called out to passers-by: ``Are you an insurance adjuster?
Have you seen one for Allstate? Have you seen one for State Farm?''
Spray paint on makeshift signs or garage doors spelled out the
names of insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Chibli, 44, who lived at 4702 Osage Court until the
twister grabbed most of his roof, said he is frustrated that he
hasn't seen an adjuster sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're busy. Everybody is having the same problem,''
Chibli said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials also grew increasingly concerned Thursday about
scam artists, and warned residents not to pay contractors until
work is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want fly-by-night crews coming in and taking people's
money,'' Fort Worth Police Chief Ralph Mendoza said. ``Please only
deal with reputable businesses, and don't give anyone money
beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate offers of help have begun flooding in.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County College and the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce
are offering temporary office space to businesses displaced by the
storms. Lowe's, Home Depot, Payless Cashways and several other home
improvement stores are donating plywood.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take days for the city to regain some semblance
of normalcy, and months or longer before the damage is no longer
visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmetically, we will be impacted for a while,'' Fort Worth
Mayor Kenneth Barr said. ``The downtown buildings will have plywood
on them for at least five or six months.''

FLORIDA CONSIDERS BILL TO BLUNT FINANCIAL THREAT TO CIGARETTE
COMPANIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   State lawmakers in Florida may soon take up legislation intended
to reduce the financial threat to cigarette makers in a high-stakes
tobacco case that is reaching a critical phase in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Florida lawmakers, the state attorney general,
Robert A. Butterworth, offered model legislation this week that
would delay the awarding of punitive damages in any Florida lawsuit
until all compensatory damages in the action were resolved. Doing
so in the Miami case could delay a punitive judgment for years,
since compensatory damages must be considered individually and
hundreds of thousands of people are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Florida lawmakers said in interviews Thursday that it was
uncertain whether the legislation drafted by Butterworth would be
offered. But the proposal, first reported in The Los Angeles Times
Thursday, is clearly intended to affect the large class-action case
in Miami that was brought against the tobacco industry on behalf of
all Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, a six-person panel will soon decide whether the
ills of three representative smokers were caused by cigarettes. If
the jury makes such a finding regarding any one of those smokers,
it would then award punitive damages, or those meant to punish a
company, for the entire class. Though its size is unknown, the case
is estimated to cover 300,000 to 500,000 current or former smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Miami jury held that the industry had conspired
to hide the dangers of its products, setting the stage for a likely
punitive damage award.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that an award could reach tens of billions of
dollars and might lead some producers to seek bankruptcy
protection. Such a move would imperil producer payments under
recent settlements reached with states worth $246 billion over the
next two decades. Florida's share of that money is $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a number of interests, including cigarette
makers, have lobbied state lawmakers for legislation to blunt the
financial impact of the Miami case, several people involved in
those efforts said. Other groups expressing concern about the case
include financial institutions seeking to sell bonds backed by
Florida's settlement funds, those people said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Butterworth said the attorney general was
traveling and unavailable for comment. But in his letter to
lawmakers, Butterworth noted that his proposal would only codify
prevailing court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Florida lawmakers said in interviews Thursday that they were
concerned that a huge award in the Miami lawsuit might stop the
flow of settlement payments to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they expected that some legislation affecting
the Miami case could emerge next week, but they questioned whether
it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Rosenblatt, the chief lawyer in the class-action
lawsuit, is barred by a court order from discussing it.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Montgomery, a lawyer in Palm Beach who said that he
had consulted with Rosenblatt on the case, said that Florida law
barred the awarding of punitive damages so high that they would
force a company into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of any legislation that might blunt the effects of
the anticipated punitive damage award in the Florida case sent
tobacco stocks up sharply on Wall Street Thursday.

RENO SAYS GOVERNMENT SET TO INTERVENE; FATHER PREPARES TRIP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the father of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez took
concrete steps toward traveling to the United States to retrieve
his son, Attorney General Janet Reno insisted the US government
would be prepared to intervene if the child's current guardians
refuse to let him go.
</P>
<P>
   Peacefully extricating the boy from his Miami relatives, who
took custody of him after his arrival on US soil four months ago,
remains a tricky prospect. Even if a court orders Elian's return to
his father, as is expected, it would be politically disastrous for
the Justice Department to intervene using force, especially given
the heightened tensions surrounding his case in his newfound Miami
home.
</P>
<P>
   In part to head off such a scenario, Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, applied for a US visa Thursday, said his attorney,
Gregory B. Craig. Officials hope Gonzalez's arrival might offer a
peaceful venue for his reunion with the boy, who has become a
symbol of the hostilities between Cuba and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the wrangling with Elian's Miami relatives
will be on hold. After a second day of negotiations, federal
officials Thursday said they will wait until Tuesday before taking
any action to remove the boy from his current home.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of the continued standoff, Craig said
Elian's father was ready to fly to this country to see his son ``at
a moment's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The relatives in Miami do not speak for Elian. The lawyers in
Miami do not speak for Elian,'' said Craig, who was a
foreign-policy adviser to Senator Edward M. Kennedy and represented
President Clinton during his Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person who has the legal and moral authority to speak
for Elian is his father,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Reno, when asked whether the federal government was prepared
to enforce the law if the boy's relatives did not agree to cede
that power to his father, said: ``You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, which began last November when Elian survived a
treacherous boat ride from Cuba that killed his mother and 10
others, was thrust back into the spotlight last week as a federal
judge in Florida upheld a ruling by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service that the boy must be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Justice Department has tried to coordinate a
plan to retrieve the boy, in preparation for a final legal ruling
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   By working out a deal with Elian's relatives ahead of time, Reno
hopes to preempt any violent outbreaks in Miami, if an appeals
court again rules Elian must go home.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans in the Miami community have indicated they would go to
great lengths to keep Elian, regardless of what the court decides,
and local law enforcement agents have essentially backed them up.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, under no circumstances would Justice Department
officials, still under fire for their handling of sieges at Waco
and Ruby Ridge, want to send armed forces to retrieve Elian and
send him home, several legal specialists and members of Congress
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they just decide to go there to the house, they are going
to face thousands upon thousands of Cubans,'' said Representative
J. Joseph Moakley, Democrat of South Boston, who has been in
contact with Elian's grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Immigration and the Justice departments have got to plan
this out. We can't have another Waco situation where people are
going to get killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of Worcester, said
the Justice Department is in ``a very tricky spot. That's why
they're giving the family every possible option to be cooperative
and to do what's in the best interest of the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Reno, despite her insistence that the government would
carry out the full extent of the law, said she hoped Elian's
father's arrival in the United States would remove the need for
further government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   During an unusually personal news conference, Reno made it clear
she had been touched by the case, which has played out in the South
Florida region where Reno once lived and worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a community I was born in, raised in. It's a community I
love. And when it's hurting, it hurts me,'' she said. But Reno
declined to give credence to the perspective of the Cuban
protesters in Miami, who view returning Elian to the regime of
Fidel Castro as political heresy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been heartbreaking for everyone involved, but we
believe that the law is clear,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father must speak for the little boy, because the sacred
bond between parent and child must be recognized and honored, and
Elian should be reunited with his father,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials Thursday reiterated their promise to
expedite that process, speeding up the visa application for Elian's
father. Cuban officials also released a list of nearly three dozen
others hoping to come along for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the father's attorney said he had thus far submitted visa
applications only for family members, including Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's current wife, their 4-year-old son, and a favorite
cousin of Elian's.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have received assurances that Juan Miguel will be able
to take custody of his son, we will also be seeking permission for
a support group of Elian's classmates, teachers, and doctors to
come to the United States to help smooth the transition,'' Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the spotlight in the drama shifted to Washington, tensions in
Miami relaxed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   A second day of talks between Immigration and Naturalization
officials and lawyers for Elian's relatives in downtown Miami ended
without an agreement after about eight hours, with plans to resume
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that pending the results of the next round
of negotiations, it would extend the deadline for taking action on
Elian. The deadline, which already had been extended to this
morning, now is set for 9 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement gave all sides some breathing room. But the
anxiety in Miami, and within the area's Cuban-exile population in
particular, clearly remains because of the sense that the federal
government is going to try soon _ one way or another _ to return
the youngster to his father.'
</P>
<P>
   And that is something Cuban-American activists said they will
try mightily to prevent, no matter what agreement might be reached
at the INS offices in Miami or by the State Department in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're getting ready for the worst,'' said Ileana
Bosche, one of hundreds of Cuban-Americans who shuttled into the
crowd outside the house where Elian lives with the family of his
great uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rodriguez, another of the protesters, added: ``God
willing, we won't need to have any civil disobedience or anything
like that, but we will do what we need to do . . . and it looks
like we'll have to do something.''

ARMY'S HIGHEST-RANKING WOMAN ACCUSES FELLOW GENERAL OF SEXUAL
HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Texas, Ariz.)   (ADDS 2 grafs on generals receiving promotions at start of 2nd
take.) 
 (rk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army's highest-ranking woman, Lt. Gen. Claudia
Kennedy, whose career is often cited as an example of the expanding
opportunities for women in uniform, has filed a sexual harassment
complaint against another Army general, accusing him of groping her
in her office in 1996, Pentagon and government officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy complained informally to her superiors when the incident
allegedly occurred in 1996 and then filed a formal harassment
complaint late last year, when the other officer received a
prominent new assignment, according two officials familiar with the
case. In 1996, both officers held the lesser rank of major general,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's accusation threatens to become a huge new
embarrassment for the Army, which, like the other armed services,
has been roiled in recent years by sexual scandals, charges of
harassment and accusations of double standards when the accused is
a senior officer.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have in recent years sought to portray the
overwhelmingly male-dominated military as more open than ever to
women, even at the highest ranks. For a woman as senior as Kennedy
to have filed a complaint of harassment against another senior
officer seriously undercuts the impression they hoped to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a zero tolerance for harassment,'' the Pentagon's
spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Thursday during a news conference in
which he refused to identify the accused general and repeatedly
sidestepped questions about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy filed her complaint, the Army's inspector
general's office began an investigation and has since interviewed
several people who were involved or were familiar with the
circumstances, officials said. Because of the ranks of those
involved, the Department of Defense's inspector general is
overseeing the Army's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are continuing their work and have not yet reached
a conclusion on the merits of the accusation, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Army and Pentagon officials cited the privacy rights of the
accused general in declining to identify him. The Army declined to
discuss the case publicly at all, refusing to either confirm or
General Kennedy's complaint, which was first reported Thursday in
The Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't comment on the existence of investigations,'' said
Col. Edwin Veiga, an Army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is one of only three women in the military who now serve
as three-star officers. The others are Vice Adm. Patricia Tracey of
the Navy, who serves as deputy assistant secretary of defense for
personnel, and Lt. Gen. Leslie Kenne, commander of the Air Force's
Electronic System Center at Hanscom Air Force Base in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 52, has served as the Army's deputy chief of staff for
intelligence since her promotion to lieutenant general in May 1997.
She was the first woman to reach that rank in the Army. She
recently announced that she intends to retire later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kennedy served at the Pentagon as the Army's assistant
deputy chief of staff for intelligence. After the incident now in
question, she chose to handle the matter internally, reporting it
to her superiors in the Army staff, according to one official
familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Kennedy was satisfied with the results at the time.
It was only when the officer's name came up for a prominent
assignment last year, the official said, that she filed a complaint
with the Army's inspector general's office, which is supposed to
operate independently of the Army's chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by The New York Times for comment, Kennedy declined to
discuss her accusation.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews after her promotion to lieutenant general,
however, she said that she had experienced sexual harassment in her
career. In an interview with ABC in June 1997, she said she had
dealt with an incident earlier in her career ``individually'' and
then alluded to what appeared to be this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important thing about it was that early in my
career, what I did was I dealt with it individually,'' she said.
``And later in my career, in fact in the last _ just in the last _
within the last 10 years, my approach was to turn it over to my
boss. And I was very impressed with the way it was handled. In
other words, it was investigated carefully, and there was a very
positive response on the part of the Army. ``Anytime someone is
sexually harassed, it is a very serious matter,'' she continued.
``When we think about sexual harassment, sometimes we're distracted
by the word `sexual,' and we think that this is a matter of very
aggressive courting or dating or flirting. It has nothing to do
with the interactions between men and women that are of mutual
interest. This has everything to do with nonmutual activity.''

</P>
<P>
   Civilian lawyers who specialize in military justice said
Thursday that they did not know the identity of the offi- cer
accused by Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four months of 1999, around the time she filed her
formal complaint, 11 Army major generals were promoted to
lieutenant general and given prominent new assign- ments, Army
records show. But it was not clear whether the accused general was
among them or whether Kennedy filed her complaint after the officer
received a change in assignment but not a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy joined the Army in 1969 after receiving a bachelor's
degree in philosophy from what is now known as Rhodes College in
Tennessee. At the time of her induction, the Army had a separate
Women's Corps and opportunities for women were relatively limited.
</P>
<P>
   She rose through the ranks as a military intelligence officer,
one of the few elite career paths then open to women. She
eventually became commander of two military intelligence
battalions, in Germany and Hawaii, as well as commander of the San
Antonio Recruiting Battalion at Fort Sam Houston in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After being promoted to brigadier general in 1993, she held
staff positions in the intelligence field, serving for a time as
assistant commandant of the Army's Intelligence School at Fort
Huachuca, Az.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has been buffeted by controversies over sexual
behavior, including highly publicized rape and assault cases at the
Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland beginning in 1996 and
the sexual assault trial in 1997 of its senior enlisted man, Sgt.
Maj. Gene McKinney, who was acquitted at a court martial of all
charges except one of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the Army has twice demoted generals for having
adulterous affairs. Maj. Gen. John Maher 3rd was stripped of two
ranks and forced to retire last November after having affairs with
two subordinate officers' wives and ``an improper personnel
relationship'' with an enlisted soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. David R.E. Hale, was demoted one rank and fined after
pleading guilty to eight counts of misconduct stemming from affairs
he had with the wives of four subordinate officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Army had allowed Hale to retire quietly even though a
complaint about his behavior had been filed with the inspector
general's office. Once the accusations became public, the Army
called him out of retirement to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for expanding the role of women in the military said
Kennedy's complaint suggested the military still had far to go to
root out harassment and bias.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy ``broke the glass ceiling but still was not immune from
sexual harassment,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. ``It took
courage to come forward and file a complaint knowing her own
reputation would be the first on the line.''

BRAZILIAN REGULATORS APPROVE MERGER OF 2 BIG BREWERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ga., the Netherlands, Mexico, Portugal)   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Antitrust regulators approved the $7 billion
merger of the two biggest beverage companies in Brazil Thursday,
creating the world's third-largest brewer.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Companhia Cervejaria Brahmas and Companhia
Antarctica Paulista into a company called Companhia de Bebidas das
Americas, or AmBev, was first announced last year, and came after
months of government scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the deal sent a powerful message about the potential
for other big mergers in Brazil. It represented a setback to
smaller beverage producers, who fear that AmBev could crush
competition in Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy.
</P>
<P>
   AmBev will control nearly 70 percent of Brazil's beer market,
where its Brahma, Skol and Antarctica brands are leading sellers
among the combined company's 18 beer labels. Ambev also will
control a quarter of the soft drinks industry with a product lineup
that includes 37 soft drinks and seven brands of water. Worldwide,
only Anheuser-Busch Cos. of the United States and Heineken NV of
The Netherlands are larger.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is the third-largest market worldwide for Coca-Cola after
the United States and Mexico. Coke controls about half of Brazil's
soft drinks market, in addition to owning a minority stake in
Cervejarias Kaiser, the country's third-largest brewer.
</P>
<P>
   While Kaiser and other critics had complained that the approval
of AmBev could give the company the ability to dictate beverage
prices within Brazil, the majority of regulators apparently viewed
the merger as consistent with a goal of the government's broader
economic policy _ encouraging the formation of large companies
capable of competing in markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   One of AmBev's goals is to capture 1 percent of the global soft
drinks market by exporting a beverage made with guarana, an
Amazonian berry, in a venture with PepsiCo. The company also hopes
to strengthen its presence in Latin American countries where Brahma
is already sold.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in Brazil's domestic beverage market, the federal
antitrust agency's approval of the merger was greeted with
surprise, even though several conditions were attached, like the
sale of several manufacturing facilities and one beer brand,
Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a strict antitrust standpoint I thought that any merger
resulting in 70 percent market share would have trouble getting
approved,'' said John Ferencz McNaughton, a lawyer specializing in
antitrust policy at Noronha Advogados, Brazil's largest law firm.
``At the very least, the expectations were for stronger
restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible beneficiary from the approval may be Cintra, a
Portuguese brewer that is reportedly considering the purchase of
some of AmBev's factories.
</P>
<P>
   Other beverage concerns were critical.Kaiser, AmBev's main
competitor, said it is seeking a way to appeal. ``The ruling is
full of holes,'' said Humberto Pandolpho, Kaiser's president. ``It
is an insult to the Brazilian consumer.''

   ``I would support that position and I think the vice president
would,'' Graham said. ``And the overwhelming number of people in
Miami, including in the Cuban community, would support such a
determination if they thought it was made by an appropriate
judicial body.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who said the Senate has taken the first steps toward
petitioning the majority to bring his bill to the floor, added:
``The purpose of this legislation is to try to be a channel to move
this case from an INS asylum case to a family court.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was the purpose behind Gore's statement Thursday, his
aides said. ``This was the only way to vindicate the principle,
that this should be decided in a court that deals with custody
cases,'' a top adviser said. Contrary to some suggestions, he
added, Gore's action may have the effect of calming the people of
Miami rather than stirring them up.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore said in his statement: ``Let us be clear that the real
fault in this case lies with the oppressive regime of Fidel Castro.
Elian should never have been forced to choose between freedom and
his own father. Now we must take action, here on our own shores, to
make sure that Elian's best interests are served.''
</P>
<P>
   But he definitely stirred up Washington, including some on his
own staff. ``This was not something that was discussed, chewed over
and thought out for a long time or that huge numbers of people were
consulted on,'' an adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Jake Siewert, a spokesman for Clinton, said
that Gore had alerted Clinton in advance and that the president was
not upset. ``We knew there would be times when he differed with the
president,'' Siewert said. ``This is one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said: ``We've stated in the past we don't
believe congressional action is appropriate in this situation.
There is a father who speaks for his son and has made it very clear
that he wants to be reunited with him as soon as possible, and that
is what we are trying to do. The INS has received no credible
information that any of these family members wants to stay in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore, said the vice president
``clearly disagrees with the INS and the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's break with the administration is the most
dramatic of his campaign to date. Back in November, as Gore
struggled to assert his independence from the president and become
his own man, he told reporters: ``Running for president of this
country is far more important than being the best vice president I
can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has differed from administration policy in a
number of areas. He said he would require his appointees to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to support allowing gays to serve openly in
the military. He said he supported the use of marijuana for
medicinal purposes. And he has opposed a Clinton nominee to the
Federal Election Commission because that nominee, Bradley Smith,
opposes changing the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these matters has been a matter of national urgency,
as Elian's case has become.

young women now take the advances she engendered in the obstetrical

   (NYT22) UNION CITY, N.J. -- March 30, 2000 -- NJ-SENATE-CORZINE
-- Many in New Jersey are basing their first impression of John
Corzine not on his record as an investment banker but on joking
slurs against Italian Americans, the state's largest ethnic group.

LEGAL PROCESS ON ELIAN NEARS END, THOUGH COMPLICATED BY POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (with CUBAN-BOY and CUBAN-BOY-GORE)  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER and ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Ultimately, the question here is a legal
question,'' said Doris M. Meissner, the nation's top immigration
officer, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Would that it were so simple.
</P>
<P>
   Federal court case No. 11424-D, Elian Gonzalez vs. Janet Reno,
is no ordinary immigration matter, no ordinary child custody fight.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the 6-year-old Cuban boy rescued at sea four months
ago while his mother perished has undergone a slow-motion
transformation from a wrenching family drama into a legal,
diplomatic and political showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which now features Vice President Al Gore's taking a
position at variance with that of the rest of the Clinton
administration, marks the coming together of three interwoven
strands linking the tormented history of relations between the
United States and Fidel Castro's Cuba: the political clout of
Cuban-Americans in South Florida and longstanding immigration and
family law.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several weeks, the administration's position has
hardened, reflecting its interpretation of immigration law and its
desire to resolve the matter quickly to avoid lasting political
damage to President Clinton and Gore. The administration is
supported by many experts in immigration and family law, who say
that without the political and diplomatic overtones of the case it
would have been resolved long ago in favor of the boy's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are adamant and virtually unanimous in
the belief that longstanding immigration policy should be observed
in this case. Bending the rules to allow Elian to remain in this
country when he has a competent father abroad, they say, would set
a dangerous precedent that could affect hundreds of Americans with
children held abroad by estranged spouses or other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been almost no debate about this case at any
agency,'' said a senior officer of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. ``If you are an American parent and your
child is taken to a foreign country and they think their way of
life is better than ours and make him or her a citizen of that
country to prevent his repatriation, that would be in the mind of
any parent an absolutely unacceptable position.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in the administration had advocated anything close to
that position, this official asserted, until Gore on Thursday urged
that Congress adopt legislation that would allow Elian to stay in
the United States, apparently concerned that supporting the
administration's desire to return him to Cuba promptly could cost
the Gore presidential campaign Cuban-American votes in Florida and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Despite agreement on the law and the desired outcome of the case
within the administration as a whole, there has been mounting
frustration at the White House and the State Department that the
Justice Department and immigration authorities have moved too
slowly in the case and have shown too much deference to Elian's
relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials also expressed concern Thursday that
Justice and the immigration agency did not have a strategy for a
final resolution to the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also inflamed Cuban-American tensions that have
become over the years more like a bitter intra-family squabble than
a dispute between nations with differing political systems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has offered a number of minor economic and political
openings to Havana and is trying to handle this case in a way that
balances that effort with desire not to alienate Cuban-American
voters. With some 800,000 Cuban-Americans living in Florida, many
separated from relatives in Cuba, any question of relations between
the two countries quickly becomes a matter of partisan passion that
politicians seek to exploit for electoral advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans earlier this year proposed legislation to make Elian
and his Cuban relatives citizens of the United States to allow
their reunification and protect them from a deportation order. But
the Republicans abandoned the effort after many of their allies,
including the conservative Family Research Council, warned that
such a policy could encourage other countries to countenance the
kidnapping of American children.
</P>
<P>
   A new effort, endorsed by Gore on Thursday, was undertaken this
week by two Republican senators, Connie Mack of Florida and Robert
C. Smith of New Hampshire, and one Democrat, Bob Graham of Florida,
to grant Elian and his Cuban relatives permanent-residency status.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The senators accused the Justice Department of running roughshod
over the rights of the boy's relatives in Miami and called on
Clinton to suspend all deportation proceedings until the matter is
resolved in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   With Castro's surprise announcement on Wednesday that Elian's
father would travel to the United States to be reunited with him,
and Gore's surprise announcement that he favored granting the boy
and his family permanent-resident status, the battle is now
entering its endgame. As it does, it threatens to move from
courtroom and conference room to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans in Miami appear prepared to forcibly block any
effort to remove Elian from the home of relatives to be reunited
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said on NBC's ``Today'' program Thursday morning that
Elian's father had a presumptive right to custody. She and other
U.S. officials, including Clinton, have pleaded with the boy's
relatives in Miami and the wider Cuban-American community to
respect the law and, if their appeal in the federal courts fails,
to allow the peaceable reunion of father and son.
</P>
<P>
   But so much emotion has accrued to this case that a simple legal
resolution to the matter seems a distant dream.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials cannot recall an immigration case that
has so transfixed the nation or opened such political wounds.
Attorney General Janet Reno, who has deep family roots in South
Florida, has told intimates that she is personally distraught at
the plight of the child and fearful of civil unrest if he is
deported.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said publicly Thursday that she had shown forbearance in
seeking the return of the child, even though she felt strongly that
what she called the ``sacred bond'' between father and child should
be honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not move hastily,'' she said at her weekly news
conference, answering critics in Florida who accuse her of
hard-heartedness, ``although nothing, no court order or anything,
prevented us from doing so. The relatives had their day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore have tried to navigate their way through the
intensifying dispute, stressing that it is, at root, a custody case
that should be decided in court with a presumption in favor of the
father.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Cuban relatives in Miami, other Cuban-Americans and
Republican politicians in Florida and Washington accuse the
administration of pursuing a cold-hearted policy that would deprive
Elian of the fruits of liberty in the United States. To these
exiles, Cuba under Castro is, by definition, an unfit place to rear
a child.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration and many experts on immigration
and custody law argue that this is a relatively simple case of an
unaccompanied minor who should be returned to his father under
American law and custom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question isn't why has the Clinton administration taken
such a hard line, it's why the Clinton administration has taken
such a soft line,'' said Jan Ting, a former assistant INS
commissioner for refugee affairs and now a professor of law at
Temple University. He said the president should send in federal
marshals to enforce the law, as President Dwight D. Eisenhower did
in Little Rock, Ark., and President John F. Kennedy did in
Mississippi and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current administration seems to lack the backbone of its
predecessors,'' Ting said, ``and has consistently caved in to
intimidation and threats of civil disorder.''

DRIVING A GREAT DEAL: DOT-COM FIRMS GIVE SCARCE DRIVERS A 
 HANDSOME PACKAGE TO DELIVER INTERNET GOODS TO E-CUSTOMERS 
 &HT;     BY JENNIE YABROFF
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Don't pity the poor Internet delivery driver who brings your
groceries on a rainy Friday night. He's probably well rewarded for
what he does, drawing a competitive salary, full benefits, a
signing bonus, yearly stipends and stock options.
<P>
   That's the hefty price a growing number of dot-com delivery
services are paying in an extremely tight labor market to deliver
their groceries, restaurant meals, videos and more on time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The demand for drivers is really high,'' said Gary Narducci
of EZ2Get, a restaurant delivery service that recently bought
Dine-One-One. ``We're having to constantly increase our pool as the
business grows, and it's a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   EZ2Get offers a $500 signing bonus to new employees and referral
bonuses to drivers who bring in new employees. The Dallas company
pays a base rate of $5 to $8 an hour for drivers, plus tips, and is
planning a stock option plan for all employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a (job) crunch right now, and gas prices aren't
helping,'' said Jerry Spence, a dispatcher for EZ2Get. ``It's a
great market to be in if you don't mind driving.'' EZ2Get employs
about 40 drivers for San Francisco, including students and others
who hold two jobs. Spence said some of EZ2Get's employees work two
shifts _ one for his company and another for one of its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   With more positions available than workers, drivers are jumping
from one company to another, looking for the best money and most
convenient schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Narducci said that although drivers leave to work for services
like Kozmo.com or Federal Express, some come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few competitors initially (hired) a lot of people and
offered a lot of money,'' he said. ``But the drivers would be
sitting around the warehouse with nothing to do, so (the companies)
had to scale back. It takes awhile to judge how many drivers you'll
need each night.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's Kozmo.com, a movie and grocery delivery service, was
mum about providing information because it is in a pre-IPO ``quiet
period.'' It would only say its hiring has been on target.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companies like EZ2Get have come to accept high
turnover rates as part of the cost of business.
</P>
<P>
   Other delivery services such as Foster City's Webvan concentrate
on attracting long-term employees. Starting drivers for the grocery
delivery service (which the company prefers to call couriers, or
customer service ambassadors) make $14 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Total compensation for a first-year employee at Webvan averages
more than $40,000, including bonuses, full medical coverage, a $400
stipend for a gym membership or exercise equipment, $1,500 tuition
reimbursement, stock option, and $2,000 toward a 401(k). Plus, the
lunches are free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in business over a year, and our initial 25
couriers are all still with us,'' said Bud Greby, director of
corporate affairs for Webvan. ``They have a lot of loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zaleski, who hires couriers for Webvan, said his company
hasn't had any problems hiring workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, where the unemployment rate is less than 2
percent, we've gotten 10,000 applications for our new operations.
So far, we've hired 200,'' he said. The ratio for the Bay Area
business is comparable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1 out of every 3 applicants makes it to the interview stage
at Webvan, and only 1 out of 10 is hired as a courier. Applicants
must have clean driving and criminal records and are screened for
drugs before they begin a two-week training period. The company
employs about 240 couriers for the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and drivers agree the key to attracting and keeping
employees is treating the company like an Internet business that
uses drivers, instead of like a traditional delivery service doing
business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies are quickly cutting a reputation for their
generous compensation packages, which usually include stock
options, as well as their nontraditional approaches to rewarding
and motivating workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kozmo has a real dot-com attitude,'' said driver Jennifer Leo,
who previously worked for Waiters on Wheels and now drives part
time for Kozmo.com to supplement her income.
</P>
<P>
   Leo said that she sees a lot more competition for drivers than a
few years ago and that the companies that will succeed are those
that offer lots of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make it a fun place to work _ on weekend nights (the
drivers) divide into teams and we have contest with prizes,'' she
said. ``Kozmo is paving the way for these kinds of companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to get in on the ground floor and grow with the
company also attracts employees. Randy Cervantes, who drove for
Federal Express for five years before becoming Webvan's first
courier, has been promoted three times since joining the company.
``I'm really happy to be here _ I make more money than I have in
any other delivery job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Webvan lets me have a say in things, is more open to my ideas
than other companies. If I come up with a way to improve the
process, they listen, and it might even lead to a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cervantes also said Webvan's computerized system of calculating
how long deliveries will take means a less stressful workday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Fed Ex, they didn't take into account how many packages you
had to deliver in your shift, so you had to do whatever you could
to get them all done,'' he said. ``Sometimes, it was really hard to
get it done. Webvan is better at taking into account the distance
between deliveries and the size of the orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express, which has lost drivers to Internet companies,
said it is still too early to gauge how big a threat they
represent. ``Everyone's looking to make a lot of quick cash right
now,'' said Tim Wertner, Federal Express managing director of
ground operations for the San Francisco area. ``We're staying
competitive while we see how many of the dot-coms are around in the
next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has responded to the current labor crunch by hiring
employees directly into courier positions, instead of starting them
in lower-paying jobs like package handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The starting wage for a Federal Express driver is $13.53 per
hour, which is comparable with most Internet delivery companies.
Employees receive full benefits, a pension plan and $2,000 to
$4,000 tuition remibursement for classes taken toward a college
degree. Although they aren't eligible for stock options, employees
do get the opportunity to fly free with delivery aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the chronic demand for drivers, delivery companies
depend on job fairs, employee references and Web sites.

   But desperate times call for desperate measures. Kozmo, for
instance, also targets college job boards and posts help wanted
signs in bike and scooter shops. (Kozmo drivers use a range of
transportation for deliveries.)

<P>
   Webvan goes so far as to hire customers and says it gets job
inquiries from people who have seen its vans.
</P>
<P>
   All delivery businesses, both high and low tech, share the same
tried-and-true method of attracting employees: classified
advertisements. ``If you want to compare companies, just look in
the classifieds under drivers,'' said EZ2Get's Narducci. ``You'll
see our ads, and the ads for all our competitors.''

NASDAQ AVERTS TRAGEDY 
 &HT;     BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
For much of Thursday's trading session, it looked as though the
Nasdaq Stock Market might be headed for a disaster of epic
proportions. But thanks to a powerful, late rally, the net result
turned out to be merely terrible.
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by exceedingly volatile
high-technology and biotech stocks, finished the day down 186.78
points _ or 4 percent _ at 4,457.89, its fifth-largest point drop
ever.
</P>
<P>
   It has shed 590 points, or nearly 12 percent, since topping out
at 5,048.62 only three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Market experts urged investors not to worry, insisting that a
correction _ and the heart-stopping volatility that goes with it _
was natural and overdue, considering how far the Nasdaq had risen.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak on March 10, it stood 24 percent above where it was
at the end of 1999 _ a rate of gain that in retrospect clearly was
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get extremely sharp upward moves like that, the
corrections are going to be sharp and nasty,'' said Alfred Goldman,
market strategist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``That's
just the way it works. The big picture is still bullish.''
</P>
<P>
   While Thursday's final tally _ the Nasdaq's third 100-plus point
drop in a row _ was bad enough, it pales by comparison with the
gore-on-the-floor carnage that prevailed up to the last half-hour
of trading.
</P>
<P>
   At that juncture, the Nasdaq index was down nearly 290 points,
or more than 6 percent _ far worse than the record 229.46-point
drop it suffered on January 4.
</P>
<P>
   Then, out of the blue, bargain hunters charged in and eagerly
grabbed up a host of Nasdaq stalwarts, sending the index rebounding
by more than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   In those final 30 minutes, JDS Uniphase vaulted more than $5 to
finish at $116.25 after being down more than $8. Qualcomm also
gained more than $5 to close at $145.23, after falling a staggering
$17. Intel rebounded $2.63 to finish at $127 _ a net loss of $4.88
on the day.
</P>
<P>
   The other major market indexes also finished down yesterday,
after enduring their own, wild fluctuations. But their net losses
were relatively modest.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 20.60 points, or 1.4
percent, to 1,487.92. At one point, it was down nearly 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which sported a 125-point gain
at midsession and a 102-point loss later on, wound up losing 38.47
points, or 0.3 percent, at 10,980.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some froth built into the market _ it got ahead of
itself,'' said Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells Capital
Management in San Francisco. ``Now there has been something of a
sobering-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schlossberg stressed that there doesn't appear to be a
``change in the fundamentals'' that sent the market to its peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have been rising, but not ``soaring,'' he noted.
``Economic growth is strong and bond yields are subdued, in part
because the inflation outlook is good.''

 INVESTORS WHO HELD ON TO VARIAN SHARES GET REWARDED 3 WAYS  &HT;    BY KATHLEEN PENDER
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate divorces usually work out better for shareholders than
corporate marriages, but few pay off like the breakup of Varian
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, in one of the more amazing transformations in
Silicon Valley history, the big old slug of a company split itself
into three little sexy ones.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the split, Varian was trading at $39. Today, shares
in the three companies combined total $146. That's a 274 percent
gain for investors who kept all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things took on a life of their own,'' says Tim Curro, a
New York hedge-fund manager, who bought Varian before the split.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1937, Varian was a Silicon Valley pioneer, but proved
better at inventing technologies than marketing them. ``The Peter
Principle started working very early at Varian,'' said Jim
McCamant, a longtime Bay Area stock analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Varian got into so many different businesses that no single
analyst could cover the company, so almost nobody did, and the
stock traded at a ``conglomerate discount.''
</P>
<P>
   After promising for years to break up the company, management
finally did on April 2, 1999. For each share of Varian Associates,
stockholders got one share in each of the spin-offs:
</P>
<P>
   Varian Medical Systems (VAR) kept the firm's hospital-equipment
business. Its stock went from an intial price of $18.31 to $44.50
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Varian Inc. (VARI), which makes high-end scientific instruments,
went from $9.19 a year ago to $41.75 yesterday. Like Varian
Medical, it remained headquartered in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates (VSEA), which moved to
Gloucester, Mass., soared from $11.06 to $60.06.
</P>
<P>
   The chip-equipment business was voted ``most popular'' by Wall
Street. And Varian Inc. sells to &UR;  &LR; some sizzling markets including
biotech, oil and gas and semicoductors.
</P>
<P>
   But several investors who have owned all three say Varian
Medical is the most interesting, not just for investors, but also
for cancer patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Varian Medical is still the most undervalued of three
companies,'' says Geoff Barth of Investors Group, a Canadian
mutual-fund company that is the biggest holder of Varian Medical
and Varian Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Varian Medical is the leading maker of radiation oncology
equipment, which is used as an alternative to surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Varian and its biggest competitor, a division of Germany's
Siemens AG, recently introduced a new system of hardware and
software that seems far more effective at killing certain localized
tumors, with fewer side effects, than current radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The technology uses a massive piece of equipment called a linear
accelerator, which speeds up electrons through a tube to create a
pencil-thin beam of radiation that is targeted at the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   With older equipment, the beam can be shaped only into a
rectangle or square. Since most tumors are oddly shaped, the beam
also zaps healthy tissue. ``That restricted the dosage of radiation
to what normal tissue could tolerate, and not what the tumor
needed,'' says Steven Leibel, chairman of radiation oncology at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   With the new system, called intensity modulated radiation
technology, or IMRT, the beam can be shaped to fit the tumor, so
doctors can deliver more radiation to the tumor and less to
surrounding tissue.
</P>
<P>
   IMRT uses a piece of equipment called a multileaf collimator
that attaches to the lens of the linear accelerator. The MLC has as
many as 120 tungsten fingers that move in and out to change the
shape of the beam.
</P>
<P>
   The MLC is controlled by sophisticated software the doctor uses
to plan, execute and monitor the treatment. As the linear
accelerator rotates 360 degress around the patient, the fingers
keeping moving in and out at varying speeds to modulate the shape
and intensity to different parts of the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Patients still have to come in every working day for six weeks
for treatment, although Varian CEO Dick Levy says that in the
future, doctors may be able to give higher doses in fewer days.
</P>
<P>
   Although &UR;  &LR; IMRT has been used mainly for prostate cancer, it also
is being tested with tumors in the head and neck, lung, breast and
brain.
</P>
<P>
   At Memorial Sloan Kettering, 1,100 prostate cancer patients have
been treated with IMRT. Leibel said the normal radiation dosage for
prostate cases using conventional treatment is 64 to 70 Gray (units
of absorbed radiation). With IMRT, his hospital has moved the
standard dose to 81 Gray and may raise it again to 86. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By bombarding the tumor with higher doses, researchers at MSK
saw a 71 percent improvement in tumor control while reducing the
rate of complications, mainly rectal bleeding, from 10 percent to 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was chemotherapy and you got the results we did, it
would be hailed as the greatest discovery in oncology,'' says
Leibel.
</P>
<P>
   MSK is even advertising its IMRT equipment in newspapers because
people have read about it on the Internet and want to find it, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, Varian systems are in use at Stanford
University Medical Center, UCSF and the Palo Alto Medical Clinic,
and they're going in at Marin General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens systems are in use at UCSF-Mt. Zion and are going in at
Alta Bates in Berkeley, Mt. Diablo in Concord, the Tri-Valley
Clinic in Hayward, and John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Foyles, marketing communications manager for Siemens
Oncology Care Systems in Concord, says there's not much difference
between Siemens and Varian machines, and neither company has a
patent on the core hardware. The main barriers to entry are their
huge market shares, which make it hard for newcomers to compete.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In conventional radiation equipment, Varian has about 70
percent of the U.S. market and Siemens has about 30 percent.
Worldwide, Varian has 50 percent and Siemens has 35 percent. Other
competitors include Elekta of Sweden and Mitsubishi, which operates
mainly in Asia and does not sell IMRT equipment.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Varian and Siemens each have about 25 IMRT systems in
operation, leaving plenty of room for expansion. But there are
several stumbling blocks:
</P>
<P>
   The first is cost: A top-of-the-line system sells for $2
million, although linear accelerators built since 1988 can be
upgraded for $500,000 to $1 million. ``These are big-ticket items''
and any talk about health-care cost controls could induce panic,
Curro said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's resistance to change. ``Doctors are conservative,''
Levy says, and many referring physicians have never heard of IMRT.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's training. Varian is having a hard time finding
people who can teach others to use the new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Varian's radiation oncology business accounts for 78 percent of
its revenues. But it has several other technologies in development:
</P>
<P>
   Brachytherapy. This involves feeding radioactive isotopes or
``seeds'' through a catheter into the tumor. It's invasive, but the
equipment cost is less than IMRT's, making it popular in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Digital X-rays. Varian is one of several companies working on
the medical-imaging equivalent of digital photography.
</P>
<P>
   Biosynergy. This involves using chemicals or drugs to enhance
the effect of radiation and/or desensitize healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Restinosis. In about 40 percent of angioplasty cases, the artery
will clog up again. Varian is working with Cordis, a division of
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, to reduce that rate to 15 percent by using
radiation and stents, devices that prop open arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are good odds that one of these will pay off,'' Levy
says, ``but even if they don't, we see 12 to 14 percent top-line
growth and 18 to 21 percent bottom-line growth based just on our
present business.''
</P>
<P>
   Barth agrees. ``We think their cancer business alone justifies
the current stock price. But these others are home-run markets. If
they could gain first-mover status in one of them, that would be
huge, pure upside. If they were to fizzle out, I don't think the
downside is that great.''
</P>
<P>
   For the year ended September 1999, Varian Medical lost $24
million on revenues of $590 million. Excluding losses from
discontinued operations, earnings were $8.2 million (27 cents).
</P>
<P>
   In this year's first quarter, the company earned $5.2 million
(17 cents) on $141 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jay Sellick of C.L. King &AMP; Associates in New York
expects Varian to will  &LR; earn $1.55 per share this year and $1.85
next year, which means the stock is selling at 28 times this year's
expected earnings and 24 times next year's. That's higher than most
capital equipment companies but lower than medical-device
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The valuation ``clearly isn't as good as it was not too long
ago,'' Sellick says. ``But I would consider this a good one- to
two-year investment. Cancer isn't going away. And these folks have
a good reputation for innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution: Varian is a party to several environmental
lawsuits and an antitrust suit stemming from its pre-split days.
The company says it believes it has set aside sufficient reserves
for any liabilities ... but you never know. &UR;  &LR;

 &HT;    One of gardening's enduring myths: Trimming crape myrtles
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I've been thinking a lot lately about crape
myrtles. I'm writing this on a plane back to Houston after spending
nearly a week in Atlanta, where spring is in full bloom. Azalea
blossoms laden the limbs, the jasmine smells sweet, and the kudzu
is coming back to life. Two out of three ain't bad. Thank God kudzu
never made it across the Sabine River.
</P>
<P>
   All the crape myrtles have been neatly trimmed back, their ugly
spindly branches whacked away in preparation for summer's blooms,
so that what remains are thick branches and knobby outcroppings
from which the new branches will sprout. The crape myrtle is the
franchise flower of summer here in Deep East Texas, its blooms
lasting longer in the heat than anything save lantana, which grow
low to the ground and aren't nearly as impressive. A mature crape
myrtle tree in full bloom, pink or white, will bring a smile to
your face even on the worst of days.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that not all the crape myrtles in Atlanta have
been trimmed, but all were that I saw while spending my time at a
secluded conference center outside the city, in a planned community
called Peachtree City. I was trapped in an executive training
high-dollar prison camp from which there was no escaping. I spent
what little free time I had walking the grounds, trying to clear my
head of consultantese. The smell of dogwood blossoms and pine
needles rejuvenated me at key moments. First thing I noticed was
that the crape myrtles had all been pruned.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening columnist Jeff Abt has been on a lonely jihad against
pruning crape myrtles for years. Near as I can tell, at least from
observation, I am his only recent convert, though he has allies
among fellow horticulturists who already know better. He spoke
recently to a Rotary Club meeting and exhorted the nearly 200
middle-aged and older men, as well as a scattering of women, to
leave the crape myrtles alone. Pruning them has no effect
whatsoever on the quality, duration or size of their blossoms.
Leave crape myrtles alone and they grow into beautiful trees with
lovely blossoms, and he showed slides to prove his point. If you
want short crape myrtles, Jeff said, then buy a variety that
doesn't grow tall instead of whacking away at what are essentially
trees. Imagine if we went out and topped pine trees every year to
keep them to a certain height.
</P>
<P>
   I left Rotary and on my way back to the office spied a landscape
man working outside an office, flailing away on the crape myrtles,
a huge pile of limbs growing nearby. I slowed and watched him. The
pruner looked so determined, fulfilling his mission with the
certainty of a man who has done this task the same time each year
for many years: It's late February. Time to whack on the crape
myrtles. This is ingrained into our culture.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff convinced me otherwise a few years back, the first time he
wrote a gardening column pleading with readers to not prune the
myrtles. By sad coincidence, I had spent the previous Sunday
hacking away at several huge crape myrtles growing off the back
deck of a house I had just bought. There were about eight of them,
and they were close to 20 feet tall. By the time I got through, I
had knocked them down a good five feet, had blisters on my fingers
from using the long-handled pruner, and then had to drag the limbs
out to the curb so the city would take them to the dump.
</P>
<P>
   I was feeling pretty darned manly _ job well done and all that _
until Jeff informed us in his column that pruning crape myrtles is
unnecessary, dumb and doltish. My words, not his.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never prune another crape myrtle, since I firmly believe in
the minimalist theory of lawn maintenance. But, judging from the
number of crape myrtle trees that look like multiple amputees now
that spring has arrived, Jeff's plea still falls on empty ears.
</P>
<P>
   I complimented Jeff on his talk to Rotary a few weeks ago, and
he mentioned in passing that he and some allies in this lonely
crusade were thinking about forming CRAMM: Citizens Rallying
Against Myrtle Mutilation. I don't think they're planning anything
more sinister than bumper stickers. As he explained it, this would
be the nonviolent arm of the anti-crape myrtle pruning movement. He
hinted darkly at a more militant faction, but I wasn't interested.
Shedding blood over crape myrtles is a bit out there.
</P>
<P>
   At my new house, I planted a dozen crape myrtles last fall,
spindly things that are now about four feet tall. It wasn't easy,
but I resisted the temptation to trim them back a bit as their
first spring approached, to maybe help them shoot out new branches
_ much in the way you trim rose bushes. But I looked temptation
square in the face and resisted for once, and I have been rewarded
for my efforts. All my crape myrtles have new branches coming out.
By summer, they should be delightful.

 &HT;    Bus driver didn't stop at crossing, feds say
 &HT;    By David Bennett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The school bus driver in Tuesday's train-bus accident,
which killed three children and injured four, did not stop at the
unguarded rural railroad crossing, federal investigators said
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to the preliminary determination the bus driver
did not stop at the crossing prior to entering it,'' said Ken
Suydam, the National Transportation Safety Board investigator
leading the probe into the early morning wreck in Tennga, Ga., near
the Tennessee-Georgia line.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Rhonda Cloer, who was released Wednesday from Erlanger
Memorial Hospital after treatment for arm injuries and facial cuts,
has refused to be interviewed by investigators looking into the
worst train-bus crash involving Georgians since 1974. Cloer, whose
daughter was among those critically injured, referred questions to
her attorney, Suydam said.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-car CSX freight train, carrying automobiles from
Cincinnati to Tampa, Fla. _ slammed into the Murray County school
bus, tearing the passenger compartment off the chassis and dragging
it about 100 yards down the track.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer was conscious when rescue crews reached the crash site,
and according to witnesses, she said she had stopped before
entering the crossing and never saw the train.
</P>
<P>
   Suydam also said the audio portion of the videotape taken from
the bus indicated that ``several conversations were going on'' and
that the AM/FM radio was on. He said investigators could not
immediately say whether the noise was sufficient to prevent Cloer
from hearing the train whistle.
</P>
<P>
   He said Cloer was not able to see far enough down the track
because of the heavy tree growth bordering the rail bed.
</P>
<P>
   Laws in Tennessee and Georgia require a driver to put on the
bus' four-way flashing lights and come to a complete stop 15 to 50
feet before every grade crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Suydam said the engineer had sounded the train whistle at the
appropriate distance as he neared the crossing and sounded the
whistle constantly for 8 seconds before impact when the engineer
saw the bus on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier statement, the engineer, whose name has not been
released, said he jammed the train into an emergency stop as soon
as he saw the 72-seat school bus, which was in the early part of
its route picking up children for Northwest Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the data recorder on the train indicated the
train was moving about 50 mph as it approached the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Three school buses cross the track each day at Liberty Church
Road.
</P>
<P>
   Students Kayla Silvers, 6, and Daniel Pack, 9, died Tuesday, the
day of the crash. Another student, Amber Pritchett, 9, died
Wednesday night at T.C. Thompson Children's Hospital. Three other
children remain hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Sherrill, 8, and the driver's daughter, Kayli Cloer, 5,
are in critical condition at Thompson, and relatives said Cloer has
been in a medically induced coma to control brain swelling. Jordan
Manis, 6, is in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany Gaddis, 8, was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services for Kayla and Daniel are to be held today at
Liberty Baptist Church, which is near the crossing. Services for
Amber are scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site Thursday, investigators conducted tests for
five hours after a rain-delay.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB photographers rode the bus and engine through the crossing,
taking pictures at 50-yard intervals of what Cloer and the train's
conductor might have seen.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on whether Tennessee officials would
file criminal charges against Cloer.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Keeton, spokeswoman for the Tennessee Highway Patrol, said
Cloer, who had a commercial driver's license, had only one previous
violation on her driving record, a 1991 speeding ticket. The record
did not indicate whether that occurred while she was driving a bus,
Keeton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the final NTSB report is months away, investigators
plan to provide a preliminary report Saturday that will detail
speeds, sight distances and other factors involved in the crash.

 &HT;    Compared to Nyquil, gasoline is a bargain
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ ``If you really think about it, we aren't paying
a whole lot for gasoline,'' read the e-mail I received the other
day. That's exactly what I've been saying all along.
</P>
<P>
   We've been spoiled for too long by gasoline prices that are
artificially low.
</P>
<P>
   Let the rest of the world deal with gasoline prices that are $2,
$3 and $4 a gallon, but let the price at the pump at the corner
convenience store go over a buck a gallon, and we all start
moaning.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief, not until the gas crisis of the '70s did anyone
consider that oil was definitely a finite resource. Back then, it
was hard to find gasoline at any price. Later, oil producers
increased production and gas prices fell. Now, they are on the way
up again. But one thing is for certain: at some point we'll either
be buying a syntectic fuel or we won't be driving.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, the e-mail listed some prices per gallon for
other items that make gasoline almost a bargain, even at $1.50 a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diet Snapple 16oz for $1.29 equals $10.32 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lipton Ice Tea 16oz for $1.19 equals $ 9.52 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gatorade 20oz for $1.59 equals $ 10.17 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ocean Spray 16oz for $1.25 equals $ 10 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pint of milk 16oz for $1.59 equals $12.72 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brake fluid 12oz for $3.15 equals $ 33.60 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Evian water 9oz for $1.49 equals $ 21.19 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pepto Bismol 4oz for $3.85 equals $123.20 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whiteout 7oz for $1.39 equals $25.42 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scope 1.5oz for $0.99 equals $ 84.48 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   And the topper:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vick's Nyquil 6oz for $8.35 equals $ 178.13 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   So next time you're at the pump, be glad your car doesn't run on
Nyquil, Scope or Whiteout.

GIULIANI FAR AHEAD OF CLINTON IN FUND   RAISING FOR SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (adds 3 grafs at end) 
 (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani raised nearly twice as much
money as Hillary Rodham Clinton during the first three months of
this year and has now collected a total of $19 million for his
Senate campaign, according to figures provided by both candidates
Thursday. The latest numbers leave little doubt that Giuliani will
significantly outraise and outspend the first lady in the race in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got a lot of people out there who don't like her,'' said
Bruce J. Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager, grinning as he
released the Republican mayor's side of what turned out by day's
end to be a fairly lopsided fund-raising picture.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said that more than half of Giuliani's total
contributions came from out of state, though he contended that the
strong showing _ news of which clearly unsettled some of Clinton's
supporters _ was as much a tribute to Giuliani as a testament to
Clinton's unpopularity.
</P>
<P>
   He said Giuliani had raised $7 million in the reporting period
required under federal law, from Jan. 1 to March 31, for a total of
$19 million for his campaign. Clinton's campaign aides said she had
raised about $4 million in the period, bringing her total to about
$12 million. The figures do not count millions in additional
so-called soft money contributions, which are largely unregulated,
that the two candidates have been energetically soliciting.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Giuliani was startling, not only because of its
size _ the mayor has already raised more money than Charles Schumer
collected for his entire Senate contest in 1998 _ but also because
the figures appeared to undercut what had once been a widespread
assumption of the contest: that Clinton would raise more money than
Giuliani. Earlier this year, Clinton's advisers had said they were
confident that she would raise $25 million for her campaign; she
has yet to reach the halfway point toward that.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, said
he was now certain that Giuliani would raise ``at least several
million more dollars'' than Clinton. ``We think they will have a
significant amount more than we have,'' de Blasio said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum called a formal news conference to announce the
figures, which he presented in a series of brightly colored charts,
filled with graphic illustrations that demonstrated the scope of
Giuliani's accomplishment for the sake of the television cameras at
the back of the room. By contrast, Clinton disclosed her figure in
a short statement e-mailed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani now seems certain to break the fund-raising record of
$21 million set in Virginia by a nonincumbent candidate for Senate,
Oliver North, in 1994. He has already surpassed Schumer, who raised
$17 million in his run for Senate in 1998, and his advisers say
they now think that he might end up raising close to $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The splurge of fund raising was condemned Thursday by Theodore
W. Kheel, the former labor negotiator who has taken the lead in
trying to work out an agreement between Clinton and Giuliani to
renounce voluntarily the use of unregulated soft money in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely terrible,'' Kheel said. ``It tells the public
that the electoral process depends on how much money you can raise.
The assumption is that more money will buy the election. It's
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The actual filing period does not end until midnight Friday.
Giuliani's aides said he was putting out the numbers a day early
because he would be in Arizona attending fund-raisers Friday. The
release of what the aides saw as a bit of good news also came as
the mayor has tried to tamp down criticism of his response to the
fatal police shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Because the figures were preliminary, neither campaign was able
to provide what is a critical way to measure the financial health
of a campaign: the amount of cash on hand. But Giuliani seems
likely to enjoy an advantage in this area. Unlike Clinton, Giuliani
has yet to hire much of a campaign staff, a reflection of the fact
that he has not done much campaign traveling and has a network of
City Hall aides. Teitelbaum said the campaign was about to begin
hiring more staff members within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani appears to be in a strong financial position, for
reasons going beyond the numbers in the latest report. Teitelbaum
said that more than half of the contributions came in response to
direct-mail solicitations, which meant that Giuliani, who has kept
a modest campaign schedule, did not have to leave City Hall much to
raise the cash. And Teitelbaum said the campaign now has gotten
contributions from 135,000 donors, most of whom have given below
the $1,000 legal contribution limit and whom the campaign can hit
again for more money.
</P>
<P>
   That said, political analysts cautioned Thursday that it would
be a mistake to read too much into the political position of either
candidate based on fund-raising figures. For one thing, no matter
how Clinton stands in comparison to Giuliani, she still has raised
what in any other Senate race would be a huge amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   And there is, Clinton's aides said, no corollary between a
candidate's fund-raising ability and victory, ``Senator D'Amato,
Senator North and Senator Huffington can all attest to the fact
that more money doesn't necessarily get you elected to the
Senate,'' said Howard Wolfson, Clinton's press secretary, referring
to unsuccessful Senate campaigns by Alfonse D'Amato in New York,
North in Virginia, and Michael Huffington in California.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said Giuliani's figures reflected the success in sending
fund-raising letters portraying Clinton as a far-left candidate to
conservatives. ``We have raised more money than any Democratic
candidate in history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a coincidence of timing, Clinton found herself dealing
with the news of her lagging fund-raising on the same day that her
husband was again demonstrating his fund-raising prowess, and in
New York at that. President Clinton raised about $1.7 million in
fund-raisers Thursday on behalf of national Democratic
organizations in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum took note of President Clinton's fund-raising skills,
along with the observation that Mrs. Clinton did not have the
obligations of a job, in arguing that Mrs. Clinton should be
concerned.

INS EXTENDS DEADLINE OF CUBAN BOY'S STAY IN U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ U.S. immigration officials extended until Tuesday the
deadline for Elian Gonzalez's stay in the United States, granting
the shipwreck survivor's attorneys another four days to fight the
boy's deportation to Cuba, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The extension was the second in as many days and came as
6-year-old Elian's father in Cuba was seeking permission to enter
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, speaking through his American attorney, said he
will enter the country once he gets the U.S. visa, and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service assures him that he will be
given custody of his son while in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The latest developments prompted presumed Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore and Republican candidate George W.
Bush to once again weigh in on the issue, with Vice President Gore
breaking ranks from the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials originally had threatened to revoke the
boy's parole Thursday unless they had written assurances from his
family that he would be surrendered to authorities once appeals are
exhausted to keep him in the United States. They later moved the
deadline to 9 a.m. Friday before agreeing Thursday to meet with the
family's attorneys again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have continued to conduct our discussions with the
government on this matter and because of scheduling difficulties we
have agreed to continue those discussions on Monday,'' Jose Garcia
Pedroza, one of six attorneys representing the family, said after
12 1/2 hours of negotiations over two days.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was placed into the custody of his great uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, shortly after his rescue off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., by a pair of fishermen last Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives and their lawyers have argued that Elian
should remain in the United States, a plea that has the outspoken
support of the city's large population of Cuban expatriates. But
the INS, citing U.S. immigration law, has decided that the boy
should be reunited with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relatives in Miami do not speak for Elian,'' said the
father's lawyer, Gregory Craig. ``The lawyers in Miami do not speak
for Elian. The only person that has the legal and moral authority
to speak for Elian Gonzalez is his father.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling last week, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore
upheld a decision by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner to return
Elian to his father. Elian's family has appealed the ruling and a
federal appeals court in Atlanta has scheduled the case for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the father, Craig said he seeks visas for Elian's
stepmother and infant half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   Visa applications for travel from Cuba to the United States must
be submitted to the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana. The State
Department did not say how long the visa process will take but
added that it would expedite Craig's request.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling last week, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore
upheld a decision by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner to return
Elian to his father. Elian's family has appealed the ruling and a
federal appeals court in Atlanta has scheduled the case for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who oversees INS, indicated
Thursday that she is willing to send U.S. marshals to retrieve
Elian if the Miami relatives refuse to work toward a prompt,
peaceful resolution of their dispute with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would be willing to enforce the law if peaceful
efforts fail, Reno responded, ``You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, however, did not question the relatives'
motives in fighting to keep Elian, saying that they ``love him
dearly and have cared for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, a former Miami prosecutor who grew up in the city, also
made an emotional plea for calm to the city's Cuban expatriates who
have rallied in support of the family's attempt to block the
government's call that Elian be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a community I love,'' Reno said. ``And when it's hurting,
it hurts me.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that Cuban exiles, who have fled Cuban President Fidel
Castro's regime, should have heightened respect for the U.S. rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   On the street in front of the house in Miami's Little Havana
neighborhood where Elian has been staying with his great uncle,
dozens of demonstrators linked arms and formed two rows, according
to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, broke with the Clinton administration's view
that Elian should be summarily returned to his father under federal
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said U.S. courts should first determine whether going back
to Cuba would be in the boy's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian Gonzalez's case is at heart a custody matter,'' Gore
said. ``It is a matter that should be decided by courts that have
the experience and expertise to resolve custody cases, with due
process and based on Elian's best interests,'' Gore said. ``It now
appears that our immigration laws may not be broad enough to allow
for such an approach in Elian's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore endorsed pending congressional legislation that would make
Elian and his father legal immigrants, enabling them to litigate
the custody case in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he welcomed the vice president's break with the
administration and support for a custody hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he could convince the rest of the administration of the
wisdom of that approach,'' said Bush. ``I hope he'll use his
influence to encourage the president and the attorney general to
follow that approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the vice president now supports legal residency for
Elian Gonzalez,'' Bush said. ``I wish he could convince the rest of
the administration of the wisdom of that approach. The vice
president is an influential member of this administration. I hope
he'll use his influence to encourage the president and the attorney
general to follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Jan. 23 said he supported legislation in Congress to
make Gonzalez a citizen. But Bush also said citizenship would not
preclude the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be a wonderful gesture,'' Bush said on ABC's ``This
Week.'' ``I guess ... the boy could still go back to Cuba as a
citizen of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has consistently said Gonzalez should not be returned to
Cuba until his father had had a chance to spend time in the United
States ``to understand the greatness of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez has stated he would release the boy to his
father if he came to Miami to claim him. Though the great uncle
participated in Wednesday's negotiations, he did not attend
Thursday's eight-hour session. Instead, his daughter, Marisleysis,
21, joined the negotiations late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for the boy's Miami family, said
Marisleysis asked to attend the meeting, ``because (she) is the
most important person in this boy's life and she felt she needed to
be come.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother, Elizabeth Gonzalez, took the boy on an ill-fated
journey to the United States last November. Elian and two other
passengers were the only survivors of the boat trip. His mother and
10 others drowned in the journey. Before she died, she strapped
Elian to an inner tube on which he drifted for two days before
being discovered by two fisherman on Thanksgiving Day.

 &HT;    Slain cop's wife: Abu-Jamal's address `will haunt' Antioch
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio _ The widow of slain Philadelphia police
officer Daniel Faulkner told Antioch College's graduating seniors
Thursday that choosing as a commencement speaker the man convicted
of her husband's murder ``is akin to the people of Oklahoma City
having Timothy McVeigh address their graduating class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shock and disgust felt by society at your decision will
haunt those who follow you at Antioch for years go come,'' Maureen
Faulkner wrote. ``Do not honor a convicted murderer by permitting
him to send you off with his banal message of `revolution' and
hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Antioch officials said Thursday they have no plans to negate the
wishes of Antioch's class of 2000, which invited radio journalist
and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death-row inmate, to
speak via audiotape at its April 29 commencement.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner and fellow survivors of slain officers _ along with
active-duty and retired officers _ have deluged Antioch College
officials with more than 600 e-mails and letters protesting the
selection.
</P>
<P>
   But two college administrators said the college is not taking
sides in the international debate on Abu-Jamal's guilt or innocence
and the fairness of his trial in the 1981 slaying. Nor, they said,
is the college honoring Abu-Jamal by including his comments at
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   They said the school is respecting Abu-Jamal's free-speech
rights, as well as the wishes of its graduating seniors, who chose
Abu-Jamal and trans-gender author Leslie Feinberg over eight other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail and fax campaign represents ``five or six hundred
people trying very hard to keep one person's voice from being
heard,'' said Antioch College President Bob Devine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals on death row still have the right of free
speech,'' said Antioch Dean of Students Scott Warren, who chairs
the college's commencement committee.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said Wednesday that some correspondence amounted to
``hate mail'' clearly intended to ``intimidate and harass'' the
college. The college Thursday made available for inspection the
first 300 or so e-mails and letters it has received. A second,
similar batch is still being read and copied, college officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The letters and electronic messages virtually unanimously
criticized the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we believe in free speech, but not by a KILLER,'' wrote
Toni MacDonald, president of the northern California chapter of an
organization for survivors of police slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have someone who violated the essence of human rights by
the taking of another man's life _ especially a person in law
enforcement _ come to a place of education and deliver a
commencement speech is just not acceptable,'' wrote P.atricia Hunt,
widow of a slain California Highway Patrol officer.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement fraternal organizations and
victims-and-survivors' groups quickly e-mailed to members the word
of Antioch's selection of Abu-Jamal earlier this week and
encouraged members to express their opinion to the private college.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal's case is a lightning rod, having drawn international
attention from anti-death-penalty activists and others who believe
he was railroaded by a corrupt and racist justice system. Abu-Jamal
is black; the slain officer was white. Last month, Amnesty
International called for a new trial for Abu-Jamal, citing what the
organization called judicial bias, irregularities in the police
investigation and possible coercion of key witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter-writers consistently referred to Abu-Jamal as a
``cop-killer'' and noted that several appeals of his 1982
conviction have failed. Arnold Gordon, Philadelphia first district
attorney, said in a letter to Devine, ``From an evidentiary
standpoint, the case against Mumia Abu-Jamal was overwhelming, one
of the strongest that I have seen in 30 years as a prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon wrote, ``Mr. Abu-Jamal has been portrayed by a small but
vocal group of supporters and some misguided celebrities as a
victim and a martyr, rather than the vicious, cold-blooded cop
killer that a jury found him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Some messages seemed ominous. One, from an unnamed author who
described himself as ``just a guy in Kevlar, a cop with family and
friends,'' used Devine's first name: ``When the alarm goes off,
Bob, aren't you going to wonder why they got to your neighbor's
place a little faster? Can you blame them?''
</P>
<P>
   Many letters suggested that the college would be better served
had Maureen Faulkner been invited to speak. In a phone interview
from her Southern California home Thursday, Faulkner made it clear
her voice will be heard on commencement day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to threaten, but I'm coming. I'm going to be
there, and I'm going to protest.... I'll have a picture of Danny in
my hand,'' said Faulkner, who did just that last year when students
at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., invited Abu-Jamal to
speak via audiotape at commencement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last moment of my husband's life, he was looking up at
a barrel of a gun,'' Faulkner said. ``I don't want people to forget
that. I won't let people forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   One message of support came from the president of Evergreen
College, Jane Jervis, who endured similar protests last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having gone through the experience you are about to have _
namely, having Mumia Abu-Jamal as a speaker at graduation _ I want
to extend my condolences and whatever advice I or members of my
staff might offer,'' Jervis wrote to Devine.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Jervis wrote, ``our graduation ceremony was
extraordinary _ a real learning event, as graduations seldom are _
and I have never been more proud of Evergreen.''

   NEW YORK _ Elisabeth Bing's hands are gnarled with arthritis,
and she needs help opening a display case that holds her collection
of delicate pre-Columbian and Native American fertility figurines.
</P>
<P>
   They are beautiful and shocking: A woman large of thigh and
buttocks, squatting as she gives birth. A mother with breasts
pendulous from nursing, one infant on her back and another in her
belly.
</P>
<P>
   The figurines are on display in the large carpeted studio on the
Upper West Side where Bing, at 85, continues to teach the natural
childbirth classes that were so revolutionary when she began her
crusade a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many pioneers, Bing, who fled Nazi Germany in 1933, has
gone from being a rebel to a relic, which is both the good news and
the bad. She knows that she led a movement that transformed the
obstetrical profession in the United States. And the measure of her
success is that young women now take it for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not being tied down anymore,'' Bing said. ``We're not
lying flat on our backs with our legs in the air, shaved like a
baby. You can give birth in any position you like. The father, or
anybody else, can be there. We fought for years on end for that.
And now it's commonplace. We've got it all.''
</P>
<P>
   But with all that has come a lack of regard for history. Bing
described a call from a young woman who was referred by a hospital
where the childbirth classes once scorned were now overbooked. She
was looking for an instructor. ``What are your qualifications?''
she asked Bing.
</P>
<P>
   She tells the story with a rueful laugh, seated in her
apartment, a few floors above her studio. There are books
everywhere, orchids and African violets on the sunny windowsills,
walls hung with beloved art, including reproductions by the German
artist Emil Nolde, who was ordered by the Nazis not to paint and
switched from oils to watercolor to avoid the telltale smell.
</P>
<P>
   Bing compares the ignorance of young women to that of the
post-war generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``World War II is part of my life,'' she said. ``But people see
it as so far away. That's how it works. It mostly doesn't bother
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Age has tamed her emotions, Bing said, although her eyes brim as
she describes her loneliness, after 16 years of widowhood. She
fears declining health and is grateful that her housekeeper calls
each morning to check on her. Her son, a professor of classics at
Emory University in Atlanta, is farther away than usual, on a
fellowship in Cambridge, England. He sends photos of her 5-year-old
granddaughter, who plays the cello _ as Bing does, even now with
her aching hands. But the coming weeks will be full of celebration.
She will be honored at a symposium organized by the New York
chapter of Lamaze International, an organization that Bing founded.
The chapter also intends to publish Bing's autobiography. And the
Schlesinger Library on the History of Women at Harvard University
has offered an archive for her papers.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is an inspiring tale that began in Berlin in 1914, when the
First World War was planting the seeds for the Second. By 1933, two
of her siblings, a dental surgeon and an architect, could not find
work because they were Jewish. Bing, for the same reason, was
thrown out of the university two days into her freshman year. With
the help of friends in London, her widowed mother arranged for the
family to flee.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Bing trained as a physical therapist. Her hospital
job involved the usual cases: broken bones, strokes, paralysis. But
each morning she went to the maternity ward, to provide exercise
for women who were not allowed out of bed for 10 days after
delivery. Around that time, a patient gave her a book by Grantly
Dick-Read, ``Childbirth Without Fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed coined the term ``natural childbirth,'' and said that the
mind-body connection would ease labor. Bing longed to train with
him in the north of England. But bombs were falling and travel was
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she read about obstetrics, watched deliveries and was
horrified by what she saw. Soon Dick-Read's approach was refined by
Dr. Fernand Lamaze, a French physician who studied breathing
exercises for mothers in labor in Russia, where poverty and war had
made anesthesia a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bing settled in the United States, in 1949, she was
committed to finding doctors who would collaborate in these
techniques. In 1951 she made a niche at Mount Sinai Hospital, where
Dr. Alan Guttmacher, another pioneer in women's health, was
beginning a maternity service and welcomed her. Bing has been
teaching and lecturing since.
</P>
<P>
   But the fervor of the early days is gone; natural childbirth
classes are a routine part of the prenatal routine, not a
philosophical imperative. Bing favors six weekly classes, but
couples now want to cram the program into a few hours. And
virtually every woman who comes to her these days expects an
epidural, which blocks the sensory nerves below the waist.
</P>
<P>
   Fervent feminists once refused medication as a badge of honor.
Bing tries not to sound preachy, but she thinks the younger women
are cheating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an experience that never leaves you,'' Bing said of an
unmedicated birth. ``It needs absolute concentration; it takes up
your whole being. And you learn to use your body correctly in a
situation of stress. I'm not saying it's white or black. But these
girls are not trusting their bodies, that they can give birth by
themselves.''

 &HT;    Seles takes two bites out the bagel at
 &HT;    Ericsson
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ If you were putting together a list of the
players least likely to get bageled _ tennis slang for losing a set
6-0 _ Monica Seles would be near the top.
</P>
<P>
   Since turning pro nearly 11 years ago, Seles has earned a
reputation for grunting out every single point, for fighting from
start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Bagels? She has served more of them than a Manhattan deli. But
no one had ever forced her to eat two in one sitting. Not when she
was a 14-year-old amateur playing in tour events. Not when she was
coming back after a 27-month layoff following her stabbing. Not
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 534th match of her career, it happened.
</P>
<P>
   She lost 6-0, 6-0 to top-seed Martina Hingis in semifinals of
the Ericsson Open. The match lasted only 39 minutes. Seles, her
movement hampered by a sprained ankle, won only 22 points in the 12
games. And after she double faulted twice to end the match, hitting
a second serve into the middle of the net on the final shot, some
fans in the stadium court crowd booed and whistled.
</P>
<P>
   For Hingis, it meant a berth in the final. For Seles, it meant a
6-0, 6-1 loss to Steffi Graf in the fourth-round of the 1989
Wimbledon no longer was her worst defeat.
</P>
<P>
   She had been double-bageled. And booed.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, although understandably subdued after the defeat,
shrugged it off as just a really bad day. And as for the fans, she
seemed surprisingly forgiving. In a way, they were like her. They
came to the stadium expecting a better show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they really wanted a closer match than what happened
out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What did happen out there?
</P>
<P>
   Seles, 26, seemed to be back after a stress fracture in her
right foot kept her sidelined for five months. She won a title in
Oklahoma City earlier this month. And although she sprained her
ankle before the start of the Ericsson, she managed to win her
first four matches _ even handed out a few bagels along the way.
</P>
<P>
   She finished off a three-set match with Anna Kournikova in the
fourth round with a 6-0 set. And Wednesday, in the quarterfinals,
she needed only 22 minutes to win the first set of a 6-0, 6-3
victory against Amy Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she predicted that playing Hingis would be
``different.'' If only she knew how different.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 minutes into the match, Seles had lost 13 of 14
points _ including 12 in a row. It didn't help that twice during
that stretch, line judges made no calls on shots by Hingis that
appeared to land past the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day. Even the calls went against her. The
first set was over in 18 minutes. Seles had won only eight points.
And Hingis was wondering if maybe she would default.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she kept playing,'' Hingis said. ``I was like, `Well,
nobody else would do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Seles was still ripping line-drive groundstrokes _ perhaps even
more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   When the match ended, Seles had hit nearly as many winners (14)
as Hingis (13). But she also had 35 unforced errors compared to
five for Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to go for more shots than I would have liked to,
because I knew I had a hard time moving sideways,'' Seles said.
``When I started doing that, I started making more errors. ...
Going against someone who is as consistent as Martina, it's not
going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final game, Hingis had three match points. When Seles hit
a forehand volley that landed near the baseline, Hingis playfully
argued with a line judge. Two double-faults later, it was over.
``I'm sure somebody else in her place wouldn't even step out on the
court,'' Hingis said. ``She just wasn't herself today.''

767 FUEL TANK PARTS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CRACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Parts in the center fuel tank structure of as many as
40 Boeing 767 widebody jets now in service may be susceptible to
cracking, The Post-Intelligencer has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect parts _ called stringers _ also may be in 16 other
767s now in various stages of production at the company's Everett,
Wash., plant, including every 767 parked on the flight line that
has not yet been delivered to a customer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, which came to light only recently when an 8-inch
crack was found on a 767 in production, has been traced to a
shipment of improperly heat-treated parts from a Boeing supplier,
Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it does not consider this to be an immediate
safety-of-flight issue. The Federal Aviation Administration said it
is waiting for further analysis by Boeing before it determines what
should be done with planes that are already in service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplanes in service are safe to fly,'' Boeing spokeswoman
Yvonne Leach said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest problem comes at an especially bad time for
Boeing. The company is scrambling to regain lost momentum after a
recent 40-day strike by its engineers and technical workers that
disrupted production lines and resulted in a number of missed
airplane deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   At this time, Boeing believes the suspect parts can be replaced
in those 767s without delaying any deliveries, Leach said. She
could not provide a breakdown of how many of the 16 767s in
production with possible suspect parts have rolled out the factory
door and are on the flight line.
</P>
<P>
   The next 767 is scheduled to be delivered Monday, she said, and
the suspect parts have already been replaced in that plane.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA was notified by Boeing of the problem last week and is
working with the company to better understand the nature and scope
of the problem, as well as to determine a corrective action plan
for planes in service, said FAA spokesman Mitch Barker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for Boeing to do an assessment of the size of
the problem, what effect this might have and what needs to be
done,'' Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second supplier problem that has complicated Boeing
production in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Production had to be slowed in early March on all but one of
Boeing's commercial models after the company discovered substandard
fasterners had been used on its assembly lines in Everett and in
Renton, Wash., since last December.
</P>
<P>
   The fasterners were made from an alloy that made them prone to
cracking.
</P>
<P>
   The latest problem involves the ``stringer'' that is used on the
767's center wing fuel tank. The 194-inch-long aluminium stringers
run the width of the center fuel tank. They carry the wing load and
serve as an attachment for the tank's metal skin.
</P>
<P>
   There are 28 stringers on top of the tank, and 28 on the
bottom.,
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 28 upper stringers are suspect, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers have calculated that even if the two stringers failed,
the others can carry the wing load with adequate safety margins,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the issue said the fuel tank assembly for
the 767, including stringers, is shipped to Boeing from Northrop
Grumman, which is one of Boeing biggest subcontractors. Its Dallas
unit makes the 747's main fuselage and tail sections, as well as
major parts for most of Boeing's commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
   The raw material for the faulty stringers came from Alcoa, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Leach would not identify the raw-material supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation found that the material was heat-treated at
too high a temperature at the raw material supplier's facility,''
Leach said. Only one bad lot of parts came from that supplier,
Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   The wings of the 767 are joined to the fuselage on each side of
the center fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said a worker on the 767 production line first noticed a
8-inch long crack on one of the stringers and notified his
supervisor. That triggered an investigation that led back to the
supplier, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A P-I source gave a different account of how the crack was
discovered. This person said the crack was found during what's
known as a ``shakedown inspection.''
</P>
<P>
   This inspection is performed after machinists finish their work
on a particular area of a plane. The source said the crack resulted
from the additional drilling and riveting work that must be done
during wing installation. The crack occurred where a rivet went
through the skin into the stringer, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said Boeing does not yet know how many planes in service
are affected.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA's Barker said the number of in-service 767s with the
suspect parts is believed to be around 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good handle on the number of planes,'' he said.
Neither he nor Boeing would identify the airlines or operators of
the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the flying public should be concerned, Barker responded
that the FAA can issue an airworthiness directive requiring
operators to take immediate corrective action should it be
determined that the suspect stringers are a risk to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said Boeing has not yet come up with a corrective action
plan for those jets in service. But for those planes in production,
she said, the two suspect stringers are being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that it is time consuming to replace the two
suspect stringers on finished jets. Floor panels must be removed,
she said. But she did not know how many hours of work is involved.
</P>
<P>
   The source said any fix requires one worker to climb inside the
fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of work,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The source questioned why it took so long to discover that Alcoa
had delivered a lot of bad material to Northrop.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been building 767s at the rate of about 4 per month.
</P>
<P>
   That means the bad material could have been used in planes for
as long as a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes a year to find this problem, it indicates to me
that Boeing's quality control process is suspect,'' the source
said. ``Why should it take so long to find this.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the center fuel tank is only about a foot below
where passengers sit in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Leach did not know when the lot of bad material was delivered.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the FAA launched a special audit of Boeing's
quality control and manufacturing processes to determine what the
agency said was the ``root cause'' of a series of
production-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   Among those were improperly torqued tail bolts, improperly
cleaned fuel tanks and the use of an adhesive that did not meet
federal fire standards for aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   That audit was recently completed but the FAA has not yet
released the findings.

<P>
   PORT LOKO, Sierra Leone _ In one of the two camps here where
rebels, ex-soldiers, militiamen and traditional hunters from the
country's nine-year civil war are supposed to give up their arms
and start becoming law-abiding citizens, Sheak Bnyallay stalked up
to a visitor and angrily removed his sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet fragment was lodged an inch under his right eye. The
eyeball was permanently fixed at an odd angle. Bnyallay, 31, was a
soldier who had rebelled against the government of Sierra Leone _ a
``sobel'' in the staggeringly complex classification of fighters
who rose up as this country sank into lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   He was angry that since his arrival a couple of months ago no
one had examined his eye. He was even angrier that he had made no
progress in rejoining the Sierra Leone Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they take care of my needs,'' Bnyallay said, his breath
smelling of the cheap palm wine that many in the camp use to get
drunk, ``I'm loyal to the government. If the government does not
take care of my needs, I know what to do later as a soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   A reconstructed Sierra Leonean Army is expected to absorb a few
thousand soldier-rebels; Bnyallay's injury makes it unlikely that
he will be among them. What happens to this angry man _ as well as
to the thousands of other ex-combatants, ``bush fighters'' with no
military training _ may well determine the future of this West
African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Even if U.N. peacekeepers eventually succeed in deploying
throughout the country and all of the 45,000 estimated combatants
give up their weapons, most people regard that as only the first,
and perhaps easiest, step in rebuilding Sierra Leone. Weakened by
decades of corrupt governments, devastated by one of the most
brutal wars in Africa, Sierra Leone needs to be remade from
scratch.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have an army, a police force,'' said Maj. Gen.
Vijay K. Jetley, the commander of the U.N. peacekeeping troops.
``Or should I say, they have some sort of army, some sort of police
force _ but only some sort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This country needs a healing touch, touched with velvet
gloves, tenderly,'' Jetley added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The camps in Port Loko are run by the British government;
Nigerian soldiers provide security. The Norwegian Refugee Council
runs another camp for refugees. The Roman Catholic church has a
facility for child soldiers, some as young as 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There is no government here. A few miles outside Port Loko, on
the road to Freetown, the capital about 30 miles southwest of here,
villagers crush stones alongside the road and fill potholes in the
hopes of collecting some change from motorists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The scene is a familiar one in Africa. But here it has been
pushed to its extreme: the pothole-fillers are boys no older than
10. And they have erected roadblocks, less sturdy and dangerous
than the ones their older brothers used to put up before the
arrival of the peacekeepers, but sturdy enough to force motorists
to stop. In less than two miles, boys at a dozen roadblocks
cheerfully tried to extort money.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to the peace accord signed in July, the Revolutionary
United Front, ex-soldiers and a pro-government militia were all to
have given up their weapons months ago. Only about a third,
however, have gone through these disarmament camps so far.
</P>
<P>
   A power-sharing government, made up of government and United
Front officials, is nominally leading the country until elections
are held early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the enormous job of rebuilding Sierra Leone has
become clearer as the foreign peacekeepers have deployed throughout
most of the country, except, significantly, in the rebel-controlled
diamond mining area.
</P>
<P>
   The officials of the United Front have little understanding of
the diamond industry, much less of how to reform it, said a Western
diplomat in Freetown. Even before Graham Greene gave diamond
smuggling a critical part in his World War II-era novel ``The Heart
of the Matter,'' it had been at the root of many of Sierra Leone's
problems. The country's deep social inequalities, despite the
potential wealth of its diamonds, have been the rallying cry for
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Oluyemi Adeniji, the special U.N. envoy to Sierra Leone, said
that the cost for disarming, demobilizing and somehow reintegrating
the country's fighters into Sierra Leone's shattered society had
initially been $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, delays and other problems make it likely that the cost will
be $90 million, Adeniji said, adding that only about $30 million
had been raised so far, with Britain as the main individual donor.
</P>
<P>
   Private humanitarian organizations are also struggling to supply
the needs of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Kenema, a town in the south, the International Rescue
Committee is one of the organizations dealing with the seemingly
endless categories of victims. While people whose hands, arms or
feet were hacked off have became the war's symbols of suffering,
other kinds of victims are more numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Girls were kidnapped, some taken as sex slaves. Rape was used
systematically to terrorize and drive wedges between women and
their communities in a culture where rape victims often become
social outcasts, said Kim Vradenburg, program manager for the
International Rescue Committee in Kenema.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was typically not one man on one woman but multiple men on
one woman,'' Vradenburg said, adding that most of the victims she
has counseled are younger than 14 years or older than 40 years _
``those who could not run away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone will also have to absorb an unknown number of child
soldiers, some as young as 6 or 7, who fought in the bush for
years. Many were kidnapped by the front's rebels, though many also
volunteered. Most are illiterate, with only one or two years of
schooling. Beyond the psychological damage the children have
suffered, it will be difficult for them to return to their
communities, especially if they committed atrocities there,
Vradenburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Port Loko, conditions have improved steadily in the
disarmament camps since they opened four months ago, said Arnstein
Hansen, a Norwegian who manages the camps for the British
government.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, rapes, looting and stealing were taking place
regularly inside the disarmament camps as well as in the nearby
refugee camp, he said. One time, a grenade smuggled into one camp
exploded, killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   Crime has been put under control, Hansen said, but little has
been accomplished to reintegrate the ex-combatants into society.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following guidelines established by the United Nations,
combatants voluntarily disarm and demobilize at one of the 10
disarmament camps in the country. As an incentive, they are given
$150 at the beginning of what is supposed to be a 10-week stay, and
another $150 at the end _ considerable sums in a country where the
per capita gross national product is $140 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the combatants are supposed to receive some
vocational training during their stay.
</P>
<P>
   But few, if any, have received any.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not working,'' Hansen said, ``not at all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Around noon most of the 2,300 ex-combatants at one camp here
were milling around in front of their tarpaulin tents or in the
shade of trees. Under one mango tree, a group of men sat and passed
around a marijuana joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to improve my education, provided there is an
assistance,'' Patrick Lahai, 35, said as he took a reporter around
the camp. He said had been training to become a teacher before he
joined the front's rebellion in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assistance? No assistance!'' snorted a young man from under
the mango tree. The man, Junior Barry, was a tailor by training. He
came out of the shade, angry that he had spent three months in the
camp and that no one had given him a sewing machine. ``We will go
back to the bush and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never,'' Lahai said. ``I will never go back to the bush.''

   ``We'll take you,'' Junior Barry said. ``How will you survive?''

<P>
   ``I will cater.''

   ``How will you cater?''

   Junior Barry walked away angrily, back into the shade. Under the
mango tree no one had moved. Nothing had changed. But the marijuana
joint was a lot shorter.

 &HT;    Stankowski putts up 66
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Leave it to the BellSouth Classic to revive Paul
Stankowski's game. Lost for much of the last two PGA Tour seasons,
the 1996 BellSouth champion fell back into his Atlanta area comfort
zone Thursday, taking the overnight lead at the TPC at Sugarloaf
with a 6-under-par 66.
</P>
<P>
   Stankowski squeezed more out of his round than his ball-striking
might have allowed, but after finishing 113th on the money list
last year he'll take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to steal from Tiger (Woods), but it was definitely not my
`A' game,'' he said. ``It was more like a `D' game. But it was my
`A' putting game, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite morning rain and lightning that caused a 1 hour,
55-minute delay, forcing 39 players to finish their first round
today at 7 a.m., scoring conditions became ideal during the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   One stroke behind Stankowski with 5-under-par 67s were Phil
Mickelson, Kenny Perry, Blaine McAllister, Frenchman Jean Van de
Velde, former U.S. Open champion Steve Jones and Jay Don Blake.
Eric Booker is at 5-under with three holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9-ranked Nick Price led a group of 11 players at 68 that
included tour rookie Gary Nicklaus and former Masters champion
Larry Mize of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is in such unbelievable condition, you can't
criticize anything,'' said Price.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion David Duval is already seven shots off the
pace, shooting a 1-over 73 that included four bogeys and three
birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Stankowski, famous for a '96 BellSouth win that pushed him into
the Masters as the tournament's final entry, birdied three of his
first four holes Thursday _ 10, 12 and 13. On the second nine, he
made birdies at 1, 2 and 6 without making a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde only entered the BellSouth because he missed the
cut at The Players Championship and didn't want to wait a week
before his first Masters appearance and become unduly restless. ``I
thought if I could manage to keep the ball in play and hit the
right section of the green, you might have a chance to roll a
couple of putts in,'' said Van de Velde. ``That is pretty much what
I did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was completely thrilled with the course. After
driving into the right fairway bunker at the fifth hole, Perry hit
a 9-iron that landed about 8 feet in front of the hole, spun back
to the front of the green and stopped. As he headed to the green,
the ball began rolling again, down into the hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Perry: ``I've never seen the ball come to rest and stop and five
minutes later roll off into the water.''

GOVERNMENT ASKS JUDGE TO PROTECT INMATES AT PRIVATE PRISON IN
LOUISIANA
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By FOX BUTTERFIELD  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the
Wackenhut Corrections Corp. and the state of Louisiana charging
that conditions at a private for-profit juvenile prison in central
Louisiana are ``dangerous and life threatening'' and asking a
federal judge to take emergency action to protect the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asked Judge Frank J. Polozola of U.S. District Court
in Baton Rouge, La., to intervene to stop guards at the Wackenhut
prison from beating the inmates, throwing gas grenades into their
barracks, holding them for long periods in isolation and failing to
provide the inmates with adequate mental health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   David Utter, director of the Juvenile Justice Project of
Louisiana, a civil rights and advocacy group that represents some
of the inmates, said the action was highly unusual because it was
done in the form of a request for a preliminary injunction for
emergency relief, rather than as a regular lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an extraordinary remedy for a horrendous situation,''
Utter said.
</P>
<P>
   A group of experts hired by the Justice Department who toured
the prison, at Jena, reported that many of the 276 boys had no
shoes or blankets and were constantly short of food. The experts
also reported that many of the boys tried to commit suicide or
deliberately injured themselves to get into the infirmary as a way
to escape physical abuse by the guards.
</P>
<P>
   A New Orleans juvenile court judge, Mark Doherty, found
conditions at Jena so bad that he released six boys he had sent
there after visiting the prison in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, a Republican and a former prosecutor, said Wackenhut
had treated the boys no better than animals ``on all fours.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Justice Department lawsuit, Wackenhut
released a statement saying that the company ``is providing a
constitutionally sound, safe and secure facility'' and that it is
``working hard to continuously improve the operations through
additional support from our corporate and regional staff.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wackenhut said it believed that the Justice
Department experts had been misled by ``exaggerations and
misstatements of facts'' by inmates they had interviewed, and that
the experts' findings ``do not accurately reflect the condition of
the facility today.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stalder, the secretary of the Louisiana Department of
Public Safety and Corrections, was said to be out of town, and
other officials in his office did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut, based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., is the
second-largest private prison company in the United States and the
largest internationally. It operates 39,308 beds in 56 institutions
in 13 states and seven countries, and its shares are traded on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have privately expressed both
bafflement and anger at the conditions in Jena, since the Justice
Department had reached an agreement with Wackenhut just before the
prison opened in December 1998 laying down guidelines for how the
prison would be run.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil
rights, said ``We are taking this action on behalf of young people
in this facility who cannot help or protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee added, ``It is clear that, at this time, we need to involve
the court to get some emergency relief.''

BRUINS' SPIRIT IS NOT ENOUGH AGAINST BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was David against Goliath, wily veterans against willing but
inexperienced kids, a contender against a rebuilder.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the team that was expected to win _ the St. Louis
Blues _ did, but the Bruins put up a gallant fight in a 3-2
decision Thursday night at the FleetCenter. Bruins goaltender John
Grahame was sensational and kept his club in it through a very
hairy second period.
</P>
<P>
   Boston isn't mathematically eliminated from the playoffs but
with only five games remaining, it could happen as soon as Saturday
against the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than a few reasons to fear the Blues. They had
lost only one of their previous 17 road games and had the best
record away from home in the league (26-9-4). They also had been
beaten Wednesday by Toronto, the first time the Blues were defeated
by a Canadian-based club this season. St. Louis came in with the
most victories (48) and points (106) in the NHL and are considered
a legitimate contender for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in the Blues' fine season has been the play of Roman
Turek, who went into the game with a 1.92 goals-against average,
.914 save percentage, and 40-14-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it was the Bruins who scored first, just 6:47 into
the game on Joe Thornton's 22d goal. Thornton, who before the game
was presented the Seventh Player Award, collected the puck from
Mikko Eloranta off the boards and backhanded a shot past Turek.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jochen Hecht tied it less than five minutes later with
his first of two goals. Former Boston College star Marty Reasoner
centered a pass that Thornton tried to intercept. The pass found
its mark, however, and Hecht backhanded a shot past Grahame at
11:16.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame often came up huge, once at 17:54 when he robbed Hecht
with his glove after Ladislav Nagy fed a pass across the crease
that Hecht tried to bang in at the right post.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame was even more impressive in the second period, during
which the Bruins were outshot, 18-7, including 10-1 at the 8:25
mark.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:16, defenseman Chris Pronger, considered a leading
candidate for the Hart Trophy as the league's MVP, had two bids.
One Grahame stopped, the other hit the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, as the Blues continued to swarm, Pronger
tested Grahame with a shot from the left point and then former
Boston University standout Scott Young had a chance at 5:36.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht broke through again on the power play at 14:34 for his
12th goal of the year. Right wing Stephane Richer teed up a slapper
that struck Grahame's glove, with the puck dropping to his skates.
With Grahame having lost sight of the puck, Don Sweeney tried to
help out by clearing it but wasn't able to and Hecht rapped it past
Grahame for the 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht's second goal was followed by some penalty trouble for the
Bruins but they survived.
</P>
<P>
   Young, however, boosted the Blues' advantage to two goals at
4:37 of the third with his 21st of the year. Boston pulled to
within 3-2 when Sergei Samsonov took a cross-ice pass from Eric
Nickulas, skated down the right circle and lifted a shot over Turek
for his 19th goal of the season.

AGENT SAYS   HE'LL COMPLY   WITH LAWS   ON LICENSING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Tenn., N.C., Ohio, Mich., Ind., N.J.)  (Formerly skedded as BKC-NCAA-DEMPSEY)

 By JOE DRAPE   and JUDY BATTISTA c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lawyer for Andy Miller, the professional sports agent, said
Thursday that he had contacted law enforcement authorities in
Florida and Tennessee to assure them that Miller intended to comply
with state laws governing agents.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Paul Robbins, said he had also conveyed the same
message to officials at the University of Florida and the
University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The calls came in response to an article in The New York Times
Thursday that said Miller appeared to have broken laws in both
states by repeatedly contacting prominent college basketball
players without registering as an agent in those states or alerting
the athletes' universities about the conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advised them that we have nothing but respect for the laws
in those states and we are taking steps to comply with their
licensing requirements,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Florida basketball team left for Indianapolis and the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament's Final Four
Thursday, the athletic department turned over to the university's
police department information about Andy Miller's repeated phone
calls to the Gator star Mike Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Miller estimated that the agent had telephoned him about 45
times since September, and that the two spoke at least 20 times, a
university official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Tennessee have strict laws regulating sports agents;
each requires agents to register with the state and to notify a
university when contacting an athlete. Violating these provisions
in Florida can be considered a felony. In Tennessee, it is a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Miller admitted having met at least once with Andy Miller,
at a basketball game at Rutgers last December, a University of
Florida official said. He also said the agent had offered him
tickets to a professional basketball game the next night in
Orlando, Fla. Mike Miller told school officials that he declined
the offer, sparing himself a violation of NCAA rules that bar
players from receiving extra benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on a meeting with Mike Miller and our compliance staff
yesterday, we have determined no eligibility issues exist for Mike
Miller,'' Florida's athletic director, Jeremy Foley, said in a
statement. ``Because of the information reported in The New York
Times that a sports agent may have violated Florida law by
improperly contacting Mike, we have turned over information to the
police investigative authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agents routinely contact top college football and
basketball players in an effort to represent them when they turn
pro, and Miller was aggressive in his pursuit of top prospects.
Telephone records and diary entries reviewed by The Times show that
he tried to reach at least 24 players from at least 17 teams,
including Cincinnati, North Carolina and Michigan State. He placed
many telephone calls to Tony Harris of the University of Tennessee,
to Shaheen Holloway of Seton Hall and to A.J. Guyton of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of Florida coaching staff and administration
have done a good job of educating us about NCAA rules,'' Mike
Miller said in a statement Thursday. ``I have not violated any NCAA
rules and my total focus is on getting ready to play North Carolina
in the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Joe Sharkey, a spokesman for the University of
Florida police department, an investigator was assigned to the case
Thursday and the police hope to determine if a crime was committed
by next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sole responsibility will be to look for any criminal
activity that this person may have done by contacting Mike Miller
or other athletes,'' Sharkey said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Tennessee, where Harris received repeated
calls from Andy Miller, Malcolm McInnis, the school's associate
athletic director, said officials hoped to talk to three other
athletes whose names appeared in Miller's diary, although with less
frequency than Harris'.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a situation like this, the prudent thing to do
is check with the other athletes who might have been other targets
to see if there has been an attempt to contact them,'' McInnis
said. ``Obviously, we'd report to the state if we are aware of
somebody who violated the law.''

PAYING DUES: TAR HEELS' FORTE DOES ROOKIE STUFF AND STAR STUFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ As North Carolina's leading scorer, Joseph Forte
has helped carry the Tar Heels to their 15th Final Four. And that's
not the only burden the freshman has shouldered.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina program has certain traditions. Team statistics are
listed by alphabetical order, not by leading scorers. Seniors, even
walk-ons, get their picture on the cover of the media guide. And
freshmen, no matter how talented or precocious, are put in their
place. They're last in line for water breaks, last in the buffet
line and first when it comes to carrying bags.
</P>
<P>
   Before each season, North Carolina upperclassmen vote and assign
jobs to the rookies. Forte's seasonlong assignment, by unanimous
vote, was to carry the team's Green Bag. It's the trainer's bag,
the team's heaviest equipment bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bag is very heavy,'' said the 6-foot-4, 185-pound Forte.
``At times I've got my Walkman on and I'm walking out of the locker
room and the manager taps me on the shoulder and says, `Come back
and get the bag.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about the pecking order. All the other the
little things, it's just that, humiliating. You can't knock it. It
makes you a better person. The other players saw I was confident,
and they didn't want me to be overconfident. What better way to do
that than to have me carry that bag and remind me of my place.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Tar Heels' Final Four semifinal game with Florida
on Saturday, Forte's place is at the top of the school's freshman
scoring list.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Not Phil Ford, not James Worthy, not Michael
Jordan, not Vince Carter. Forte scored 585 points, breaking Sam
Perkins' record of 550 points. He averaged 16.7 points per game to
become the first North Carolina freshman to lead the team in
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Joseph was a very good prospect,'' North Carolina
coach Bill Guthridge said. ``But I didn't know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge said that Forte has provided an ``ingredient'' the Tar
Heels needed, but in his succinct manner, he didn't elaborate. Tar
Heels senior point guard Ed Cota did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting,'' he said. ``Being able to knock down an outside
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A big-time player who makes big-time plays for us,'' North
Carolina sophomore forward Kris Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest came in the South Regional semifinal against
Tennessee. The Tar Heels trailed 64-57 with less than five minutes
to play. Faced with momentum-changing possession, Forte set a
screen near the top of the key for Cota, then stepped back and took
a flip pass from Cota. Forte's 3-pointer started a 13-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in my ear the whole game,'' Cota said. ``He told me
wasn't going to miss. All game, it was, `Ed, don't forget me. Find
me, find me.' He reminds me of myself. He wants the ball in
crunch-time situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte said his goal as a freshman was to start and win a
national championship. He didn't expect to lead the team in
scoring, but he has not been blinded by the bright lights that
focus on Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy transition,'' said the former star at
Hyattsville (Md.) DeMatha High School. ``At DeMatha we get a lot of
attention, a lot of media attention. It was easy for me to step in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly how North Carolina freshmen are supposed to
act. Sure, the school gets more than its share of high school
All-Americans. But the Tar Heel way is to be humble before you
become a star. From the first day of practice, Forte told his
teammates how good he was going to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the court, you might think he's a little cocky, but he's
not cocky at all, he's just got a lot of confidence,'' Cota said.
``I like being around him, because I love a person who has
confidence in himself. He might boast a little about the things he
does well. We don't pay him no mind, we just pat him on the butt
and tell him to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not like that,'' the soft-spoken Forte responded.
``I'm a good guy off the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte opened the season being named MVP of the Maui Classic in
Hawaii, then was named most outstanding player of the South
Regional in Austin. After Forte scored 28 points in the South
Regional final to lead the Tar Heels past Tulsa, Guthridge was
asked if Forte would be relieved of his bag-carrying duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' he said, straight-faced. ``We might put some more
bricks in the green bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte, it would appear, can carry the load. nn

VINYL ANSWER: CUSACK HELPS `HIGH FIDELITY' FIND THE RIGHT GROOVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' begins with the end of a romance. The breakup
is not pretty to see, even if it's funny.
</P>
<P>
   As Laura, his live-in lover, walks out his door, Rob Gordon
(John Cusack) hurls self-pitying abuse at her.
</P>
<P>
   Then he informs us, in the first of his ongoing conversations
with the audience, that he may look wounded by Laura leaving, but
he's been through much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't even make the top five of my most miserable
breakups,'' Rob says. Already he sounds like a man trying to
convince himself more than his audience.
</P>
<P>
   And so Rob launches into a recap of those special girls and
women who did make his top list, starting with a classmate in
elementary school. The diverse list (two of the women played by
Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor) includes women who broke up
with him, women he broke up with and regretted leaving, women he
dated on the rebound and women who dated him on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The further Rob gets into his hilariously pathetic
recollections, the more we, and finally he, notice the degree he
has played in his own self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity,'' directed by Stephen Frears (``Dangerous
Liaisons,'' ``The Grifters'') is a near masterpiece of comic angst.
It's an exceptionally funny, insightful romantic comedy _ but with
sting. The pain of self-recognition in the laughs makes them more
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on the Nick Hornby novel about emotionally
adolescent Rob, the owner of a rundown used-record shop. Rob is
pushed to the point where he must finally embrace adulthood _ dare
we call it commitment? _ or be left behind forever.
</P>
<P>
   In its adaptation to the screen by Cusack and others, it has
been relocated from London to Chicago. (Hornby has praised the
movie for being faithful to his book's essentials.)
</P>
<P>
   Like many adolescent adults, Rob runs on obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters is what you like, not what you are like.''
</P>
<P>
   He has three likes: himself, women and music. Not much else
matters, although he has convinced himself he has depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read books like `Love in the Time of Cholera.' And I
think I've understood them,'' he says. ``They're about girls,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   For reality, he has substituted music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I
miserable because I listened to pop music?'' Rob asks as though
there really might be a definitive answer.
</P>
<P>
   His record shop _ that's right, mostly vinyl _ specializes in
the esoteric, the cultish and arcane, as much to keep away
mainstream buyers as to attract off-beat collectors. Its
out-of-the-way location, grungy look and elitist clerks keep away
all but the music fanatics whose lives have focused down to
hoarding some narrow gully of music minutiae.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd feel guilty taking their money if I wasn't, well, one of
them,'' Rob admits.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has frequented such record shops (or used bookstores)
will fully believe Rob's two unlikely assistants, an endearingly
timid geek, played by Todd Luiso, and a verbally aggressively music
snob, Barry, played by Jack Black.
</P>
<P>
   Black, a master of comedic assault, steals most of his scenes,
and Cusack wisely stands back and lets him. When a middle-aged
businessman makes the error of wandering into the shop wanting to
buy his daughter some music Barry considers square, Barry coldly
asks if the girl is in a coma. He then orders the man out of the
shop.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Lisa Bonet and Natasha Gregson Wagner as more
of Rob's flirtations, Joan Cusack as Laura's best friend (she has a
really great small scene calling Rob names that ultimately provides
a catharsis to his self-realization) and Tim Robbins (paying back
Cusack's small role last year in Robbins' ``Cradle Will Rock'') as
guru Ian, Laura's post-Rob love interest.
</P>
<P>
   Laura is played by Iben Hjejle, and she is one of the film's few
weak links, because we can never quite figure out why Rob is so
shaken and taken by her. The script doesn't really give Hjejle
enough to work with, and she is not compelling enough to convince
us on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Frears is skilled at pinpointing the emotional frailties and
moral weaknesses of characters yet finding a humanity that makes us
care about them, even pull for them, while they mess up again and
again. He can make even the most conversation-bound scene exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The script, by Cusack and ``The Grifters'' writing team of D.V.
DeVincentis and Steve Pink, with an additional credit to Scott
Rosenberg, who wrote an early draft, takes liberally from Hornby's
book. It's constantly scathing and comically cynical without ever
turning really ugly or bitter.
</P>
<P>
   It's Cusack who makes this film, however. He specializes in
smart but self-destructive characters we care about, and this is a
richly cutting comic version of them. Without Cusack's deft touch,
his perfect air of cynicism in which we can read an alternate human
side without having it made overt, this character would be just a
jerk or a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also benefits from a great soundtrack with music from
Bob Dylan to the Thirteenth Floor Elevators to Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   If the film has a problem, it is in taking too long to have Rob
finally grasp the essentials of what he needs to do to grow up.
That, in turn, makes the resolution seem abrupt and too little
developed. But even there, the writers have given a little shading
that reflects that in life you can never be sure of movie-perfect
endings. &QL;

`SIXTH SENSE' REVEALS ITS SECRETS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE'
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   As we neared the end of a century (no, not a millennium _ not
yet), we craved more answers, more meaning, even more spirituality
in our entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a little horror film called ``The Sixth Sense'' made an
astonishing $285 million at America's box offices and racked up six
Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   We're not saying it's an undeserving film, just a lucky one _
and a historic case. ``The Sixth Sense'' joins ``The Exorcist'' as
the only horror movies ever nominated for Oscar's best-picture
honors.
</P>
<P>
   Almost like ``The Crying Game,'' ``The Sixth Sense'' hinges on A
Big Secret, which can't be divulged here.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that repeat viewings on video can show how
director-writer M. Night Shyamalan pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   He tells a tale of a prominent child psychologist (Bruce Willis)
encountering a boy (Haley Joel Osment) who sees and hears dead
people _ much like a former patient of Willis' who killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to redeem himself, the psychologist takes the boy as a
patient, learning painful details of his hideous visions.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``An American Werewolf in London,'' spirits appear to the
boy as the people were when they died, and since many died
violently, the visions are grisly. Seeing them is a ``gift'' he'd
rather give back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the obsessed psychologist seems to be drifting away
from his wife (Olivia Williams), drawn from home and normalcy into
the boy's bizarre world.
</P>
<P>
   Like the boy, you may be haunted by images from this film. Yet
``The Sixth Sense'' is less horrific than it is an absorbing drama,
and the performances are superb.
</P>
<P>
   Also credit Shyamalan, who gives his film new dimensions through
the cleverness of its ending, and who, like Stephen King, knows his
way around a good scary yarn.

<P>
   `CRAZY IN ALABAMA'
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Antonio Banderas adores his wife, actress Melanie
Griffith. In his first directorial outing, he showcases and
photographs her lovingly, and he ensures that almost every male in
the story also worships her.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith's character is a poor woman's Thelma or Louise who, in
1965 Alabama, poisons her abusive husband, cuts off his head, puts
it in a box and heads to Hollywood with naive dreams of stardom.
</P>
<P>
   This means abandoning her seven kids to their grandmom and
stealing a car along the way. But a gal's gotta do what a gal's
gotta do, even if her hubby keeps speaking to her from his box in
the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Juxtaposed with this odd lark of a road trip is a story back
home, as her young nephew (Lucas Black) is embroiled in a sad yet
cliched racial drama, taking the side of blacks against the town's
monstrous sheriff (rock singer Meat Loaf, now adding his original
last name of Aday).
</P>
<P>
   David Morse, Robert Wagner, Elizabeth Perkins and Paul Mazursky
are good in supporting roles, but it's Rod Steiger who steals the
show as an ornery judge.
</P>
<P>
   Though the racial drama works well, Griffith's saga does not,
starting with her allegedly forgivable crime.
</P>
<P>
   For a woman chronically abused for years, she seems happy if not
carefree, and everything comes too easily to her, from not getting
jailed to winning $32,000 in Vegas to quickly landing a role on
``Bewitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, almost every man becomes her instant guardian
angel, totally devoted to her well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its flaws, the film has many nice visual touches,
thanks to Banderas' eye. If only he were not so overcome by his
private life's heart.

A TIME TO BOND &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' won't be enough for James Bond fans
May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will the latest Bond film arrive on tape and DVD that
day, but a second wave of vintage Bond movies also will make their
DVD debuts and return on VHS.
</P>
<P>
   Getting their first discs will be Sean Connery's Bond bow (``Dr.
No''), three more from Roger Moore (``Moonraker,'' ``The Man With
the Golden Gun'' and ``The Spy Who Loved Me'') and George Lazenby's
lone outing (``On Her Majesty's Secret Service'').
</P>
<P>
   All will cost a suggested $34.98 on DVD and $14.95 on tape.
Boxed sets will be $149.98 for DVD and $62.98 for VHS.
</P>
<P>
   The discs will include new documentaries, audio commentaries and
other extras.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' also will be $34.98 on DVD but will
cost an extra $5 on tape _ still low, considering this will be the
first Bond film to hit VHS at a sell-through price.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the maverick productions of ``Never Say Never
Again'' and ``Casino Royale,'' the only Bond films waiting for DVD
releases are ``From Russia With Love,'' ``You Only Live Twice,''
``Diamonds Are Forever,'' ``Octopussy,'' ``A View to a Kill'' and
``The Living Daylights.'' Look for the third and final Bond wave by
year's end.

A TOWN DISEASED AND TORN  &HT;     BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; The poison runs deep in the little Mendocino County city of
Willits.
<P>
   A cocktail of chromium and other highly toxic chemicals has
contaminated the town's groundwater _ the result of decades of
illegal dumping and spills from a now-bankrupt hydraulics plant
adjacent to residential neighborhoods, schools and busy commercial
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees on this point.
</P>
<P>
   But the people of Willits are deeply divided over whether the
contamination is responsible for health problems among residents,
ranging from tumors and birth defects to a host of other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Chromium also takes center stage in the Julia Roberts movie
``Erin Brockovich,'' based on a true story in which a small
Southern California town successfully sues Pacific Gas and Electric
Co. over dumping of the chemical in its water supply. The situation
in Willits is not as straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   After dozens of interviews with local residents, town officials
and public health authorities, a crazy quilt of opinion emerges in
which the truth, whatever it may be, has been lost amid conflicting
interests and perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, as a rancorous public hearing held last
week by the Willits City Council demonstrated, is that the fabric
of the community is being torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare of individual citizens has been pitted against
concerns about property values and tourism as well as a local
history that enshrines the founder of the hydraulics plant as one
of the town's most respected figures.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tale that many in Willits, the self-proclaimed
``Gateway to the Redwoods'' about 150 miles north of San Francisco,
would prefer to keep hidden from outsiders a matter that some
townsfolk wish could be hushed up and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``No town wants to be thought of as having a toxic site in it,''
said David Drell, head of the nonprofit Willits Environmental
Center. ``But the story of this plant needs to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; A Rash of Illnesses
</P>
<P>
   Donna Avila's backyard is 15 feet from the pale yellow siding of
the vast Remco Hydraulics plant, which closed in 1995 after more
than 40 years in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Avila, 48, was concerned about the high-pitched whine of the
plant's machinery when she moved in more than a dozen years ago but
couldn't afford any other house big enough to accommodate herself,
her husband and their four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what was going on in that building,'' she said.
``God, if I only knew.''
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the smell _ a sickly sweet odor that Avila
couldn't quite place. The headaches followed, and skin rashes.
Then, in 1996, a tumor in her uterus resulted in a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really make the connection until after the surgery,''
she said, ``when my neighbors came over and said they'd had
hysterectomies, too. Then I started talking to more and more
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Those conversations led Avila to draw up a map of Willits and to
dot it with colored pins denoting cases of cancer, birth defects,
diabetes, headaches, rashes, nosebleeds and numbness. Today, that
map resembles a pin cushion of illnesses, suggesting that virtually
the entire neighborhood had suffered in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   At the center, unmistakably, is the Remco plant.
</P>
<P>
   Avila shared her concerns with City Hall and the school
district, but, to her mind, was met with little but stonewalling
and evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in November, she read about a lawsuit filed in U.S.
District Court in San Francisco by the family of a 5-year-old boy
with hemophilia who had allegedly died after drinking contaminated
water from Willits' Baechtel Creek, which runs near the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit charged that the boy succumbed to internal bleeding
due to high levels of chromium in the water. The case was
subsequently dismissed by a federal court judge, but a
wrongful-death claim is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been poisoned,'' Avila declared. ``There is no way that
there can be so many problems and something not be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   She has since filed a class-action suit with more than 60 other
plaintiffs charging that the Remco plant is responsible for
numerous health problems among Willits residents.
</P>
<P>
   Avila's attorney, Oakland lawyer Bill Simpich, said that a
ruling is expected by May on whether the case will be heard in
federal or state court and that the case will proceed gradually
from there.
</P>
<P>
   These days, mention of Avila's name around town will prompt
knowing looks and raised eyebrows. Whatever sympathies her cause
may engender among others, there is clearly a feeling that Avila
has gone too far in airing the town's dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want to open their minds about polluting other
people and hurting other people, that just shows how naive they
are,'' she said. ``Someone has to be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Remco Hydraulics was established in 1957 at the site of a small
machine shop on the outskirts of town. Its chief backer was Bob
Harrah, who would go on to set up two other industrial concerns in
Willits, making him one of the town's leading employers and
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Remco grew in size as contracts for hydraulic equipment arrived
from the U.S. Department of Defense and other customers. Chrome
plating for parts began in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   County health officials soon started receiving complaints about
strange smells and chemicals emanating from the plant, and these
officials in turn notified Remco that the company appeared to be in
violation of environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   There are some who believe that Harrah's extensive connections,
both in Mendocino County and in Sacramento, allowed him to all but
ignore the officials' warnings. After all, he was handling defense
contracts as the Vietnam War was intensifying, and that was a
higher priority than how chromium and assorted solvents were being
handled.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Remco continued dumping its waste in and
around the plant site as the facility's main building grew in size
to nearly 3.5 acres. Runoff poured through a storm drain straight
into nearby Baechtel Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The company also installed large fans atop the roof to ventilate
the factory. Those fans pointed directly at Baechtel Grove Middle
School, located just across the street.
</P>
<P>
   These were good years for Harrah. He served on the Willits
Planning Commission, City Council and high school board of
trustees. He also was chairman of the board for the town's only
hospital and a director at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Times changed. While Harrah moved on to other ventures and other
responsibilities, Remco eventually began to struggle as its defense
contracts dried up after the war. The company was sold and resold
to a variety of new owners before finally declaring bankruptcy and
closed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even after the cogs and wheels of its machinery started
rusting, Remco still managed to provide plenty of work _ this time
for lawyers. The city of Willits filed suit shortly after Remco's
bankruptcy, demanding that the plant's former owners assume
responsibility for cleaning up the site.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court judge ultimately ruled that a Chicago firm
called Whitman Corp. was accountable for Remco's toxic legacy.
Whitman, which began life as the Illinois Central Railroad in 1851,
is now the holding company for Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi is Whitman's single largest shareholder, but to date has
played no role in the Remco case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Whitman agreed under a court-mediated consent decree to
fund an independent trust charged with investigating and cleaning
up contamination at the Remco site. While cleanup has yet to begin,
the company said it has spent $7 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe there's a problem out there at all,'' said
Barbara Guibord, lead attorney of the Chicago law firm representing
Whitman in its dealings with Willits. ``We absolutely believe there
is no health threat whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, she said, has tried to be a good corporate citizen.
``We're doing the right thing,'' Guibord insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Willits officials aren't so sure. City Manager Gordon Logan and
City Attorney Ross Walker noted with undisguised frustration that
Whitman did not disclose until only recently that depositions taken
from former Remco workers in 1996 show the company was aware of
illegal disposal of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whitman probably should have found a way to work out our
problems with the city earlier than we did,'' Guibord admitted.
``We weren't in any kind of meaningful dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how severe the contamination, she stressed that no
evidence exists linking Remco with any health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people get cancer,'' Guibord said, ``and it's not
because they live in Willits.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some parts of Willits appear to be more prone to illness
than others. And most of those areas just happen to be downstream
from the Remco plant.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hoggett, 26, lives in his parents' garage on Franklin
Street, across from the old factory, and runs his own printing
company.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never really gave much thought to all those rumors
about Remco. He'd heard the one about the kid who had vomited up
some sort of green fluid, and when his parents tried to preserve it
by placing it in the freezer, it wouldn't harden.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Willits had heard that one, Hoggett said. It was
part of the local folklore.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Hoggett has started taking such talk more seriously.
As he spoke, he kept one eye on the telephone. He was waiting for
word of his father, who at that very moment was undergoing surgery
for a tumor in his groin area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's definitely something going on,'' Hoggett said.
``It seems fishy. It seems real fishy.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence Dilling lived with her family in a cozy house right
above Baechtel Creek, behind where the Safeway now stands. She
never knew about the storm drain just upstream or the way that
chromium from Remco had a way of turning the water yellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was a foul odor in the air,'' recalled Dilling, now
76 and bedridden with back problems. ``And we would see a
grayish-white fog that covered the ground near the plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children played in the creek, and Dilling served her family
water from the property's well. She also used well water for the
fruits and vegetables grown in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, her daughter Frances gave birth to a son with
muscular dystrophy. A subsequent daughter was born prematurely and
weighed just 4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then Frances had a second daughter, this one with a tumor in her
brain. The child died shortly after her second birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Dilling's 53-year-old son was diagnosed with
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no proof that any of this is connected to that plant,''
she said as her eyes filled with tears. ``But I remember that
odor.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Pam Arlich also recalled a funny smell at their home
three blocks from the Remco plant. The smell was especially strong
after heavy rains, when the groundwater would rise and flood the
garden where they grew pears, cherries and prunes.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after moving in, John and Pam both developed sinus
troubles. Then their daughter, Christina, was diagnosed with
bladder and kidney infections. Now 22, she may soon require a
hysterectomy, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlichs' oldest son, 20-year-old Jarrod, has asthma. Their
younger son, Matthew, was born prematurely. Now almost 13, he
doesn't talk much. He has a bad stutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is five people all living in the same house,'' Pam Arlich
said. ``You should have at least one healthy person.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Christina gave birth to her own son, Aaron. He
doesn't talk much. He, too, has a bad stutter.
</P>
<P>
   Experts speak of ``pathways of exposure'' when trying to
determine how an environmental hazard can affect surrounding
communities.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of PG&AMP;E and the contamination depicted in ``Erin
Brockovich,'' the pathway was fairly clear: Chromium had entered
the groundwater, the groundwater fed into nearby wells, people
drank from the wells.
</P>
<P>
   In Willits, however, most homes are hooked up to municipal water
lines that feed from a surface reservoir 7 miles away, upstream
from the Remco plant.
</P>
<P>
   City officials insist that their drinking water is safe,
although most townsfolk say they don't touch it. Bottled water
tastes better, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nobody is sure what to make of people eating fruits
and vegetables grown with well water or children playing on lawns
sprinkled with well water.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks close to the site have legitimate concerns,'' said
Janice Goebel, an investigator with the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board who has studied the Remco plant. ``The
exposure potential is definitely there.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It's a significantly contaminated site. The
concentrations of chromium are the highest I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Goebel said levels of chromium in the groundwater
run as high as 336,000 parts per billion. The ``public health
goal'' set by her agency for acceptable chromium exposure is a mere
0.2 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hexavalent chromium _ the most toxic form of the chemical and
the one contaminating Willits' groundwater _ is known to cause a
variety of illnesses, including cancer. The Remco contamination is
complicated by the presence of a number of other chemicals also
known to be carcinogenic.
</P>
<P>
   Various county and state agencies are now investigating the
matter as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Mills Matheson, who has practiced medicine in Willits
since 1974, insisted that ``there's no route of exposure'' between
the contaminated groundwater and nearby residents, and that the
chance of one's health being affected by eating chromium-tainted
fruits and vegetables ``is so tiny that it's very unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Matheson has made it a point to read all available medical
literature on chromium and to educate Willits' dozen or so other
physicians on the effects of exposure to the chemical. For this
reason, the town's medical community is united in believing that
Remco's neighbors have no grounds for claiming their health
troubles stem from close proximity to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no danger now,'' Matheson said. ``There's no need to
close the school. The danger was in the past. What that danger was,
we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that's part of the problem. All efforts to date have
focused on determining existing health hazards, which, considering
that the plant has been closed for five years, are considerably
less than in earlier decades. A recent study, for example, found no
evidence of chromium at Baechtel Grove Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has yet conducted the epidemiological research
required to determine past contamination among plant workers, their
offspring, or students exposed to airborne toxins. Entire
generations of Willits students have scattered far and wide, with
subsequent health problems going undocumented.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, Willits' main tourist attraction, the scenic
Skunk Train that travels from the town to Fort Bragg, passes within
feet of Remco. When the fans were turning, riders from throughout
the world also were exposed to whatever was being ventilated from
inside the facility.
</P>
<P>
   William Wright, head of the cancer surveillance section at the
state Department of Health Services, said a full epidemiological
study of Willits would entail many thousands of interviews and
blood samples, and cost ``millions and millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a single study that would put all
these issues to rest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright added that there have been other regions where
epidemiological research could not adequately explain chronic
health problems spanning decades.
</P>
<P>
   Matheson said he used to treat patients for headaches, sinus
troubles and nosebleeds ``all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a lot of hay fever in this area,'' he pointed out.
``It's like a dentist saying that they see a lot of cavities. It's
routine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Willits Environmental Center is based in the middle of town,
right on Main Street and just across from the post office. David
Drell established the center 10 years ago to oppose construction of
a power plant in the town.
</P>
<P>
   The Remco factory didn't figure on the center's agenda until
only a couple of years ago, after Donna Avila began stirring up the
dust.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Drell acknowledged that contamination at the site is
``very severe'' and said, ``We still don't know the full extent.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the health problems of local residents, Drell said: ``We
don't know if it's attributable to the plant. We're not health
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Drell, 55, is uncharacteristically subdued for
an environmental activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a toxic world,'' he said with a shrug. ``The
dumping of toxics is not limited to Remco.''
</P>
<P>
   Drell's interest in the plant is limited primarily to cleaning
up the site. He is eager to work with town officials in pressing
their case, and he has embraced an offer from Whitman to fund a
committee that would help citizens understand the hundreds of
documents the investigation has generated.
</P>
<P>
   Drell has lived in Willits for 26 years. Like many other
townsfolk, he doesn't like to make waves. He's also thinking about
running for a seat on the school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small place,'' Drell observed. ``When this is all done,
we'll still have to meet each other in the supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Community Full of Conflicts
</P>
<P>
   Potential conflicts of interest abound in Willits.
</P>
<P>
   The city has had to adopt an adversarial posture in its
negotiations with Whitman, yet is also partnered with Whitman in
pursuing a separate lawsuit against one of the Chicago firm's
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   At least one member of the city council owns property near the
Remco plant _ property that would plunge in value if the city were
to be more vocal in calling attention to its contamination problem.
</P>
<P>
   Farr Associates, the environmental engineering firm that
virtually serves as the independent trust overseeing cleanup of the
plant, previously served as a paid consultant on the Remco case for
Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Henshaw Environmental, which was hired to conduct soil and
groundwater tests on behalf of the trust, employs at least one
former Remco worker, who proudly wears his battered old Remco cap
while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, life goes on in the town. Randy Cantua at the local
Farmers Insurance office said people used to talk about Remco a few
years ago, ``but now it's kind of old news.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Vest, a broker at the Century 21 real estate office, said
average home prices in the area run about $150,000, in part because
the town so far has succeeded in playing down talk of the
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are making a big deal about nothing,'' said
Clinton Wilson, manager of the Computer Cave, Main Street's sole
electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   Most Willits residents don't seem particularly concerned about
the pending cleanup of the Remco plant, which Anne Farr, the
trust's site project manager, estimated could take 30 years and
cost more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   They are focused instead on the town's near-term prospects, &LR;  and
how they can attract more visitors. According to City Hall, tourism
now accounts for about 20 percent of Willits' total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   To boost that amount, Lynn Kennelly, executive director of the
Willits Chamber of Commerce, said the town is playing an active
role in a countywide effort to attract more people from the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a high quality of life here,'' she observed.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah, the Remco founder, was a key factor in spurring the
town's growth. ``He was wonderful in terms of helping,'' Kennelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who also was pivotal in turning his hwkY_$J`~|

ADAM PETTY HOPES FOR CUP RACE WHILE GREAT-GRANDDAD IS ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Adam Petty says he always has thought of
great-grandfather Lee Petty, patriarch of the family's NASCAR
legacy, as the ``healthiest man around.''
</P>
<P>
   But the elder Petty, 86, has been hospitalized for treatment of
a blood aneurysm since mid-February. Great grandpa's failing health
will be another motivating factor for Adam at Texas Motor Speedway
on Friday, when he attempts to qualify for his first Winston Cup
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty serious; I'm not going to lie,'' Kyle Petty said
of his grandfather, who is hospitalized in Greensboro, N.C. ``It
could go either way. We've tried to stay away from as much of that
as we could because this is a real positive weekend for Adam. We're
trying to keep Adam shielded from this stuff as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 19-year-old Adam admittedly never has been ``real
close'' to Lee Petty, he naturally remains concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an old man, and he's been through a lot,'' Adam Petty
said Thursday. ``I always thought he was the healthiest man around
because he was always down there giving us grief at the race shop.
But he's gotten real, real weak on us. The way I look at it,
there's four generations of us still alive. He's run a Winston Cup
race, dad's run a Winston Cup race, grandpa's run a Winston Cup
race. Be neat if he could be alive when I did my first Winston Cup
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping and praying that he's going to be all right. And
we'll go see him next week in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty already is the first fourth-generation athlete in any
professional sport. If Adam does qualify for Sunday's DirecTV 500,
he and father Kyle will be able to tell Lee Petty about their first
race against one another. Lee and son Richard Petty competed
against each other in the 1959 Daytona 500, a race Lee won,
inaugurating the 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway as
NASCAR's showcase facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something very special in our family, something that I've
grown up seeing my father and my grandfather do ever since I can
remember,'' Adam Petty said. ``Any kid wants to be just like their
father. It's something that I've always wanted to do, and I really
can't believe it's happening when I'm 19 ... trying to make my
first Winston Cup race. But if we do succeed and do make the race,
it will be very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty will need to post one of the top 36 speeds in his No.
45 Sprint Chevrolet Monte Carlo to qualify. Kyle Petty said
Sprint's promotional effort here has been considerable, adding
pressure to make the show from a business standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really break it down, it's more personal for us,'' said
Kyle Petty, the son of Richard Petty. ``Obviously, my grandfather
started this thing 50 years ago. When we look at it and say that
Adam has chosen to follow in the footsteps of what his grandfather
and his great grandfather and what I did ... that is big. And for
me personally, it's huge. Racing against my father, I always wanted
to beat him. When Adam makes this race and we go out there to race,
I hope he laps me 20 times in the first 15 laps. I'm pulling for
him. But for us as a company, Petty Enterprises, and for us
personally, this is a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Petty qualifies as a NASCAR pioneer, having competed in the
sanctioning body's inaugural season in 1949. His 55 career
victories are seventh on the all-time list, five more than compiled
by Ned Jarrett, Junior Johnson and Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's Rookie of the Year in 1959, Richard Petty retired in
1992 after winning a record 200 races and seven series
championships _ and forging a legacy as ``The King.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty has added eight Cup victories to the family total
since his first series start in August 1979 _ when he was two
months past his 19th birthday. Kyle Petty has a ready answer for
those who question whether Adam, who is in his second season of
competing in NASCAR's Busch Grand National Series, is ready to step
up to Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we do,'' Kyle Petty said. ``I'm going to use the
same line my father used ... `We have Winston Cup cars. We're in
Winston Cup racing. This is what we do. This is all we've ever
done.' So the quicker we get Adam into Winston Cup racing, the
quicker we may not have to have a Busch team or a truck team and we
can concentrate on Winston Cup racing. If Adam had not gone into
racing, we'd still have race cars and the John Andrettis and Steve
Grissoms driving for us for years to come. There doesn't
necessarily have to be a Petty driving a race car for Petty
Enterprises to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kyle said his son definitely is more focused on racing as a
career than he was coming out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I preface this by saying I'm a lot prejudiced,'' Kyle said,
``but I think he's got an incredible amount of talent at the age he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty, who qualified 13th Thursday for Saturday's
Albertson's 300 BGN race, said he selected TMS for the first of
five Cup races this year after consulting with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really the first place last year I qualified good in
the Busch car (third). Didn't race good, but qualified OK,'' Adam
Petty said. He returned with King Richard last fall to drive in a
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series event, racking up laps of experience
in a vehicle similar to a Cup car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laps here, and I was pretty comfortable,'' said
Adam Petty, who tested his new Cup car here alongside two-time
series champion Terry Labonte on March 20-21. ``We didn't do
anything but make mock qualifying runs. We ran pretty much the same
Terry did, maybe a little bit better. Any time Terry comes to
Texas, he's on his game. So that's a pretty good gauge.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam said he is anxious to qualify so he can begin earning
respect in the Cup garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people that doubt this decision to go Winston
Cup racing right now,'' Adam Petty said. ``I'm not going to be a
star (Sunday). I know that I have no chance to win. What you do
realize is you have the opportunity. And I think if I can go out
and show Jeff Burton and Mark Martin and people like Dale Earnhardt
that I have the ability to do it, I can gain their respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, my dad's been the biggest help to me in my career.
I've got to prove that I'm not going to ride on Richard Petty's
coattails the rest of my racing career. I've got to make a name for
myself. That's what I'm trying to do.'' nn

PUTTING THE GOO IN GOOD TIMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle facing Goo Goo Dolls lead singer Johnny
Rzeznik isn't how to follow up 1998's multiplatinum ``Dizzy Up the
Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor it is having to sing ``Iris,'' the group's breakthrough hit
from the film ``City of Angels,'' one more time.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't the lack of privacy that has come with whirlwind
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Rzeznik's biggest problem is trying to weave his way
through Los Angeles traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to change lanes here. I've got to make a U-turn''
Rzeznik said as he called from L.A., where he was on his way to a
rehearsal for the band's three-show tour in South Africa, which
took place a few weeks ago. ``I hate this city, I'm telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to MTV and Top 40 radio has been equally circuitous for
the Goo Goo Dolls, whose first incarnation was in the early '80s as
the Sex Maggots. After a promoter urged the band to change its
name, the Goo Goo Dolls signed with Celluloid Records in 1985, only
to bow out of the agreement quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stupid name,'' Rzeznik said of the loopy label, which
was inspired by an ad in the back of a True Detective magazine for
a doll with a moveable rubber head. ``We got a record deal, so we
had to kind of stick with the same name. By the time 1995 rolled
around, everybody sort of knew who we were. It would have been
unwise to change the name at that point. I begged those guys; I
lost that argument.''
</P>
<P>
   The group landed a new deal with Metal Blade Records, an
offshoot of Warner Bros., and that relationship proved equally
disheartening. The Goo Goo Dolls became entangled in a nine-month
legal battle with Metal Blade after the release of 1995's ``A Boy
Named Goo,'' claiming they hadn't been fairly compensated. A new
deal was negotiated with Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   The drama continued when Rzeznik and bassist Robby Takac fired
drummer George Tutuska in 1995 over long-simmering disagreements.
Current drummer Mike Malinin was called in just a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The group scored a few hits early in its career, but 1998's
``Dizzy Up the Girl'' was an unprecedented success, thanks in part
to ``Iris.'' The song's placement on the ``City of Angels''
soundtrack, coupled with the film's success, has made it the
biggest hit of the Goo Goo Dolls' career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think anybody would ever hear that song. Here I am on
a record with Peter Gabriel and Alanis Morissette and U2 and
whoever else was on there _ just huge, huge, huge bands,'' Rzeznik
said. ``That was a lot of traffic to get through, but it happened,
and it was great. I'm very happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dizzy Up the Girl'' is the band's sixth album, and it
showcases a sweeter, more accessible sound. The album has sold more
than 3 million copies. A fourth single from it _ ``Broadway'' _ was
released March 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that the record would do well, of course, but I
didn't think it was going to do as well as it has,'' Rzeznik said.
``Things just evolve. I sort of have no control over what happens
with the songs. Sometimes I'm afraid I might wake up one morning
with an entire record of polka songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rzeznik has already been writing for the band's next album, but
no release date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 10 seconds of inspiration and 10 months of being annoyed
and having to do the day-to-day pounding of actually hammering into
it,'' Rzeznik said. ``It's all so tentative right now. It's hard to
even say what the heck it's going to wind up being.''
</P>
<P>
   Rzeznik has used his new visibility to branch into other areas
of interest. He was a guest on ``Politically Incorrect'' and has
hosted programs on MTV and VH1. He's also writing music for a
Disney project and for ``some people I respect a lot and grew up
listening to their records and really loved them.'' (He wouldn't
get more specific than that.)
</P>
<P>
   With stardom comes the inevitable focus on the band's leader,
and Rzeznik is definitely one of rock's reluctant cover boys _ the
kind with carefully mussed hair, body-clinging clothes and tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Rzeznik seems unfazed _ and almost amazed _ at the heartthrob
label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, brother, that's a temporary status that I'm having
right now. I don't put much stock in it,'' Rzeznik said. ``It makes
me a little uncomfortable because I've never thought of myself like
that, and I don't know if that's something I particularly want to
be. There's a very quick shelf life for heartthrobs. I want people
to hear our music.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has experienced the Goo Goo Dolls live knows that
this is no batch of prepackaged pretty boys. The group balances
every mainstream-radio moment with a gritty rock anthem. It's a
nice surprise and, for the band, a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it's always got to be, man. Listen to the first
three Kiss records, and then listen to it live,'' Rzeznik said.
``If you can't rock as hard as you do on the records, that's just
weak. There's no excuse.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking from from administration policy on a
highly volatile issue, Vice President Al Gore said Thursday that
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and several family members should be
given permanent residency status in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement seemed to take some officials in the Clinton
administration by surprise, coming as it did in the midst of
negotiations between immigration officials, who want to return the
boy to his father in Cuba, and relatives who have been caring for
him in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the government agreed to extend until at least next
Tuesday the relatives' temporary custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Gore said he was supporting legislation
sponsored by Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Connie Mack, R-Fla., and
Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., that would allow Elian to stay in the
United States while his case is adjudicated in family court.
</P>
<P>
   If the court decided that he should be with his father, Elian
would return to Cuba. But when he reached adulthood, he could then
decide, Cuba willing, to return to the United States, where he
would resume permanent residency status. A step short of
citizenship, that status denies a person voting rights, the ability
to serve on a jury and in the military and access to certain
welfare benefits. It also makes him subject to deportation if he
commits a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is necessary in this case because the law generally
requires a person to live in the United States for five years
before becoming eligible to apply for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, I have said that Elian Gonzalez's
case is at heart a custody matter,'' Gore said in the statement.
``It is a matter that should be decided by courts that have the
experience and expertise to resolve custody cases, with due
process, and based on Elian's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now appears that our immigration laws may not be broad
enough to allow for such an approach in Elian's case. That is why I
am urging Congress to immediately pass legislation that is being
sponsored by Senators Bob Graham and Bob Smith, which would grant
permanent resident status to Elian, his father, stepmother,
half-brother, grandmothers and grandfather, so that this case can
be adjudicated properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement marks his strongest breach yet with the
administration and comes as Cuban exiles and officials in Miami are
threatening massive protests if the administration sends the boy
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gore said his statement Thursday stemmed logically
from his earlier position that the matter should be treated as a
custody case.
</P>
<P>
   But it stunned several members of his own party, including those
within the administration, who said they could not fathom his
timing or his reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, it's unbelievable!'' one administration official
blurted out in a private conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vocal about her surprise was Rep. Maxine Waters,
a liberal California Democrat, who said that Gore's position was
making her reconsider her support for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was introduced Wednesday by Graham, an
oft-mentioned vice presidential possibility for Gore, and Mack.
Smith, who met with the boy earlier, told reporters that Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, had indicated to them that the
Senate might be reluctant to support citizenship for Elian, as
Graham and Smith had proposed earlier, but that lawmakers might be
amenable to this proposal for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lott could not be reached for comment and there was no
indication of the prospects of such a bill or whether Lott would
allow it to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, a similar measure has been introduced by Rep.
Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the only other state with a significant
Cuban population. Menendez's bill would give permanent residency
status only to Elian, not to his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's statement, the most definitive he has made
in the four-month-old case, is certain to appeal to Florida's
800,000 Cuban-Americans, who could swing the electorate in November
in the nation's fourth-largest state.
</P>
<P>
   And it brings Gore into line with the position outlined in
January by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival for
the presidency, who said then that he supported citizenship for
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the vice president now supports legal residency for
Elian Gonzalez,'' Bush said Thursday. ``I wish he could convince
the rest of the administration of the wisdom of that approach. The
vice president is an influential member of this administration. I
hope he'll use his influence to encourage the president and the
attorney general to follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Waters said in an interview: ``I was totally blindsided. The
calculation doesn't make sense. If Gore did it because he's trying
to get the anti-Castro Cubans, first of all, they're not going to
vote for him anyway. These are Republicans. And number two, the
last polls I saw a month ago showed the American public is on the
side of sending Elian back to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was surprised and disappointed that Gore had been
so definitive in his statement, and that she was considering not
participating in the presidential election. ``I do have somewhere
to go,'' she said. ``Nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, on the other hand, said that Gore had indicated all
along that he wanted the matter treated as a custody case and that
what was new was his support for permanent residency status. Graham
said in an interview that if the family court determined that Elian
should be with his father in Cuba _ and the prevailing presumption
in the United States is that a child generally belongs with a
natural parent _ he and the vice president would support returning
the boy to Cuba until he reached adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I would support that position and I think the vice president
would,'' Graham said. ``And the overwhelming number of people in
Miami, including in the Cuban community, would support such a
determination if they thought it was made by an appropriate
judicial body.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who said the Senate has taken the first steps toward
petitioning the majority to bring his bill to the floor, added:
``The purpose of this legislation is to try to be a channel to move
this case from an INS asylum case to a family court.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was the purpose behind Gore's statement Thursday, his
aides said. ``This was the only way to vindicate the principle,
that this should be decided in a court that deals with custody
cases,'' a top adviser said. Contrary to some suggestions, he
added, Gore's action may have the effect of calming the people of
Miami rather than stirring them up.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore said in his statement: ``Let us be clear that the real
fault in this case lies with the oppressive regime of Fidel Castro.
Elian should never have been forced to choose between freedom and
his own father. Now we must take action, here on our own shores, to
make sure that Elian's best interests are served.''
</P>
<P>
   But he definitely stirred up Washington, including some on his
own staff. ``This was not something that was discussed, chewed over
and thought out for a long time or that huge numbers of people were
consulted on,'' an adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Jake Siewert, a spokesman for Clinton, said
that Gore had alerted Clinton in advance and that the president was
not upset. ``We knew there would be times when he differed with the
president,'' Siewert said. ``This is one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said: ``We've stated in the past we don't
believe congressional action is appropriate in this situation.
There is a father who speaks for his son and has made it very clear
that he wants to be reunited with him as soon as possible, and that
is what we are trying to do. The INS has received no credible
information that any of these family members wants to stay in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore, said the vice president
``clearly disagrees with the INS and the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's break with the administration is the most
dramatic of his campaign to date. Back in November, as Gore
struggled to assert his independence from the president and become
his own man, he told reporters: ``Running for president of this
country is far more important than being the best vice president I
can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has differed from administration policy in a
number of areas. He said he would require his appointees to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to support allowing gays to serve openly in
the military. He said he supported the use of marijuana for
medicinal purposes. And he has opposed a Clinton nominee to the
Federal Election Commission because that nominee, Bradley Smith,
opposes changing the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these matters has been a matter of national urgency,
as Elian's case has become.

HULL'S ROLE AT CONVENTION UNERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a normal year, there would be little doubt that Republican
Gov. Jane Hull would lead the state's delegation to the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia, a ceremonial but coveted job
traditionally reserved for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the ordinarily innocuous matter has more than a
few politicos biting their nails. Hull badly wants to fulfill her
traditional role, but Sen. John McCain, who controls the delegates
and feuded with Hull during his bid for the White House, is hiding
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Hull is maneuvering to lead the delegation.
But McCain also could head the group himself or back someone other
than Hull, a prominent supporter of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the GOP nomination sewed up, but after McCain won
Arizona's Feb. 22 primary, he technically owns all 30 of the state'
national delegates and has shown no interest in relinquishing them
to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very definitely I would want to be the chairman,'' Hull told
``The Arizona Republic'' this week. ``If there is a strong feeling
about someone else nominating John _ you know me, I would probably
defer to them. (But) my role, obviously, the standard role of the
governor, is to be chairman of the delegation. My feeling is that's
the way we proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always have problems. Are there a lot of people out
there that hold it against me that I chaired the Bush campaign? I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McCain had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, however, McCain announced that he has given
the Texas governor six of the delegates he won in Michigan,
allowing Gov. John Engler, a top Bush supporter, to attend the
convention as a Bush delegate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's reluctance to relinquish delegates has raised concerns
that many party activists, who tend to be Bush supporters, will be
pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and her aides are making it clear that there will be no
such contretemps in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned, the 30 delegates here are committed
to John McCain unless he releases us,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Her chief of staff was unambiguous about the need to put a
tourniquet on the flow of bad blood between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not meant to be a confrontational thing. Period,''
Rick Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Arizona delegation must be elected by
delegates to the state Republican Convention on May 13, and both
McCain and Hull are eligible to run. In 1992, for instance, Gov.
Fife Symington led the delegation, although he was forced to sit it
out at the last minute by a foot injury. In 1996, he again was
expected to lead the group but stepped aside after he was indicted
on charges of bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   For some McCain loyalists, the image of a delegation led by Hull
is, well, uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awkward,'' said Chuck Coughlin, a McCain supporter and
local lobbyist. ``She supported Governor Bush over John.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin suggested that it is Hull, rather than McCain, who
should compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody is slightly graceful about this, I'm sure there
is an amicable solution that can be worked out,'' Coughlin said.
``I guess we'll see how graceful the governor is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scenarios that have been discussed by McCain supporters
include the possibility of state Republican Party Chairman Mike
Minnaugh announcing the McCain votes, or having more than one
person lead the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl said that, ultimately, the matter of who
will lead the Arizona delegation will be decided by party activists
who are elected at the precinct level to go to the state GOP
convention in May. But, he added elliptically, the delegates likely
will be swayed by McCain's victory in the Arizona primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will certainly be informed by the fact that John McCain
won the Arizona primary, and I would think they would be somewhat
influenced by his desires,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull shows few signs of relenting. In fact, she has been
assiduously cultivating allies at the precinct level in preparation
for the state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Dunton, a former Steve Forbes supporter who is running for
convention delegate, said he expects both McCain and Hull to push
to lead the delegation. Ultimately, however, it should be the
governor's prerogative to lead the group regardless of McCain's
Arizona victory, Dunton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a (national) primary winner. She rode with the
winner,'' Dunton said. ``I would hope that we would unify and win
the election. That is the prime thing to do.''

ICAHN OFFERS PREMIUM FOR NABISCO SHARES
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By JOSEPH B. TREASTER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just 15 days after being rebuffed by the board of the Nabisco
Group Holdings Corp., Carl C. Icahn, the renowned investor,
appealed to shareholders on Thursday in a campaign to take over the
troubled maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the board that was widely distributed, Icahn
offered shareholders a premium of 40 percent for 100 million shares
that would give him control of the company. He offered $13 a share,
up from the stock's closing price of $9.3125 on Wednesday. Shares
of Nabisco closed Thursday at $11.75.
</P>
<P>
   And Icahn held out another carrot: Once in control, Icahn said,
he would immediately try to sell the company at what he expected
would be a ``very attractive price.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco shares, which had been trading at about $30 a year ago,
have been in decline in response to fears that as the former parent
of R.J. Reynolds, the cigarette maker, the holding company could be
liable for claims resulting from new tobacco litigation. The shares
have also suffered, analysts said, as investors shifted money from
consumer goods to technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco, whose board on March 15 adopted a shareholders rights,
or ``poison pill,'' measure designed to block Icahn, said it would
not comment until the board met and studied the proposal. In the
meantime, Nabisco urged its shareholders to sit tight. Henry A.
Sandbach, a spokesman for Nabisco, said he did not know when the
board would be meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco said on March 13 that it had been notified by Icahn, who
has been seeking control of Nabisco for five years, that he
intended to replace nine of the holding company's 12 board member
at the annual meeting scheduled for May 9. By March 13, Icahn had
increased his stake in Nabisco to 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on March 15, the board adopted the poison pill
measure to take effect should Icahn or any other shareholder gain
10 percent of Nabisco's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn, who is known for his buyout of Trans World Airlines and
takeover attempts of the USX Corp. and Texaco Inc., is the largest
individual shareholder of Nabisco with 31 million shares. With 100
million more shares, he said, he would own 40 percent of the
company. He has recently been reported to have taken a 5 percent
stake in the Federal-Mogul Corp., a company in which Julian H.
Robertson Jr., the head of the Tiger Management hedge fund, had
held a large position.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn characterized the poison pill measure as an expression
``of contempt for stockholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Goldman, a senior analyst at Merrill Lynch who follows
Nabisco, said there was no mistaking Icahn's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to appeal to investors so that investors will put
pressure on the board,'' Goldman said. ``He's going directly to the
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco has a complicated capital structure. Nabisco Group
Holdings, the stock that Icahn says he will buy, is the holding
company that owns 80.5 percent of Nabisco Group and no other
assets. As the former parent of R.J. Reynolds, it might be liable
for damages if litigation bankrupted Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Nabisco Group Holdings has traded at a substantial
discount to the market value of its stake in Nabisco Group. That
discount was slightly over 20 percent last summer, but it grew to
58 percent last month. Even with the rise in Nabisco Group Holdings
on Thursday, the discount is still 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Icahn urged the Nabisco board to rescind its
poison pill, remove other restrictions to ownership of large blocks
of the company's shares and reschedule the annual meeting to give
him time to buy the 100 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was unclear how investors would respond to the
proposal. The $13, some analysts said, may not seem remarkably
higher than the $15 at which the stock was trading as recently as
last September. And many, investors, they said, may hold out hopes
of a turnaround in market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nabisco is a great company and they have brands that are truly
old Americana,'' Goldman said. Despite the poor performance of
Nabisco stock, Goldman said, James Kilts, the chief executive of
the operating company, has done an excellent job. ``They have very
good management,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn has criticized management, particularly for its decision
to sell the tobacco units and retain the cookie and cracker
business. He argued that shareholders would have benefited more if
the company had kept the tobacco business and sold the other units.
But company executives said Nabisco might then have been accused of
fraudulently stripping away holdings that might otherwise be used
to pay tobacco litigation claims.
</P>
<P>
   Playing to concerns about potentially heavy liabilities, Icahn
on Thursday underscored that ``the clock is ticking on tobacco
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the risks facing shareholders, he said, were that ``if and
when the current board determines to sell'' there might ``be no
buyer.''

APRIL IS A BANNER MONTH FOR BIRDING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Our state's reputation as a world-class vacation
destination for birdwatchers is well-established, but this month
looms especially significant.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Great Texas Birding Classic, which continues to grow
in popularity and impact, is scheduled April 7-16 over a 624-mile
stretch from Orange to Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Also cause for celebration is the completion of the Great Texas
Coastal Birding Trail _ a four-year, $1.4 million project and the
first of its kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MANY BENEFICIARIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Birding Classic has multiple beneficiaries:
</P>
<P>
   _ It serves as a highly competitive venue: Last year, 39 teams _
professional and amateur, including eight youth teams _ vied to see
which could count the most species (with 312 the winning number).
Contestants represented 10 states and five foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ It introduces newcomers to many of the 618 bird species
recorded in the state. Novice and advanced amateur birders, while
not involved in the competition, savor the spring migration
spectacle as millions of birds pass through on their way to
Northern summer habitats.
</P>
<P>
   _ It pours money into individual communities' tourism coffers
and the overall Texas economy. Indeed, birding generates an
estimated $155 million in annual retail sales within the state.
</P>
<P>
   _ It enhances bird conservation by linking private corporations
with competitive teams. Through corporate and local community
support and tournament entry fees, last year's event generated
$50,000 for avian habitat conservation in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the Classic's winning
teams since 1997 have directed more than $150,000 to help buy more
than 1,000 acres of emergent intertidal coastal wetlands, expand
existing bird sanctuaries, re-vegetate landscapes with native brush
valuable to migratory birds and pay back loans used to buy habitat
areas and fund long-term monitoring of high-priority migratory
birds.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Classic, sponsored by Texas Parks and Wildlife and
Texas Partners in Flight, begins April 7 with an opening ceremony
in Brownsville (5:30 p.m. at the Holiday Inn Fort Brown).
Competition starts April 9 on the lower Texas coast, moves to the
central coast April 12 and to the upper coast April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-up registration will be allowed on April 7. Call
888-892-4737 for more information, or access
www.tpwd.state.tx.us/gtbc.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BIRDING TRAIL EXTENDED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 event coincides with the official opening of the Great
Texas Coastal Birding Trail's southern segment, which spotlights 88
sites along 16 loops, primarily in the lower Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   This portion of the trail extends south from near Riviera to
Brownsville, then winds along the Rio Grande to Laredo. It includes
Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park, near Mission, where a $12
million World Birding Center is planned.
</P>
<P>
   A new map, produced in conjunction with the Texas Department of
Transportation, pinpoints sites in the southern segment and will be
available by April 17. Maps covering other portions of the trail
already are published. These can be obtained free at chambers of
commerce, visitors bureaus, state parks and wildlife refuges along
the trail and at Texas Travel Information Centers. They can also be
ordered by calling 888-892-4737.
</P>
<P>
   Using the three trail maps, travelers are guided by numbered,
colored symbols that correspond to 308 birding sites designated
along the trail. Maps include directions to each site, information
about birds and other wildlife commonly seen in that area, the
availability of overnight camping facilities and tourism
information.
</P>
<P>
   All the major sites in south Texas _ from the King Ranch outside
Kingsville to Sabal Palm Audubon Center and Sanctuary in
Brownsville _ are featured. And, according to Texas Parks and
Wildlife's nature tourism program director Linda Campbell, ``The
new map makes some of the lesser-known birding hot spots in the
Valley easier to find, such as state wildlife management areas and
county and city parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Several south Texas communities, aware of the increased impact
on tourism, have published localized birding guides also available
free of charge. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rockport/Fulton: Call 800-242-0071.
</P>
<P>
   _ Corpus Christi: 800-678-6232.
</P>
<P>
   _ Harlingen: 800-531-7346.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brownsville: 800-626-2639.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive, too, are the advances on Texas Parks and Wildlife's
Web site. Accessed from www.tpwd.state.tx.us/gtbc, pages include a
kids' guide to birdwatching; a ``birding 101'' listing of popular
sites; a calendar of migration events; a birding checklist; and
reminders on birding ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the April issue of Texas Parks and Wildlife magazine will
be designed as a birding information resource. Available at many
bookstores and supermarkets the first week of next month, the
stylish publication will include a 2000 events calendar.

AUSSIE FINDS FERTILE GROUND FOR SPRINT CAR DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 CAR-DREAMS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Brooke Tatnell is like a lot of Sprint Car
drivers. He dreamed of one day racing with the Pennzoil World of
Outlaws and beating the likes of Steve Kinser, Sammy Swindell and
Danny Lasoski.
</P>
<P>
   Tatnell is living that dream. Only, he had to go halfway across
the world to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Tatnell, 28, is a native of Australia, from a town near Sydney,
and has been driving Sprint Cars since he was 16 years old. Now he
is running full time on the rigorous Outlaws circuit in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to make a career out of driving race cars,
particularly Sprint Cars, America is the only place you can do
it,'' Tatnell said before Thursday's first day of the Southern
Bleacher Classic at the Texas Motor Speedway dirt track. ``We have
the land mass the United States has, but we don't have the
population to make a good living in Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatnell's father raced Sprint Cars, which meant he was around
the sport most of his life. Tatnell follows a long line of
Australians, led by Garry Rush _ the Steve Kinser of Australian
Sprint Car racing _ who came to the United States to race the light
and powerful cars.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Car racing is one of the best attended sports in
Australia, Tatnell said, with 4,000 to 5,000 people at a race.
</P>
<P>
   He won the World Series of Sprint Cars tour in Australia this
winter after winning six out of 17 races and finishing in the top
five in all the events.
</P>
<P>
   Tatnell first ventured to the United States in 1991, when he had
his equipment shipped over, and that first year was a learning
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gained a lot of experience, learning about the business
sort of things,'' Tatnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Tatnell has raced on the Outlaws tour full time for the past two
years. After driving for himself last year, he is now driving for
Lonny Parsons in the No. 6 Casey's General Stores Maxim.
</P>
<P>
   After a seventh-place finish in the second race at Perris Motor
Speedway in Lake Perris, Calif., the team and Tatnell have
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Through five events he is not in the top 20 in points, but he
said the struggles have been good for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new team we got here and fortunately in this sport
nothing happens overnight,'' Tatnell said. ``We are trying to jell
as a team and get the right equipment that suits my driving style.
This has been a good bonding thing and really grown to work with
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatnell said that he lived in Memphis, Tenn., last year. But
since the Casey's General Stores team is based out of Des Moines,
Iowa, he now lives in a motel.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to eventually buy a motor home, but he is happy
just to be racing on the Outlaws tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done more racing in the last three years than I have in
the previous nine,'' Tatnell said. ``One year in the Outlaw deal is
five years in Australia.'' nn

ADVERTISING: COALITION WORKS TO BE FAMILY FRIENDLY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ohio, Calif.) (mg) 
By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Efforts by marketers to generate more ``family friendly''
programming to sponsor during primetime on television networks are
accelerating, representatives of the companies involved have
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of marketers, known as the Family Friendly
Programming Forum, outlined the most recent developments, which
include a holiday movie special to run on CBS, at the annual
Television Advertising Forum on Thursday sponsored by the
Association of National Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The forum drew more than 280 executives from consumer product
companies, agencies, TV networks and program syndicators, who also
heard discussions on topics like convergence, technology and
audience measurement.
</P>
<P>
   Forty members of the association are also members of the
programming coalition, which seeks to stimulate the production of
shows meant to appeal to broader, multigenerational audiences and
suitable to run from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific times).
The initiative is indicative of the increasing attention being paid
to such viewers, who remain crucial to the success of mass
marketers even in an era of aiming programs and products at
narrower segments of the general population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to sit and watch TV with our families and not be
embarrassed,'' said Steve Johnston, vice president for advertising
and brand management at Nationwide Mutual Enterprises in Columbus,
Ohio. ``I've got two teen-age daughters, and there are programs I'm
embarrassed to watch with them. Maybe they're not, but I know I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the coalition are such advertising giants as
AT&AMP;T, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Coca-Cola, Ford Motors, General Motors,
Gillette, I.B.M., Kellogg, McDonald's, Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Unilever United States.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is getting some attention because of concerns
that the programs produced under its auspices may be more suitable
for viewers of the 20th century than the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the contemporary American family does not
resemble the ``nuclear'' model that prevailed during the decades
when major marketers routinely produced TV programs. And viewing
habits have substantially changed as children, teen-agers, parents
and grandparents scatter to different rooms to watch different
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be realistic; families may not be gathered around
one TV any more and they're not your traditional families,'' said
Susan Frank, executive vice president and general manager of the
Odyssey Network in Studio City, Calif., a cable channel that has
been refocused on family-oriented programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are times you can bring family members together with
content that's thought-provoking, done in a good, quality way,''
she added. ``You have to be relevant to the way people live
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Odyssey, owned by Hallmark Entertainment; the Jim Henson Co.;
and the Warner Brothers unit of Time Warner are sponsoring a
32-page advertising section about the programming coalition that
will run in the April 10 issues of the trade publications Adweek,
Brandweek and Mediaweek.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the coalition, which began in 1998 with 10
marketers, does not mean that members will shun ``dramatic
programming that touches on controversial subjects,'' said J.
Andrea Alstrup, vice president for advertising at Johnson &AMP; Johnson
in New Brunswick, N.J., who heads the programming coalition along
with Robert L. Wehling, global marketing officer at Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying everything should be sweet all the time,''
Alstrup said. ``We're saying that in the early hours of prime time,
up to 10 o'clock, there's a need for entertainment that people can
enjoy together, intergenerationally.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Johnson &AMP; Johnson is one of three members of the
programming coalition that will collaborate with CBS on the holiday
special, Alstrup said. The special is to be a two-hour movie titled
``The Flight of the Reindeer'' that is to run before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the special was coordinated by Bill Cella,
executive vice president for broadcast and programming at
McCann-Erickson North America in New York, part of McCann-Erickson
Worldwide Advertising. The agency, a unit of the McCann-Erickson
World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, works
for Johnson &AMP; Johnson and the other two marketers. Cella identified
one as Nestle USA and said the other declined to be identified at
this time.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has also agreed to broadcast the second annual presentation
of the Family Program Awards show sponsored by the programming
coalition; the broadcast has been scheduled for late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Nationwide are among 12 members of the
programming coalition that have donated $1 million to a
script-development fund that is a joint effort with the WB network,
owned by Time Warner and the Tribune Co. Eight scripts have been
developed through the fund, half of which have produced orders for
pilots or presentations for this year and next.

   Alstrup said that two are ``definitely'' being considered for
the lineup for the fall 2000 season, which will be decided by WB
executives in May. One is ``Finally Home,'' featuring the actress
Melissa Gilbert, about a husband and wife who, after the deaths of
their twins, take in foster children, and the other is ``Gilmore
Girls,'' about a mother and daughter with a close relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Wonder if they are as close as the actress Angelina Jolie
was with her brother, James Haven Voight, when she won her Academy
Award on Sunday night. But that might be too family friendly even
for the folks at the Family Friendly Programming Forum.

YAHOO SAYS IT IS DISCUSSING INTERNET PRIVACY WITH FTC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yahoo Inc. on Thursday notified the Securities
and Exchange Commission that it was voluntarily cooperating with an
inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission into how Internet sites
gather personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo officials played down the inclusion of the information in
the annual report, stating that the company was just being
``extremely conservative in legal documents'' and that it took its
privacy policies seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But financial analysts said the disclosure underscored a larger,
and more profound, point. In deciding that the FTC inquiry was
material enough to include in an SEC filing, Yahoo has also
indicated how important the mining of demographic data on one hand
and concerns about consumer privacy on the other can be to an
Internet company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an implication that the FTC could use their disclosure
to help set industry guidelines which could impact their ability to
use that information,'' said Jordan Rohan, a media analyst with Wit
Soundview, a New York-based investment banking firm. Referring to
data gathering, he added, ``It's almost an admission that rules may
change or may become more concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure also underscored the FTC's emergence as the
primary regulator of e-commerce. In recent months, it has begun
inquiries into the Web practices of several companies, most notably
the data-gathering practices of DoubleClick Inc., and it has
wielded considerable authority over the gathering of data about
minors online.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hunt, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said the discussions with the
FTC had ``nothing to do with advertising profiling.'' However, she
declined to elaborate on the nature of the disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   David Medine, the associate director for financial practices for
the FTC, declined to acknowledge that an inquiry was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, however, acknowledged having been contacted
by the commission after the release of a survey in February by the
nonprofit California HealthCare Foundation, which concluded that
while 19 of the top 21 health sites had privacy policies, many did
not live up to promises not to share personal information with
third parties.
</P>
<P>
   The survey included not only major health-care-only sites, like
Healtheon/WebMD, but also so-called portals like Yahoo and Excite,
which offer numerous services, including health-related content.
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Smith, an Internet security expert and one of the
researchers on the survey, said a common problem on sites was that
visitors did not know how many companies might have access to their
personal data. For example, a visitor might fill out a health care
survey on one site, but the data could be processed by a
third-party contractor, making the information more widely
available than had been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Web sites say they are not gathering
information about individuals but are gathering general demographic
data about, for example, the nature of their subscriber base to
sell to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Rohan, from Wit Capital, said Web sites were justifiably
concerned about being able to continue gathering demographic
information. Advertisers, he said, are willing to pay substantially
more _ 7 to 10 times as much _ for the ability to direct messages
to prescreened audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's disclosure suggests that the controversy about data
gathering is hitting the mainstream, said Lanny Baker, an analyst
at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire industry's been hiding under their desks and
letting Doubleclick take it on the chin,'' Baker said. But
DoubleClick, he said, is ``not doing anything that anyone else
isn't doing.''

CELL PHONES BLAMED FOR `911' FALSE ALARMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of cell phone users are calling 911 by accident,
clogging the Valley's emergency switchboards and tying up operators
for crucial minutes as they try to determine whether the caller is
in need of help.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit apparently is the one-touch button on many phones
that's pre-programmed to dial 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a national problem,'' said Jim Wortham, the system
administrator for the Maricopa Association of 911 Emergency
Telephone Systems, which coordinates Maricopa County's 911
operation. He estimates that 15 to 20 percent of all 911 cell phone
calls are made in error.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental calls often occur when the phone is jostled in a
purse or car, Wortham said, and owners are unaware of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's burdening the system,'' said Deputy Chief Robert Khan of
the Phoenix Fire Department, whose wife accidentally called 911
when her phone activated while in her purse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had open lines while operators try to determine whether
there was a car accident, a shooting or a fire, only to find that
it's just someone singing along with their car radio,'' Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix 911 dispatchers alone receive about 500 accidental cell
phone calls daily. Other communities average 10 to 30, Wortham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said cell phone users can reduce the bogus calls by
turning off their phones when they are not in use or by being more
careful handling them. Officials said cell phone owners also can
reprogram the button to make sure it doesn't call 911 if pushed by
accident. &QL;

FATHER'S GOLDEN TOUCH GIVES INNOVATIVE SMITHS A RADICAL STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Stevie Smith did not have to do much
convincing to have his father work with him on his Pennzoil World
of Outlaw team.
</P>
<P>
   That's strange considering Smith's father, Steve, spent most of
his Sprint Car career racing around their New Oxford, Pa., home.
The elder Smith rarely traveled, but now he's out on the road with
his son.
</P>
<P>
   Steve, though, wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before I quit driving, (Stevie) wanted to start his own
team,'' Steve said. ``We always wanted to go together and have our
own race team down the road. He definitely wants to be on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevie Smith started the team after the 1996 season and ran most
of the 1997 season without a sponsor, and his father served as the
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the 1997 season, Ingersoll-Rand signed on as a
sponsor and the team took off. In 1998, Smith led the points for
two weeks in May and led the series with 13 victories. Smith Racing
had some engine troubles midway through the season and ended fourth
in points.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Stevie finished fourth again and had five victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a load off my shoulders,'' Stevie said of having his
father around. ``I don't have to do all the worrying. It's hard for
one guy to do it all, and I would like to keep it in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevie started racing Sprint Cars in his late teens in Central
Pennsylvania, while his father was already an established local
star. He later ventured onto the World of Outlaws tour in 1990, and
won the rookie of the year honors while driving for Al Hamilton,
</P>
<P>
   Stevie drove for a few other teams before starting his own team
in 1997, but he always had plans for his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie said his father ``was one of the best. Everybody kind of
expected that out of me, but I didn't know what to expect. I did my
own thing and I didn't try to outdo him and not try to be as good
as he was, but to the best I could for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevie has continued his father's tradition by building the own
equipment. The team uses a Smith chassis they designed and built
along with their own engines.
</P>
<P>
   Steve was known as one of the innovators in Sprint Car racing,
despite seldom racing outside of Sprint Car-crazed Central
Pennsylvania. Some of the sprint cars he built were radical and
were much different from the standard sprint car.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths don't have quite as radical car on the Outlaw series,
but there are a few things they do that other teams wouldn't try.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths were one of the first to use side rails on the roll
cage to provide more protection for the driver. Plus, they
experimented with a Sprint Car that used coil-over shock suspension
instead of the more common torsion bar suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't let you do much because if you come out there with
a car looking completely different, (the series officials) don't
want to argue with 40 other cars,'' Steve said. ``So, you just got
to keep up and do what you can the best you can. Out here on this
deal, you ain't going to have anything ahead of them for very
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the changing face of the Outlaw series, where teams can
buy any part they want anywhere, the Smiths still use equipment
they can call their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is part of it for me,'' Steve said. ``I have always run
my own cars and normally done my own motors. But (you feel) that
little extra if it is your stuff. That's part of the fun, but,
really, it is almost too much work for the time that we have to get
it done.'' nn

FED ISN'T TRYING TO CURB STOCK PRICES, SAYS GREENSPAN IN LETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told
members of Congress in a letter made public Thursday that the
central bank's goal in raising interest rates was not to bring down
the stock market, and he reiterated his opposition to growing calls
for the Fed to make it more difficult for investors to buy stock
with borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and chairman of the House
Banking Committee, Greenspan said the Fed ``is not `jawboning' the
stock market or targeting stock prices.'' The letter was in
response to written questions from the committee to Greenspan after
his appearance on Capitol Hill in February.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Greenspan said, the central bank is concerned that the
economy is reaching a point at which it cannot meet the sustained
high level of demand for goods and services _ and that the long
rise in the stock market, by making people feel wealthier, is
supporting that demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharp increase in equity valuation appears to have been an
important factor behind an apparently developing imbalance,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has long struggled with how monetary policy should
take account of sharp swings in asset prices. Ever since he used
the phrase ``irrational exuberance'' in discussing the stock market
in December 1996, investors have been suspicious that he is trying
to talk down the markets.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Greenspan has said that he does not know
whether stocks are overvalued _ but that in either case the wealth
being generated on Wall Street is contributing so much to the
accelerated pace of economic growth that the Fed cannot ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   To many economists and analysts, the distinction being drawn by
Greenspan _ that monetary policy does not single out stock prices,
but that the rise in stock prices will almost certainly have to be
tempered or reversed for monetary policy to be successful _ is so
fine as to be meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   And as he has put the stock market at the center of the debate
over monetary policy, Greenspan has come under pressure not to drag
down the entire economy, especially with inflation so restrained,
just to put a ceiling on the stock market's rise.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Leach whether it would be better to try to rein in the
stock market not by raising interest rates but by tightening
requirements on margin lending _ buying stock with borrowed money _
Greenspan said that ``changes in such requirements have no
appreciable and predictable effect'' on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed chairman issued a veiled warning about the rapid
rise in margin lending at a time when the markets are gyrating
wildly and technology stocks in particular are on a roller coaster
ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, he said, ``recognizes that considerable risks can be
involved in the purchase of equity on margin, especially in
volatile markets, and believes that lenders and borrowers need to
assess carefully the risks they are assuming'' in using margin
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Greenspan said in response to a question from Rep.
Ron Paul, R-Texas, the path of stock prices will be determined not
by the short-term interest rates the Fed controls, but by corporate
performance and overall interest rates in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The risks ``of investing in equities come primarily from
uncertainty about future earnings and about the longer-term
interest rates at which those future earnings should be discounted,
and not mainly from the possibility that the short-term cost of
financing stock positions could increase,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, even if our operating procedures were associated
with somewhat larger movements in short-term rates, I doubt that
investors' perceptions of equity risks would be much affected and
thus that equity prices would be significantly influenced.''  &QL;

ASBESTOS-BEARING VERMICULITE SOLD AT SEATTLE GARDEN STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vermiculite from a closed mine in Libby, Mont., where
hundreds of workers and their families died of asbestos-related
diseases is being sold in garden stores in the Puget Sound area,
the Post-Intelligencer has found.
</P>
<P>
   That product, Zonolite Chemical Packaging Vermiculite produced
by W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., was found to have alarmingly high levels of
asbestos in recent testing by the Environmental Protection Agency
and the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA, sophisticated air sampling of the Zonolite
detected asbestos fibers at levels up to 80 times higher than the
exposure to workers allowed by the federal Office of Safety and
Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Grace said that it discontinued the product in 1992. The tracing
number on bags of Zonolite found at Chubby and Tubby, a small chain
of Seattle hardware stores, show the bags contained vermiculite
from the Grace mine in Libby. The Zonolite was packaged at a Grace
plant in Santa Ana, Calif., ``in August 1991, most likely on the
third shift,'' said William Corcoran, Grace's vice president of
public and regulatory affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran said he was surprised ``that a product discontinued
eight years ago is still available today'' and added that he had no
idea who was selling the material, but it wasn't Grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemical packing material,'' he said, ``is not now, nor was it
ever, intended to be sold in lawn-and-garden sections of
home-improvement stores.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA investigators found the Zonolite on the top shelf of a local
garden store while they were gathering garden products for asbestos
testing. They tested the Zonolite by using it the same way that
gardeners described when they called the agency to ask if the
material was safe.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have notified three Seattle stores where they
bought the products of the test results, but there appears to be no
effort to spread the word to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on limited sampling we've completed, we cannot make
broad determinations on what products are or are not safe, just
yet,'' said Bill Dunbar, a spokesman for EPA's regional office.
``Our testing is part of a national effort to determine what
consumer products have asbestos in them and until those studies are
complete, it would be irresponsible to take any product off the
shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that EPA is reluctant to caution the public about a
possible risk from this out-of-date product worries some in the
agency, especially those investigating possible continued asbestos
contamination near the mine at Libby and at the more than 250
operations across the country where Grace or its customers
processed Zonolite from the early 1960s to the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Mike DiCecco, general manger of Chubby and Tubby, didn't wait to
be ordered to remove the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the EPA told me that the material was contaminated with
asbestos, I ordered it taken off the shelves, I'm just not going to
take a chance that a customer buys something dangerous from us,''
DiCecco said.
</P>
<P>
   According to calls from readers who read the P-I's series on
Libby in November, Zonolite Chemical Packaging Vermiculite also was
being sold in southern and eastern Washington, Oregon, Michigan,
Missouri, Texas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   DiCecco says he's not sure where the Zonolite he removed from
the shelves came from ``but about two years ago we bought 150 bags
from a liquidator from Tacoma. Once we saw the W.R. Grace label, we
were confident it was vermiculite because they had made it in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   A manager of another garden store in Kent, Wash., also said he
had bought it from a wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   The material, which is vermiculite ore expanded popcorn-like in
a heat process, looks identical to what gardeners use to mix with
peat and soil. Used worldwide as a packaging for chemicals, the
vermiculite not only cushions the material but also absorbs liquid
if a container should break or leak.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials may not think they have enough evidence to warn
consumers but at EPA's regional environmental testing laboratory,
across Puget Sound in Manchester, Wash., lab chemists don't want
the stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the packaging material is used for the purpose for
which it was designed, people are concerned about the hazard.
</P>
<P>
   In a large hangar-like warehouse adjacent to the area where the
testing of lawn products is being conducted, sit several barrels of
vermiculite, packaging from boxes of samples and chemicals used in
the lab. On shelves on the second floor are several large unopened
Kraft paper bags of the same type of Zonolite packaging material
which was contaminated with asbestos. They were purchased years ago
from a garden store in Port Orchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't use it any more for shipments received at the
laboratory,'' said Gerald Dodo, an EPA chemist and contract
officer. ``The coolers and boxes they use to ship samples to us are
packed with vermiculite. We just don't want people here to deal
with it because the exposure could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``A simple painter's or dust mask isn't going to do anything to
stop asbestos fibers, so it would be better not to deal with it at
all,'' Dodo said.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the EPA familiar with the test results say that OSHA
should be notified, so lab workers in other labs are aware of the
potential risk.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to DiCecco, signs have been posted near the
cash registers at the Chubby and Tubby stores saying ``Due to an
EPA investigation, we have pulled vermiculite off our sales
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not going to sell any of it until EPA completes its
investigation. It's not worth the risk.''

DIME BANCORP SUES SALOMON IN DISPUTE OVER HOSTILE BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Doing all it can to fend off a hostile takeover bid,
Dime Bancorp is suing its former investment bankers for going to
work for its unwanted suitor, North Fork Bancorp.
</P>
<P>
   Dime, which owns the Dime Savings Bank of New York, asked a
state court Wednesday to stop Salomon Smith Barney from serving as
a financial adviser to North Fork, a banking company that is
pressing Dime to accept a $1.9 billion buyout offer. North Fork,
based in Melville, rode in a few weeks ago, just as Dime's
shareholders were about to vote on a proposed purchase of Dime by
Hudson United Bancorp, based in Mahwah, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Judge Ira Gammerman declined to issue a
temporary restraining order sought by Dime and gave Salomon's
lawyers until Wednesday afternoon to explain why he should not stop
the firm from advising Dime.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Dime prevails in court, it would still have to contend
with North Fork and its other financial adviser, a smaller firm
called Sandler, O'Neill &AMP; Partners. After two postponements, Dime's
shareholders are scheduled to vote May 17 on Hudson United's
proposed $1.4 billion stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   Dime contends that Salomon Smith Barney agreed in May 1997,
while advising Dime on an acquisition, not to represent any company
on a bid for Dime without its consent.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Salomon, a unit of Citigroup, said the firm
merely pledged that it would not share any confidential information
it gathered while working for Dime.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over conflicts of interest involving investment banks
usually center on the disclosure of confidential information, but
that is difficult to prove. In an attempt to thwart an unsolicited
takeover by Vodafone AirTouch in November, Mannesmann of Germany
filed suit in London accusing the Goldman Sachs Group of a similar
betrayal. That suit was thrown out, and Goldman continued advising
Vodafone on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Dime is arguing that Salomon is violating a
contract it signed as Dime's adviser on its purchase of the North
American Mortgage Co. in 1997. Dime contends that part of the
agreement, for which Salomon received $1.5 million in fees, was
that Salomon would refrain from working on any bid for Dime for
three years. People close to Dime said the bank was troubled by the
involvement of James Harasimowicz, a Salomon investment banker, who
worked with Dime on the North American Mortgage deal .
</P>
<P>
   Duncan King, a Salomon spokesman, said Harasimowicz, a director
at the firm, has worked on both deals but was not the lead banker
on either.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a prepared statement, King said: ``Dime is intentionally
misrepresenting the previous agreement in an effort to thwart the
transaction. The prior agreement does not preclude Salomon Smith
Barney from advising North Fork. It simply precludes our use of any
confidential information gained while advising Dime three years
ago. We are confident that we have completely respected our client
agreements.''  &QL;

   PHILADELPHIA _ When 63-year-old Marilyn McDonald walked off the
plane, it took her maybe a second to figure out where she was.
</P>
<P>
   Banners, posters, designated greeters all telling her that she
was in the city that's playing host to the 2000 NCAA women's Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Philadelphia, host city of this year's women's
Final Four,'' blared a representative covered in ``PWB2000''
attire, who then handed out brochures about hotels, tourist
attractions and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a women's basketball game? Since when did this
become a big deal?
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure wasn't like this when I started coming to these 12
years ago,'' said McDonald, a resident of Walters, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's first capital might never play host to an Olympics
or a Super Bowl, but when it throws a party, it lets everyone know
about it. Even for a sport that, until recently, was never given
this type of hype.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA women's Final Four, in its 19th year, has become an
event the Ann Meyers, C. Vivian Stringers and Jody Conradts worked
for years to build: a prime-time championship that can stand on its
own, full of fan fervor and an abundance of media coverage and
corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too often you can go somewhere and people are calling
your name and holding up signs,'' Tennessee star Tamika Catchings
said. ``You've got a lot of young athletes out there getting
excited about playing basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, yes. In 1982, it was a little different.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA sponsored its first women's basketball Final Four in
1982 in Norfolk, Va., but few took notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were the NCAAs, but I wasn't in tune so much with
the game that led to our being, you know, a member of the Final
Four,'' said Rutgers' Stringer, who coached in the first Final Four
when she was with Cheyney State University.
</P>
<P>
   The three games drew a combined 15,531 fans with the title game
on national television _ a big deal back then. But, few knew who
the players or coaches were. Remember, not all universities
embraced women's basketball. It wasn't until the late 1970s that
legislation forced Title IX equity compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My enthusiasm is exactly the same (as it was in 1982),''
Stringer said. ``but I think that when I look at this press room
and all the people that are here, this was nowhere near the size
that it was there. There has been a tremendous revolution that has
taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   People know who Tennessee coach Pat Summitt is. People know that
Connecticut is dominating the game. They know Catchings is regarded
as one of the best college players, ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably no more significant to the players who are in
the game,'' Texas coach Jody Conradt said. ``It's all about
awareness. It's about how the media views the game and its
coverage. Once we started to get fans who really started to support
the programs and the players themselves, there was a feeling that
this can be big.''
</P>
<P>
   It is big ... it's just taken awhile.
</P>
<P>
   While the men's tournament has enjoyed huge TV ratings and fan
interest for years, the women's Final Four has just recently begun
to see similar results.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 10 years of the women's Final Four, the average
three-game attendance was 19,659. Since 1992, however, the women's
event has averaged 33,536 fans, topped by the 46,582 figure in 1996
at the Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped that I would live long enough to see some of this
happen,'' said recently retired Baylor coach Sonja Hogg, who won
the NCAA's first national title with Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change, however, is the grail for all sporting
events: television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Final Four was split between ESPN and CBS with no
day off in between. The semifinals were on ESPN before the men's
national semis. Translation: You had to know where to look and when
to look to watch the games. In 1994, the NCAA and ESPN agreed to a
seven-year contract beginning in 1996, allowing the sport to run
its own event with clear boundaries between its brothers, and for a
day off between games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA was looking for prime-time coverage and a rest day,''
ESPN spokesperson Josh Krulewitz said. ``This is a tremendous
property for us and it's been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   How successful? The 1999 title game between Duke and Purdue drew
a 4.3 rating on ESPN. That is equivalent to 3.24 million homes. It
was the second highest rating for a basketball game, men's or
women's, in the 20-year history of the network.
</P>
<P>
   The people in women's basketball aren't crazy about it, but a
sign of its progression as a big-time sporting event can be seen in
casinos, too. Oddsmakers in Las Vegas set lines on semifinals and
finals _ the only three women's games of the year where betting
odds are established.
</P>
<P>
   Lost amid the glitter of sold-out arenas and television coverage
rests some issues for the Final Four, and the tournament itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question it will continue to
grow,'' NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said. ``We're putting a lot
of money into it. It's not one of the profit sports, yet, and
neither is the tournament. The men's (tournaments) have been
profitable for some years, but it took them some time.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is guessing the timetable when the tournament will become
self-sufficient. There is talk among leaders in the sport of going
to neutral-site games in the first two rounds, which are now being
played on campus sites, but the concern is how well the games will
draw without a host school. There is also discussion of how to get
all 63 tournament games on television, equivalent to the men's
tournament. Another concern is the dominance by a few schools, such
as Tennessee and Connecticut. More parity would drive interest,
many believe.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt is also concerned that, despite the heavy media
coverage, the event it overshadowed by the men's Final Four on the
same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest disappointment is the lack of coverage
compared to the men,'' Summitt said. ``Should we move (the time)?
Are we getting the type of exposure we want? I'm not sure, but if
we don't want to compete, we should take a look at the format.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the Final Four from its ``why-is-this-on-TV?''
beginnings to its current ``what-time-is-it-on?'' state suggests
that all of above can happen. And it might not take long.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``I never thought it would be like this.'' nn

CITIZENS: BUZZ OFF, CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, the number of toilets people have is sacred.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott joined others earlier
this week urging citizens to skip intrusive census questions, like
those about bathrooms. But even before the Mississippi Republican's
privacy push, people were wary of Census 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They say the census is too nosy, that the government doesn't
need to know whether they have a phone, their mortgage amount or
how they get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials defended the 52-question survey Thursday,
saying only one question was added since the 1990 count (asking
about grandparents as caregivers) and only one in six people gets
the longer form.
</P>
<P>
   The census may not have changed in the past 10 years, but we
have. Think Caller ID, unpublished numbers, identity theft, paper
shredders and the ease of Internet information, all virtually
unheard of 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 12 percent of Arizonans have that little box alerting them
who's on the other end of the phone line and shredders were a top
Christmas gift last year. Combine that with a growing mistrust of
the government, and you get a population that's defensive about its
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in an increasingly privacy-conscious world,''
says Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a
San Diego-based consumer group. ``People are concerned about the
census. They are saying, `I don't see a need for the census to know
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say Lott and other members of Congress now
complaining about the form actually approved it.
</P>
<P>
   And the survey will help decide how to dole out $185 billion in
federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they pause and look at how the information is being used,
my guess is they will actually see its usefulness,'' says Kenneth
Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But Sylvia Allen, 53, of Heber, can't understand why the
government needs to know who in her house can't dress himself or
bathe on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally invasive. They've gone too far on some of the
questions,'' Allen says. She understands that the government needs
to count people and will fill out her form, but she might not
answer all the questions. ``Some just don't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Tilford, 34, of Phoenix, reluctantly filled out the long
form. ``It's so intrusive,'' he says. ``I feel like they threatened
me into doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't fill out the form, census officials say, are
subject to a $100 fine. But census officials admit they've never
fined anyone.
</P>
<P>
   However, they soon will call people who didn't fill out their
entire forms in order to get all questions answered.
</P>
<P>
   So far, census officials have counted the number of forms
returned (46 percent in Arizona), but not how many questions were
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt says he's unsure whether lawmakers' suggestions will
influence people.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., urged people to
answer only the first six questions, then return it with a letter
of protest.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen people called the office of Rep. John Shadegg,
R-Ariz., saying they were uncomfortable with some questions.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona congressmen say they are reassuring their
constituents, telling them to fill out the form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't come back to haunt you in any way,'' says Keith
Rosenblum, press secretary for Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe. ``We are
a society in the Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials, by law, cannot share their information with
the Internal Revenue Service or anyone else. Although after 72
years, forms can be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep trying to tell them, it doesn't matter what they tell
us, we can't share it, not even with the president,'' says Jim
Howard, a local census office director.
</P>
<P>
   But when the president admits on television that he lied to the
American people, some don't believe government promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that people are more sensitive to privacy
issues, but it's not the individual information we're interested
in,'' Howard says. ``It's as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as people grow more concerned about their privacy, they are
revealing more about themselves, points out Professor David Sorkin
of Chicago's John Marshall Law School and an expert on privacy law.
</P>
<P>
   They are using grocery saver cards, which tell the store their
favorite ice cream and which deodorant they use. On the Internet,
they tell newspapers which stories they read and booksellers what
titles they buy.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Givens of the privacy group says people are trying to
guard their privacy more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they don't have control of their personal
information,'' she says. ``So, they don't want to give it out.'' &QL;

CLERGY AND LABOR CALL ATTENTION TO WORKING POOR
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)  (mg) 
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On college campuses and farmers' fields, in churches
and immigration detention centers, and across a range of religious
and political beliefs, people are fasting. They do it to make a
statement, to draw attention, to make a personal kind of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Across New York state this week, more than a thousand people,
from the Roman Catholic bishop of Albany to janitors in Buffalo,
have joined in one of the country's largest fasts, this one to
protest low wages and concerns about the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Fasting, of course, has been a spiritual undertaking and
sociopolitical tool for centuries, and the lineup of famous fasters
is vast and varied: Gandhi, Cesar Chavez, Dick Gregory and, of
course, Jesus of Nazareth. But fasting, it appears, is seeing a
modest revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a definite increase in fasting,'' said Kim Bobo,
executive director of the National Interfaith Committee for Worker
Justice. ``Fasting has always been in the Christian, Jewish and
Muslim tradition, and as people of faith seek increasingly to
struggle for justice in this time of abundance, it's a natural
outgrowth that fasting would be something they do.''
</P>
<P>
   To many, the power of fasting, personal and political, feels
especially strong in New York, where many of the streets, beginning
with Wall Street and extending deep into the suburbs, seem to be
awash in money and an obsession with wealth and excess.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Howard Hubbard of Albany said New York's religious and
labor leaders initiated a 40-hour fast because they were upset that
the problems of poor workers were drawing so little attention.
Fasting, he said, is a way to make an unmistakable moral statement
when so much of the populace is preoccupied with stock options and
sybaritic consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is mesmerized these days by the soaring stock market
and how people seem to be doing so well economically, yet the gap
between the richest and the poorest is wider than it's been in
decades,'' said Bishop Hubbard, who is co-chairman of the New York
State Labor-Religion Coalition, which organized the fast.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Brockport, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and New York
City, hundreds of clergy members, labor leaders, college students
and others began fasting at 8 p.m. on Wednesday. Subsisting on only
water and juice, they have prayed together and joined street
demonstrations to draw attention to a group they call ``invisible
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   These workers include janitors in Buffalo who earn $5.25 an
hour, farm workers in Sullivan County who must work 70 hours a week
and cafeteria workers at the State University of New York in Albany
who cannot afford medical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers are fasting during the same week that six
students at Purdue University in Indiana are doing so to pressure
the university's administration to do more to ensure that apparel
bearing the Purdue name is not made in sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, six students at the University of California at
Berkeley fasted for eight days to demand more instructors for the
ethnic studies department. In 1998, half a dozen tomato pickers in
Immokalee, Fla., fasted for a month to protest low wages, while
janitors and labor leaders at the University of Southern California
shunned food to protest the university's failure to sign a union
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Kevin Irwin, a professor of theology at the Catholic
University of America who has written extensively on fasting, said
the upsurge is a healthy development, healthier, he said, than a
trendier type of fasting that he has little patience for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the fasting we're seeing now regarding social
concerns is healthier,'' Irwin said. ``It is dependent on God and
raises very important values in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who choose to fast have many role models. In the Bible,
Jesus fasted for 40 days to proclaim good news to the poor and to
give sight to the blind and health to the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi fasted to draw attention to Britain's colonialism and
harsh treatment of the Indian people. And Cesar Chavez, founder of
the United Farm Workers, held repeated fasts to make the public
focus on the low wages and miserable conditions of thousands of
farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Shaughnessy, statewide coordinator of New York's
labor-religion coalition, acknowledged that it was hard to count
how many people were participating in the fast. But he said close
to 1,500 people had told the coalition that they would participate.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition chose to make the fast 40 hours because 40 is
freighted with symbolism: the 40 days of Lent, the 40 days of rain
in the Great Flood, the Jews' 40 years in the desert, and the
40-hour workweek.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth year the coalition has held the fast. Last
year, after the participants focused on the plight of farm workers,
the State Legislature raised the minimum wage for farm workers.
This year the fast began two days after the New York State Catholic
Conference held its annual lobbying day in Albany, and it will end
at noon today.
</P>
<P>
   The participants say they want to press the New York Legislature
to raise the state minimum wage above the federal minimum of $5.15.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Hubbard said he hoped the fast would grow, and some labor
and religious leaders say they will try to spread it to other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues may be different,'' Bishop Hubbard said, ``but the
call to reach out to those who are neediest and most vulnerable
among us is every bit as much a part of our religious mandate as it
was when Christ walked the face of the earth.''

SHELDON GOES 8-FOR-9, BUT OATES REJECTS HIS PITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates gave Scott Sheldon
the news he dreaded to hear Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't get sent to the minors. His spot on the team looks
fairly secure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Oates told Sheldon he couldn't pitch the ninth inning
of the Rangers' 6-1 victory against the Double-A Tulsa Drillers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chickened out,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon's calling card is his versatility, and he put that on
display by playing all eight positions in the field. He caught in
the first inning, then moved to shortstop, first base, second base,
third base, center field, right field and left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great opportunity,'' said Sheldon, who played all
four infield positions, catcher and left field for the Triple-A
Oklahoma RedHawks last season and has played short, second, third
and first in the majors. ``I thank Johnny for trying it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that would have made it perfect would have been
if he'd been able to play the ninth position. He has never pitched
in a professional game but has in alumni games at the University of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to pitch to one hitter in the ninth, and I chickened
out,'' Oates said. ``The rewards for doing it don't outweigh the
risks if I blow his arm out. He has a chance to make the club, and
if I blew his arm out I couldn't live with myself. If it's in
August and I need an emergency pitcher to save the bullpen, I might
use him then, but I couldn't do it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon understood the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want it to become uncomfortable for him,'' Sheldon
said. ``He worked so hard to let me play all the other positions.''
DECISIONS ALMOST DUE
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sheldon and the other players on the bubble likely will
find out Sunday whether they've made the club. Johnny Oates said he
will announce his decisions before the team works out at The
Ballpark in Arlington that day.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves two exhibition games to impress the manager, Friday
night against the St. Louis Cardinals at The Ballpark and tomorrow
afternoon in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, though, said those games will carry little weight. He'll
make his decisions based on spring training as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The final roster makeup greatly depends on left-handed reliever
Mike Venafro, who has been bothered most of the spring by a finger
injury. He's scheduled to pitch the next two games, and if he shows
he's healthy, he will be on the team.
</P>
<P>
   That likely will leave the final roster spot for a utility
infielder: Sheldon or Edwin Diaz. ZIMMERMAN BEARS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Rangers were playing a team of Triple-A and
Double-A players, reliever Jeff Zimmerman treated the game as
though it meant something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to work on having a high intensity level and
not treat it as just another exhibition game,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   That's been a problem for Zimmerman this spring. He has had a
tendency to throw a couple of good pitches then lose his focus.
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished what he wanted against the Drillers, working a
1-2-3 eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to maintain my intensity,'' Zimmerman said.
RODRIGUEZ HURT
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez left the game in the first inning after
being hit on the right elbow by an inside fastball from Chuck
Smith. He is to be examined by team orthopedist Dr. John Conway,
but Rodriguez said he doesn't believe the injury is serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sore, stiff, but it's OK,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays last night appeared negative but will be reviewed by
Conway on Friday. RODRIGUEZ, JONES INDUCTED
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez and Tulsa manager Bobby Jones became the charter
members of the Wall of Fame at Drillers Stadium in a pregame
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez didn't spend much time in Tulsa. He hit .274 in 50
games at the Double-A level in 1991, then was promoted to the
majors to stay on June 20 that year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is managing Tulsa for the sixth consecutive season and the
eighth year overall. He has 476 victories, the most in Tulsa
history, and guided the club to the 1998 Texas League championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Drillers plan to induct two new members each year. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ About 600 scattered single tickets, obstructed-view tickets
and standing-room tickets remain for Monday's season opener against
the Chicago White Sox. The paid attendance for Opening Day has
surpassed the regular-season record of 47,204, set July 4, 1999
against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edgar Lopez is the play-by-play announcer and Eleno Ornelas is
the analyst for the Rangers' Spanish radio broadcasts. All the
team's home games, beginning with Friday's exhibition against St.
Louis, are scheduled to be broadcast on KESS/1270 AM. nn

POLL GIVES GORE AN EDGE IN NEW JERSEY
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE VOTERS
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey voters favor Vice President Al Gore over Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, 50 percent to 37 percent, primarily because
Bush's support has sagged among independents and women, according
to a Quinnipiac College poll released on Thursday. Independents
favored Bush, 43 percent to 41 percent, in a Feb. 24 Quinnipiac
poll, but now support Gore, 47 percent to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac in
Hamden, Conn., said women now favor Gore, 54 percent to 33 percent;
last September, women were evenly divided. Only 35 percent of all
voters and 45 percent of Republicans wanted Gov. Christie Whitman
as Bush's running mate, McLean said. The poll questioned 1,177
voters from March 21 to 27 and had a margin of sampling error of
three percentage points.  &QL;

   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   BUSH ON THE CENSUS
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush said on Thursday that he understood why some
people found the long census form too nosy.
</P>

   ``All of us need to encourage people to fill out the census,''
Bush said in Wisconsin. But, he added: ``I can understand why
people don't want to give all that information to the government.
And if I have the long form, I'm not so sure I want to either.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi and other Republicans have said
those who think the long form invades their privacy should not
answer questions they see as intrusive. Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said that Republicans
opposed an accurate count for political purposes.  &QL;

<P>
   FLAG DEBATE IN VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   The fiery contest predicted for this year's Senate race in
Virginia is already apparent as Sen. Charles S. Robb defended his
vote against a constitutional ban on burning the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign of his Republican opponent, former Gov. George
Allen, sought to cast the incumbent Democrat as a defender of
desecration, Robb took to the Senate floor to speak passionately as
a Vietnam combat veteran who ``had men literally die in my arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending unpopular free speech as a constitutional right, he
said, ``They did not die for a piece of cloth, however sacred,''
but for ``all that our flag represents.'' The Roanoke Times
editorialized: ``The spectacle of one American _ who has never had
to defend his country's flag under fire _ waving it to attack
another _ who has _ is revolting.'' The Allen campaign denied
questioning Robb's patriotism and insisted that Allen should not be
attacked for having had a safe draft number when Robb was fighting
the war.

<P>
   CALIFORNIA  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVIS BACKS PRIMARY
</P>
<P>
   In a break with his fellow state Democrats, Gov. Gray Davis of
California is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold California's
open primary elections, which allow voters to cast ballots for
candidates of any party in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party has joined with the Republican Party to
fight the open primary through the federal courts. But the governor
is convinced that the open primary system is important to his
political future _ he faces re-election in 2002 _ and that it is
sound policy, his aides said. In the 1998 primary, Davis attracted
many Republican votes, which gave him invaluable momentum heading
into the general election later that year.

REFS' SURVEY HURTS, BUT NCAA BUOYED BY PROPOSED GAMBLING BAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Two days before the first Final Four of the 2000s
and NCAA president Cedric Dempsey wasn't discussing No. 8 seeds or
this NCAA Tournament's capricious twists and turns. Gambling,
again, is a major distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dempsey and other NCAA officials were in Washington
to meet with congressmen regarding legislation that would ban
betting on college sports. Also Wednesday, a University of Michigan
study was released that found that of the Division I football and
basketball game officials it surveyed, a majority said they gamble,
with some betting on sports and using bookies.
</P>
<P>
   For the NCAA, that's one up and one down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are somewhat confident that if we can get the (legislation)
to the floor for a vote, we will win that vote,'' Dempsey said
while meeting with reporters at the RCA Dome. ``We recognize that
we have strong opposition from the gaming community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan survey, which received responses from 640 out of
1,462 officials, provided another distraction from the Final Four.
Two years ago in San Antonio, the Northwestern basketball
game-fixing scandal broke two days before the national semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, though, believes that the NCAA has been proactive when
it comes to this issue. This year, basketball officials who work
the NCAA Tournament _ plus the 10-member basketball committee that
selected and seeded the field _ underwent background checks.
Dempsey said one referee, whom he declined to name, was not
approved because of the background check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the right track,'' said Bill Saum, the NCAA's
director of Agent, Gambling and Amateurism Activities. ``We need to
remember that officials are a segment of society, and certainly
this didn't surprise us. We're very comfortable with the integrity
of the officials and the integrity of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey also discussed issues such as upcoming amateurism
legislation and college basketball issues. While most schools
oppose the elimination of summer recruiting, Dempsey said the NCAA
will propose to eliminate summer recruiting in order to improve the
``basketball culture.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Michigan State coach Tom Izzo doesn't think that his team's
second consecutive Final Four appearance provides an advantage. ``I
wish it did,'' he said. ``On the court, it doesn't help at all. Off
the court, with the nuances of handling the hotels, the practices,
all the media, it might give us a slight edge.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida coach Billy Donovan on the longer timeouts due to
television commercials: ``It certainly is an adjustment. Our
players have a tendency to want to get back on the floor a lot
sooner because they have been programmed over the year of how long
those timeouts are. In essence they're 30-second timeouts that
become 50 seconds, almost a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wisconsin's Andy Kowske was a guest during an Internet chat
session hosted by CNN/Sports Illustrated. The first question he was
asked was: ``In your wildest dreams did you really believe you
would be here? Honestly.'' Kowske's answer: ``Honestly, no. We had
13 losses and to think that we'd be in the Final Four is
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Indiana player Landon Turner, who played on the
Hoosiers' 1981 national championship team before being paralyzed in
an automobile accident, has organized a Hoosier Legends Basketball
Exhibition Game that will be played Friday at Butler's Hinkle
Fieldhouse. The game's proceeds will benefit Emily Hunt, a
7-year-old paralyzed in 1996 in an amusement-park accident. nn

SPORTS COLUMN: MURAKAMI WILL ALWAYS BE FIRST
</HEADLINE>
   (mg) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Nearly 36 years disappeared as Alvin Jackson greeted
Masanori Murakami behind the batting cage on Thursday. The first
time they met, two curious things happened: Murakami became the
first Japanese player in the American major leagues. And the Mets
won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the winning pitcher,'' recalled Jackson, now the Mets'
bullpen coach, savoring such a rare event.
</P>
<P>
   The big news on Sept. 1, 1964, took place in the eighth inning
when the 20-year-old left-hander came out of the San Francisco
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before, I was playing in Fresno with 200-300 people,''
Murakami said Thursday night. ``The next day I played in New York
for 40,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans came out to see Willie Mays and the Giants, who had
been spirited out of New York seven years earlier, but they
happened to witness history. The odd thing is that it took three
full decades for the Nomos and the Irabus and the Yoshiis to
arrive. Now they are playing for big bucks in North America, and
the so-called major leagues sent two teams here for two official
games, the second being a 5-1 victory by the Mets in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami was here to broadcast for the NHK network, but he had
an extra duty. Just before the game, he trotted out to the mound,
wearing his old San Francisco Giants uniform, which still fits him.
He threw the ceremonial first pitch, an American custom, and later
said he hoped his own country might adopt the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Other artifacts of his are in the Baseball Hall of Fame _ his
orange Giants traveling bag, as well as a Murakami bat and glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, I brought them to Cooperstown,'' Murakami recalled in
English. Maybe one day a Japanese player will be voted into the
Cooperstown Hall of Fame. Who knows where baseball is going on this
international kick? Baseball would be lucky to capture even one
quarter of the energy of the quadrennial soccer World Cup, the
greatest sports event on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami helped put this show on the road. He told the story of
his odd voyage to America. He had been a promising young player in
the system of the Nankai Hawks, and for some progressive reason,
the team leadership decided to send him to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent me over to study the language,'' he said with a
self-deprecating smile, ``but they also sent me to study baseball
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Murakami then put his odyssey into perspective: ``Before the
war, Nisei went to America to live,'' Murakami said. ``Then came
the war, and they took houses back from Japanese. People were sad
after the war. Japanese people nervous. But after 20 years, we
tried to play baseball with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball not professional wrestling. Wrestling is show.
Baseball is true.''
</P>
<P>
   With some inner wisdom, they dispatched the composed young man
to the Giants, whose classic orange-and-black-trimmed uniform had
been the model for that Japanese dynasty, the Tokyo Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a major league player when I came to San
Francisco,'' Murakami said. ``I play A ball, not Double-A ball or
Triple-A ball. But on Sept. 1, they call me up. I was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   After flying overnight from California to New York, Murakami was
handed a contract by Chub Feeney, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I don't sign,'' Murakami said. ``It was in English,
and I don't understand it, so I don't sign. Chub Feeney was all
excited. Only hours before the game. But he called in some Japanese
guy who read the contract, and he told me it was all right.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, Manager Alvin Dark sent him out there.
``Mets were ahead,'' Murakami told Jackson Thursday night. ``Ninth
inning, we scored one run. I want us to tie the score so I could
pitch ninth inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson looked at him last night with 36 years of incredulity,
as if to say, ``Brother, I needed that game more than you did.''
The Mets held on. Murakami went on to pitch credibly for the Giants
in 1965, and he dreamed of being a starter, but then the Hawks
called him home.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched 18 years for Nankai, Hanshin and the Nippon Ham
Fighters, with a decent 103-82 record and a 3.64 earned run
average, mostly as a reliever. And he tried to tell people what
Mays and Marichal and Dark had taught him.
</P>
<P>
   Now he dispenses wisdom over the airwaves. On Friday he will fly
to Los Angeles and Seattle to interview Japanese players, who make
millions in the American majors. But Masanori Murakami has
something they don't. He started all this.  &QL;

GORDON SEARCHING FOR NEW COMBINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN, JEFF WILSON, RICK HERRIN AND JOHNNY D. BOGGS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jeff Gordon's Busch Grand National
qualifying effort Thursday was nothing to celebrate, but he ate ice
cream anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's speed of 179.910 mph stood 46th after first-round
qualifying for Saturday's Albertson's 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a different motor combination,'' said
Gordon, driver of the No. 24 Pepsi Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``We have
to find out why our speed is off. We know we are not getting down
the straightaways. We don't know if it's aerodynamics or too much
drag, or if it's under the hood with horsepower. We can't change
much on the body. The one thing we can change is the engine, so
we're going to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're searching to find a combination out there that we can
rent from someone to find out if that is our problem. We will try
to check off all the variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is attempting to qualify for his second BGN race of 2000.
The former three-time Winston Cup champion started 27th and
finished 18th in the Sam's Town 300 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on
March 4.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gordon picked his favorite new ice cream flavor as part
of a Dreyer's and Edy's Ice Cream promotion. The winning flavor,
``Jeff's Mint Chocolate Speedway,'' was submitted by Angie Athanas,
24, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The flavor will be available in stores
this year. PARKER HIT AND MISS
</P>
<P>
   Hank Parker had the fastest times during Busch practice Thursday
morning. However, it didn't translate to success during afternoon
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who drives the No. 53 Team Marine Chevrolet, qualified
28th at 182.278 mph after finishing the practice sessions as the
only driver to top 185 mph. Part of Parker's problem, he said, was
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the clouds were out, we were great,'' Parker said. ``Then
the sun comes out and the clouds go away, and it hurt us. The track
changed. The car was really good before, and I thought we had
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who finished second in the rookie-of-the-year points
standings last season to Tony Raines, also said he had severe
troubles with running loose. The qualifying session was especially
disappointing to Parker after his near-perfect practices. But he
anticipates his car will be ready for Saturday's Albertson's 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be good,'' said Parker, who started and finished 20th in
last season's Coca-Cola 300 at the Texas Motor Speedway. POINTS
LEADER STRUGGLES
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kenseth, who remains devoted to running a part-time Busch
schedule even though he leads the series in points, could manage
only the 50th-best speed (178.489) Thursday in qualifying for the
Alberton's 300.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, driver of the No. 17 Visine Chevrolet on the Busch
circuit, is also the leading rookie on the Winston Cup Series and
is committed to running a full Cup schedule. WRECK UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Rich Bickle and P.J. Jones were involved in separate wrecks
during practice sessions, and David Steele tagged the wall in
qualifying. None of the drivers was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious of the accidents occurred when an oil line
broke in Jones' No. 74 BACE Motorsports Chevrolet. The car filled
with smoke, and the Monte Carlo spun in the oil in Turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going that fast, and I should have been able to save
it, except there was so much smoke in the car,'' Jones said. ``I
couldn't see anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was treated and released from the Lone Star Health Infield
Care Center. nn

GUN OF A SON: HULL TRAILS HIS DAD BY TWO GOALS BUT MAY HAVE
SURPASSED HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Bobby Hull morphs into a cheerleader as he
watches his son, Brett, inch closer to his goal-scoring mark of
610. Two goals, and Brett will be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I want him to break my record,'' Bobby Hull said as he
waited for Brett after the Stars' most-recent trip to Chicago. ``I
want him to get more than anybody else who has ever played because
he's better than anyone else that played.''
</P>
<P>
   Even better than Bobby?
</P>
<P>
   ``Even me,'' Bobby said, pausing before explaining his
rationale. ``I'm not sure I could've done what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   What Brett Hull has done is adapt his game because the NHL he
thrived in no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a pure goal scorer,'' said Washington forward Adam
Oates, a teammate of Hull's in St. Louis. ``The 2 1/2 years I
played with him was the best hockey I ever have had. I think the
year he scored 86 (1990-91), it was the best pure goal-scoring year
ever. I know Gretz scored 92. But the year Hull got 86, he did not
have a short-handed goal, no empty netters, no four-goal games.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest pure goal scorers doesn't score near as many
goals any more. This, they say, is progress.
</P>
<P>
   As in Wednesday against the Florida Panthers. Hull didn't score
a goal, but Stars coach Ken Hitchcock couldn't heap enough praise
on him for ``clawing and scratching and working.'' This is what it
has taken for Hull to score 22 goals, five shy of his lowest total
for a full NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   But, let's be honest. Since March 19, he has been two goals
behind dad, who ranks ninth all-time. (He has been within nine
goals since getting 600 and 601 on New Year's Eve.) And, while two
goals used to be an average night for Brett, the five games between
now and the end of the regular season might not be enough time to
score two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there is a chance it might not happen. Whatever,''
Hull says in a tone that begs you to believe he doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   But he does. If he didn't, he would've faded off into the sunset
content with the player that he was. But he didn't; he changed into
the player he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think enough people gave him credit for being a smart
hockey player, and he is, a very smart hockey player,'' Oates said.
``He knows the game, and it has changed since then, and he's
changed along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things didn't so much change as get accentuated. When you
score as many goals as Hull did, you aren't going to get as many
assists. So the idea persists that maybe you aren't a playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played with some guys that were pure goal scorers but who
didn't understand the game,'' Stars forward Guy Carbonneau said.
``Talking with Brett and his dad, you can see that they understand.
People always talk about his shots and his goal-scoring ability,
but what they forget is how good he passes the puck and how well he
understands the game.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Hull doesn't score goals as often as he used to. He always
has one or two guys on him, which means somebody is open. He now
makes the pass. As he did against the Panthers, when he assisted on
three goals. His second assist landed so perfectly on winger Scott
Thornton's stick as he came flying toward the crease that Thornton
said he didn't have any choice but to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit,'' Thornton admitted when asked if Hull's
play-making ability surprised him at all. ``He's a ``really'' good
passer.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is thick. Just when he's finally a couple of goals
away from the milestone he has always wanted, he starts getting
recognized for his passing. And yes, 610 is a mark he really wants
to get. This season would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau realizes that by what Hull doesn't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to talk about it,'' Carbonneau said. ``I
understand. Look at Patrick Roy going after the most wins. I think
that affected him a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has been affected, too. He admitted as much to his father a
couple of weeks ago. It was Brett and Bobby and Carbonneau at
lunch. They talked about a lot of things, but eventually the
conversation steered back toward hockey.
</P>
<P>
   They're different players, father and son. Bobby would come
barreling down the left wing and wind up and let it fly. Brett
would float around, getting himself in the perfect position for his
one-timer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' Carbonneau said, ``is still to score goals.
They both did that really well in different days and different
games.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, things have changed. This season likely will end with
one 50-goal scorer, Florida's Pavel Bure. There could be more,
Bobby says. Probably should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not the way the game is anymore,'' he laments in a
way that if you weren't looking straight at him you'd swear you
were listening to Brett talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard adjustment for older players that were scorers,''
Hitchcock admitted. ``It's not easy making those adjustments in the
best of times, let alone when a player is set in his ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull isn't going to deny he has been known to be a little
stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hull, well, ``he makes me look flexible,'' Brett says.
</P>
<P>
   So that's what Bobby meant when he said he wasn't sure he
could've adjusted his game as Brett did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably being truthful in that sense,'' Brett Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the part about Brett being better than Bobby because
of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering,'' Bobby Hull said. ``But then, you know,
obviously I'm his son, so he's going to say a lot of nice things.''

McGWIRE PUTTING UP HISTORIC NUMBERS IN HOME RUN TOTALS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sexiest man in America will be at The Ballpark in Arlington
this evening. Tom Cruise? Mel Gibson? Brad Pitt?
</P>
<P>
   No, no and no. We're talking Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, chicks dig the longball, and nobody does the longball
like the big St. Louis Cardinals slugger with the huge biceps and
the enormous home run totals.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and the Cardinals are in town Friday for an exhibition
game against the Rangers at 7:05 p.m. at the Ballpark in Arlington,
his first appearance in Arlington, Texas, since 1997, when he
played for the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, McGwire was simply the best slugger in the
American League. Since then, he's become the best slugger in
history. McGwire hit 70 home runs in 1998, shattering the
single-season record of 61 set by Roger Maris in 1961. He followed
that up with a relatively paltry 65 last season.
</P>
<P>
   To those who don't play the game, the numbers are unbelievable,
incredible, astounding, the adjective of your choice. Those who
play the game are even more amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to believe,'' said Rangers first baseman Rafael
Palmeiro, who was second in the American League with 47 home runs
last season. ``To hit 30 home runs is so hard, and to hit 40 is
even more so, and 50 and 60. He hit 70. That's so out of reach it's
not even funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, National League pitchers aren't laughing. McGwire
averaged a home run about every eight at-bats the past two seasons.
It wasn't a matter of would he hit another home run, but when, and
how far.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew it was just a matter of time,'' said Rangers pitcher
Darren Oliver, McGwire's teammate with the Cardinals the past two
years. ``If he hadn't hit a home run in the last three games it
didn't matter who was pitching, it was bound to happen. You knew he
was going to hit one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only hit one, but hit one a long way. The right-handed pull
hitter holds the unofficial record for the average length of the
majestic drives he clouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody hits like him, as far as he hits them,'' Oliver said.
``There was him, then there was a big separation to everyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's exploits have attracted huge crowds, even for
exhibition games. The Rangers expect a crowd of around 35,000,
about 5,000-10,000 more than they normally draw for their home
exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's raw power makes Cardinals batting practice _ which
should commence at about 5:20 p.m. Friday _ a spectacle. Even
players have been known to stop and watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazed me was how far he hit the ball in (batting
practice),'' Oliver said. ``That's a joke. It was almost like
somebody teeing up a golf ball and hitting it. It was amazing. When
you see it every day you'd think you got used to it, but it was
still like, `Wow.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's also a good word to describe McGwire's home run totals
the past three seasons. He warmed up with 58 in '97 _ when he split
the season between the A's and Cardinals _ obliterated Maris's
record with 70 in '98, then followed it up with 65 last year. The
'99 season proved that the '98 season wasn't an aberration, and
that McGwire might have another single-season record in his lethal
bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's capable of doing it again,'' Palmeiro said. ``I don't
think it's a once-in-a-lifetime deal. He may give it a go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that McGwire has averaged 64 homers the past three
seasons, he also might have a go at the mother of all baseball
records, Hank Aaron's 755 career homers.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has 522, 10th on the all-time list and 233 away from
Aaron. If McGwire keeps up his pace of the past three season for
the next four years, he'd break the record in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can stay healthy, he can do it,'' Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has had periodic back problems. He was removed with
stiffness in his back in the third inning of the Cardinals' 3-1
victory over the Montreal Expos on Wednesday. This spring, he's hit
.327 with seven home runs in 52 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire won't set any records tonight. But he could have a
chance to hit the ball a long way. He doesn't always get that
chance during the regular season. Because he's a threat to swat one
over the fence every time he walks to the plate, he doesn't see
many strikes with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys pitched around him,'' Oliver said. ``You can't be dumb.
If there were guys on base, they'd take their chances with the next
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an exhibition game, though. Oliver is scheduled to start
for the Rangers, and even with men on base he said he would
probably challenge his former teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exhibition game, so it's a little different,'' Oliver
said. ``I don't have to pitch him carefully. You still want to go
out there and get the guy out, but if you happen to give up
something, it doesn't count. That's the good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if McGwire does hit the longball, at least the chicks will
dig it. nn

HANFORD WORKERS TO FILE LAWSUIT OVER 1997 TANK EXPLOSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELA GALLOWAY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven workers who claim they received botched medical help
after an explosion in a Hanford, Wash., plutonium plant nearly
three years ago plan to file a lawsuit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The current and former workers allege they suffered severe
disabling injuries in a May 1997 tank explosion, and the subsequent
mishandled emergency response.
</P>
<P>
   They seek medical treatment and unspecified financial
compensation, said Hugh Plunkett, a Minneapolis lawyer representing
the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the workers want answers about the explosion at the
nuclear reservation near the Tri-Cities in eastern Washington, said
plaintiff Ron Irvin, a 46-year-old electrical worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come out with the truth about what really happened that
night,'' Irvin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Eight electrical workers were taking a meal break behind the
Hanford Plutonium Finishing Plant when they noticed an explosion in
a fourth-floor chemical mixing room. They were directed to take
cover in the plant, but to do so they had to walk through a plume
of brown smoke that smelled of metal and chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford officials said no radioactivity was released, but
managers were found to have failed to properly test the workers for
exposure to chemicals, and did not have adequate testing equipment
on hand. The men had to drive themselves to hospitals for checkups.
Three other Hanford workers have joined in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett said contractors for the federal Department of Energy
have given Irvin and other workers inadequate information and
assistance in dealing with subsequent medical problems such as
blood abnormalities, numbness, migraines, inability to urinate,
sexual dysfunction and memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the workers has had health problems since the explosion,
and some can no longer work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man can't even hold a hammer,'' said Plunkett, who added
that the workers want medical monitoring. ``They want to know when
(their health) turns a corner because they live in constant fear of
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett said Fluor Hanford, one of the site's top contractors,
will be one of the primary defendants in the lawsuit to be filed in
U.S. District Court in Spokane, Wash. Several subcontractors that
worked under and advised Fluor also will be named.
</P>
<P>
   Two governmental agencies hit Fluor with hefty fines following
the explosion, which blew a hole in the defunct plant's roof, which
was supposed to help prevent release of nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Karpe, a Fluor spokesman, declined to comment until the
lawsuit is filed.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett contends that Fluor and others lied to the workers and
staged a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the incident, the workers were told tests showed they
were not exposed to toxic levels of chemicals or radiation ``until
(Hanford management) finally admitted there hadn't been any
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the workers weren't tested until last year, when the
government paid for medical tests at the University of Texas,
Plunkett said.
</P>
<P>
   Those examinations indicate the workers were exposed to
radioactive or similar contamination, but they still lack a clear
picture of what they were exposed to when supervisors led them
through a brown plume after the eruption, Plunkett said.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, the lawyer said, workers who pushed for answers were
threatened and harassed.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett said homes and cars of several workers who asked
questions about the incident were broken into. Nothing of value was
ever taken, but some personal records were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   One worker discovered two dead, plucked crows in his front lawn
_ their heads buried in the ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were abused. They were exposed. And they have been left
out in the wind,'' said Gerry Pollet, executive director of Heart
of America Northwest, a Hanford watchdog group. ``There was just a
plain, old-fashioned cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Several months after the explosion, the state Department of
Ecology fined the federal Department of Energy $110,000 _ the
largest fine ever related to Hanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Energy had not adequately identified the
risk posed by the chemicals and did not manage them right, which
led to the explosion,'' said Steve Moore, a state Ecology
compliance inspector. ``We found deficiencies overall in the
emergency response system.
</P>
<P>
   Then in March 1998, the Energy Department levied its own fine,
one of the largest in the history of its nuclear safety program:
$140,625 against Fluor for its handling of plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the explosion, the Energy Department noted
several other unsafe incidents, including an instance where the
company allegedly left an open, unlatched wagon loaded with
plutonium sitting unattended in a corridor.
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporter Heath Foster contributed to this report.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking from from administration policy on a
highly volatile issue, Vice President Al Gore said Thursday that
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and several family members should be
given permanent residency status in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement seemed to take some officials in the Clinton
administration by surprise, coming as it did in the midst of
negotiations between immigration officials, who want to return the
boy to his father in Cuba, and relatives who have been caring for
him in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the government agreed to extend until at least next
Tuesday the relatives' temporary custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Gore said he was supporting legislation
sponsored by Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Connie Mack, R-Fla., and
Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., that would allow Elian to stay in the
United States while his case is adjudicated in family court.
</P>
<P>
   If the court decided that he should be with his father, Elian
would return to Cuba. But when he reached adulthood, he could then
decide, Cuba willing, to return to the United States, where he
would resume permanent residency status. A step short of
citizenship, that status denies a person voting rights, the ability
to serve on a jury and in the military and access to certain
welfare benefits. It also makes him subject to deportation if he
commits a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is necessary in this case because the law generally
requires a person to live in the United States for five years
before becoming eligible to apply for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, I have said that Elian Gonzalez's
case is at heart a custody matter,'' Gore said in the statement.
``It is a matter that should be decided by courts that have the
experience and expertise to resolve custody cases, with due
process, and based on Elian's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now appears that our immigration laws may not be broad
enough to allow for such an approach in Elian's case. That is why I
am urging Congress to immediately pass legislation that is being
sponsored by Senators Bob Graham and Bob Smith, which would grant
permanent resident status to Elian, his father, stepmother,
half-brother, grandmothers and grandfather, so that this case can
be adjudicated properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement marks his strongest breach yet with the
administration and comes as Cuban exiles and officials in Miami are
threatening massive protests if the administration sends the boy
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gore said his statement Thursday stemmed logically
from his earlier position that the matter should be treated as a
custody case.
</P>
<P>
   But it stunned several members of his own party, including those
within the administration, who said they could not fathom his
timing or his reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, it's unbelievable!'' one administration official
blurted out in a private conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vocal about her surprise was Rep. Maxine Waters,
a liberal California Democrat, who said that Gore's position was
making her reconsider her support for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was introduced Wednesday by Graham, an
oft-mentioned vice presidential possibility for Gore, and Mack.
Smith, who met with the boy earlier, told reporters that Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, had indicated to them that the
Senate might be reluctant to support citizenship for Elian, as
Graham and Smith had proposed earlier, but that lawmakers might be
amenable to this proposal for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lott could not be reached for comment and there was no
indication of the prospects of such a bill or whether Lott would
allow it to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, a similar measure has been introduced by Rep.
Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the only other state with a significant
Cuban population. Menendez's bill would give permanent residency
status only to Elian, not to his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's statement, the most definitive he has made
in the four-month-old case, is certain to appeal to Florida's
800,000 Cuban-Americans, who could swing the electorate in November
in the nation's fourth-largest state.
</P>
<P>
   And it brings Gore into line with the position outlined in
January by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival for
the presidency, who said then that he supported citizenship for
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the vice president now supports legal residency for
Elian Gonzalez,'' Bush said Thursday. ``I wish he could convince
the rest of the administration of the wisdom of that approach. The
vice president is an influential member of this administration. I
hope he'll use his influence to encourage the president and the
attorney general to follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Waters said in an interview: ``I was totally blindsided. The
calculation doesn't make sense. If Gore did it because he's trying
to get the anti-Castro Cubans, first of all, they're not going to
vote for him anyway. These are Republicans. And number two, the
last polls I saw a month ago showed the American public is on the
side of sending Elian back to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was surprised and disappointed that Gore had been
so definitive in his statement, and that she was considering not
participating in the presidential election. ``I do have somewhere
to go,'' she said. ``Nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, on the other hand, said that Gore had indicated all
along that he wanted the matter treated as a custody case and that
what was new was his support for permanent residency status. Graham
said in an interview that if the family court determined that Elian
should be with his father in Cuba _ and the prevailing presumption
in the United States is that a child generally belongs with a
natural parent _ he and the vice president would support returning
the boy to Cuba until he reached adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I would support that position and I think the vice president
would,'' Graham said. ``And the overwhelming number of people in
Miami, including in the Cuban community, would support such a
determination if they thought it was made by an appropriate
judicial body.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who said the Senate has taken the first steps toward
petitioning the majority to bring his bill to the floor, added:
``The purpose of this legislation is to try to be a channel to move
this case from an INS asylum case to a family court.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was the purpose behind Gore's statement Thursday, his
aides said. ``This was the only way to vindicate the principle,
that this should be decided in a court that deals with custody
cases,'' a top adviser said. Contrary to some suggestions, he
added, Gore's action may have the effect of calming the people of
Miami rather than stirring them up.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore said in his statement: ``Let us be clear that the real
fault in this case lies with the oppressive regime of Fidel Castro.
Elian should never have been forced to choose between freedom and
his own father. Now we must take action, here on our own shores, to
make sure that Elian's best interests are served.''
</P>
<P>
   But he definitely stirred up Washington, including some on his
own staff. ``This was not something that was discussed, chewed over
and thought out for a long time or that huge numbers of people were
consulted on,'' an adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Jake Siewert, a spokesman for Clinton, said
that Gore had alerted Clinton in advance and that the president was
not upset. ``We knew there would be times when he differed with the
president,'' Siewert said. ``This is one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said: ``We've stated in the past we don't
believe congressional action is appropriate in this situation.
There is a father who speaks for his son and has made it very clear
that he wants to be reunited with him as soon as possible, and that
is what we are trying to do. The INS has received no credible
information that any of these family members wants to stay in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore, said the vice president
``clearly disagrees with the INS and the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's break with the administration is the most
dramatic of his campaign to date. Back in November, as Gore
struggled to assert his independence from the president and become
his own man, he told reporters: ``Running for president of this
country is far more important than being the best vice president I
can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has differed from administration policy in a
number of areas. He said he would require his appointees to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to support allowing gays to serve openly in
the military. He said he supported the use of marijuana for
medicinal purposes. And he has opposed a Clinton nominee to the
Federal Election Commission because that nominee, Bradley Smith,
opposes changing the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these matters has been a matter of national urgency,
as Elian's case has become.

SMALLER RAISE FOR WORKERS WHO GET TIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ State lawmakers on Thursday agreed to a law
giving waiters, bartenders and busboys a smaller minimum-wage
increase than other low-wage workers who do not get tips, despite
complaints that the move was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Without a change in the law, the minimum wage for food service
workers who also routinely earn tips would have risen on Friday to
about $3.50 an hour from $2.90.
</P>
<P>
   But legislators from both parties, in both houses of the
Legislature, reached agreement with Gov. George Pataki to cap the
wage increase for this group at $3.30. The Senate and the Assembly
passed the bill on Thursday, and the governor's office said Pataki
would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats said they voted for the bill only because Pataki,
a Republican, had signaled that if they allowed the minimum wage to
rise to about $3.50 (there was some dispute as to exactly what the
number would be), he would use his administrative powers to roll it
back to $2.90. Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, called
predictions of a rollback ``complete and total nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, and some Republicans, said they voted for it to keep
wages from rising too sharply so that small businesses would be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 121-19 in the Assembly and 58-2 in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Labor union officials were split on the bill, some believing it
was the best deal that the workers could hope for and others
arguing that the Legislature should have let the automatic increase
take effect and dared the governor to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage under federal law is $5.15 an hour, but states
are allowed to set lower minimums for certain groups of workers,
like farm laborers and food service employees. The state-mandated
minimum for most of those workers has been $4.25 since 1991, but
under a law enacted in December, it will rise on Friday to $5.15.
