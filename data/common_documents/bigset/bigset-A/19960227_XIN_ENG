<HEADLINE> Cuban Doctors Arrive In S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of Cuban
doctors, recruited by South Africa under an inter-governmental
agreement, arrived here today to begin their peace mission.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the arrival of 96 Cuban doctors at Johannesburg
International Airport, South African Health Minister
Ms. Nkosazana Zuma said the Cuban doctors came to South Africa to
help transform society.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Zuma said, "We are now struggling for the transformation
of society so that we can provide basic needs to our people. Cuba
is very much part of that struggle," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Deputy Health Minister Jorge Antelo said the three-year
inter-governmental agreement, signed last month, was "a mission
of peace, humanity, solidarity and unity".
</P>
<P>
South Africa has a shortage of doctors in rural areas. Doctors
are being lured from the public sector, with higher salaries by the
private sector or to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Zuma said if the health department did not "import" doctors
from other countries, it would be unable to meet the health needs
of the population.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated that it was the government's policy to provide
the basic health care to all people, especially those in rural
areas previously neglected.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban doctors to be deployed in South Africa's nine
provinces, will perform the same duties and receive the same
remuneration as their South African counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges EU To Release Financial Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today welcomed the
European Union's attitude toward its dispute with Greece and
urged the EU to release financial assistance immediately despite
Greek efforts to block it.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers' meeting on Monday turned down a
Greek proposal to adopt a common condemnation of Turkey
concerning the two countries' dispute over an Aegean islet.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last month when both Turkey and Greece
claimed sovereignty over a set of small islands, called Kardak in
Turkish and Imia in Greek, in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The United States later intervened, preventing a war between
the two NATO members.
</P>
<P>
According to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement, the European
Union has taken up, during Monday's meeting, the situation between
Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Greece, despite its attempts, was
unable to get the support of the other 14 European Union members
in getting a statement that would express solidarity with Greece
and condemn Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey welcomes the reaffirmation of the European Union's 14
members to carry out their obligations toward Turkey within the
framework of customs union," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ankara also urged the EU to release its planned
financial assistance, a sum of 375 million ECU (483.75 million
U.S. dollars), despite Greek attempt to block it.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the European Union to take the decision for the
implementation of the financial assistance, an indispensable
factor...in the customs union, as soon as possible," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Reports say Britain and France have urged Greece not to force
the EU into a legal battle with Turkey over the financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Ankara maintains that the withholding of the assistance
would be a violation of the customs union accord, which might
go as far as to the European Court of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Leader Signs Economic Accords in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko, who is currently on an official visit to Russia, and
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a package of six
economic agreements here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The documents, signed immediately after the two men's one-hour
face-to-face talk, cover trade-economic cooperation, price policy,
mutual recognition of education certificates, cooperation in the
construction of the Moscow-Minsk-Warsaw-Berlin highway, and
scientific and technological cooperation in information and
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told reporters after the signing ceremony that the
agreements come into effect "from today." He said he had discussed
with Lukashenko the entire range of bilateral issues and "all
problems were resolved."
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, for his part, said that in his meeting with
Chernomyrdin "there were no issues closed for discussion" or
"excessive diplomacy." "We talk like people close to one another,"
the Belarus leader said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chernomyrdin, Russia has reached a far bigger
progress in relations with Belarus than with any other
member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who arrived earlier this morning for his first
official visit to Moscow, held a two-hour-long meeting with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. As a result, they signed a Joint
Statement and an agreement to cancel the mutual debt problem.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the two documents signed, Yeltsin said, "We
support Belarus while Belarus supports Russia. This is why we have
agreed to settle the debts. From this moment onwards, no one owes
anything to anyone. It is on this basis that we can build
integrational relations."
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko told reporters that the documents he signed with
Russian leaders are the first step to a treaty which Moscow and
Minsk intend to sign soon.

<HEADLINE> California's Economy Surpasses Nation's Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- California's economy is more
likely to have a rebound later this year, as it has shaken off
recession and gained momentum, the Investor's Business Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The state's "business image is much improved over what it was
earlier in the decade," said Chris Taylor, economist at Wells
Fargo Bank in San Francisco. The state is largely helped by its
computing, movie and export industries, which have created more
jobs.
</P>
<P>
California's job growth already is outpacing the rest of the
nation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Just last Friday, it said, the state's revised data show that
the number of jobs in California jumped by 3.1 percent last year.
That's more than twice the 1.5 percent average for the U.S. as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. economy has started to slow down, California's
growth sectors -- computing and show biz -- can help the state
weather a national slowdown a bit, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
Last year's healthy job gains in California were driven partly
by a boom in U.S. spending on capital goods like factory machines
and computers.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts think that capital spending will slow this year,
which could hurt California, where many growing firms sell capital
goods like computers, and the software and services to run them.
</P>
<P>
But some argue that the tech companies will do just fine,
because businesses will continue to invest and try to raise
productivity with the help of high-tech equipment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade could also help the state outperform the nation
as a whole, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of the state's output comes from trade, it
said. Heavy overseas demand for high-tech and Hollywood will keep
the state's exporters busy this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Trade is up 70 percent in the past five years, reaching 150
billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the state's manufactured goods surged 18.7 percent
in the first three quarters of last year over the year-earlier
period, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It added that a 23 percent gain in tech exports -- from a
record 50 billion U.S. dollars in 1994 -- boosted California
exports above the national average.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Suspension Helps Peace Accord: Bildt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- High Representative for
Bosnian civilian affairs Carl Bildt said today the suspension of
sanctions on Bosnian Serbs was a positive contribution to the
implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of sanctions "will lead to a speedy economic
recovery of the Serb entity in Bosnia" and "lay conditions for
better cooperation between the Serb state and the Muslim-Croat
federation," the Tanjug news agency quoted Bildt as saying in
Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The international high representative said he would discuss the
resumption of relations between the two parties in Bosnia with the
prime ministers of Republika Srpska, the Muslim government in
Sarajevo and the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Serb authorities broke off all contacts on February 8 with the
Muslim-Croat federation in the wake of the arrests of two senior
Serb officers in late January by Muslim police on charges of war
crimes involvement.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said some concrete projects in telecommunications and
power supply in Bosnia had already been discussed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved an Implementation Force
(IFOR) report Monday evening concerning the compliance of peace
agreement by the parties in Bosnia, which enabled an automatic
suspension of sanctions against the Bosnian Serb state in line
with Resolution 1022 of November 22 last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution says sanctions against Republika Srpska are
to be suspended automatically 24 hours after the Security Council
receives a report from the IFOR confirming that Bosnian Serbs have
withdrawn from the zones of separation.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the mass exodus of Serbs from Sarajevo, Bildt
said it was the greatest tragedy primarily for themselves, but he
added he hoped that some of them would return.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Serbs living in Sarajevo have fled to
other Serb territories before the five Serb-held suburbs are
reverted to the administration of the Muslim-Croat federation in
mid-March. The federation police have already entered one of the
Serb suburb and will patrol in the other four districts gradually
from this week on.

<HEADLINE> WTO Official: Telecom Talks Reach Critical Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations on a global
deal to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications are reaching
a critical stage and an extension of the scheduled deadline of
April 30 for a deal is "out of question," an official who chairs
the talks said here today.
</P>
<P>
With only eight weeks left before the April 30 deadline, the
negotiations are reaching a stage which is both "critical" and
"encouraging," said Neil Mcmillan, president of the negotiating
group on basic telecommunications of the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference today that from the 48 WTO members
participating in the telecom talks, 22 initial market-opening
offers have been made. The latest three came this week from
Brazil, Israel and Poland.
</P>
<P>
A number of participants have indicated or promised to table
or improve their offers in the coming weeks, he added.
</P>
<P>
A formal meeting of the negotiating group will be held at the
WTO headquarters Wednesday afternoon, when senior trade and
telecom officials from the participating nations will review the
progress so far and try to give new impetus to the telecom
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Given the complexity of reaching a global deal to liberalize
telecom markets, some trade officials here fear that negotiators
might fail to meet the April 30 deadline, a notion dismissed
today by Mcmillan.
</P>
<P>
"We have most of the components on the table now to reach an
agreement if we keep the momentum up, so extension (of the
deadline) is out of question," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't strike a deal on April 30, we'll be in great
difficulty indeed in reaching an agreement at any later stage,"
Mcmillan warned.

Chiluba said though economies of both countries were weak,

The two countries could further expand bilateral cooperations

some conditions attached to foreign aid had reduced African
countries' sovereignty.
</P>

session.

competitive on the world market, so the suspension of sanctions
(against the Bosnian Serbs) will enable a gradual adjustment to
the economy of Europe and the world," Tanjug quoted Kasagic as
saying in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in northwestern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Serb official said the suspension of sanctions could have
come earlier, but the arrest and indictment of two high-ranking
Serb army officers have complicated the situation and delayed the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the two officers has prompted Serb authorities to
cut off contacts with the Muslim-Croat federation and with the
IFOR. The Serbs resumed relations with the IFOR last week but not
with the Muslim government.
</P>
<P>
Serb Vice-President Milomir Draganic also expressed
satisfaction over the suspension of sanctions against the Serbs in
the Serb stronghold of Pale today. This was the first positive
step of the world community towards the Republika Srpska, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Workers Confederation Decides to Hold Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Responding to the government's
decision to ban demonstrations, President of the Lebanese General
Workers Confederation (GWC) Elias Abu Rizk announced this
afternoon his insistence on the stand to stage nation-wide
demonstrations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rizk said later this afternoon that he refused to abide by the
decision taken by the Council of Ministers in an extraordinary
session earlier today. He accused the government of
"procrastinating" in meeting the labor's demands.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri's remarks that
"the government is not a party but an arbitrator," the labor
unions leader was quoted by "Sawt Al-Watan" (Voice of the Nation)
radio as saying that the prime minister "is not an arbitrator but
a party."
</P>
<P>
This was the labor's Reaction to the government decision to
send the army to streets to enforce the demonstration ban by force.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of the army because it is a shield for the
nation and the citizens," Rizk said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated a "firm" decision by the GWC to stage
demonstrations Thursday because "it is a right safeguarded by the
constitution."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the extraordinary cabinet session, Hariri
announced the government's stand on the demonstrations planed by
the powerful GWC and other political opposition forces by
stressing the government ban on demonstrations. "Demonstration is
forbidden, but strike is allowed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Council of Ministers took the decision and
authorized the army to execute the decision for a period of three
months so as to guarantee security in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a related development in conformity with the government's
decision, the command of the Lebanese Army issued an order later
this afternoon on suspending the effectiveness of all licenses
for carrying weapons by civilians.
</P>
<P>
"From 3 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon and until another
instruction, the effectiveness of all licenses of carrying
weapons ... ... are suspended," the army command said in the
order.
</P>
<P>
It said that only members of the official security forces can
bring with them weapons, on condition that they wear military
uniform when they are carrying licensed weapons.
</P>
<P>
Even before the cabinet took the decision, police sources
reported that army units and internal security forces had begun
deployment on the capital's streets and elsewhere as a
precautious measure to maintain order and law.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the GWC, which groups various trade unions with
an estimated membership of more than 400,000, is scheduled to
have a conference Wednesday to make the last arrangements in
preparation for Thursday's action.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers expect that a face-to-face
confrontation between the government and the GWC is unavoidable
since both sides have refused to make a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Warns Cyprus Cannot Be Object of Blackmail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government stated
here today that Cyprus cannot be the object of blackmail as
a result of differences between European Union (EU) members and
third countries.
</P>
<P>
This was highlighted by government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides when asked to comment on reports that Britain
insists on connecting Turkey's EU customs union with Cyprus' EU
accession course.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, I would like to make it
crystal clear to everybody that as a future partner of the
EU, we have our pride and our dignity, and when we join
the Union, we shall do so on our own two feet. If we
were to pay lip-service to achieve this, we would rather stay
out of the Union," Cassoulides told his press briefing.
</P>
<P>
This message, he added, is addressed to all 15 EU member
states, including Greece. But he pointed out that there was no
doubt about the Greek government stance on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which has been divided since the Turkish invasion
in 1974, applied for full EU membership in July 1990. It has
considered the EU accession as a move to be in favor of the
efforts to solve the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council of Ministers decided on March 6, 1995, to
start accession talks with Cyprus six months after the end
of the EU 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government made a similar statement, refuting
reports from Brussels which said that Greece's moves to stop
Ankara from receiving EU funds could jeopardize the island's
prospect of joining the EU.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Detect Most Distant Galaxy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- American and Canadian
astronomers in Hawaii, using the new 390-inch Keck Telescope, the
world's most powerful optical telescope, have detected an
extremely distant galaxy, some 14 billion light years away.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made last month when the astronomers were
trying to measure the mass of galaxy cluster only 5 billion light
years away, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists maintained that the chance discovery indicated that
contrary to some theories, these agglomerations of stellar matter
began forming very early, perhaps as soon as 1 billion years after
the hypothesized creation of the cosmos in the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the astronomers reported another discovery of an
apparent "baby galaxy." They noticed an unusually bright blue
galaxy in the background of one of the images. The blue color is
characteristic of massive stars that burn brightly and die in the
relatively brief time of 10 million years. So they concluded that
the galaxy was composed largely of very young stars and that the
image they were seeing was of this galaxy as it was when it was
only about 10 percent to 20 percent of its present age.
</P>
<P>
Describing the findings as "serendipitous," Dr. Erica Ellingson,
an astronomer at the university of Colarado, said, "We believe
this is the first glimpse ever of a galaxy being assembled. We
believe we finally caught one in the act of birth."

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Car Crash Confirmed as Deliberate Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police today
confirmed that Monday's car crash in Jerusalem, which killed a
woman and injured 22 others, was a deliberate attack, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 3:00 p.m. local time Monday, when
Ahmed Abdul Hamideh, 39, an American Palestinian, drove into a
crowd of people at a bus stop in northern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Several people in the crowd, apparently including soldiers and
policemen at the scene, opened fire and killed Hamideh, who came
back from California and lived in Beit Hanina, north of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Following preliminary investigations, Israeli Police Inspector
Assaf and Jerusalem police chief Arye Amit, who rushed to the
scene, announced on live radio that it was a "terrorist attack."
</P>
<P>
But the perception soon changed, when traffic investigators
found several meters of skid marks, indicating Hamideh tried to
stop his car, and had apparently lost control of the car.
</P>
<P>
However, the police today finally determined that it was a
deliberate attack, when they found out that there was no
mechanical problem with the brake of the black Fiat, which was
rented by Hamideh.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior police officer as saying, "With
all the other intelligence information, they got to the final
conclusion."
</P>
<P>
One piece of Information indicated that Hamideh met with one of
east Jerusalem newspaper's editor before the incident occurred,
telling him "I am going to do something today," and asked the
editor to see him on TV.
</P>
<P>
Police also found documents issued by the Islamic Jihad
movement in the car, though they could not determine whether
Hamideh acted under the directions of the movement.
</P>
<P>
Hamideh's attack came just one day after the two suicide
bombing attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon, which left 27 dead and
84 wounded, as the situation has been tense in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police believed that the two suicide bombers
apparently came from refugee camps near the West Bank town of
Hebron, and that both of them were dressed as Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, the police still had not determined on the identity
of the bombers, as none of the passengers questioned by police
has yet identified anyone they saw as suspicious.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Prices Down 0.3 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
reported here today that retail sales were down by 0.3 percent in
January, the poorest showing in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The weakness was centered at auto sales which fell 1.2 percent,
the first decline in this area since last July, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
The drop in retail sales in January followed a 0.6 percent
increase in December and a 0.9 percent rise in November. It was
the biggest decline since sales fell 0.4 percent last July.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the big decline in auto sales, overall sales would
have been unchanged in January, reflecting the fact that
department stores posted a 0.3 percent gain, due to heavy
discounting to get rid of unsold goods following a poor Christmas
sales season.
</P>
<P>
Sales at hardware and other building supply stores were down by
0.4 percent in January while sales at furniture stores fell 0.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government reported last week that overall economic
growth was up at a weaker annual rate of just 0.9 percent in the
fourth quarter of last year and many analysts said growth in the
current January-March quarter will show little pickup. But the
January retail sales gave one more sign that the U.S. economy was
weakening further at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Business Economists said Monday
that the majority of economists still held that the country would
escape a recession this year.
</P>
<P>
But analysts believe that the poor show of retail sales in
January will result in more cuts of U.S. interest rate in the
first half of this year.

JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's East Java Regional
Manpower Office has planned to send 50,000 contract workers abroad
during the country's sixth Five-Year Development Plan period
ending 1999, an Antara news agency report from Surabaya, capital
of East Java, said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Syaifii Syamsudin, head of the manpower
office, as saying that the 32,094 East Javanese contract workers
now working abroad send an average of 30 billion rupiah (13.04
million US dollars) annually to their home province.
</P>
<P>
With the attractive salaries abroad and the tight competition
in Indonesia's job market, the temptation to work abroad among
East Javanese people has been growing lately, said the report.
</P>
<P>
About 30 recruitment agencies are now operating in East Java.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian contract workers, the majority of whom are women,
are mostly employed in Malaysia, Singapore and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
They are paid between 25,000 and 80,000 rupiah (11 to 35 US
dollars) per day while the minimum daily wage in Indonesia is
4,600 rupiah (two US dollars).

NEW YORK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Graphics Inc., a
producer of graphics-oriented workstation computers in the United
States, said Monday it agreed to acquire supercomputer maker Cray
Research Inc., reported newspapers here today.
</P>
<P>
The price was set at about 765 million U.S. dollars, or 30 U.S.
dollars a share.
</P>
<P>
This is a move of Silicon Graphics to push deeper into a
potentially lucrative market, according to the reports. "The
combination of Silicon Graphics and Cray Research will create the
world's leading high-performance computing company," said Edward
McCracken, chairman and chief executive of Silicon Graphics.
</P>
<P>
Silicon Graphics makes several types of powerful computers --
favored by scientists, engineers and Hollywood special-effects
artists -- that can create and manipulate complex images for movie
studios.
</P>
<P>
Cray Research makes supercomputers, some of the most powerful
commercial computers in the world. It specializes in making
machines that can calculate massive problems, such as those for
atmospheric research or nuclear bomb design.
</P>
<P>
For 1995, Cray reported a loss of 226.4 million U.S. dollars,
or 8.95 U.S. dollars a share. Its revenue fell 27 percent to 676.2
million U.S. dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Official Defends Civil Aircraft Downing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A Cuban Foreign Ministry
official defended here today Cuba's shooting down of two unarmed
civilian aircraft piloted by anti-Castro activists last Saturday,
stressing the aircraft violated Cuba's territorial space.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Alfonso Martinez, official spokesman of Cuba's Foreign
Ministry, told a press conference here this morning that the
February 24 downing of the aircraft occurred over Cuba's
territorial waters, instead of "international waters" as said by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
He argued that this point can be also backed by the fact that
the U.S. authorities requested on the very Saturday permission to
enter Cuba's jurisdictional waters north of Havana for joint
search and rescue of the four crewmen aboard the downed planes.
</P>
<P>
Whether the civil aircraft were armed or not is not the issue,
said the spokesman, who is also an international relations
professor based in Havana and arrived in Geneva from seminars in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The flight of the aircraft had clear political intentions, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants ASEM to Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas told the press here today he hoped that the first
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) to be held in Bangkok would concentrate
on issues beneficial to both continents so as to further promote
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the meeting on March 1-2 would avoid discussing
issues that are considered "irrelevant," such as the East Timor
issue.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed similar views on Monday, saying that "we
hope (for) a shared perception."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the outlook of the meeting and whether it
could be as "big" as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
Alatas said that "we have to be proportional and see how
successful we are in this first meeting and decide what else we
can do in future years."
</P>
<P>
On issues to be discussed at the ASEM, the minister said Asian
countries have stressed that "irrelevant" and "controversial"
issues must be shunned if the meeting is to succeed in uniting
perceptions and common goals of cooperation between the two
continents.
</P>
<P>
He added that the issues irrelevant to the aims and atmosphere
of the meeting include human rights and workers' wages.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Asian side believes it would be best if this
first meeting is directed towards concrete matters that are
positive and can be a uniting force instead of things that create
tension.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Belarus to Speed Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Belarus will
accelerate economic integration after a key accord was signed
today removing a major stumbling block to closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Russia has agreed to cancel all debts owed by Belarus
before January 1, 1996, including those from the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Belarus' debts for Russian gas supplies and
Russia's debts for nuclear materials used in old Soviet missiles
and the stationing of Russian troops in Belarus will cancel each
other out.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in debt to each other from this moment. We will
practice economic integration on this basis," said Russian
President Boris Yeltsin after signing the accord with his Belarus
counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the two countries will strengthen cooperation in
fighting drug-trafficking and other crimes, and Russia will
provide land-locked Belarus with access to the Baltic Sea via
Kaliningrad.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who arrived here this morning for his first
official visit, has been seen as Yeltsin's closest ally among the
leaders of the 12-member Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
The Belarus president told reporters that the documents signed
earlier today are the first step to a wide-ranging bilateral
treaty which he and Yeltsin intend to sign soon.

<HEADLINE> Iran Air Disaster Victims Do Not Believe US Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The families of the ten UAE
(United Arab Emirates) nationals who lost their lives in the
U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner in 1988 do not believe they
will receive the compensation the U.S. promised to them as
reported last week.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the families of the 42 non-Iranian
victims of the disaster have already received
compensation. However, relatives of the UAE victims said they have
received nothing.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the UAE national's complaint, the Iranian Deputy
Consul-General in Dubai, Mohsen, was quoted by the newspaper Gulf
News based here as saying that the U.S. has never taken any serious
steps to compensate the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
On July 3, 1988, the USS Vicennes shot down an Iranian
airliner with 290 people on board en route to Dubai from Bandar
Abbas in Iran. Although the U.S. claimed that this was a case of
mistaken identity -- as they thought the aircraft was an F-14
fighter jet, Iran has maintained that the attack was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
A recent report that the United States has agreed to pay 101.8
million U.S. dollars in compensation to the families of the
bereaved was met with disbelief here.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the U.S. government sent a letter to the UAE
foreign Affairs Ministry, promising that the families of the
national victims would receive compensation. It stated that
250,000 dollars had been set aside for each victim who was a
"bread winner," and 100,000 dollars each for the remaining
victims.
</P>
<P>
"However, no serious steps have yet been taken by the
U.S. government until now," the bereaved UAE nationals said.

<P>
KATHMANDU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed in an
armed clash with police in a western district in Nepal today,
according to a spokesman for the Home Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Police opened fire in self-defense when they came under a
violent attack by some people involved in criminal activities at
a village of the western district of Rolpa, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A police team arrived there this morning after receiving
information that some people assaulted a local teacher and chopped
off his hands and legs with Khukuri, a Nepali knife.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the policemen were attacked by
people armed with home-made guns on their way to the village.
</P>
<P>
Two attackers were arrested by police while others managed to
escape into nearby jungles, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Violent activities were rampant in some remote hilly districts
in Nepal during last two weeks and were reportedly carried out by
a ultra-leftist group under the name of "People's War."
</P>

Several leftist parties in the country, including the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML), have condemned these
terrorist activities and urged the government to ensure public

<HEADLINE> US Wholesale Prices Up 0.3 Pct in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Wholesale prices in the
U.S. rose 0.3 percent in January, the third straight month of
rising, the Labor Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the increase in its Producer Price
Index (PPI) was slower than the advances of 0.6 percent in
December and 0.4 percent in November. Wholesale prices were
unchanged in October.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly due to rising winter demand for
gasoline and heating fuel which boosted the energy costs for the
second straight month.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs shot up 2.7 percent in January after surging 3.7
percent last December. Excluding that component, wholesale prices
actually fell 0.1 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The energy prices increase was led by a 13.3 percent jump in
gasoline costs, the highest since a 13.9 percent increase in
September 1990.
</P>
<P>
Food prices declined 0.2 percent, erasing a similar gain in
December.
</P>
<P>
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core index dropped 0.1
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected a 0.5 percent increase in the PPI, which
measures cost pressures before they reach the consumer level.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1991, inflation during the first half of the year,
particularly during the first quarter, has been sharply higher
than the yearly average inflation rate," economists at Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp. explained. "We fear that 1996
will not be an exception."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A quarter of Britain's asthma
sufferers say the disease completely controls their lives or has a
major impact on their work and leisure, a survey showed today.
</P>
<P>
A Gallup poll of more than 44,000 men, women and children found
that one in four asthmatic children had at least one week off
school last year.
</P>
<P>
Only a quarter of the children lost no school days; eight
percent lost three to four weeks and five per cent lost more than
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
One in 10 sufferers had visited an accident and emergency
department in the previous 12 months and 86 per cent said the
asthma affected their ability to take part in physical activity.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Allen &AMP;
Hanburys, also found that four out of 10 asthmatics have symptoms
every day or most days.
</P>
<P>
The findings will be discussed at a conference here today
organized by the National Asthma Campaign, which is calling for
people with asthma to be given more information and better
treatment.
</P>
<P>
There is growing evidence that patients who are given clear
instructions about what to do when they feel an attack approaching
use less medication and have fewer symptoms.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Decides to Use Army to Enforce Demonstration Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's government refused
today to make more compromises on demands of the powerful General
Workers Confederation, and decided to send the army and police to
streets to enforce a ban on demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers see that only two days before the
nation-wide demonstrations planned by the GWC and political
opposition forces, the government's showdown will unavoidably
harden the GWC's position.
</P>
<P>
At a call by President Elias Hrawi, the Council of Ministers
held an extraordinary session in the Beirut Presidential Palace
this morning to assess the present situation in the light of the
nation-wide demonstrations planned to be held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri told a news conference that the
session discussed all the issues on the ground, the most important
of which is the subject of strike and demonstrations called for by
the General Workers Confederations, and the conditions it put
forward for canceling the move.
</P>
<P>
Grouping various trade unions with an estimated membership of
more than 400,000, the GWC has been accused by the government of
trying to interfere in the political life in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the General Workers Confederation has taken
the decision to challenge the administrative authority with the
demonstrations," the multi-billionaire prime minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that even after intensive meetings between the
confederation and Labor Minister Asaad Hardan, and despite a
number of meetings between the labor minister and the ministerial
committee charged with the social demands to study the things, the
GWC still insists on the decision to stage the strike and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Hariri refuted a charge that his government gives the priority
to the projects of roads, electricity, water and telephone and
others without paying more attention to social affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It is right that we, the government, are concerned with these
issues, because these are the basic way to develop the people's
life."
</P>
<P>
"But it is not right that we have not paid an attention to the
social affairs, since we have added the health services for times,
added the social services for times, and added the subsistences
for times, and we have kept the monetary and financial stability
in the country and kept the incessant economic development, making
it much better than a large number of the world countries at the
present," said the prime minister, who took office in October
1992.
</P>
<P>
On the confederation's demand for a 76 percent wage increase
for the private and public sectors, and a higher minimum wage
level, which constitute a key obstacle to a settlement between the
government and the labor, the prime minister accused the GWC of
attempting to impose its demand on the government "in a way far
away from democracy."
</P>
<P>
He said that the government upholds the effectiveness of the
demonstration ban, which the government adopted more than two
years ago following a bloody clash between the army and
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
"On the demonstration ban," the prime minister announced, "the
Council of Ministers today discussed this issue, took the
decision to ban the demonstrations and authorized the security
forces to execute this decision."
</P>
<P>
Although more talks could be held between the government and
the GWC before a possible deadlock, but in view of the staunch
stands of the two sides, a confrontation has been expected by
political observers.
</P>
<P>
A labor-led national committee met Monday and confirmed the
scheduled strike and demonstrations Thursday, and it gave the
government a deadline until Wednesday morning to meet labor's
demands.
</P>
<P>
"The committee stresses that Thursday, February 29, is only
one stop on the road of national popular movement which will not
stop until the main demands are met," the committee said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations will stop on Wednesday morning," it added.

<HEADLINE> EC Calls for Understanding at Asia Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) in Bangkok should focus on understanding rather than
provoking conflict, the European Commission (EC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The summit should discuss a full range of issues "in a way that
will prompt understanding rather than provoke conflict," said a
statement issued by EC President Jacques Santer and Commissioners
Leon Brittan and Manuel Marin.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM summit will provide an opportunity for the first time
for the leaders of 25 nations from Asia and the European Union to
discuss improving cooperation between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The EC believes the summit will help boost bilateral
investment, cooperation on the future world trade agenda, the
opening of a dialogue on UN reform, cooperation on arms control
and provide a forum to discuss the two regions' different values
"in a climate that will encourage trust and respect."
</P>
<P>
EC President Jacques Santer, who will attend the summit, told a
press conference today that the summit "will give Europe and Asia
the chance to discuss improved access to trade and investment in
each other's markets as well as helping them draw closer on key
trade issues, notably global investment rules."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official: New Taxation System Guards Against Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A tightening taxation system
 to prevent rampant smuggling and tax evasion in China's
flourishing processing trade has been proved a success on a trial
basis and is likely to be carried out nation-wide, according to a
high-ranking Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Duanmu Jun, deputy commissioner of the Chinese General
Administration of Customs, made the remarks here today at a China
Taxation Seminar, which was organized by the Better Hong Kong
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of Hong Kong businessmen, the official gave
 a detailed explanation of the new system, which has been
implemented on a trial basis in three Chinese cities -- Guangdong
province's Dongguan, Jiangsu province's Suzhou and Zhejiang
province's Ningbo -- since November last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, a business in processing trade is required to
 set up a counter account of security deposits for imported
materials at the specified Bank of China offices. Only if all the
processed products are exported within the limited time, can the
counter account be canceled.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the new measure has been proved
feasible and practical in the trial execution, since
administrations can keep a close watch on procedures of processing
 trade so as to prevent illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in 1994, the Chinese Customs tracked
down 465 major cases of smuggling carried out through processing
trade, accounting for 61 percent of the total value of smuggling
cases.
</P>
<P>
This not only dents the national revenue due to tax evasion,
but also hurts law-abiding businesses, said the
official. Processing trade generated an import and export value of
133.28 billion US dollars in 1995, nearly half of the country's
total foreign trade value.
</P>
<P>
The deputy commissioner said that the system does not bring
much trouble to businesses, who are able to complete all
formalities in 4.5 working days and need not actually pay security
 deposits to set aside their funds. It will be adopted on a
step-by-step basis in other cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
The system is one of the three major reform measures China has
planned to adopt in the year of 1996 to shake up its import and
export taxation. The other is to slash the customs duty rates by
36 percent on more than 4,900 items, and at the same time to
suspend all import tax exemption and reduction. It will be put
into force from April, 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The third one, which began to be implemented on January 1,
1996, lowers the refund rate for exported goods.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spilt Brings Huge Disaster to Birds in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's biggest environmental
disaster in 29 years could eventually kill up to 50,000 birds,
wildlife experts said this week.
</P>
<P>
The 65,000 tons of oil spilt from the tanker Sea Empress last
week was the worst since the Torrey Canyon tanker spilt more than
100,000 tons of oil off the Cornish coast in south west England in
1967, killing 50,000 birds.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife rescue services estimate that so far 20,000 birds have
been affected by the spill off the south west coast of Wales and
the figure could soar over the next few of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Richard White, an expert for the Devon Wildlife Trust,
said: "We estimate that for every one bird we capture alive there
are up to 50 dead ones on the beaches or out at sea."
</P>
<P>
A 56-kilometer stretch of coastline near Milford Haven, where
the Sea Empress sank, is now littered with the oily corpses of sea
birds. Some 45 grey seals were seen swimming in the blackened sea.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 oiled birds, including guillemots, razorbills,
scoters and red throated divers, have been taken to rescue centers
around the country where they are being fed, cleaned with
washing-up liquid and left to dry.
</P>
<P>
If they are not rescued in time, they die of hypothermia or
toxic poisoning.

<HEADLINE> More Opportunities and Better Conditions for Chinese Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to provide
more opportunities and a more favorable environment for women's
development.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qicao, vice-chairwoman of the All-China Women's
Federation, made the remark at a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Last September China successfully hosted the UN Fourth World
Conference on Women (FWCW) in Beijing, showing the new image of
Chinese women during China's reforms and opening-up period, and
promoting cultural and economic exchanges between Chinese women
and women in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Huang said, "Educational conditions, living standards and
health care for women were improved last year, and more women took
part in China's social and economic construction."
</P>
<P>
By 1995 illiteracy was eliminated among more than three
million women, and as a result an international prize was given to
the All-China Women's Federation by the UN Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) during the FWCW.
</P>
<P>
A total of 96 million rural women were given practical skill
training, and 580,000 of them have become economic leaders in
their villages.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the Children's Foundation of the All-China Women's
Federation received donations totalling over four million, helping
100,000 poor girls return to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 is the first year of China's Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000). Huang pointed out that work should emphasize
improving women's quality and offering more vocational training to
help rural women get rich and unemployed women in cities find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Also, March 8 of 1996 is the 86th Women's Day, and various
activities will be held to celebrate the festival. Some
outstanding women will give speeches across the country, and a
photo show to feature current Chinese women's conditions is to be
held in Hong Kong.

<P>
MACAO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to hold its 7th arts
festival next month and offers performances, exhibitions,
concerts, drama and ballet shows to local citizens.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Macao Cultural Institute announced today
that the annual arts festival will be held between March 9 and 31,
and will include a dozen art troupes and cultural institutions
from Portugal, Mozambique, Czech, the Chinese mainland and Macao.
</P>
<P>
A cultural unit from the Chinese mainland, the Nanjing Museum
from east China's Jiangsu Province, will attend the festival for
the first time. The museum will send about 80 pieces of cultural
relics for an exhibition of Chinese antiques, covering a period
from the new stone age to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The official said that the festival will cost six million
Patacas (about 776,100 US dollars), an increase of one million
Patacas compared with the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
"We aim at improving local citizen's awareness of arts, and
offering them with more colorful entertainment," said Gabriela
Pombas Cabelo, president of the Macao Cultural Institute.

SHANGHAI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The British company
Shandwick, the world's largest independent public relations

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Liu Jing, deputy governor of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, met a group of experts from
Germany here today to express his thanks to Germany for its
donation of five million marks for the province's quake victims.
</P>
<P>
Liu discussed with the group the projects made possible by the
donation and briefed them on the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The donation was intended to combine relief with poverty
elimination, said Christoph J. Burk, head of the group.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake left 17,000 dead or injured, demolished or
seriously damaged over 900,000 houses and left economic losses
topping four billion yuan (about 482 million US dollars), Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to rehabilitate the quake-hit
area within the next three years, he said, adding that the biggest
difficulty is shortage of money.
</P>
<P>
In 1988 the German government donated 20 million marks after an
earthquake hit Lancang and Gengma counties, also in Yunnan. For
this also, Liu also expressed his appreciation.
</P>
<P>
The group will pay a six-day visit to the disaster area and
then deliver a report to the German government on how to implement
the relief projects.

<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
repatriate all the remaining 1,898 Vietnamese asylum-seekers
camped in Palawan, by June 30 this year, Foreign Affairs
Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision was made as Manila has no more funds
to support them and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees could not commit fund support either.
</P>
<P>
The earlier reported support commitment by the Catholic Bishops
Conference of the Philippines was also vague as the church group
did not pledge any specific amount, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the Vietnamese will realize that repatriation
is the best option for them and returning to their country would
be much better in the long run than staying in the camp with an
uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
All repatriations, he added, will be carried out in the
presence of representatives of church and non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Originally, there were 2,469 Vietnamese refugees in the
southeastern Philippine province of Palawan.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Commentary Marks Taiwan Uprising (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years Lee Teng-hui's attempt to split the motherland
has been fully exposed. More and more people in Taiwan have come
to realize that Lee's splittist activities and some people's
perverse acts to assert "Taiwan independence" will only push
Taiwan into a disastrous abyss, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
To achieve an early, peaceful reunification of the motherland,
the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits must make
joint efforts to fight against splittism preached by the Taiwan
authorities and against the "Taiwan independence" forces, make
them stop trying to create "two Chinas" and "one China, one
Taiwan" and return to the "one China" principle. Only by this
means can Taiwan have a bright future, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan compatriots have a glorious history of fighting
against foreign invasion, and they showed patriotic enthusiasm in
the "February 28 Uprising", when they fought against the despotic
and corrupt Kuomintang regime, the commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the Chinese government have always supported and
shown sympathy with the Taiwan compatriots, it says.
</P>
<P>
"We fully respect the lifestyle of the Taiwan compatriots and
their aspiration to be masters of their own affairs. We also
respect their desire to exercise democratic rights and have
adopted measures to protect all the Taiwan compatriots' legal
rights and interests. However, we firmly oppose the attempts by
certain leaders of the Taiwan authorities to create "two Chinas",
"one China, one Taiwan" or "Taiwan independence" under the guise
of "democratization", the commentary stresses.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government solemnly states that a country's
sovereignty belongs to all the citizens of that country, and the
sovereignty of China, including that of the Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen
and Mazu regions, belongs to all the Chinese people, including the
Taiwan compatriots, but definitely not to only certain persons in
Taiwan. These persons must not be allowed to make any changes on
the sovereignty, says the commentary.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of reunification, whoever or whichever party
follows the 'one China' principle and upholds reunification and
opposes 'Taiwan independence' will have our support. Otherwise,
we will firmly oppose them," says the commentary.

NICOSIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has expressed indignation at the terrorist attacks
against innocent people in Jerusalem and Ashkelon in Israel Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Israeli President Ezer Weizman,
which was released here today, President Clerides expressed his

Cyprus to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
A powerful bomb ripped through a Jerusalem city bus Sunday,
killing 25 people. A second bomb in Ashkelon less than an hour

</P>
<P>
The Cyprus president stressed that "such actions aim at
disrupting the peace process in the Middle East and cause the
wrath and condemnation of democratic people all over the world."
</P>
<P>
"We hope," he continued, "that in the face of such a

terrorist acts in Israel.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
"This fact underlines even more strongly the need to give
the message that the peace process is irreversible and is the
only means that can bring peace, stability and progress in the
area," it added.

<HEADLINE> UN Council "Strongly Deplores" Downing U.S. Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
"strongly deplores" the shooting down by Cuban air force of two
civil aircraft on February 24, which apparently has resulted in
the death of four persons, said a presidential statement of the
council.
</P>
<P>
Madeleine Albright, current president of the Security Council
and representative of the United States, said in her statement
just adopted that the council recalls that according to
international law, as reflected in Article 3 bis of the
international Convention on Civil Aviation of 7 December 1944
added by the Montreal Protocol of 10 May 1984, states must refrain
from the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight and must
not endanger the lives of persons on board and the safety of
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"States are obliged to respect international law and human
rights norms in all circumstances," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council requests that the International Civil
Aviation Organization investigate this incident in its entirety
and calls on the governments concerned to cooperate fully with
this investigation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council requests that International Civil Aviation
Organization report its findings to the council as soon as
possible. The council will consider that report and any further
information presented to it without delay, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Before the Security Council adopting the presidential
statement, Cuban representative delivered a 30-minute speech,
which elaborated U.S. planes violating Cuban airspace in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
After the two U.S. planes were shot down last Saturday, Cuba
accused the two U.S. planes violating its airspace and U.S.
officials lying over the downing of the two planes.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times also reported Monday that U.S. intelligence
officials had admitted that the two planes might have violated the
Cuban airspace and the Cuban control tower had given warning
before the two planes were shot down.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday Cuba asked the Security Council refrain from
taking any action until its Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina
arrives in New Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan FM Calls On UN To Bring Perpetrators Before Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Foreign Minister
Anastase Gasana today called on the United Nations to help
bringing perpetrators before justice.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the call at a press conference at Africa
Hall here. He is here to attend the three-day 63rd Ordinary
Session of the Council of Ministers of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), which opened here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He said, the UN has not been able to avoid genocide in Rwanda,
but must not fail to assist efforts being made to bring the
perpetrators before justice.
</P>
<P>
In spite of its big peacekeeping force, the UN did not manage
to protect Rwandan people from one of the most traumatic events
in world history, the minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We want the international tribunal to be successful," he said
adding preparations were speeded up to begin the justice process.
</P>
<P>
Close to one seventh of Rwanda's population was massacared in
a blood curdling genocide between April and July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that his government is exerting utmost
effort to bring a viable and coherent solution to the post-
genocide socio-economic problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the voluntary repatriation of refugees is going well
despite some hinderances caused by fugitives who are trying to
take the refugees hostage in order to escape justice.
</P>
<P>
He added that the repatriation and resettlment of over a
million of refugees is one of the serious challenges facing the
new Rwandan government. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iranian Vice President Starts Visit to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Vice President Hassan
Habibi arrived in Damascus today on a three-day official visit to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Vice President was received at Damascus
International Airport by his Syrian counterpart Abdul-Halim
Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
During his current visit to Syria, Habibi will head an Iranian
delegation to a meeting of the Syrian-Iranian Joint Committee.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival at Damascus airport, the Iranian Vice President
made press remarks in which he praised Syrian-Iranian bilateral
relations, describing them as "positive and good," and affirmed
that the two sides would always seek to develop these relations
for the better.
</P>
<P>
"We will review a number of regional and international
questions with the aim of bringing closer our views on these
questions," Habibi said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital said the Iranian Vice
President's current visit to Damascus and the talks he will have
with Syrian officials gain a great deal of importance. It is
because the visit comes on the eve of a new round of
Syrian-Israeli negotiation in the American state of Maryland and
in the wake of the recent developments in Iraq and a period of
frigidity in the Syrian-Iranian relations over the Syria-Israel
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Habibi is carrying with him a message
from Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad on the future of Syrian-Iranian relations.
</P>
<P>
Habib's visit to Syria will be followed by a visit of Syrian
Prime Minister Mahmoud Zouebi to Tehran with the aim of giving
a new impetus to the Syrian-Iranian relations, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Habibi's current visit to Syrian was delayed several times
because of Iran's preoccupation with its coming parliamentary
election.
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Damascus think that Habibi's visit to
Syria will be a new opportunity for the two sides to examine the
Syria-Israel peace process file, the recent developments in Iraq
and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iran have shown willingness to maintain the strategic
ties which have been existing since the outbreak of the Islamic
Revolution in Iran in 1978.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Border clashes between
Cambodia and Thailand have been dramatically reduced thanks to the
joint efforts of both countries, the Agency of Khmer Press said today.
</P>
<P>
A joint committee on cooperation along the border between the
two countries played a leading role in the reduction, the agency
quoted Second Prime Minister Hun Sen as telling new Thai
Ambassador Domedy Bunnag.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen hoped that the Thai government will provide Cambodia
with agricultural technology and continue to give scholarships to
Cambodian students.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Thailand for helping Cambodia's accession to
the seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
which will be completed by 1997.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Launches Primary Health Care Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
launched programs for family planning and primary health care, a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Shahnaz Wazir Ali, special assistant to Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, said that primary health care service in the country was
still inadequate in its coverage and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the problem partly to the lack of health
personnel in Pakistan, especially of female medical staff.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, as many as 22,624 Lady Health
Workers (LHW) have been trained in the country by January 1996 and
another 8,143 are being trained.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a target to train 40,000 LHWs by June
1996 and 100,000 LHWs by June 1998, she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that main objectives to be achieved under the programs
included expansion of availability of family planning services in
rural and urban areas as well as improvement of nutrition status
of mothers and children in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Commentary Marks Taiwan Uprising (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
"People's Daily", marks the 49th anniversary of the "February 28
Uprising" in Taiwan in a commentary to be published tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The commentary describes the uprising as a democratic political
movement launched by the people of the island province and a
historic event of major influence in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The intensification of contradictions between the people and
the authorities in Taiwan at the time cast a shadow on the
political life of Taiwan, and these contradictions still exert an
influence on the political life of Taiwan today, it says.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the uprising broke out, the Communist Party of China
(CPC) fairly described it as "a justified, legitimate and peaceful
movement".
</P>
<P>
The commentary says: "It was because of Chiang Kai-shek's
intransigence that the movement turned into an armed struggle."
And "the armed struggle in self-defense staged by the Taiwan
people was forced upon them. It is necessary, justified and
correct", the commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the Chinese government have always pinned high
hopes on the Taiwan people in the unremitting efforts to solve the
Taiwan issue and realize the reunification of the motherland, the
commentary stresses.
</P>
<P>
This principle was indicated in the speech made by President
Jiang Zemin on the eve of the Spring Festival in 1995, and in a
series of government's policies, regulations and measures
governing the protection of the legal rights and interests of the
Taiwan compatriots, it adds.
</P>
<P>
To put an early end to the state of separation between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits is the popular feeling and the general
trend, it says.
</P>
<P>
However, the commentary states, certain anti-China forces in
the world, who are reluctant to see the reunification and
prosperity of China, support the splittist forces in Taiwan by
various means with the intention of obstructing the development of
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and China's
reunification drive.
</P>
<P>
Some leaders of the Taiwan authorities collude with the
overseas anti-China forces and engage in separatist activities in
an attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan",
which have led to unprecedented tension in the cross-Straits
relations, directly undermined economic growth and social
stability in Taiwan and seriously damaged the immediate interests
of the Taiwan people, the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> Japan Plans to Open Provincial Government Jobs to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The southern Japanese prefecture
of Kochi today became the first in the country to announce plans
to scrap rules preventing foreigners working for the local
government, Kyodo News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Daijiro Hashimoto, younger brother of Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and the governor of Kochi, wants to remove the
Japanese nationality requirement for people applying to take
the prefecture's public examinations for some 20 executive
positions, excluding police and teachers, in the Kochi government.
</P>
<P>
The governor proposed the plan at the opening session of the
prefectural assembly despite opposition from the Home Affairs
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the prefecture's 900 or so foreign residents,
mostly Koreans, will be eligible to take part in the examinations
from this summer.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal has yet to be endorsed by the prefectural
personnel committee, the local government's recruitment
organization, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, a journalist-turned-politician, is confident he can
convince the personnel committee, saying he hoped the committee
will lift the nationality requirement in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The Home affairs Ministry has cast doubt on the move,
reiterating that in 1953, the then cabinet announced that people
involved in the use of government power and the formation of
national policies should be Japanese nationals.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hashimoto expressed some support for his younger
brother on February 20, saying that foreigners should be allowed
to serve for prefectural governments, but subject to what kind of
the job is offered.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Zimbabwe To Explore New Trade Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa said today that he would dispatch Tanzania's Chamber of
Commerce on an exploratory tour of Zimbabwe to boost trade
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe at the end of a two-day working visit, Mkapa said the
purpose of his visit was to ''add a new momentum to the
traditional and demonstrably strong'' political and economic
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is against that background that Tanzania would be sending
the commerce delegation to determine which specific areas of
trade could be exploited for the benefit of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe said that he hoped the discussions between
the two leaders would result in the formulation of ''concrete
plans'', adding that Zimbabwe took cognisance of the role played
by Tanzania during the liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe hinted at the possibility of Zimbabwean exports going
through Dar es Salaam Port and the railway from Zambia to
Tanzania, in the spirit of Southern African Development Community
(SADC) which calls for maximum exploitation of the region's
ports.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in strife-torn central African countries of
Burundi and Rwanda, Mkapa said his country was doing everything
possible to impress on leaders of both countries to respect the
political dispensation on the will of the majority and security
of the minority. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's security chief today
warned the country is facing the dangerous possibility of nuclear
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Barsukov said it was "quite possible" for terrorists to
seize weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear weapons, other
radioactive materials and hazardous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Barsukov, director of the Federal Security Service (FSS), told
a joint meeting of the FSS and interior ministry that the number
of crimes related to explosions, hostage-taking and
politically-motivated murders is growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
Describing terrorism as "the gravest danger" to the Russians,
Barsukov stressed that Chechnya would continue to be a source of
terrorism for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Chechen separatists threatened months ago to use nuclear
weapons to strike Moscow or other Russian cities if Moscow
continued its war in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Parliament Differs on No-Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government
survived a vote of no confidence in the upper house of parliament
Monday night but faced defeat in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Democratic Convention alliance tabled a motion
blasting the government's failure to resolve a serious power
shortage in the country which has hit production at hundreds of
companies and led to worker demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
During the debate before the vote in the lower house, Prime
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu dismissed what the opposition called "an
energy crisis" in the country, saying there were only occasional
power shortages.
</P>
<P>
He said the shortfall was due in part to outdated equipment in
the power sector and debts between power generators, fuel
suppliers and industrial consumers.
</P>
<P>
Power shortages have cut production at hundreds of
enterprises. Workers in some major enterprises such as the
country's two leading steel works, Hunedoala and Resita, have held
protest rallies and demonstrations to demand a settlement from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The power shortage was mainly blamed on the lack of fuel
supplies, including coal, natural gas and oil, for the country's
thermal electricity power stations.
</P>
<P>
But bitter winter weather, which has caused drastic cutbacks
in the production of hydropower, has also contributed. Hydropower
makes up 28 percent of the country's total electricity production.
</P>
<P>
The government has imported a considerable amount of heavy oil
and asked Russia to increase its gas supplies to Romania.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened on Colombo Bridges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Security is being tightened on
major bridges in greater Colombo following indications of Tamil
rebels' plans to blow up some major bridges leading to the city,
police sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The bridges believed to be the target of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are the main Kelani Bridge, the new Japan
Friendship Bridge, the old Victoria Bridge and the railway bridge,
all crossing the Kelani river, as well as bridges spanning the
canal system around the city, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
They said the information was provided by LTTE suspects caught
in the Central Bank bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
According to these suspects, the LTTE has planned tactics
similar to that used in the Central Bank attack that killed 90
people and injured some 1,400 others on January 31.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is believed to plan to use explosive-laden trucks
parked on the bridges.
</P>
<P>
In this light, the sources said security personnel manning the
check points at the bridges have been instructed to search all
heavy vehicles thoroughly before they are allowed onto the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting against the government for a
separate Tamil state in the north-east of the country since 1983.
More than 50,000 people have been killed in the ethnic war,
according to the government.

<HEADLINE> hke022741-- High Growth Rate Projected for India's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- India's 1995-96 Economic
Survey today projected a high overall economic growth rate of 6.2
percent and called for continuing efforts to deepen and widen the
country's economic reforms, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
However, the pre-budget survey prescribed hard options in the
macro economic management and warned the government of difficult
decisions in handling emerging new challenges in the economic
scenario.
</P>
<P>
"The task of economic reforms is far from over," said the
survey tabled in Parliament today. It noted that the country's
strong economic performance in recent years would not continue of
its own accord.
</P>
<P>
The survey, preceding a vote on a four-month budget in
parliament tomorrow, urged the government to take guidance and
inspiration from the fast growing East Asian "miracle" economies
to raise the living standards of the people and eliminate the
"scourge" of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that if India wanted to achieve a sustained
economic growth rate of seven to nine percent over the next two
decades, it would have to encourage a rapid increase in foreign
direct investment.
</P>
<P>
It tried to allay fears that foreign investment would swamp the
country's indigenous industry and create unemployment, saying that
these apprehensions were either grossly unfounded or exaggerated.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Consumer Council
is considering a proposal for a computer linkup with hospital
emergency rooms to better pinpoint dangerous household products.
</P>
<P>
The information, provided daily by medical staff, would provide
invaluable statistics on injury accidents and give early warning
of hazardous products entering the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
That is expected to save lives.
</P>
<P>
The council is considering proposing an arrangement with the
Hospital Authorities after studying the success of a similar
system in the United States, which collates information from
hospitals across the country.
</P>
<P>
Chief research and testing officer Connie Lau Yin-hing said,
"Product-related injury statistics are very important for our
research and implementation of the Consumer Goods Safety
Ordinance, which came into effect last October."
</P>
<P>
With information supplied to a central computer at a
surveillance center, it will be able to determine whether
follow-up action needs to be taken.
</P>
<P>
Every year, some 1.6 million people receive treatment for
accidents in Hong Kong's hospitals.

<HEADLINE> British Aerospace to Produce Hawk Parts in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 27 (Xinhua) -- British Aerospace (BAe)
will have some components of its Hawk aircraft manufactured in
Malaysia to overcome the slow delivery from Britain, Malaysian
Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that BAe would manufacture the components in a joint
venture with Malaysia's state-owned SME Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
"The parts will be made not only for the Royal Malaysian Air
Force's 28 Hawk aircraft but also for BAe," Syed Hamid told the
press after meeting with BAe Chief Executive Officer John Weston
at his office here today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia bought 10 Hawk-100 and 18 Hawk-200 aircraft from
Britain in 1994 under an agreement worth 1.8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Malaysian Air Force complained that it was unable to
optimize operations of the aircraft because of frequent component
breakdown, delay in obtaining replacements and lifespan that fell
short of the guarantee period.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the air force, some 40 types of the
components suffered frequent faults and it took up to three months
to obtain some of the replacements.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid told the press that he could not reveal the number
and types of the components to be manufactured in Malaysia at this
stage as discussions were still going on between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Once we get the license to produce the components locally,
there will be a transfer of technology and it will also be for the
worldwide market," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said that BAe agreed to have the repair and maintenance of
the aircraft's avionic system carried out locally instead of
having them sent to Britain.
</P>
<P>
BAe also agreed to bear the cost of replacing the components
that failed ahead of the guaranteed lifespan, Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
The British company will reportedly organize a seminar in June
for users of the Hawk to help improve the aircraft's performance.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Reaffirms Demonstration Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri today reaffirmed a government ban on demonstrations, and
said the police and the army are authorized to enforce the ban.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement at a press conference following an
extraordinary session of the cabinet today.
</P>
<P>
Just two days before nation-wide demonstrations planned by
trade unions and political opposition forces, the Council of
Ministers held the extraordinary session in the Beirut
Presidential Palace this morning to discuss worker's demands and
measures to maintain law and order.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting, presided by President Elias Hrawi and
attended by Prime Minister Hariri and 25 members of his
government, lasted three and half hours.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following the meeting, the prime
minister accused the General Workers Confederation, which called
for the nation-wide demonstrations on Thursday, of "attempting to
impose its demands on the government in an undemocratic way."
</P>
<P>
He restated a demonstration ban adopted by the government more
than two years ago following a bloody clash between the army
troops and demonstrators in a mainly Shiite populated suburb in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
He said the ban is still effective.
</P>
<P>
Hariri announced that the government decided to authorize the
security forces, including the police and the army, to enforce
the ban.
</P>
<P>
Even before today's cabinet session, police sources reported
that army units and internal security forces had begun deploying
on capital streets and elsewhere as a precautious measure to
prevent the demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> Australian Defense Considers to Buy Patriot Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A study by the Australian
Defense Force (ADF) has suggested the purchase of Patriot-style
missile system to improve and enhance the country's defense
strength.
</P>
<P>
The study, confirmed today by a high-ranking official in the
Department of Defense, has been submitted to the department for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Defense issued a formal request this month to
the defense industry to "register interest" in the project, which
aims to give the ADF the ability to destroy laser-guided bombs and
even cruise missiles before they reach targets in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The study comes at a time when many countries in the region are
acquiring modern fighters, the local paper "The Australian" said
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited Indonesia as an example that is considering to
purchase nine frontline F-16 fighters from the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Collinson, director of the
ADF's missile project, the budget for the project is estimated
around 250 million Australian dollars (187.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The study, however, is only in its preliminary stages and any
final decision to purchase a new missile defense system and to
allocate the budget would not be made in years, Collinson was
quoted as saying by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Collinson added that the Patriot surface-to-air missile would
be one of many options to be considered as there is still debate
within the Defense Department about whether the costly Patriot
would be suitable for Australia.

TOKYO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar briefly sank to
the year's low of 103.97 yen before 5 p.m. in Tokyo today, on
selling by U.S. funds and Japanese institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The dollar later recovered the 104 yen level, aided by the

The U.S. currency was changing hands at 104.22-25 yen at
5 p.m., down from 104.58-61 yen at 9 a.m.. It hit an intraday
high of 104.67 yen before 10 a.m. on buybacks by Japanese life
insurance companies.

Meanwhile, Tokyo stock prices fell sharply as the market saw
heavy arbitrage-linked selling.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Import Duty Adjustment in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The cancellation of tax
exemption and reduction on imported products, to be fully
implemented in China from April 1, does not imply any policy
tightening with regard to foreign investment, said a high-ranking
Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
"To cancel or adjust tax exemption and reduction, coupled with
big cuts on customs duty rates, is in compliance with the final
documents of the Uruguay Round talks and is consistent with the
practice of other countries," Wang Liaoping of the Chinese
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation told a seminar
on China's tax and customs policies here today.
</P>
<P>
The preferential policy of tax exemption and cut was originally
formed during the initial stage of China's reform and opening,
with the aim of freeing those foreign-funded enterprises from the
bondage of a planned economy, according to Wang, who admitted this
was unique in the world.
</P>
<P>
When a socialist market economy is gradually established, it is
inevitable to adjust these policies, he said. Enterprises, either
foreign-invested or domestically-funded, should now be put under
the same administrative measures.
</P>
<P>
"This does not imply any tightening in our foreign investment
policy," said Wang, who is in charge of the Department of Foreign
Investment in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the contracted foreign investment amounted to 90.3
billion US dollars in China, and the actual inflow of capital hit
a record high of 37.7 billion US dollars, representing a
12-percent growth over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), China intends to
maintain year-on-year growth in the inflow of overseas capital,
Wang told hundreds of Hong Kong businessmen who attended the
seminar.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has always been the bridgehead to channel overseas
investment into China since the country started opening to the
outside world in 1978. It is estimated that of the total 100
billion US dollar worth of overseas investment, 60 percent flew in
through Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> 30 Hamas Activists Arrested in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Thirty Hamas activists have
 been arrested in the West Bank by the Palestinian security
forces in a crackdown by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
on the organization, Israel Radio said today.
</P>
<P>
The movement follows two Hamas suicide bombing attacks
Sunday in Jerusalem and Ashkelon, which killed 22 Israelis, two
Americans and one Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian security official said today in Gaza that
90 Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists including some of the groups'
leaders are under arrest in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Demands that Hamas fugitives be arrested are to be raised at a
meeting tonight between Israeli army Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak
and PNA President Yasser Arafat at the Erez checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Shahak is expected to spell out what Israel expects the PNA to
do following the two suicide attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Internal Security Minister Moshe Shahal
said today that the closure, imposed on the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip must continue for a long time since the PNA has not proved
that it is wiping out extremist organizations under its
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Israel sealed off the Palestinian territories Sunday
immediately following the deadly attacks.
</P>
<P>
Shahal said that the most basic and important thing the
Israeli citizens need now is security.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Russian-U.S. "Chicken War" Abates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A Russian-U.S. chicken battle
abated Monday as a Russian agriculture official expressed
confidence that the dispute between Moscow and Washington over the
issue of poultry imports could be resolved short of an outright
trade war.
</P>
<P>
The chicken war loomed last Friday when Moscow threatened to
perpetuate its temporary suspension of frozen poultry imports as
of March 16 unless Washington exporters improved health and safety
standards to Moscow's satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
The threat provoked protests from Washington. A U.S.
Department of Agriculture official said on the same day that
Washington might review agriculture trade ties with Russia if the
ban went through. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Russia
was using "inaccurate science or incomplete data" in evaluating
sanitary norms.
</P>
<P>
However, Vyacheslav Avilov, head of the Russian Agriculture
Ministry's veterinary department, said Monday that negotiations
should ease the problem.
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely sure that the Americans will fulfil all our
requirements and we will reach an agreement," Avilov said. But he
declined to give a timetable for talks, and only said: "That all
depends on the American side."
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue of both quality and certification," Avilov
continued. "We need guarantees that these birds are disease-free,
quality products -- that there is no salmonella, no bad chemical
additives, or the like. The U.S. must meet its responsibilities
for the problem to go away," he noted.
</P>
<P>
U.S. chicken imports are big business in Russia, which imported
over 500 million U.S. dollars worth of chicken in 1995, 70 percent
of which came from the United States, according to official
statistics here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. birds are on the same market as Russian ones, which
are scrawny, gray and unappealing. Chickens from both countries
are often sold from barely-refrigerated containers or on the
street in cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the largest export market for U.S. birds, suspended
shipments last Wednesday, citing failure to comply with new health
regulations, the latest and strongest in a string of recent moves
countering foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Pesov, vice president of Soyuzhontrakt, a private
company that controls 55 percent of Russia's poultry imports, said
on Monday that complaints about U.S. chicken quality were rife. He
denied Russia was trying to protect domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
"During our numerous checkups both here and in the U.S., we
found out that the poultry imported from the U.S. does not reflect
the needed health safety standards," an Agriculture Ministry
official noted. "What they guarantee and what they show us are not
satisfactory. They are not prepared in the right fashion. It's not
a ban, it's a temporary halt, and it has nothing to do with
protectionism."
</P>
<P>
Some experts here, however, saw the situation differently.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that this measure is part of a protectionist slant
that began with Vladimir Kadannikov (First Deputy Prime Minister)
joining the Russian government," said Yaroslav Lissovolik, an
expert with the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy.
</P>
<P>
Konstantin Vorobyov, a public relations director with
Soyuzhontrakt, said the ban move could prove effective in cracking
down upon gray-market importers of poultry of dubious quality. But
he did not think a full ban would take effect.
</P>
<P>
"Russia producers cannot satisfy the demand anyway, and the
U.S. fowl is still the cheapest imported chicken available in
Russia," he pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people were
killed and 33 others wounded in a fresh heavy fighting between
the two rival Somaliland forces, according to local radio reports
today.
</P>
<P>
The forces loyal to President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal of the
break away Republic of SomaliLand launched an attack Sunday
against those of his main rival, Abdurahman Ahmed Ali in the
suburb of Buro town, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking through radio in Hargeisa, the capital of Somali-
land, Defense Minister Abdullahi Hussein Iman said his Somali-
land government has lost three of its soldiers but gained the
upper hand in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Iman said that the government forces now remain in full
control of the remote town of Buro, 150 miles east of Hargeisa
and its surroundings. He claimed that his forces have killed the
field commander of the rebel forces, Omar Ddhego-Finish.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a spokesman for the rebel forces in South
Mogadishu said their forces have defeated the government forces
in Buro and captured a large amount of ammunition and assorted
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman Hussein Ismail Salah said their forces now
control Buro and inflicted the government forces heavy losses
during the battle.
</P>
<P>
The government forces are mainly dominated by the Habar Awal
subclan of President Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal, while those of
the rebels belong to the Gar Hajis subclan of Abdurahman Ahmed
Ali, who is the first Vice President of General Mohamed Farah
Aidid in South Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Dayton-type Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has rejected the idea of a Dayton-type procedure for a
solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Clerides' position was expressed in an interview with the
Greek Television, shown here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the case of Bosnia a hasty solution was
reached in order to avoid a terrible bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
But in the case of Cyprus, "there is no need for doing
something hasty because despite the continuation of Turkish
occupation of 37 percent of the island's territory there is no
bloodshed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion that a Dayton-type of procedure is probably the
only way forward towards a comprehensive agreement on the Cyprus
problem, was put forward by Greek American leader and President of
the Council of Overseas Hellenes (Greeks), Andrew Athens, who
visited Cyprus last week.
</P>
<P>
He told Cyprus radio last Saturday that the U.S. administration
favors such a procedure and expressed the hope that both Athens
and Nicosia would accept it.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, President Clerides also said no new
U.S. initiative on Cyprus would be launched, at present, because
of the inability of Turkish political parties to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said Carrie Cavanaugh, Director of the Office of
Southern European Affairs at the U.S. State Department,
reaffirmed, during his recent visit to the island, President Bill
Clinton's position that the U.S. would undertake within 1996 a
role for a solution to the Cyprus problem, after a Turkish
government is formed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite all U.N. and
international peace efforts in past 21 years.

<HEADLINE> German Boxers' Group to Challenge IBF on Botha Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Association of
Professional Boxers opposed on Tuesday the ruling by the
International Boxing Federation (IBF) that the doping-invovled IBF
champion Frans Botha of South African might fight American Michael
Moorer first.
</P>
<P>
The German group said Botha's first opponent should be Germany
heavyweight Axel Schulz, adding that IBF ruling denying Schulz an
early rematch against Botha was a "low blow" and would be
challenged.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the IBF ruled that Botha could keep his crown
despite taking anabolic steroids before his fight with Schulz
last December.
</P>
<P>
In addition, IBF ordered the South African should give his
challenger a rematch within 180 days with the winner going on to
fight Moorer.
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, IBF president Robert Lee said officials had not
fully taken into account an agreement that bound the winner of the
December bout between Botha and Schulz to fight Moorer by June 9.
</P>
<P>
Lee said several members of the IBF's executive and
championship committees had met again and decided to reverse part
of Saturday's decision.

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Reserves Orders on Hawala Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The designated court dealing
with India's bribery scandal today reserved orders for Thursday on
taking cognizance of the charge sheets against ten politicians,
said the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old 18-million-US-dollar scandal is locally
known as the hawala case.
</P>
<P>
The special court postponed its decision after the Central
Bureau of Investigation (CBI) submitted additional documents to
support its charges against the politicians for their alleged
involvement in the hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Today is the deadline set by the special court for the CBI to
file all supportive documents on the charges against the ten
politicians, including Bharatiya Janata Party President L.K.
Advani and All India Indira Congress Working President Arjun
Singh.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indian MP Admits Receiving Bribe from Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- India's hawala case took a
new twist Monday when an opposition member of parliament (MP)
alleged that he had been bribed to vote in favor of the government
in a no-confidence motion in July 1993, The Financial Express said
today.
</P>
<P>
Shailendra Mahato, an MP who quit the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha
(JMM) and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) early last
month, said that he had been paid four million rupees (about
109,600 US dollars) to do so, said the report.
</P>
<P>
He added he had been told that the money had come from Prime
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Rao allegedly used money received from
hawala kingpin S.K. Jain to buy four JMM MPs to vote against the
no-confidence motion. Mahato is the only MP yet to admit it.
</P>
<P>
S.K. Jain is the key suspect of illegal foreign exchange
dealers (hawala dealers) in the 18-million-US-dollar scandal that
is rocking the country's entire political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Delhi High Court issued a notice to the Central
Bureau of Investigation asking the agency why it had not conducted
probe into the bank account of another JMM MP who allegedly
received money from Rao. This MP had denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of Mahato's open allegation, the BJP said that it
would move a privilege motion against Rao in the parliament's
final session now underway.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Congress Party Monday rejected the opposition demand
for Rao's resignation after Mahato's charges.
</P>
<P>
"I emphatically deny all the allegations. ... They are false,
groundless and politically motivated," said Congress Party
spokesman V.N. Gadgil.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Two power companies
from Tanzania and Zambia will soon present proposals to their
respective governments on power grid interconnection between the
two countries, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are expected to be made at the end of a
three-day meeting of the power companies which started here on
Monday to discuss a feasibility study report on the proposed
power grid linkage.
</P>
<P>
Results of the feasibility study were presented at the meeting by
South African Power Utility Corporate Advisor, Arnot
Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
Hepburn said the 330 KV transmission interconnection would be
useful for both Tanzania and Zambia. He was optimistic that when
the proposed project materialises, Tanzania could stop using thermal power.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) Managing
Director, Simon Mhaville, said the grid interconnection would
eliminate power crisis in Tanzania and other countries in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
The proposed transmission line interconnection would cover 630
km, and would stretch from Pensulo of Zambia to Mbeya in
Tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China and Luxemburg have distinctive
advantages and demands, which will enable them to learn from and
help each other and bring benefit to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made this remark at a meeting with visiting Luxemburg
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker at the government headquarters
of Zhongnanhai here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is willing to develop ties with Luxemburg on
the basis of mutual respect, seeking common grounds while
reserving differences, non-interference into each other's internal
affairs, equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He said that Luxemburg, though small in size, has its
distinctive features. It has a beautiful landscape, developed
economy, and advanced financial sector and iron and steel industry.
</P>
<P>
He praised Luxemburg for its distinguishing advantages and
people's high living standards. "We admire the achievements made
by the Luxemburg people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said China is a great nation with a vast territory, big
population and long history. He said that China has in recent
years made marked economic development, which brought about
enormous benefit to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburg and China enjoy good political relations and their
leaders had frequent exchange of visits, Juncker said. "In my
talks with Chinese leaders during the visit," he said, "I
discovered that we share views on a great number of issues."
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to see that China will play its due role in
international affairs and that China will join the World Trade
Organization as soon as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China is satisfied with the smooth development
of Sino-Luxemburg relations over the past years, and the expansion
of traditional bilateral cooperation in such fields as metallurgy
and finance.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate Luxemburg's positive desire to develop its ties
with China and hope that both sides would explore new ways to
strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation for even greater
development of bilateral relations," Jiang added.

<HEADLINE> Residents in Lhasa Eat More Fresh Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- "I usually make two or three
dishes with fresh vegetables for my family each meal every day,"
said Gaisang, a middle-aged Tibetan woman, with a basket full of
spinach, celery, tomato and fungi.
</P>
<P>
Residents like Gaisang in Lhasa, capital of southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region, have been able to eat more fresh
vegetables thanks to the local government's flexible policies on
vegetable management, and its effort to build more markets for
farm produce.
</P>
<P>
He Deguo, an official of the Lhasa Agricultural and Animal
Husbandry Bureau, said that over the past decade, the local
government has spent over 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million US
dollars) building vegetable production bases with a total area of
2,000 hectares and more than a dozen markets.
</P>
<P>
From the early 1980s, the local government began to introduce
preferential policies for vegetable dealers, including exempting
them from various taxes, providing housing and other daily
necessities, He Deguo said.
</P>
<P>
Every day 60,000 kg of fresh vegetables, such as hotbed chives,
asparagus lettuce, ginger and green pepper, are supplied to local
markets, including 20,000 kg of vegetables transported from
Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Hainan and Shandong provinces, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Never in my life have I seen so many fresh vegetables in Lhasa
as today," Deqen Wangmo, a Tibetan woman living in bustling Bargor
Street in central Lhasa said.
</P>
<P>
"I won't worry about buying fresh vegetables now since they are
in ample supply on the markets all year round," she added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, residents of Lhasa on the Qinghai and Tibetan
Plateau no longer have to eat only the traditional radish, potato
and Chinese cabbage in winter.
</P>
<P>
The local residents used to dig cellars to store their
vegetables to last them the whole season.
</P>
<P>
Basang Doje, a salesman for a local company who would often go
to other parts of China on business by plane, still remembers the
days when he had to take some fresh vegetables for his friends and
relatives on his way back home.
</P>
<P>
"Now I no longer have to take a heavy luggage with me to board
planes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local nutritionists noted that the increasing consumption of
green vegetables by Tibetans has helped contribute to lengthen the
life expectancy of the Tibetans.

</P>
<P>
He made the remarks yesterday when speaking to State House

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets Aside Funds to Fight Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian National
Planning Board has earmarked some 12 billion rupiah (about 5.4
million US dollars) of the coming 1996/97 budget for flood control
projects in greater Jakarta, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to fund short-term programs, including
dredging, enlarging and cleaning the 13 rivers as well as moving
illegal residents away from the banks of rivers, Minister of
National Development Planning and Chairman of the Board Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said at a recent gathering.
</P>
<P>
He said that funds were also expected to come from the Jakarta
municipal administration as the whole flood control system
requires a huge amount of money.
</P>
<P>
The floods in Jakarta in January and February killed more than
30 people, forced thousands of families to flee their homes,
created traffic jams in many parts of the capital and cut off
100,000 telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
Official statements said that the floods caused losses of
almost 90 billion rupiah (40.3 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The floods are believed to be caused by the combination of
heavy downpours, tides, waterways clogged by garbage and the
environmental degradation in the upstream areas of Bogor, Puncak
and Cianjur in West Java.
</P>
<P>
The government said that it would stop issuing new permits for
construction of hotels, restaurants and villas in the areas of
Bogor, Puncak and Cianjur, while unauthorized buildings would be
demolished.
</P>
<P>
Some tributaries, canal drainage and rivers will be enlarged to
allow faster drainage into Jakarta bay, said the reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- All member states of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU ) were called to meet their
financial obligation in full and on time.
</P>
<P>
The call was made on Monday by Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister
Tamirat Layne in his opening address to the 63rd ordinary session
of the OAU Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat said,"The total arrears owed by member states to the
organization is equal to two years regular budget of the OAU
underscores the obvious fact that our organization continues to
face a potentially grave financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
It was stated that out of the amount of 27.49 million U.S.
Dollars, only a sum of 5.03 million dollars was paid by 15 member
states over a period of 7 months during the 1995/96 budget year
starting from June 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Our organization cannot continue to leave under the shadow of
a crisis created by an ever increasing level of arrears owed to
it by member states," Tamirat stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat called on African countries to strengthen their
cooperation in economic area. He said that cooperation among
African countries in the economic area is no doubt one of the
vital elements for the economic and social development of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"It is for this reason that we need to redouble our efforts
for economic cooperation both within our respective sub-regional
economic groupings, as well as within the context of the larger
community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"it is not with might but with right that africa's future
lies, and it is by raising high the banner of mutual respect and
mutual tolerance that we can all tap on the immense potential
that we have for cooperation and unity," Tamirat stressed.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Economy Grows By 2.2 percent in 1995: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations senior
official has announced that Africa's gross domestic product (gdp)
at constant 1990 prices, grew by 2.2 percent in 1995, compared to
1.6 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by K. Y. Amoako, the UN Under
Secretary General and Executive Secretary of the Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA), at the opening session of the 63rd
ordinary session of the Council of African Ministers here
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He said that no less than half the countries of Africa have
been enjoying real gdp growth in excess of their population
growth rates through 1995, with more than a third of these
countries recorded growth rates of 6 percent and above in the
period.
</P>
<P>
Only three African countries experienced negative growth rates
in 1995, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "all this is a source of hope", saying
that "it is a vindication of the economic reforms and sound
policies which our countries have struggled to implement at
considerable social cost in the last decade or so."
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the average income per capita growth in the 53
member states has improved, and the year 1995 has seen a
turnaround in per capita growth in the sub-Saharan countries as a
whole, Amoako noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that for the second year running, Africa has enjoyed a
modest improvement in its term of trade, and that these countries
have retained remarkable price stability as well.
</P>
<P>
He called on African countries which are implementing reforms
to "build on successful policies, or deepen them in order to
sustain growth and prepare for the challenges and opportunities
of the 21 century".

SHIJIAZHUANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 percent of
the 8.2 million poor farmers in north China's Hebei Province have
escaped poverty over the past five years thanks to government's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The people live mainly in remote mountains and coastal
lower-lying areas, which are frequently hit by droughts, floods,
endemic diseases and land salinization.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, the Hebei provincial government has
spent two billion yuan helping the people live better lives.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province established 33,400 economic
schemes in the poverty-stricken areas, which reported 1.88 billion
yuan in taxes and profits during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
With the help of local government, 92,000 farmers are now able
to enjoy clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an additional 2,900 km power grid, as well as 6,800
km highway was built in the area.
</P>

Iran's official English-language daily Tehran Times reported
two gun-shooting incidents -- one in northern province of Gilan
and the other in southwestern province of Sistan-Balluchestan.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily gave no specific date or names of the
victims in the violent incidents on the eve of the crucial
Parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the shooting incidents happened between
the backers of two different candidates. But the report did not
mention their identities.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the shooting incidents show the
intensified internal power struggle between the moderate camp
headed by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the conservative
camp headed by Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri for the
victory of elections for the 270-member Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The incidents have occurred at a time when the list of
qualified candidates has not been officially presented by the
executive authorities, and the legal election activities are to
be launched on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, over two fifths of candidates
for the upcoming parliamentary elections, including President
Rafsanjani's feminist daughter, were rejected by the powerful
Guardians Council controlled by rightist hardliners.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that 2,260 out of 5,359 were rejected by
the Guardians Council which is composed of high-ranking clergies.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council and its supervisory boards have come
under fire by many grassroots organizations. The critics allege
that Guardians Council is not free from its own sectarian
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times, in its editorial, said today that voters require
a healthy atmosphere to be able to evaluate and judge candidates'
competency and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
While people are preparing to exercise their right to vote, it
noted, they should also be provided with the proper circumstances
to fullfil their task in the best possible manner.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the shooting incidents, it said, "illegal and
premature election campaigns have always been one of the main
causes of tragedies of this sort. "
</P>
<P>
"Some candidates, using their black money, have always tried to
buy people's votes," it noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that officials should ensure that the voting process is
fair and free from any pressure exerted by any circle.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Protects Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Farmland protection zones
covering one million hectares have been designated by the
provincial government in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The province has an average 0.037 hectares of land per capita,
the least arable areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new zones are part of a scheme to protect farmland.
</P>
<P>
A local government official said the coastal province has
opened up 3,270 hectares of wasteland, and returned 1,100 ha. of
former farmland back to cultivation.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the sharp decrease of the farmland in the past to
overuse of land for capital construction and neglect of grain
production.
</P>
<P>
To protect farmland, the provincial government has designated
farmland protection zones covering one million ha., accounting for
82 percent of the cultivated areas in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Heavy punishments have been threatened against people who
violate the new land-use regulations.

<HEADLINE> Iran Confiscates 135 Tons of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran confiscated 135 tons of
narcotics in the past 11 months of the current Iranian calendar
year to end on March 20, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Ansari, deputy commander of the law enforcement forces,
said that his forces made a major outlay at the southeastern
borders to prevent the inflow of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Hamshahri also reported today that a man who
had hidden 154 kilograms of hashish inside his truck's gas tank
was arrested on the road between the port city of Bandar Abbas and
the southern city of Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
The daily also said that another man was arrested in the
Shiraz province in connection with carrying six kilograms of
opium hidden inside his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Fallah, secretary of the State Anti-Narcotics
Headquarters, said it was necessary for the law enforcement
officials to deal squarely with criminals who are in any way
involved in the distribution of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has spent about 700 billion rials
(about 233 million U.S. dollars) to prevent distribution of drugs
and to combat drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Iran captured more than 150 tons of narcotics, of
which 117 tons of opium and 13 tons of morphine.
</P>
<P>
Iran has executed over 4,000 drug traffickers since 1988 and
there are over 12,500 foreign smugglers in the Iranian jails.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who were caught
with more than 30 grams of heroine or five kgs of opium.
</P>
<P>
Drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems of
the country since it is one of the best transit for drug to Europe
and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border area between
Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest drug-producing
center in the world.
</P>
<P>
In its border with Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iran has made
1,400 kilometers of roads and 150 km of canals in order to prevent
drug smugglers from entering the country.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Expands Its Export-Oriented Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu, one of China's
largest economic provinces, is expected to boost its
export-oriented economy in a bid to hook up with the international
market.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that Jiangsu's foreign trade last year totalled
16.5 billion US dollars, four times the 1990 figure. Included were
exports valued at 11.5 billion US dollars sent to 160 countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
The daily-improved investment conditions in the coastal
province have attracted investors from more than 100 countries and
areas.
</P>
<P>
At present, the province has lined up contracts for
construction projects in 104 countries and regions, an official of
the provincial Foreign Trade and Economic Commission said.
</P>
<P>
To develop its market economy, the provincial government has
introduced market mechanisms; encouraged enterprises to assume
sole responsibility for profits or loses; and changed its role of
direct management in macro-control and servicing.
</P>
<P>
The province has 502 foreign trade enterprises at present, 412
more than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The number of provincial overseas enterprises have also growing
quickly, with 427 non-trade firms set up in more than 70 countries
and regions, topping the list for the whole of China.
</P>
<P>
Seventy overseas trade companies and representative offices
have been set up in 20 countries and regions, and special "Window
Companies" have appeared in the USA, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong
to generate business opportunities for the province.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds have been absorbed in great numbers. In the
five-year 1991-95 period, almost 26,000 joint ventures,
co-operative enterprises and wholly foreign-funded businesses were
established, attracting an investment of 13.4 billion US
dollars. The investment was a staggering 33-times the sum total
for the previous 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The foreign funds have mainly covered three major industries
(Agriculture, Industry and Service), with sales totalling 80
billion yuan (about 8 billion US dollars). Exportation covered one
third of the province, earning more than four billion US dollars
in 1995.

SHANGHAI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest city in
China, plans to lead the country in making senior middle school
education universal during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the goals set in the city's plan for development

Under the plan, drawn up by the municipal government, the
number of university and college students in Shanghai will rise to
two percent of its population while the number of residents
enjoying a college education will increase to eight percent
towards the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shanghai will speed up the construction of a number
of pilot schools, modern basic education zones, new higher
learning parks and national-level basic research centers and
engineering technology research institutes.
</P>
<P>
To implement the plan, the municipal government will allocate
more funds for education, and introduce a system under which
government appropriations will play a dominant role with funds for

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Dikes in Jiujiang Discovered Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- City officials in Jiujiang
have drawn up plans to repair large stretches of dikes along the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
A recent check has discovered many dangerous sections in the
dikes along the river banks, in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
There are many branch rivers facing the south dikes of the
Yangtze, which have affected hydrological conditions of the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
This has made the riverbed move gradually southwards because
the water is prone to dash against the south dike and cause sand
silt on the north side of the river.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, during dry seasons, serious collapses of dikes
and riverbanks have frequently occured.
</P>
<P>
The check has discovered 18 dangerous sections totalling 9,402
meters, with some said to be in a grave situation.
</P>
<P>
The Jiujiang city government is drawing up a plan to repair the
216-km-long dikes, which protect an area of 908 sq km and 780,000
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has helped thousands of poor people to escape
the poverty trap.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous Guangxi is viewed as backward due to the lack
of transport facilities and adverse natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
Almost 50 of the region's 88 counties have been labeled as
poor, with seven million rural residents living below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
With the help of central and local governments, Guangxi has now
set up 2,357 economic organizations and developed 5,000
projects. As a result, 666,500 residents have escaped poverty.
</P>
<P>
In Nandan County, the most impoverished mountainous area in the
region, for years people adopted a slash-and-burn system of
cultivation. Now it has established ore dressing plants, knitting
factories, brickkilns and 490 other economic organizations.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 139,000 residents are enjoying much improved
living standards, and their per capita net income reached 1,050
yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the gross national product in the county climbed to
1.1 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> 6 Percent Economic Growth Predicted For Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Reserve Bank
of Zimbabwe Leonard Tsumba said that current good rains and the
subsequent growth in agricultural production should enable
Zimbabwe's economy to achieve a six percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
He made the prediction yesterday in Bulawayo, the country's
second largest city.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that if no drought alleviation programs were put
in place soon, any growth in the economy could be reversed by
future droughts.
</P>
<P>
He said output of the country's main cash crops of maize,
tobacco, cotton, sugar, soybean and beef were expected to grow by
18 percent from a projected fall of 12 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
For last year, Tsumba said, preliminary estimates showed that
real economic growth fell by more than two percent largely as a
result of the poor performance of manufacturing, whose output was
expected to have dropped by more than 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jinggang Mountains Attracts more Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Jinggang Mountain range
in Jiangxi Province, known as the `cradle of the Chinese
revolution', has become a major tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show more than 10 million tourists,
including 200,000 overseas, have visited the mountain range in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become a 30 million yuan industry for Jinggangshan
City at the foot of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
Jinggang Mountains became known as the `cradle of revolution'
in the 1920s and 1930s when the Red Army, led by late Chairman Mao
and Zhu De, used the mountains as a base against the Kuomintang
army.
</P>
<P>
The mountain is now among the top 40 tourists attractions in
China. It is the habitat of nearly 4,000 kinds of plants and 1,000
different animals, including dozens of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the mountain range is covered by trees,
including 7,000 hectares of virgin forests.
</P>
<P>
Though historical heritage and natural beauty is regarded as a
great gift, city officials said their painstaking efforts in
environment protection in the past years has been crucial to the
development of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the strict control of industrial and household
pollution, the city's air quality is one of the best among Chinese
cities, and at least 90 percent of its waste water is being
processed before being discharged into the environment, said the
officials.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Set up 1st Palm Oil Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is planning to set
up its first palm oil refinery in collaboration with Indonesia in
the southern port city of Karachi, the local newspaper "The News"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
An agreement in this regard is expected to be signed between
the Trading Corporation of Pakistan and the Indonesian private
sector next month.
</P>
<P>
The proposed palm oil refinery will be installed in two phases
at a total estimated cost of 16 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, the refinery could refine crude palm oil
into refined and neutralized oil, and in the second phase, the oil
refinery could be upgraded, enabling it to refine oil into olein.
</P>
<P>
The initial capacity of the proposed refinery will be 200,000
tons per annum.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that with the establishment of this palm oil
refinery, Pakistan would be able to save a large amount of foreign
exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is the world's second biggest edible oil importer
after China, and it imports mostly palm oil from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In 1994-95, Pakistan spent about 1 billion US dollars for
edible oil import, which is about 10 percent of the total import
bill. The locally produced edible oil could only meet 25-30
percent of the total consumption at the moment.

<HEADLINE> Star Rating for Three Gorges Pleasureboats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Pleasure boats at the famous
Three Gorges area of China's Yangtze River are to be 'star rated'
to ensure that tourists are not taken for a ride.
</P>
<P>
Officials are to use the "star" standards to classify
pleasure-boats that mainly cater for overseas tourists as a way of
regulating river-based business activities.
</P>
<P>
There are over 60 first- and second-class pleasure-boats plying
for trade at the Three Gorges providing almost 7,400 sleeping
berths, far exceeding actual demands, according to the National
Tourism Administration (NTA).
</P>
<P>
But some businesses have touted pleasure-boats as "luxury" or
"super-luxury" classes as a ploy to entice tourists.
</P>
<P>
After taking these craft many tourists complain that they felt
cheated.
</P>
<P>
The NTA now plans to classify the boats, in accordance with a
regulation which was passed recently by the State Bureau of
Technological Supervision. Under the new rules a system of "star"
standards will be introduced to classify the pleasure-boats
sailing in the inland river.
</P>
<P>
In the first group, 41 travelling boats, which have all passed
appraisal by the Ministry of Communications and NTA, will receive
star classifications.
</P>
<P>
China will dam the Yangtze River by 1997 for the construction
of the Three Gorges Project, the world's largest water-control
scheme.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Defense spending in the Arab
countries are still high after the 1990 Gulf War peak.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund
(AMF) obtained today, defense spending of the 22-member countries
of the Arab League in 1994 accounted as much as 27.22 percent of
their total expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The report about the economic and social conditions in the
Arab region in 1995 did not give the figure of the same year, but
said annual budgets for 1996 and 1995 have kept "almost unchanged"
in the majority of the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated by experts that total expenditure of the Arab
countries was some 153.6 billion U.S. dollars, meaning some 41.8
billion dollars were allocated for defense and security in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Syria was the biggest defense spender in the Arab region in
comparison with its total expenditure. The share was 54.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Oman's defense spending accounted 43.34 percent of its total
expenditure; Yemen 41.5 percent; Qatar 36 percent; Saudi Arabia
31.08 percent; Jordan 30.49 percent; Kuwait 27.7 percent and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) 26.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lowest defense allocations in 1994 in the Arab world were
Sudan (14.52 percent) and Egypt (19.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
But in terms of the size of defense allocations, Saudi Arabia
remained number one, spending some 14 billion dollars in 1994, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
According to an independent study published recently in the
UAE, the cumulative Arab spending on armament programs had
exceeded one trillion dollars over the past 20 years.

SHENYANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A woman sufferer of
tuberculosis in a village in northeast China's Liaoning province
has recovered from the serious illness, after receiving free
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, a project to control TB started in the province, with
a 28 million yuan (about 3.38 million US dollars) loan from the
World Bank and the similar amount of investment from the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the project covered 40 million people
in 102 of the province's counties and districts.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 people infected with TB patients were detected
and 7,838 of them have been cured.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 300,000 healthy people have been given protection
from the infection as part of the program, and 32,000 people have
been able to avoid being stricken with the potentially serious
infection. Delighted officials say the program has reduced the
number of deaths caused by the disease by 16,000.
</P>
<P>
Since the patients do not need to be admitted to hospitals to
receive treatment, the project can save 200 million yuan (about 24
million US dollars) by providing successful treatment for
thousands of patients.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Hopeful of Meeting Hostages in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) was optimistic of meeting soon with the 13
hostages held for more than seven weeks in Irian Jaya, Indonesia,
the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
ICRC spokesman Wahyu Endah expressed the hope after another
meeting Monday with leaders of the Free Papua Movement (OPM),
which abducted 26 people, including seven foreigners, on January 8
in Irian Jaya. The OPM later released 13 hostages, including one
foreigner.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC acted as a mediator between the Indonesian Armed
Forces (ABRI) and the OPM for the release of the remaining 13
hostages, including six foreigners who were on a scientific
expedition at the time of the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
OPM demanded the recognition of an attempted separatist state
in Irian Jaya in exchange for the release of the hostages. The
Indonesian government has rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Kogoya, head of the kidnappers in negotiation with the
ICRC, said that the decision to free the hostages rested with an
unidentified leader based in neighboring Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The official Antara news agency said that the leader could very
well be Mathias Wenda Alias Mosea Weror, who claimed
responsibility for the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the ABRI General Affairs Lt. Gen. Soeyono said earlier
that the military wanted an unconditional release.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Antara as saying, "We have not made any
consideration on giving a pardon."
</P>
<P>
He said that the military would take stern action if OPM
members "acted brutally" and harmed the hostages.

WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A Washington D.C.
organization today condemned the imposition by the U.S.
administration of punitive sanctions against Cuba for the downing
of two planes piloted by Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
Brian Adams, Coordinator of the D.C.-based "Hands Off Cuba"
Coalition, told a press conference that "the responsibility for
Saturday's event rests completely with the Cuban exile groups that
organize provocations against the Cuba."
</P>
<P>
Adams said the two planes belonging to the right-wing Cuban
exile group "Brothers to the Rescue" was not on a humanitarian
mission but a deliberate attempt to provoke a crisis between the
U.S. and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He said he was in Havana on July 13, 1995, and witnessed a
plane flown by "Brothers to the Rescue" dropping leaflets on the
city.
</P>
<P>
"The Cubans cannot be expected to allow unidentified foreign
aircraft to enter Havana's airspace," Adams said, "Cuba was
totally justified in shooting down the planes."
</P>
<P>
The organization called for the lifting of the U.S. economic
embargo against Cuba and for the normalization of U.S.-Cuba
relations.

<HEADLINE> Frequent Political Actions Batter Bangladeshi Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's commercial banks
may face a debacle following the long crippling political crisis
as their businesses are virtually lost due to disruptions by
frequent political actions, banking sources said.
</P>
<P>
During general strikes or other political programs, the banks
were not at all operating. The export and import schedules were
either delayed or canceled, and the bank staff were sitting idle
with no clients coming to them, said Rahman Sarker, managing
director of Prime Bank Limited.
</P>
<P>
"The banks are incurring huge financial losses, which cannot be
estimated in terms of money," he said, pointing to the loss of
credibility following disruptions in international transactions.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of overdue loans was also uncertain as the
borrowers had, in the meantime, started to point to political
situation as reasons for their non-performance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Another banker said the whole process of the export and import
trade was seriously disrupted by the political unrest leading to
failures in shipments or disposal and cancellation of many of the
contracts.
</P>
<P>
This was affecting the banks as either a large amount of their
money was stuck up in the process or the business itself was lost,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector, which faced a major debacle in the early
1990s, may face another round of serious bad debt problem unless
the political crises was resolved immediately, many bankers
warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian government
will take more effective measures this year to fight alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
The government made the decision to continue the
anti-alcoholism drive following it found that excessive drinking
and alcohol-related crimes are still on the rise.
</P>
<P>
President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat announced 1995 a year against
alcoholism and the State Great Hural adopted a law against
excessive drinking of alcohol. However, little progress has been
made to check the widespread problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chief Directorate of Police, 15.4 percent of
last year's 20,496 criminal cases are alcohol-related and as many
as 7,975 people have attended to alcoholics-rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
Alcoholism and alcohol addiction is a common phenomenon in the
country. To tackle this problem, the Mongolian government is
expected to revise and amend the existing two laws in a bid to
force alcohol addicts to quit drinking while imposing restrictions
on imported liquors.

<HEADLINE> Kirghizia Government Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Kirghiz President Askar Akayev
today accepted the government's resignation, which clears the way
for him to make changes to the cabinet line-up, Interfax news
agency said in a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The resignation was the result of a new balance of power sealed in
a referendum earlier this month, a spokesman for Akayev was quoted
by the agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the plebiscite on February 10, Akayev won 94.5 percent of
the vote in favor of a constitutional amendment giving him
sweeping new powers, including the power to appoint all top
government officials. He is required to seek parliament's approval
only for his nominee for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said Akayev had suggested to the parliament that it
reappoint Prime Minister Apas Dzhumagulov at a session to be held
on February 27.
</P>
<P>
Akayev also has the right to dissolve parliament if it rejects
three of his candidates, while parliament has the right to impeach
the president.
</P>
<P>
Unlike his Central Asian counterparts, Akayev has not used the
plebiscite to extend his rule into the 21st century. His reforms
have helped Kirghizia pull in three times as much Western aid as
any other former Soviet republic.

<HEADLINE> Navigation Resumes in Lower Reaches of Danube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The lower reaches of the
Danube River re-opened to navigation today nearly one month after
the river course was blocked by ice.
</P>
<P>
The navigable waters include the three waterways in eastern
Romania through which the Danube flows into the Black Sea from the
eastern city of Tulcea.
</P>
<P>
The three waterways had been closed to traffic since early
February after ice flowing from the middle and upper reaches
blocked the river course in the lower stretch.
</P>
<P>
The Danube, the second longest river in Europe, rises in the
Black Forest in Germany and runs through nine countries before it
finally flows into the Black Sea.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pressing Ahead With Plan to Arm, Train Bosnian Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States is going
ahead with an aggressive plan to arm and train Bosnian Muslim-led
federation's military forces even though all Islamic fighters have
not been removed from the country, U.S. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks between senior U.S.
military officials and a visiting six-member Bosnian delegation
led by General Rasim Delic, commander of the Bosnian Army.
</P>
<P>
U.S. General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, and U.S. President's National Security Adviser Anthony
Lake met with the Bosnian military delegation here today for talks
focused on promoting the Bosnian peace process, said the U.S.
officials who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said last week that the U.S. plan to
arm and train the Bosnian government troops had been delayed
because the Bosnian government failed to ensure that all foreign
Islamic fighters were out of the country by January 19 as required
by the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesman Glyn Davis told
reporters today that the Bosnian government must ensure the
complete removal of the foreign Islamic fighters before any arming
or training of its armies begins.
</P>
<P>
There are reportedly three U.S. companies competing for the
contract to run the arming and training program aimed at
strengthening capability of the Bosnian government troops against
the Bosnian Serb military forces.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Price Index Rises in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's price index in
February increased by 2.5 percent over January, the
English-language "Vietnam News" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the General Department of Statistics (GDS)
as saying that this figure was a 3.5 percent increase over
December last year.
</P>
<P>
The price hike was mainly attributed to a rise this month in
the prices of rice and other foodstuffs, up 4.5 percent before and
during the traditional Spring Festival in the mid-February. People
are likely to buy more goods for the family reunion before or
during the festival.
</P>
<P>
In Hanoi, the February rice price rose by 5.7 percent, the
price of other foodstuffs up 4.3 percent while in Ho Chi Minh City
the foodstuff price up 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the country as a whole, the price increases for
rice and foodstuffs ranged from 3.2 percent to 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price of food and services during the Spring Festival was 1
percent lower than the same period last year, according to local
economic experts.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices in February increased by 2.3 percent over last
month, while the U.S. dollar price dropped by 0.01 percent in
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The GDS estimated that the prices will even out in the months
after the Spring Festival and price will be stable in May and
June.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Business Leader Calls for Participatory Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A top leader of Bangladesh's
business community Monday strongly denounced the political
leadership's handling of the ongoing political crisis and called
for an immediate fully participatory elections.
</P>
<P>
The situation had worsened to the extent where the functioning
of civil society has come to a painful halt and the citizens at
large have reached a point of intolerable frustration, said Salman
F. Rahman, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FBCCI).
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the FBCCI president said that the
political leadership was causing tremendous damage to civil
society by continuing its polarization, and the situation simply
could not be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
"It is now obvious that the solution lies in using whatever
means possible to ensure the immediate holding of free, fair and
fully participatory elections," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the extension of the opposition three-day
"non-cooperation movement" by another two days, Salman said that
the shutdown of normal economic activities was destroying the
country and causing great harm and pain to the people.
</P>
<P>
"The man in the street cannot tolerate the prevailing situation
much longer." he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Extend NAFTA Benefits to Caribbean Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States could
extend, temporarily, the benefits of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) to the countries in the Caribbean basin, said
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher today.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who is visiting San Salvador, capital of El
Salvador, was quoted as saying that the initiative, expected to
benefit the textile, footwear and petroleum sectors, will be
introduced by President Bill Clinton this coming March to the
U.S. congress.
</P>
<P>
Around 50 percent of the exports from Central America and the
Caribbean to the United State are from the textile and clothing
industry, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived in San Salvador Sunday on a three-day
official visit.
</P>
<P>
The initiative for the Caribbean Basin and the Generalized
System of Preferences, both programs granted unilaterally by the
United States, enable Central America to introduce 90 percent of
its output to that market free of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The programs are an effort to help the smallest economies and
those in transit to free trade while offering, at the same time,
"new opportunities to a region that is already a fast-growing
market for U.S. exports," Christopher said.

<P>
KATHMANDU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Another group of 343
Bhutanese refugees were arrested Monday at Nepal-India border by
Indian police when they crossed into the Indian territory on
their way to Bhutan, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese peace marchers were arrested on the Indian side
of a border bridge at Nepal's eastern border where they had been
staging a silent sit-in protest since earlier last week.
</P>
<P>
It was the third batch of Bhutanese marchers arrested by the
Indian authorities. Earlier two groups of more than 400 Bhutanese
had been taken into police custody when they attempted to march to
Bhutan via India.
</P>
<P>
According to a refugees' organization, these Bhutanese marchers
were on a peace movement to appeal to the Bhutanese authorities to
 allow for the return of more than 100,000 Bhutanese mostly living
 in eight refugee camps in eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
India has refused the request by Nepal to help solve the
eight-year-old Bhutanese refugees problem and maintained that the
problem could only be settled through Nepal-Bhutan bilateral
talks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an Indian court is holding hearings on the
first two groups of Bhutanese refugees, arrested in mid-January
and two weeks ago respectively.

<HEADLINE> France Attaches Importance to Asia-Europe Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The first ever Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) to be held in Thailand on March 1-2 is very
important for developing the partnership between the two regions,
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said today.
</P>
<P>
While Europe's links with America appear to be strong enough,
relations between Europe and Asia are rather weak, Colonna told a
news briefing here prior to President Jacques Chirac's departure
for the meeting and a state visit to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
France hopes to build along with Asian nations a better
international economic order and believes that the strengthening
of the World Trade Organization would be in the interests of both
continents, she said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will promote France and Europe during his Asian tour,
enhance bilateral understanding and boost the French and European
presence in Asia, an area with enviably rapid growth, Colonna said.
</P>
<P>
She noted the fact that France's share of the Asian market is
only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Colonna said that Europe-Asia relations should not be limited
to the economic field. Instead, the two regions should join hands
gradually in dealing with major international issues, she said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Bangkok, Chirac is expected to canvass Asian
leaders for their opinions about issues to be raised at the Group
of Seven summit meeting to be held this June in France, she added.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the 15 European Union member states, seven ASEAN
member states, China, Japan and South Korea will take part in the
Bangkok meeting.

<P>
DHAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's mainstream
opposition parties have extended their 3-day "non-cooperation
movement" up to 2:00 p.m. Wednesday, which started last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken Monday afternoon by the liaison
committee of the three major opposition parties -- the Awami
(People's) League, the Jatiya (National) Party and the
Jamaat-e-Islami -- in protest against what they called repression
on opposition political workers, arrest of their top leaders and
killing during the program.
</P>
<P>
There was no alternative but to force the government to resign
in order to wrest back the democratic rights of the people, a
statement by the Awami League said.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties launched the movement in a
bid to press for the demand for the cancellation of the February
15 national elections participated by the ruling party and some
small parties, the resignation of the present government to pave
the way for a neutral caretaker government to hold fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the opposition parties would announce a fresh
program after February 29.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Market to Aid Goods Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The largest and most advanced
wholesale market in China has been recently established in
Shijiazhuang, capital of northern Hebei Province, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Market experts point out that the establishment of the
Nansantiao wholesale market will provide a convenient way for
commodities from Guangdong, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces and
Shanghai to enter northern parts of China and for East Shandong
Province's product to enter the western China market.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment reaching 500 million yuan, the market
covers 140,000 square metres. Before its renovation it was one of
China's 10 largest wholesale markets with more than four billion
yuan in annual transactions.
</P>
<P>
After renovation, transaction centres for food, cosmetics and
for southern goods to enter northern regions were added in the
wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a sale agent and delivery centre, and some
centres for information exchanges of pharmaceutical products and
for wholesale business at home and abroad have also been set up in
the wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
The market is the country's first one to adopt computer network
management on commodity display and storage, information inquiry
and setback as well as follow-up services.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is also the first in China to use the world's
largest commercial public data network. And more than 6,000
Chinese and foreign manufacturing and sales firms have asked to
enter into the market through the network.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Offer Compromise Proposal on Whitewater Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Democrats will reportedly
offer to extend the Senate Whitewater hearings for about a month
as an alternative to Republicans' plan for open-ended hearings.
</P>
<P>
Democrats were discussing possibilities of four to six weeks of
additional hearings, the Associated Press quoted congressional
sources as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Whitewater probe is due to expire Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats were expected to lay out their compromise at a
news conference scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Unless leaders of the two parties agree on an extension, debate
on the Republican plan to extend it indefinitely could get under
way as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A compromise with a short-term deadline allows Democrats to
further their argument that Republicans are simply after political
gain by prolonging hearings deep into the political campaign.
</P>
<P>
Senate Whitewater Committee Republicans, including chairman
Alfonse D'Amato, favor appropriating an additional 600,000 dollars
to continue the investigation on an open-ended basis.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republicans say continuing the hearings indefinitely is
justified by the recent emergence of records and notes of White
House aides -- material that was requested in some cases two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats say the newly produced material supports the
assertions of President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton and White
House aides that they have done nothing wrong in the Whitewater
affair.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Insists Downed Planes Violated Cuban Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cuba insisted today that the
two small planes it shot down last Saturday had trespassed into
Cuban air space and said it does not fear sanctions from the
U.S. or the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We have unequivocal proof ranging from maps showing
minute-by-minute radar detection, taped conversations and even
objects owned by the trespassers found in Cuban waters north of
the capital where they were shot down", a Foreign Ministry
communique said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The incursion could also be proved by the testimony of one of
the pilots who knew what happened, the communique added.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban exile group which owns the planes, "Hermanos al
Rescate" ("Brothers to the Rescue"), had said in Miami that all
four pilots in the two downed planes were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry also accused U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher of lying when he said that the shooting down
was not justified because it took place in international waters.
</P>
<P>
"He knows that we have that pilot," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the downing of the planes "was a legitimate
act of defense of our air space."
</P>
<P>
It noted that "Hermanos al Rescate" had recently dropped flyers
with anti-Cuban slogans above Havana in spite of the Cuban
government's warning that it would not tolerate maritime or air
incursions.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said that this kind of "violation" had
occurred hundreds of times before the shooting down of the planes.
</P>
<P>
It accused "Hermanos al Rescate" of being "a mafia of
terrorists that has designed repugnant and bloody plans against
our people."
</P>
<P>
Cuba "is and always will be responsible for its actions" and
has demonstrated convincingly that it knows how to defend its
sovereignty, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized that Cuba does not fear the threat of sanctions
from the United States, even if the threats should come from the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Tensions flared between Washington and Havana after a Cuban
airforce MiG shot down on Saturday the two light planes from
Florida, the United States. A third plane was able to return to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday ordered punitive measures
against Cuba, including suspending charter flights between Miami
and Havana and restricting the movement of Cuban diplomats in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would also work with Congress on a bill he
previously opposed to tighten the 34-year-old U.S. economic
embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina cut short a visit to
Denmark and rushed to New York City to explain Saturday's incident
before the U.N. Security Council which is considering a
U.S.-sponsored statement condemning the incident.
</P>
<P>
During a stopover in Madrid, he said that the shooting down of
the light aircraft "was not a show of force" nor "due to any
technical error" but indicated that Cuba's tolerance is limited
and that Cuban security could not be compromised or violated.
</P>
<P>
Robaina noted that U.S. authorities had been alerted more than
20 months ago that Cuban territory would be violated by
Miami-based exiles, who had been warned not to carry on with their
activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fact that the Americans had sought permission
to enter Cuban waters to search for survivors showed that the
United States itself was not sure whether the incident took place
in international waters.
</P>
<P>
He said his country does not fear sanctions from the United
States or the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot treat us like poor little children. We are not a
power like the United States but any small country can become a
real power if it is in possession of truth," the minister said.

MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A British-owned luxury ship
with 450 passengers on board was hit by fire on its way from Hong
Kong to Malaysia Monday night around 11 p.m. in the South China
Sea, according to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) this morning.
</P>

<HEADLINE> hke-- U.N. Council Meets on U.S.-drafted Statement Condemning Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council met here today to discuss a U.S.-drafted statement that
condemned Cuba for downing two American planes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The draft presidential statement held that "there is no
justification" for the shooting down of the two planes operated by
a Cuban exile group, Brothers to the Rescue, and condemned Cuba
for "a threat to international order."
</P>
<P>
It demanded an investigation of the incident by the
International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency based in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded the Cuban government compensate the families
of the four people killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been arguing that the two planes were
shot down in international airspace and that they were not given
warning before being gunned down.
</P>
<P>
But "New York Times" reported today that U.S. intelligence
officials have admitted that the two planes might have violated
the Cuban airspace and the Cuban control tower had given warning
before the two planes were shot down.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the officials as saying that a third plane
had returned to Florida and the pilot had confessed the violation
of the Cuban airspace.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has asked the Security Council to refrain from taking any
action until its Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrives in New
York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Robaina said he would show the Security Council the evidence
that the aircraft were in Cuban airspace.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Cuban Mission here said whether the shooting
happened in international water or not was not the "core of the
matter," but the fact that hundreds of times before there have
been such violations had to result in this incident.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Brothers to the Rescue is far from
carrying out humanitarian actions and that it is a terrorist mob
that has made up repugnant and bloody plans against the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
In the council meeting, China and Russia asked both the United
States and Cuba to provide more information on the incident. And
they said that the council can only take action after hearing a
report by the Cuban foreign minister Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican President Urges Kidnappers to Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Jose
Mdaria Figueres today urged the kidnappers of two European women
to negotiate their release and name a place for talks.
</P>
<P>
Figueres made the call in a statement before he left for San
Salvador.
</P>
<P>
German citizen Nicola Fleuchaus, 24, and Swiss citizen Susana
Siegfried, 50, were kidnapped on January 1 in a mountain chalet in
Northern Costa Rica close to the Nicaraguan border.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of 1 million U.S. dollars and
1 million colons (about 5,000 dollars) and designated a mediator,
priest Eduardo Bolanos of the Pital parish, to send the money.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
In their latest message sent to a local television station
Thursday, the kidnappers set a 5-day deadline starting Tuesday for
the government to hold talks with them.
</P>
<P>
They even threatened to starve the victims to death if their
demand was not met.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers also asked the government to change the current
economic policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Jose
Maria Figueres flew today to San Salvador to meet with U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher who is making his first tour
of Latin America in more than three years in office.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who left Washington Sunday, will discuss with
representatives of Central American countries the measures agreed
upon at a summit held in Miami in December 1994 to give impetus to
a free trade zone in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state would also be interested in
strengthening U.S. cooperation with Central American countries,
said Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo last week.
</P>
<P>
Central American countries are seeking a commitment from the
United States to grant them preferential trade treatment.
</P>
<P>
They are pressing the United States to grant them the same
treatment that Mexico enjoys under the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
However, experts said, it will be difficult for Christopher to
commit himself to any step toward that aspect.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Costa Rica are involved in a new trade
dispute in face of a U.S. threat to impose restrictions on the
import of Costa Rica-made undergarments.
</P>
<P>
Emigration to the United States is another topic on the agenda
which is of particular concern to El Salvadoran President Armando
Calderon.
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran immigrants who live in the United States send home
nearly 800 million U.S. dollars a year, which is the most
important source of hard currency for the country.
</P>
<P>
After El Salvador, Christopher will go to Chile, Argentina,
Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gun Victims Cost Major Hospital Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Emergency room orthopedic
surgeons in big city hospitals in the United States spend more
time tending victims of gunshots than victims of other accidents,
New Orleans researchers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Because the vast majority of the victims have no insurance or
funds, their treatment becomes the largest drain on the hospital's
orthopedic resources.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Treg Brown, resident in orthopedic surgery at Charity
Hospital in New Orleans, found in a study that gunshot victims
comprised 24 percent of all admissions to the hospital's emergency
room during 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Only 4 percent had insurance to pay the hospital costs for
their treatment," a United Press International report quoted Brown
as saying. "This results in taxpayers funding the remaining costs
which are staggering."
</P>
<P>
Brown told the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons that
research indicates that the average gunshot wound hospitalization
costs about 19,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brown said 85 percent of the people who showed up in the
emergency room with gunshot wounds were victims of assault, while
the rest were classified as accidental gunshot injuries.

<HEADLINE> Rubber Sector Fuelled by Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China's will invite more help
from overseas to boost its rubber industry over the next five
years, in a bid to meet the rising demand, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the rubber industry's total output jumped 8 percent
from that of 1994, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It contributes the rapid development of the sector to the
increased production of car, motorcycle and bicycle tyres,
conveyer belts, rubber pipes, rubber shoes and contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
Total consumption of rubber hit 1.3 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Spurred by China's policy to develop the car industry into a
pillar of the national economy, the paper predicts that car tyres
will see a surge in demand around the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Annual tyre production is set to reach 80 million by the year
2000, compared to 55 million in 1995, according to figures
released by the China United Rubber Corporation (CURC), formerly
the rubber industry department under the Ministry of Chemical
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Other products like conveyer belts and rubber parts for cars
are also likely to see a marked increase, the paper adds.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the output of rubber products requires a boost in
the development of efficient rubber chemicals and environmentally
sound raw and processed materials.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual demand for rubber protective materials
will climb to 40,500 tons by the end of this century, up 25
percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
The CURC will host an international conference this year on
rubber applications and production, and the development of the
Chinese market. It is projected for October 17-19 in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Government to Cooperate With President in Reform: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said Monday that his cabinet and President Boris
Yeltsin will work together to resolve all urgent economic issues
promptly.
</P>
<P>
"There are enough problems in the Russian economy for all. We
are doing the same job and the government will accord assistance,"
Chernomyrdin said in an interview with leading news agencies here.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the president's criticism of the government's
social policy, the prime minister described the censure as "fair,"
but said that "smaller social costs would be hardly possible
during the transformation of Russia's economy."
</P>
<P>
He said the Russians will see a remarkable increase in living
standard and new jobs when the country's economic reform is
completed.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin called the declining living standard "the price of
reform," saying "we will not be able to make an objective
judgement until reform starts yielding results."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "We can speak about the beginning of
stabilization," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Russia met all the conditions set by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) after it reduced the inflation rate from 18
percent in January to 3.2 percent in December and budget deficit
to about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF signed on Thursday an agreement granting Russia 10.2
billion U.S. dollars in loans.
</P>
<P>
Originally, Russia had required 13 billion dollars, but the IMF
agreed to provide only 9 billion dollars. The IMF did not increase
the amount to 10.2 billion dollars until Russia agreed to cancel
tariffs on its oil and natural gas exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin said the government has not used budget
funds to finance the restoration work in Chechnya, the rebel North
Caucasian republic, where Russian troops have fought armed Chechen
separatists for over 14 months.
</P>
<P>
The government will refrain from heavy spending until the war
is over in the republic, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to host a seminar
on trade and economic ties between China and Republic of Korea
(ROK).
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar which starts on April 18 will provide a
chance for officials and business people from both countries to
increase their economic exchanges and discuss prospects for future
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, the first of its kind, will feature speeches by
officials from Chinese government ministries on topics related to
the reduction of import tariffs, return of tax on export products,
abolition of tax exemption and the reduction of imported equipment
by foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The event is expected to be of great interest to major Korean
businesses as it will touch on subjects important to them. These
will include future cooperation in four industrial sectors between
China and the ROK -- automobile, aviation, HDTV and
program-controlled switchboards.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also focus on the opening of China's service
trade sector, which is of interest to medium-sized and small
Korean businesses.
</P>
<P>
Co-sponsoring the event are China's Xinhua News Agency
(Xinhua), Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(Moftec), Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (Kotra) and
Embassy of the Republic of Korea in China.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between China and ROK has witnessed rapid
development. The Chinese customs office reports that the bilateral
trade value topped 16.98 billion US dollars in 1995, up 44.8
percent from the same period of the previous year. It is expected
to hit 25 billion US dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of Korean-funded enterprises in China reached 5,883
by September last year. China is now ROK's biggest investment
target.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) is ready to expand its diplomatic activities with foreign
political parties and organizations, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Seeking common ground irrespective of social system or
ideological difference, the Communist Party is making great
efforts to build external relations, said Li Shuzheng, head of the
Party's International Liaison Department.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the CPC has been developing external
contacts with political parties and organizations of all types,
other than those which are regarded as fascist or racist. Links
have so far been established with about 300 parties in over 120
countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year the CPC received delegations from more than 150
parties in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America.
</P>
<P>
And senior CPC leaders travelled to countries in Eastern
Europe, Asia, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. Their
visits have proved useful for learning about the experiences of
other parties, for establishing more political ties, and for
promoting economic and cultural co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The officials, including Political Bureau members Ding Guangen
and Wei Jianxing, made a variety of visits including high-level
delegations, special surveys, economic co-operation meetings and
academic exchanges, Li said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that his government would give top
priority to the solution of social problems in its future work.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Itar-TASS news agency, the prime
minister said this decision was made in consideration of the
complicated situation at home.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Nation address on February 23, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin criticized the government's inability to
solve social problems.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin admitted that the president's criticism was
justified and fair.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities have attached more importance to social
problems since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has endorsed several decrees to raise retirement
pension and the minimum wage levels, to guarantee the payment of
salaries in time and to protect the interests of bank depositors.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that the noticeable change in policy is
mainly a result of the parliamentary election held at the end of
1995 and a preparatory step for the coming general elections in
June.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Experts here hold that the
country's remote sensing technology has reached an advanced level
in disaster-monitoring and crop yield estimation, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The research program of remote sensing technology, a key
scientific project in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), had
provided a great deal of geographical, biological, environmental,
social and economic data for government decision-makers over the
past five years, said Tian Guoliang, deputy director of the
Institute of Remote Sensing Applications under the Chinese Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Remote sensing technology had offered timely and accurate
information for agricultural sectors as it helped report sown
areas, crop growth and yields, said Tian.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the estimating accuracy of wheat yield was above 95
percent, the accuracy of maize yield reached more than 90 percent
and that of rice yield was more than 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, remote sensing technology also played
an important role in monitoring such disasters as floods, forest
fires, droughts, earthquakes, avalanches, plagues of insects and
desertification, Tian noted.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the country will further improve remote
sensing technology to better serve agricultural production and
prevent natural disasters, Tian said.

Boeing 737s.
</P>
<P>
The first leased plane, a B737-400, has been in operation

<HEADLINE> Russia Regrets Cuba's Downing of U.S. Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia today regrets the
downing of two U.S. planes on Saturday by the Cuban air force, but
said that the United States should avoid the repeated incursion
into Cuba's air space.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin told the
Interfax news agency here today that the United States should take
measures to avoid similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, two U.S. planes, which had allegedly
violated Cuban air space, were shot down 12.8 kilometers off the
Cuban coast. The U.S. coast guard has called off the search for
the four missing pilots.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Saturday night condemned the
shooting down of the two light aircraft by Cuban jet-fighters. "I
condemn this action in the strongest possible terms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Karasin said Russia hopes that the parties concerned would
make available any information about the accident, adding, "It is
necessary to give a hearing to Cuba's explanation."
</P>
<P>
He also cast doubt on the purpose of such flights by
U.S. planes in and around Cuban air space.
</P>
<P>
"It is the United States that should take concrete measures to
avoid incidents of deliberately violating Cuba's air space," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The two planes, belonging to the Miami-based Cuban exile group,
Brothers to the Rescue, may have been heading to Cuba to pick up
people attempting to flee the country, according to a U.S. defense
official.
</P>
<P>
Brothers to the Rescue has been doing this for years and the
Cuban government has warned that it would take measures against
such activity.

<HEADLINE> Major Canal Proposed in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are backing
a major canal project in northern China to facilitate the shipping
of coal to the coast, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 867-kilometer Shuotian Canal project should be included in
the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996--2000), experts from Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the ministries of water resources
and communications advocate.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive report on the feasibility of the huge project
was completed last July by the CAS's Geography Research Institute
after a four-year study.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded construction of the canal is not only
feasible but has great social, economic and ecological
significance.
</P>
<P>
The Shuotian Canal, running from Ningxia to Tianjin, is
expected to resolve the difficulty of transporting coal from the
provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces and Ningxia and Inner
Mongolia autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The canal would ease the water shortages in Beijing, Tianjin,
and the northern regions of Hebei and Shanxi provinces by
channeling and storing floodwater from the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Communications between inland and coastal regions would also be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River would be the main water source, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and technicians are currently working to resolve a
series of problems in building the canal.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the Shuotian Canal is expected to be 34.47
billion yuan (4.15 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> State Maps System to Avoid Risky Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- In a major move to reform its
state investment system, the Chinese government is speeding up the
establishment of a mechanism to make investors more responsible
for losses in their projects, according to sources from the State
Planning Commission (SPC).
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the establishment of a "capital fund" will
be required before a construction project is launched, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
For any project which needs funding from the capital market,
investors must first contribute a certain percentage of the
investment to the capital fund. Otherwise, they won't be allowed
to raise funds in the capital market.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism also requires that a representative be selected
to take charge of the project's planning, fundraising,
construction and repayment of the debt.
</P>
<P>
After China embarked on its opening and reform policy,
construction projects became dependent on bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The new measure will help investors become more aware of risks
in their construction projects.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Liaoning Reaping Benefits of New Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in northeast China's
Liaoning Province are reaping a new kind of harvest after sowing
the seeds of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xingge was one of the first to plant the new idea in
Gaofeng Township, a remote mountainous region in Linghai County in
the Jinzhou city area.
</P>
<P>
He built a study at his village home where he could spend time
quietly reading after finishing his work on the land.
</P>
<P>
The home study enabled Liu to master the skill of planting
fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
Friends and neighbours in the township were greatly influenced
by Liu's book-filled study.
</P>
<P>
And in the past year alone a staggering 8,000 people in the
township turned over a new leaf by learning new skills after
studying in their own homes.
</P>
<P>
Many children of farmers have also reaped benefits of this
thirst for knowledge. Last year, dozens of them won places at
colleges and major high schools.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic developments in the province have brought about
great changes to the lives of local farmers. In the past two years
farmers in Gaofeng have spent around 1.8 million yuan (217,000 US
dollars) on building home studies.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 farmers have used their newly found knowledge to
specialize in planting profitable economic crops in Beining County
in Jinzhou city.
</P>
<P>
They have also have developed the practice of writing diaries
in the process of their work, from which they have gained
experience in reducing costs and raising profits.

<HEADLINE> Botha Must Fight Moorer For Heavyweight Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Boxing
Federation partially reversed its Saturday decision to rule Monday
that South African Frans Botha must choose Michael Moorer over
Germany's Axel Schulz for the heavyweight crown fight.
</P>
<P>
The IBF ruled Saturday that Botha could keep his heavyweight
title despite taking anabolic steroids prior to his title fight
with Schulz last December,
</P>
<P>
The IBF, saying Botha did not know the medicine a doctor
prescribed for him was a steroid, only fined Botha 50,000 dollars
and ordered him to give Schulz a rematch within 180 days. The
winner would fight titlecontender Moorer within next 120 days
after that.
</P>
<P>
However on Monday, IBF President Robert Lee said in a letter to
the three fighters that the Executive and Championship Committees
"did not fully consider the pre-existing settlement agreement that
bound the winner of Botha/Schulz to fight Michael Moorer by June
9, 1996."
</P>
<P>
He said several members of the two committees met again and
decided to reverse part of decision.

BUDAPEST, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-speed train slammed
into a bus at a rail crossing in southwestern Hungary today,
killing 12 people and seriously injuring 14, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The bus was crossing railway lines in the town of Kutas, Somogy
County in southwestern Hungary, when the train smashed into it,
breaking it into two parts and dragging one part for more than 200
meters. Both the bus and the locomotive burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
The bus driver was killed and the train driver slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Police said human error caused the accident as the crossing's
manually-operated barrier was lowered too late.
</P>
<P>
Accidents at level crossings are fairly common in Hungary.
Sixteen German tourists were killed in one such collision in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, a similar accident killed 11 children and the driver.
And in 1995 alone, four crashes involving trains and buses or cars

NEW YORK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- New York Knicks forward
J.R. Reid was suspended by the National Basketball Association on
Monday for two games and was fined 10,000 U.S. dollars for
elbowing A.C. Green of Phoenix Suns during a game on Sunday.

<P>
Reid struck Green in the mouth with his elbow early in the
fourth quarter of the Suns' 113-105 victory.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Consider Consequences of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Sanctions should not be
imposed as a primary means of settling disputes, since the
sanctions had increased the number of adversely affected third
states and complicated problems faced by developing countries, a
Chinese representative said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Special Committee on the Charter of the United
Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization,
Zhang Kening of China said a procedure should be set up where the
third state could consult the Security Council as a solution to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council ought to take into account the possible
effect of sanctions on third states whenever it considered the
application of sanctions on target states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, agencies for early warning and dispute settlement
would reduce the need for the imposition of sanctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several countries referred to the General
Assembly resolution 50/51, stressing that, in formulating
sanctions regimes, due consideration should be given to the
potential effects of sanctions in third states.
</P>
<P>
Vasyl Korzachenko, representative of Ukraine, said that the
special problems should be met with appropriate steps. The General
Assembly resolution 50/51 provided a solid basis for protecting
the special economic interests of third states suffering from the
implementation of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the
Security Council in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.
</P>
<P>
Since the suspension of sanctions did not mean an end to the
problems faced by third states, other proposals to mobilize help
for such states should be considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aurel Preda, representative of Romania, said that the issue of
effects of sanctions on third states had become increasingly
important as a large number of states had continued to be affected.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of Greece, Iran, United States, Jordan and
Czech Republic also made statements at today's meeting.

The 300 square kilometer lake in the capital city of southwest
China's Yunnan Province, has been polluted for many years due to
long term neglect.
</P>
<P>
The building of a new stretch of waterway, known as the West
Park Channel, is already being seen as a major achievement in the
drive to end pollution. The channel serves to shorten the
recycling period and improve the quality of water in the lake. It
has now started a trial phase and will become fully operational in
June this year.
</P>
<P>
Covering 300 sq km, Dianchi Lake is a famous tourist attraction
in the city and the main source of water for the city's industry,
agriculture and residents.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1994, the provincial government announced plans to
invest three billion yuan (361 million U.S.dollars) in an
eight-year program to treat the polluted Dianchi Lake.

<HEADLINE> Asprilla Charged with Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombian football star
Faustino Asprilla and former England defender Keith Curle were
charged with misconduct here on Monday by the Football Association
for their scuffles in the Newcastle - Manchester City Premiership
tie on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla has been charged with two counts of misconduct and
Curle with one.
</P>
<P>
Referee Martin Bodenham, who did not book either player during
the match, sent his report to the FA including evidence from
linesman Andrew Martin who saw the second incident, Asprilla
allegedly headbutting Curle, which occured immediately after the
final whistle.
</P>
<P>
The match video was also studied on Monday by senior FA
officials. Spokeswoman Clare Tomlinson said: "It is clear both
players have a case to answer."
</P>
<P>
Both players have 14 days to answer the charges and Asprilla
has already pleaded his innocence.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla, playing his second match since signing for 7.5
million pounds (around 11 million U.S. dollars) from Italian
League team Parma, first elbowed the City skipper's face in
retaliation after Curle had grabbed him as he sprinted forward.
</P>
<P>
Then the pair were involved in the tussle after the final
whistle which was witnessed by the linesman.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla denied there had been any intent to injure Curle in
the first clash, although he did not discuss the butting incident.
</P>
<P>
He explained: "I was trying to push him away and trying to
escape. He had his arms around me and I wanted to get free.
</P>
<P>
"All I was trying to do was avoid him. I was pushing and
pushing but I didn't know I had hit him in the face.
</P>
<P>
"It certainly wasn't my intention to elbow him -- and what I
did wasn't that strong."
</P>
<P>
Curle has refused to comment on the incidents. It is believed
he is being reported for misconduct for the tussle after the
final whistle.

<HEADLINE> Record Entries for All England Badminton Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The All England Badminton
Championships will enjoy a record entries due to the Olympic
cut-off date of May 1.
</P>
<P>
The world's oldest tournament is this year the penultimate
event in the Atlanta qualifying period and hence the All-England
has enjoyed an increase from 327 to 358 players entered and from
27 to 36 countries represented.
</P>
<P>
It is also likely to provide a rehearsal of the probable
Atlanta showdown between the Olympic champion Susi Susanti and the
World Champion Ye Zhaoying.
</P>
<P>
Susanti, the greatest women's singles player of modern times,
is hoping to retain her Olympic title in August before retiring
and marrying the 1992 men's singles gold medallist Allan Budi
Kusuma.
</P>
<P>
But Susanti's ambitions have come under increasing threat in
the past nine months, with Ye Zhaoying taking away her World,
World Grand Prix and World Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian and the Chinese player are likely to be top
seeds at the All-England, although the defending champion will be
Swede Lim Xiaoqing.
</P>
<P>
Lim's chances at the National Indoor Arena will depend very
much on her recovery from the knee operation which kept her out of
last week's Uber Cup world team championship qualifying event in
Prague.
</P>
<P>
The other left-handed European Champion, Poul-Erik Hoyer, will
also be trying to defend his All-England title against the odds,
but he will have a tough task against the challenge of Indonesia
Heryanto Arbi.

<HEADLINE> Maoming Strives to Refine over 10 Million Tons of Oil Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The major part of a
catalytic and cracking unit for the processing of 1.2 million tons
of heavy oil annually has been completed at the Maoming
Petrochemicals Corporation (MPC).
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled to go into operation this June.
</P>
<P>
China invested more than 400 million yuan (about 48 million US
dollars) in the equipment for increasing the refining capacity of
the MPC, a major heavy oil refining base in China.
</P>
<P>
Other projects for the expansion of the corporation are also
under construction.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to increase the MPC's annual refining
capacity from the present 8.5 million tons to 13.5 million in 1997
by renovating equipment, then further increase the capacity to 17
million tons through technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
Located on the coast of the South China Sea, the MPC is
geographically close to Hong Kong, Macao and Southeast Asia. The
company boasts a 250,000 dwt wharf, which is convenient for the
import of crude oil and export of oil products.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 40 years, the MPC has processed a total of 122
million tons of crude oil and has produced more than 100 million
tons of oil products.
</P>
<P>
The company is the major supplier of oil products to the
interior part of southwest China and the coastal area of south
China.

one week out from the federal election and Prime Minister Pual
Keating has warned voters that they would have a Howard government

The Australian Financial Review

<P>

The Sydney Morning Herald

<HEADLINE> Labor Falls Further Behind Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor Party
fell further behind the opposition in a public opinion poll
published today, but experts cautioned that the figures could not
foreshadow the result of the federal election.
</P>
<P>
The News Poll, one of the most prestigious polls in the
country, showed that Labor slipped to a 10.5 percentage points
disadvantage over the opposition coalition of the Liberal and
National parties in the final week of the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
This is a gap twice as big as it was between the two groups in
the final week of the 1993 federal election.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,716 persons surveyed last weekend, 39 percent said
that they would vote for Labor, down from 43 percent one week ago,
while another 49.5 percent supported the coalition, up from 47
percent one week ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Sol Lebovic, managing director of the News Poll,
cautioned that people could not call a coalition victory on the
basis of the results of the poll.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, a 10-point lead one week out (from the
election) would almost certainly have meant victory, but not
today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 11 percent of the voters had yet to make up
their mind on whom they would vote for on March 2. The uncommitted
voters will have a key impact on the final result of the election.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paul Keating urged voters Monday to think about
the consequences of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
"Some people think, 'Oh, well, we can take the Liberals on and
see what they are like. If we don't like them we can turf them
out,' "he said.
</P>
<P>
"I just say this to Australians: you would be stuck with them
for six years. But worse than that, the fire will go out," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Labor stated in the campaign that a coalition government would
make Australia to go backward.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the poll showed that Keating led the
opposition leader John Howard as the better candidate for the post
of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a complete reversion of people's view on the outcome of the
election, 44 percent of voters thought Labor would win and 32
percent endorsed the coalition. This is in contrast with 33
percent for Labor and 44 percent for the coalition respectively
one week ago.
</P>
<P>
In the 1993 election, Labor made a last-minute comeback and
beat a strong lead of the coalition to win the final battle. It is
yet to be seen whether the miracle will happen again this time.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Invites Yeltsin to Visit Republika Srpska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President
Radovan Karadzic wrote to Russian President Boris Yeltsin today to
thank him for his decision to suspend sanctions against the
Bosnian Serbs, and invited him to visit the Serb state Republika
Srpska.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is both just and humane, and reflects the
greatness of Russia and its care for the Republika Srpska, which
the Serbs will never forget," Tanjug news agency quoted Karadzic's
letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin decided on Friday to suspend the sanctions against the
Republika Srpska on the grounds that the Bosnian Serbs have met
all the requirements for the suspension as envisaged under the
Bosnia peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The prerequisite for an automatic suspension of the sanctions
was that the Republika Srpska withdraw troops from the zones of
separation, and its compliance with this condition was confirmed
by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana in his two reports --
January 23 and February 9.
</P>
<P>
This compliance was also confirmed a few days ago by Admiral
Leighton Smith, the commander of the NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. Security Council has not by Monday night to
approved the NATO Secretary General's report.
</P>
<P>
The Rome summit on Bosnia, attended by the presidents of
Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia on Feb 17-18, decided that the
sanctions be suspended, in view of the Republika Srpska's
compliance with the requirements for the suspension.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Stocks slid lower today as
interest rates rose on bonds and investors grew skeptical of what
surprises might emerge from a batch of new economic reports this
week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost about 65.39 points to
5,565.10. The well-known barometer of blue chips had set new
records Thursday and Friday, resuming a powerful rally that began
in late January amid optimism for lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 2 to 1, with
797 up, 1,612 down and 696 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 395.18 million shares, compared with
439.14 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 3.99 to 346.95. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.62 to 650.46.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.44 to 1,115.35.
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell
3.92 to 565.35.
</P>
<P>
Bonds continued their downward trend of the past two weeks,
with the 30-year Treasury note down almost a half point and its
interest rate rising to 6.447 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said higher interest rates can make it more expensive
for companies and consumers to borrow.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to issue a number of new economic
readings this week.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, investors have often reacted more favorably to
weak economic data than positive indicators, hoping the bad news
will justify further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
But on the Nasdaq, several major technology stocks advanced.
Sun Microsystems gained after announcing plans to collaborate with
Motorola on high-speed Internet access systems for home use.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Punitive Sanctions on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today announced indefinite suspension of all charter air travel
from the United States to Cuba as part of a series steps to punish
Cuba for the shooting down the two U.S. planes piloted by Cuban
exiles.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the announcement after a 75-minute meeting with
his national security aides at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Cuban military aircraft shot down two U.S.
civilian planes "in international airspace" on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The president claimed that "these small airplanes were unarmed"
and "the planes posed no credible threat to Cuba's security."
</P>
<P>
Clinton admitted that the group that operated the planes had
entered Cuban airspace in the past on other flights. But he said
"this is no excuse for the attack and provides no legal basis
under international law for the attack."
</P>
<P>
He regarded the shooting of the planes as "a flagrant violation
of international law," saying that "the United States will not
tolerate it."
</P>
<P>
However, Cuba today accused the U.S. government of lying over
the downing of the two planes off Cuba, saying the two U.S. planes
were inside Cuban airspace at that time.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times today quoted U.S. intelligence officials as
saying that at least one of the American aircraft -- the lead
plane, which returned safely to Florida -- and perhaps all three
had violated Cuban airspace.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said the air traffic control tower in Havana
had warned the pilots that they were in danger.
</P>
<P>
Other unilateral actions against Cuba Clinton announced are:
</P>
<P>
-- asking Congress to pass legislation that will provide
immediate compensation to the families out of Cuba's block assets
here in the United States;
</P>
<P>
-- to reach agreement with the Congress on the pending
Helms-Burton Cuba legislation so that it will enhance the
effectiveness of the embargo in a way that advances that cause of
democracy in Cuba;
</P>
<P>
-- having ordered that Radio Marti expand its reach;
</P>
<P>
-- and to order that additional restrictions be put on travel
in the United States by Cuban officials who reside here and that
visits by Cuban officials to the United States be further limited.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that he is not ruling out any further steps
against Cuba in the future should they be required.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Asks UN to Defer Action on Air Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has asked the U.N.
Security Council to delay any action over shooting down two
Miami-based civil planes until Foreign Minister Roberto Gonzalez
arrives in New York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by Cuba's deputy representative Pedro
Nunez Mosquera during meeting with U.S. Ambassador Madeleine
Albright, who is also serving as council president of this month.
</P>
<P>
A Cuban diplomat told Xinhua that the foreign minister will
come to explain to the council on how the two planes were shot
down and will also make clear Cuba's position regarding the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is pushing hard for a presidential statement, which
would condemn Cuba for shooting down the planes.

<HEADLINE> Afrikaner Education Called For In S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Freedom
Front party leader, Constand Viljoen, today called for Afrikaner
education to be written into the new Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Viljoen said in a press conference that he would make the
proposal to President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The Potgietersrus Primary School, predominated by the
Afrikaners, had recently been brought into the limelight
following its refusal to enroll black pupils despite the order by
the Pretoria Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
It was announced last Friday the matter would be dealt with at
a national forum to be established by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
However, Viljoen said Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu could
not deal with the issue as he had to adhere to the court's
decisions.
</P>
<P>
"This is a constitutional matter," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Viljoen said there appeared to be a misrepresentation of the
Interim Constitution's provisions for the rights of groups such
as Afrikaners to have institutions based on culture and language.
</P>
<P>
"We must make sure the correct provision is being made for
Afrikaner education in the new Constitution," said Viljoen,
adding Afrikaner schools should continue to exist, not for the
sake of separateness but to retain the identity of the Afrikaner.
</P>
<P>
Viljoen's views on Afrikaner education were reportedly
supported by the women's organizations.
</P>
<P>
The language problem remains to be one of the outstanding
issues in the constitutional assembly before the May 9 deadline,
set for the adoption of the final Constitution.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has eleven official languages, including English
and Afrikaans.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Meet to Discuss African Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The 63rd ordinary session
of the council of ministers of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) opened here this afternoon to deliberate on political and
economic issues facing Africa.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Ethiopian deputy prime minister
tamirat layne called on African countries to strengthen their
cooperation in the economic area.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to redouble "efforts for economic cooperation
both within our respective sub-regional economic groupings, as
well as within the context of the larger community."
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian minister for foreign affairs and international
cooperation jakayam kikwete, on behalf of african delegation,
thanked Ethiopia for hosting the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said, the session is being held at a time when African
continent is facing many and varied challenges and the meeting
will give another unique opportunity to consider and offer
different and viable solutions to Africa's challenges.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing chairman of the 62nd session of OAU council of
ministers, Ethiopian foreign minister seyoum mesfin, in his
report, underlined the "need for closer coordination between the
OAU and the united nations on matters affecting Africa directly."
</P>
<P>
In his introductory statement, OAU Secretary General Salim
Ahmed Salim said conflicts are still ravaging african societies.
</P>
<P>
"In Somalia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and in Burundi, we are
still faced with the challenge of helping these countries
retrieve themselves from the senseless cycle of violence which
has gripped them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the successful establishment of an early warning
system coupled with the completion of the center for conflict
management would enhance OAU's capacity to address conflict
situations in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, UN under secretary general, and executive
secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) K.Y. Amoako
described the economic situation in Africa as a mixed picture --
the proverbial glass being half empty and at the same time half
full.
</P>
<P>
"The foremost challenge we face is the persistence of poverty.
Today, more than half of all Africans live in absolute poverty
and Africa is the only region in the world where poverty is
projected to increase," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Amoako called on African states to "renew the liberation
struggle" against poverty.
</P>
<P>
The council of ministers elected Burkina Faso as chairman of
the 63re session, and Egypt, Gabon and Angola as vice chairmen.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, the three-day session went into
camera.
</P>
<P>
This evening, the OAU Secretary General gave a reception at
the Congo hall of the OAU general secretariat to celebrate the
successful opening of the 63rd session of the OAU council of
ministers.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Belarus United Against NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko said here today that his country and Russia hold the
same position opposing the eastward expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Addressing professors and students of the Moscow State
University in Moscow, Lukashenko said he discussed the issue with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin during their meeting earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
"Belarus is categorically against NATO coming closer to its
border," Lukashenko emphasized, adding that there is no more
Warsaw Pact, which "means that there should also be no NATO which
once counteracted it."
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko arrived in Moscow earlier this morning for his first
official visit to Russia. He signed with Yeltsin two documents
including an agreement to cancel mutual debt problem.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus leader also signed with Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin a package of six agreements mainly covering
trade-economic and scientific-technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also told a news conference here that the issue of Russian
payments to Belarus in exchange for weapons-grade plutonium in
warheads of nuclear rockets removed from Belarus was resolved
during his talks with Russian leaders today.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Postpones Exhibition of Food, Medicine in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to postpone
till April an exhibition of its food and medicine products
scheduled to be held in Baghdad, Iraq, on March 19-24.
</P>
<P>
Contacts are underway between Egypt and Iraq in this regard,
Emad Eddin Ali, Chairman of the Arab Company for Foreign Trade,
was quoted by the Middle East News Agency (MENA) as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was put off so that better preparations can be
made for it to ensure the participation of the largest possible
number of Egyptian companies, Eddin Ali said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a visit by a delegation of the Federation of
Egyptian Industries to Baghdad, scheduled for Wednesday, was also
postponed for two weeks, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
It has been proposed that the visit by the 15-member delegation
take place in the first half of March, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen were to discuss with Iraqi officials the sale
of food, pharmaceuticals and textiles to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
MENA did not say why the trip was postponed. But observers here
believe that the decision was out of political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the federation have reportedly argued that it
is not the proper time for the delegation to visit Baghdad as the
trip would have come just days after two Iraqi defectors were
murdered after their surprise return from Jordan to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel Hassan and Saddam Kamel Hassan, both sons-in-law of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, were killed last Friday by family
members allegedly angered that they had dishonored the family,
according to Iraq's official media.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa stressed here today that African Countries should
be in charge with their own Destiny.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the remarks at the opening ceremony of official
talks between him and Zambian President Frederick Chiluba in
Lusaka this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the African countries were in better positions to
provide answers to their problems because they understood them
better.
</P>
<P>
There was increasing need for African ideals to prevail in
issues that affected them, he added.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, he urged the two countries to expand
cooperation for benefit of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chiluba said the two countries should revive the
joint permanent commission to promote the bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
the joint commission has been at a standstill since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, aged 57, arrived here this morning from Harare of
Zimbabwe where he had a similar visit.
</P>

It is Mkapa's first visit to Zambia since he was elected new
Tanzanian president last year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Volkstaat Council Calls For Afrikaner Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Volkstaat
(white homeland) Council today submitted a proposal to the
Constitutional Assembly (CA) to found a province in South Africa
for Afrikaners.
</P>
<P>
The proposal said South Africa's final constitution should
provide for a 10th province for Afrikaners, whose power should
be those of a constituent state in a normal federation.
</P>
<P>
The council, formed under the interim constitution to report
to the CA on measures to effect self-determination, said these
powers should include all those necessary to preserve a people's
own identity, language and culture.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the proposal for a province of the Afrikaners, the
African National Congress (ANC) said in a statement that it was
"both shocked and disappointed" at the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great pity that the council has chosen to advocate an
apartheid-style separate province for the Afrikaners during a
period in which consistent progress is being made in promoting a
new national pride and identity," said the ANC statement.
</P>
<P>
However, CA Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa, also ANC secretary-
general, said the matters raised had to be negotiated in a spirit
of give-and-take.
</P>
<P>
Ramaphosa then ruled that the council should appear before the
CA negotiating committee again, possibly on March 15.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has nine provinces under the current interim
constitution.
