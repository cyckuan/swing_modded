<HEADLINE> J. Crew's New CEO Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- J. Crew chief executive Howard Socol resigned  
Monday, less than a year after the retail veteran was hired to 
revive the ailing catalog and retail company. 
</P>
<P>
	While J. Crew said his departure was not related to the  
company's financial performance, industry analysts say its 
mail-order operation is still troubled and question prospects for 
its future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Crew said Socol left the company by mutual agreement, a  
result of differing perspectives on the vision and approach for J. 
Crew's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Socol will be Dick Boyce, a member of J. Crew board of  
directors. He is president of CAF Inc., an affiliate of Texas 
Pacific Group, J. Crew's controlling shareholder since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Emily Woods, daughter of J. Crew founder Arthur Cinader, will  
remain chairwoman of the New York-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	Socol took over as CEO in February, and his arrival was met with  
great enthusiasm after his successful 28-year career at Burdine's 
department store in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	He was recruited by Texas Pacific to jump-start the J. Crew's  
slow retail expansion, lift profits and expand its brand 
recognition. It's best known for its somewhat preppy casual wear -- 
like roll-neck sweaters and khaki pants -- modeled by fresh-faced, 
young people. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Monday, the company said that it had a strong  
Christmas and it expects to meet cash flow expectations for the 
year. The company cited robust sales on the Internet and at its 
stores, as well as a turnaround in its catalog operation. 
</P>
<P>
	But there still are concerns about its business. Among its  
biggest problems is its huge debt, mostly a result of Texas Pacific 
borrowing heavily to buy J. Crew. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, analysts worry about future growth and increasing  
competition in the catalog business from popular retailers like 
Banana Republic and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Moody's Investors Service lowered its debt rating on  
J. Crew to negative from stable amid concerns that its sales growth 
may be lower than expected because of continued erosion in its 
mail-order operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have speculated that J. Crew may go public in the  
coming year, and is taking steps to clean up its balance sheet 
before such a move. In November, it sold its Popular Club catalog 
to Fingerhut for $43 million. Its Clifford &AMP; Willis catalog is also 
up for sale.

<HEADLINE> 49ers-Packers Game Scores for Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox analyst John Madden called Sunday's San  
Francisco comeback victory over Green Bay one of the greatest games 
of all time. It was for the network, which drew TV's biggest sports 
audience since the 1998 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it was the excitement of the games or the snow and ice  
storms that left much of the country in their homes, the 
Packers-49ers game was just one of four wild-card games over the 
weekend that drew increased viewership from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco game posted a 24.2 overnight rating, the  
highest NFL wild-card game since the Chicago Bears' 16-6 defeat of 
New Orleans in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	It surpassed last season's NFC wild-card game between Detroit  
and Tampa Bay on Fox by 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Christmas gifts were spread around all of the networks who  
have the NFL,'' Fox Sports executive producer Ed Goren said. ``ABC 
had a great day, then CBS and we wrapped it up with the game of the 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's easy victory over Dallas in the late Saturday game on  
ABC posted a 21.0 rating, up 35 percent from last year's 
Minnesota-New York Giants wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's close victory over Doug Flutie and the Buffalo Bills was  
up 5 percent from 1997, registering a 17.8 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville's victory over the Drew Bledsoe-less New England  
Patriots finished with a 18.7 rating, up 17 percent from the AFC 
wild-card game a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teams involved were real good and half of the nation was  
under snow and ice,'' NFL director of broadcasting Joe Ferreira 
said. ``Any time you have more people sitting at home, you are 
going to have increased viewers.''

<HEADLINE> Met Opera Performs 'Kata Kabanova' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The most tender of Leos Janacek's nine operas,  
``Kata Kabanova'' from 1921, is not often performed in America. The 
Metropolitan Opera did eight performances in 1991 and brought it 
back this season for six. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Mackerras conducted the opening performance, as he had  
in 1991. He also conducted the opera, the first of Janacek's 
performed in Britain, in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Janacek, a Czech, created the title character out of his love  
for a married woman; he wrote his own libretto, adapting it from 
the Russian play, Ostrovsky's ``The Storm.'' Kata is a sweet young 
woman dominated by her mother-in-law, Kabanicha, and stifled by the 
small town where they live. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Malfitano sang Kata's lyrical music. Her voice lacked  
the warmth for the innocent Kata at the beginning and she hit high 
notes more loudly than the others, often making them shrill. Eva 
Randova, slated to sing the mother-in-law, was ill and Judith 
Forst, scheduled for the part on Jan. 21, replaced her. Her voice 
and presence were not imperious enough for her character to be 
obeyed without question. 
</P>
<P>
	The star among the women at Saturday night's performance was  
mezzo-soprano Katarina Karneus from Sweden. In her Met debut, she 
performed Varvara, the foster daughter. Karneus, who won the 1995 
Cardiff Singer of the World competition, sang with warm tones as 
she sympathized with Kata. 
</P>
<P>
	Kata pleads with her husband to take her on his business trip;  
she fears something terrible will happen if she's left behind. So 
what happens? She and Boris, a Muscovite living with an uncle, have 
a 10-day affair. Boris was sung by Peter Straka, whose urgent voice 
always sounded as though something big was about to happen. Paul 
Charles Clarke sang Varvara's boyfriend, and Mark Baker sang Kata's 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last act, Kata can't stand her guilt and, in a public  
place, confesses all to her husband. Then, in a scene alone, she 
loses her mind and jumps into the Volga River. Malfitano was at the 
top of her form in the last act, singing and acting to tear at 
audience hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Miller, the set designer in 1991, returned for this  
rendition. The spare set evokes a sterile, nothing-happens 
atmosphere. Kata's house is at right. Far behind are a tower and 
another house. The rest is flat, featureless ground. In other 
scenes, with a sitting room and another view of the house, the 
effect is even more stark.

<HEADLINE>  NHL's Blues Given Record $1.5M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues were fined an NHL-record  
$1.5 million on Monday as commissioner Gary Bettman settled a 
4-year-old tampering case involving defenseman Scott Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues said they won't contest the fine, levied by Bettman  
for violation of the NHL constitution and by-laws. He also ordered 
the Blues to surrender one first-round pick to the New Jersey 
Devils between 1999 and 2003. The Devils had sought five 
first-round picks as compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils get $1.425 million of the fine amount, and the rest  
goes to the NHL, payable within 120 days of Dec. 28, the day the 
penalty was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Devils have been awarded the one-time right to  
trade first-round positions with St. Louis in any other Entry Draft 
over the time period. The Devils must inform the NHL by May 1 
preceding each Entry Draft when they plan to exercise the option, 
and the Blues have a one-time deferral right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I view the Blues' conduct with respect to Mr. Stevens to be  
abhorrent and deserving of the harshest sanctions,'' Bettman said 
in a release. ``Violations of the no-tampering provisions directly 
undermine the integrity of the league and the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues admitted wrongdoing under prior management, and  
cooperated with the league's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very tough, very bitter day,'' Blues president Mark  
Sauer said during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am appalled at the severity of the penalty,'' chairman Jerry  
Ritter said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Sauer added: ``The commissioner's ruling is final.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bettman fined the Blues $500,000 for tampering for having  
``engaged in conduct detrimental to the league and the game of 
hockey'' by negotiating terms of a free-agent offer to Stevens 
prior to the free-agent signing period that began July 1, 1994. The 
team was fined an additional $1 million for entering into a side 
deal with Stevens and his agent, the late Richard Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils matched the Blues' four-year, $17.5 million offer  
sheet signed by Stevens on July 4, 1994 -- then the highest ever 
made to a defenseman and $7 million more than the Devils' last 
offer. The fallout from the side deal was New Jersey also had to 
paid Stevens $500,000 the Blues had owed as deferred compensation 
arising from Stevens' signing bonus from his one season with the 
team in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the deal, the Blues were relieved of their  
compensation obligation if another team signed Stevens on the same 
terms as their offer sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman's ruling comes more than five months after a July 27,  
1998 hearing involving the Blues and Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Sauer, Blues general manager Larry Pleau took the medicine  
surprisingly well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess if you're in the stock world doing these types of  
things, you may be in jail'' for such actions, Pleau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ritter: ``I'm more appalled at the legacy left to the  
Blues and their fans by the management team led by (chairman Mike) 
Shanahan and (president Jack) Quinn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' general manager and president, said  
he felt any team guilty of tampering ``should be reprimanded to the 
highest order because it's not the way it should be done. I feel 
very strongly on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues and Devils were at odds throughout the early 1990s,  
with Stevens the focal point. St. Louis pried Stevens away from 
Washington by signing him to a free agent deal in 1990, then lost 
him to New Jersey as compensation for signing Devils free agent 
Brendan Shanahan. The Blues' determination to get him back 
apparently led to the tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation, dormant for a long time, heated up again in  
the last year after disclosures to the Devils from a former member 
of the front office. Sauer, the Blues' president since 1996, said 
the team found documents that indicated the former front office 
negotiated a contract with Stevens ``weeks'' before the signing 
period began. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate the honest and straightforward manner in which  
current Blues management has dealt with this proceeding,'' Bettman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine comes on the heels of the Blues' fourth cash call in as  
many years, this one for $17.7 million with much of the extra money 
paying deferred compensation to players no longer on the roster. 
The team is owned by a consortium of local businessmen who have 
pumped an additional $70 million into the Blues and the Kiel 
Center, which opened in 1994, during the four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer said the fine was taken into account in the latest cash  
call, and said the team's operation will not change.

<HEADLINE> EU Countries Mull Euro Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Allowing European countries to put  
their own designs on one face of euro coins and bills may ease the 
pain of giving up national currencies. But it may also make the new 
currency easier to forge. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch Central Bank president Nout Wellink told Dutch radio that  
a likeness of Queen Beatrix probably won't remain on euro coins and 
notes for long after they go into circulation in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, as a warm-blooded Dutchman, Beatrix  
can be on all coins throughout Europe,'' Wellink said. ``But as a 
sober monetarist, I appeal for there not to be too many new coins 
in 2002.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When residents of the 11 nations participating in the single  
currency start using euros daily in 2002, there will be a total of 
88 different coins and bills in circulation. Wellink said Sunday 
that will cause confusion and could play into the hands of 
counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
	Each nation was allowed to design one side of the coins and  
bills while the other will carry a common euro design. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro debuted on stock exchanges across the world Monday, but  
will not come into everyday use until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Dutch euro coin pressed at the Netherlands Mint was  
presented to Queen Beatrix last month. More than 3 billion euro 
coins, in eight denominations ranging from one cent to two euros, 
will be minted to replace Dutch guilders.

<HEADLINE>  Police: 9 Died in Indonesian Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll in anti-military riots  
this weekend in a troubled Indonesian province rose to at least 
nine, police said today. One report said 13 people died, including 
two army officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence erupted Sunday in Aceh province after soldiers raided  
several buildings believed to harbor rebels who have been fighting 
for an independent Islamic state. Furious residents attacked the 
security forces, who responded with gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	In the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, another region  
where separatist rebels operate, fighting between groups that 
oppose and support independence left two people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The separatist activists were fatally shot during an attack  
Sunday on a security post occupied by military-backed civilians 
near the East Timorese capital of Dili, the army said. Five people 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has been plagued by outbreaks of civil unrest over the  
past year, and several separatist movements have grown bolder since 
the ouster in May of former authoritarian President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	His successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie, has  
faced sometimes violent protests by students and is struggling to 
revive the Southeast Asian nation's shattered economy. Ethnic and 
religious tensions have also set off riots. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence had recently escalated in Aceh province, where the  
military suspended a decadelong campaign against rebels in the 
province at the northern end of Sumatra island and apologized for 
human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The military conducted dawn raids around the town of Lhokseumawe  
and arrested 132 people after villagers and suspected rebels killed 
seven soldiers and kidnapped two others last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people died in the coastal town, including at least one  
soldier, police Maj. Amrin Remico said by telephone. Authorities 
earlier said six died. 
</P>
<P>
	But Suara Karya, a national daily, reported that 13 people died  
in fighting in Lhokseumawe and the nearby district of Pidie. 
Rioters burned at least 15 buildings, including police and military 
posts and local government offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people were injured, many of them shot. It was not  
known if the soldiers were using plastic bullets or live 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of troops were deployed Monday across Lhokseumawe, a  
center of Indonesia's oil and gas industry, and there were no 
reports of fresh violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The military had aimed to reduce tensions by ceding control of  
most security matters in Aceh to local community leaders, but that 
plan appears to be on hold for now. Lhokseumawe was hit by 
anti-military riots several times in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar resentment toward the military runs deep in East Timor,  
which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a year later. 
Activists allege widespread human rights abuses by the armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N.-sponsored peace talks on East Timor are underway between  
Indonesia and Portugal, which the United Nations still considers to 
be the administering power. 
</P>
<P>
	But many East Timorese separatists reject Jakarta's offer of a  
measure of autonomy, preferring a vote on independence. The 
government has not offered an autonomy deal to the Acehnese.

	Hundreds of people were injured, many of them shot. It was not  
known if the soldiers were using plastic bullets or live 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of troops were deployed Monday across Lhokseumawe, a  
center of Indonesia's oil and gas industry, and there were no 
reports of fresh violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The military had aimed to reduce tensions by ceding control of  
most security matters in Aceh to local community leaders, but that 
plan appears to be on hold for now. Lhokseumawe was hit by 
anti-military riots several times in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar resentment toward the military runs deep in East Timor,  
which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a year later. 
Activists allege widespread human rights abuses by the armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N.-sponsored peace talks on East Timor are underway between  
Indonesia and Portugal, which the United Nations still considers to 
be the administering power. 
</P>
<P>
	But many East Timorese separatists reject Jakarta's offer of a  
measure of autonomy, preferring a vote on independence. The 
government has not offered an autonomy deal to the Acehnese.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Ready for Dolphins Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With a specific playoff opponent finally in their  
sights, the Denver Broncos returned to the practice field on Monday 
following a three-day break. 
</P>
<P>
	While many Denver players said the identity of their first  
postseason opponent didn't matter, most were pleased to get another 
shot at the Miami Dolphins, who defeated the Broncos 31-21 on Dec. 
21 behind four touchdown passes from Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of only two losses during the regular season for the  
AFC West champion Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice, because we played so poorly against them on  
national television,'' fullback Howard Griffith said. ``I don't 
think the team that showed up that game is any way indicative of 
the type of team we have. I think everyone is going to relish in 
the opportunity to go back out and redeem ourselves for what took 
place that Monday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver defense took the brunt of the blame for the loss  
after Marino threw for 355 yards, but Griffith said there was 
plenty of blame to spread around. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a team, as a whole, we played poorly,'' he said. ``We can't  
do that, not at this point of the year. But we also know that that 
part of our season is behind us. Now it's time for a new season. 
Records don't matter. What happened last time doesn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defending Super Bowl champion Broncos held a 50-minute  
workout in 30-degree weather on Monday in preparation for 
Saturday's divisional playoff game at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Shanahan was coy when asked to dissect the previous  
meeting with the Dolphins, particularly when asked to assess why 
Miami's defense had so much success against a usually prolific 
Broncos offense. Denver was held to a season-low 219 yards, well 
off its season average of 381. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just played better than we did,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pressed to elaborate, Shanahan said, ``They just played their  
defense. Really, they're pretty simple in what they do. They just 
try to out-execute people, and they've been very successful doing 
it. It's not very complicated, but what they do they do well, very 
similar to what Dallas did in its hey-day when Jimmy (Miami coach 
Jimmy Johnson) was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the inability of the Denver defense to contain Marino,  
Broncos safety Tyrone Braxton said, ``We had guys in great position 
on all those plays that Marino made on us. We just didn't make the 
play. We just didn't knock the ball down or pick it. You have to do 
that when you get the opportunity, particularly against a great 
quarterback like Marino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said the Broncos are in relatively good health, thanks  
to their bye week. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Terrell Davis, who captured his first NFL rushing  
title this season with 2,008 yards, was back in the practice field, 
apparently experiencing no problems with the tender ribs that 
hindered him last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong safety Eric Brown (groin) and defensive end Neil Smith  
(abdominal muscle) appeared to be improved. It was unclear, 
however, whether either player would start on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is still not 100 percent but he's improved,'' Shanahan  
said. ``Neil looks like he's improved and should be ready to go. 
He'll be close to 100 percent. Other than that, just some nicks and 
bruises, nothing that will keep anybody out.''

<HEADLINE> Vols Coach Fulmer Is Not Underpaid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Nearly 30 years after he threw his last  
block, Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer still looks and acts like the 
offensive guard he used to be. No one will accuse him of being 
overdressed. He still doesn't care who gets the credit. And he 
would rather be underestimated than not. 
</P>
<P>
	Underpaid, though, is another story.  
</P>
<P>
	Because even though few fans would rank Fulmer near the top of  
his fraternity, one indication of how much he belongs in that crowd 
came last week. Here, in the middle of the desert, he made it rain 
money. On the eve of the Volunteers' national championship match 
with Florida State, he signed a contract that moves him into the $1 
million-a-year neighborhood where his better-known lodge brothers 
reside. 
</P>
<P>
	The funny thing is how little anybody who knows Fulmer expects  
the bigger paycheck to change him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't work any harder,'' Fulmer said. ``There aren't any  
more hours in the day. We can work smarter, though, and hopefully 
we'll get smarter as we go along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer isn't as fast on his feet as his archrival, Florida coach  
Steve Spurrier. He doesn't have the presence of Penn State coach 
Joe Paterno. And he doesn't hide a sharp mind behind an ``aw 
shucks'' disguise the way Florida State coach Bobby Bowden does. 
That doesn't mean he lacks for confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can spoil people the way coach Bowden has done it  
at Florida State,'' Fulmer said. ``But I'm not going to get into a 
storytelling contest with him, I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, he's got a few stories worth telling. At a time when  
winning coaches change programs like suits, Fulmer is a study in 
loyalty. He played football for Tennessee, worked two stints there 
as an assistant before becoming the head coach, and pined for the 
place most every minute that he was away. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of how Tennessee finally reached college football's  
rocky top is an even better one. Fulmer has now guided the 
Volunteers to four consecutive top-10 finishes, and in the bargain, 
compiled the best career winning percentage (.857) in the game. But 
few people believed he was the force behind Tennessee's steady 
climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the credit for the wins over that stretch went to his  
gifted quarterback, Peyton Manning. Fulmer, meanwhile, got stuck 
with much of the blame for the Vols' five-game losing streak to 
Florida, a run that kept them from advancing out of the 
Southeastern Conference to challenge for national title sooner. But 
then, along came this season to clear those matters up. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning and Leonard Little, Tennessee's best defender, both  
graduated to the NFL. The Vols lost their best running back, Jamal 
Lewis, four weeks into the season. Somehow, though, this was the 
season Tennessee finally refused to crumble. They salvaged unlikely 
wins against Syracuse and Arkansas in the closing minutes, and 
against Florida in overtime, en route to a 12-0 regular-season 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of those wins involved a favorable break or three: a late  
pass interference call at Syracuse, six fumbles by Florida, a 
dropped ball by Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner that was so 
unlikely people have taken to calling it the ``Hand of God'' 
fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Fulmer's opponents have noted in each case, Tennessee was  
poised enough to make something out of the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that stuff keeps happening,'' Syracuse defensive  
coordinator George DeLeone said, ``you've got to ask yourself, `Is 
this divine intervention? Or is it just a bunch of guys who refuse 
to lose?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the second question goes to the heart of coaching,  
Fulmer doesn't care which one people buy into. Just as he didn't 
mind going into Monday night's finale as the underdog against 
Florida State, despite the nation's No. 1 ranking. He's made a 
career out of being overlooked. What he refuses to be is outworked. 
</P>
<P>
	Spend five minutes with Fulmer, and you will hear him talk about  
crossing T's and dotting his I's more than once. He watches more 
film than Siskel &AMP; Ebert. It got so bad earlier this season that 
Fulmer's wife, Vicky, insisted he come home Wednesday and Thursday 
nights for dinner with their three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we'd be lucky to get a little piece of him after a  
football game,'' she said. ``He'd be up and gone Sunday morning, 
and we literally wouldn't see him until Saturday. This year, I 
think he realized his girls aren't going to be in the house that 
much longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about his new routine, Fulmer seemed almost  
embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I needed to do. We have dinner together for a  
couple of hours,'' he said, then quickly added, ``but as soon as 
everybody's asleep, I get on the phone and make some recruiting 
calls.''

<HEADLINE> Bin Laden Messages Mixed on Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The exiled Saudi millionaire accused by U.S.  
officials of masterminding two embassy bombings is sending mixed 
messages about his role, telling one U.S. magazine he did not order 
the attacks and another that he ``instigated'' them. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews published in the Jan. 11 issues of Newsweek and  
Time, Osama bin Laden is consistent on two other subjects -- 
defending the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and 
denying that he is ill, as some U.S. reports have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The interviews, released over the weekend, were conducted on  
successive days last month by Pakistani reporters who had received 
clandestine invitations to bin Laden's mountain base in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has offered $5 million for bin Laden's  
capture, citing his alleged role in the Aug. 7 terrorist bombings 
of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, 
including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden has previously denied involvement in the bombings, and  
repeated that denial in the Newsweek interview, conducted Dec. 22. 
``I did not order them but was very glad for what happened to the 
Americans there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Dec. 23, he told Time's reporter that he had  
``instigated'' the attacks -- the closest he has come to admitting 
personal involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the instigation for jihad (holy war) against the Jews and  
the Americans... is considered a crime, then let history be a 
witness that I am a criminal,'' bin Laden said. ``Our job is to 
instigate, and by the grace of God, we did that, and certain people 
responded to this instigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek quoted bin Laden as saying the bombings were ``Islamic  
revenge on American spies in East Africa,'' carried out by 
``oppressed Muslims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States retaliated 13 days later with cruise missile  
raids on bin Laden's mountain encampment in northern Afghanistan, 
and a plant in Khartoum, Sudan, that was suspected of making nerve 
gas components for bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men arrested later in East Africa and now in custody in the  
United States had nothing to do with the bombings, bin Laden said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Time that he knew one of them, Wadih El-Hage, but had  
not seen or heard from him in several years, and told Newsweek that 
the other, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-`Owhali, had been tortured into 
confessing and implicating bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I do know is that those who risked their lives to earn  
the pleasure of God are real men,'' Time quoted him as saying. 
``They managed to rid the Islamic nation of disgrace. We hold them 
in the highest esteem... 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray to God to end the plight (of the arrested men) and we  
are confident they will be exonerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to reports that he is in ill health, bin Laden told  
Newsweek, ``The Americans are committing another lie. I'm healthier 
now than at any time before.'' Time said bin Laden seemed ``eager 
to deny reports that he had cancer,'' but used no direct quotes. It 
noted that he walked with a stick because of a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden told both interviewers he saw nothing wrong with  
acquiring chemical and nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acquiring weapons for the defense of Muslims is a religious  
duty.... And if I seek to acquire these weapons, I am carrying out 
a duty,'' he said to Time. ``It would be a sin for Muslims not to 
try to possess the weapons that would prevent the infidels from 
inflicting harm on Muslims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Newsweek interview, he called it ``very strange'' that  
America and Israel could have such weapons, ``but if a Muslim state 
like Pakistan tries to defend itself... everything should be done 
to prevent it from doing so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports described bin Laden as holding an AK-47 rifle  
during the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Time quoted aides as saying bin Laden relied solely on radio and  
newspapers for outside contact, and avoids using a portable 
satellite phone because the Americans might use the signal to 
target his location.

<HEADLINE> Utah Gov. Calls for Olympic Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt on Monday called for  
change at Salt Lake's Olympic headquarters to ensure ongoing probes 
into a bribery scandal do not bog down preparations for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Salt Lake Organizing Committee Chairman Robert  
Garff, the governor asked that committee members and staff who were 
involved in Utah's Olympic bid be put on administrative leave so 
they can focus on answering accusations of buying International 
Olympic Committee votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is imperative that we maintain the remarkable things that  
characterize the 2002 Winter Olympics, and that we separate 
ourselves from mistakes of the bid committee,'' Leavitt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was released following a 2 1/2-hour meeting between  
Leavitt, Garff, legislative leaders and state Olympic 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said he was not pointing fingers and he refused to  
suggest exactly who should take leave during the probes. He said 
the letter is a suggestion for SLOC's board of trustees to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
	The next scheduled board meeting is Jan. 14.  
</P>
<P>
	During the bid for the 2002 Winter Games, boosters funded  
$400,000 in scholarships that were paid to 13 people, including six 
relatives of IOC members. Former bid officials have also 
acknowledged giving IOC members expensive gifts and free medical 
care, including cosmetic surgery, before the IOC picked Salt Lake 
in 1995 as the Olympic host city. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake narrowly lost its bid for the 1998 Winter Games to  
Nagano, Japan, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of scholarships and gift giving have rocked the  
international Olympic movement, prompting four separate 
investigations into Salt Lake's bid. The probes are being conducted 
by the IOC, United States Olympic Committee, a SLOC ethics panel 
and the federal Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff appeared to back Leavitt's idea, saying committee staff is  
distracted by the controversy and it would be best for those 
involved in the bid to ``journey to another site and focus on the 
past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's letter asks that those targeted in the  
investigations vacate SLOC's offices until the probes are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by SLOC on Monday said it would comply with  
any decision by its board. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Garff, the proposal will have another supporter  
on SLOC's board. Trustee Ken Bullock submitted a similar request to 
Garff on Monday, but he raised a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a criminal investigation in process some employees may  
have personal interests to protect,'' wrote Bullock. 
</P>
<P>
	While Leavitt would not name names, SLOC's two top officials  
were involved in the bid effort -- President and CEO Frank Joklik 
and Senior Vice President Dave Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said the charges of vote buying have stung influential  
community leaders who sit on SLOC's board and who devoted their 
time and reputations to bring the Games to Utah. Leavitt was among 
those who traveled to Budapest in 1995 for the IOC vote and said he 
has felt ``enormous disappointment'' as he reads a steady stream of 
news reports from around the world about the scandal-tainted 
Olympics in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Utah would have much preferred an honest defeat  
than a victory soiled by something that should not have been 
done,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he spent the past two weeks consulting with his  
advisers, lawmakers and unidentified local Olympic officials before 
deciding on making his recommendation on how to deal with the 
inquiries and ``keep Utah's Olympic dream on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's discouraging,'' Leavitt said of the bribery  
investigations. ``But the reality is that in a little over three 
years the Olympic flame is coming to this state and we need to be 
ready.''

	Travellers Frustrated by Storm  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frustration grew today as travelers waited for  
airlines and airports to recover from the crippling weekend 
snowstorm in the Midwest. School was out for hundreds of districts 
from Iowa to New Hampshire because of slippery roads and sidewalks, 
and Purdue University in Indiana canceled all classes for the first 
time since 1984. At least 57 deaths were blamed on the storm from 
Nebraska across the Midwest into Canada and New England, and cold 
air that rolled southward behind the storm was blamed for two 
deaths in Oklahoma.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole today announced her resignation  
as president of the American Red Cross, apparently to pursue a 
potential White House bid of her own. Dole, wife of 1996 GOP

	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Jesse Ventura was sworn in today as  
governor of Minnesota. Ventura, a former pro wrestling bad guy, 
took the oath of office at a star-studded ceremony attended by at 
least three former governors and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ventura's 
co-star in several movies. Ventura spoke for about 15 minutes, 
crediting new, young voters with his success and said they must not 
be forgotten. ``We cannot fail,'' he said. ``We must not fail. 
Because if we do, we could lose this generation. And we must not 
let that happen.'' Ventura is the first Reform Party candidate to 
win statewide office in the nation.

	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A sniper with a high-powered rifle opened fire  
today on Interstate 80 traffic, hitting at least four vehicles and 
wounding one man in the chest. The highway was shut down in both 
directions. Washoe County sheriff's sergeant Bob Towery said the 
man's injuries did not appear to be life-threatening. Three other 
vehicles were hit as well, and two had bullet holes through the 
centers of their windshields. Dozens of officers, assisted by two 
sheriff's department helicopters, were searching search for a 
powder blue Chevrolet pickup driven by a possible suspect.

breathing on their own today, while one continued receiving 
assistance from a ventilator. Baby girls Ebuka, Chidi, Chima, 
Echerem and brothers Jioke and Ikem were breathing without 
assistance at the neonatal unit of Texas Children's Hospital. All 
seven remained in critical but stable condition. They are expected 
to remain at Texas Children's Hospital until at least March. The

scaling back on President Clinton's goal of 10,000 by the turn of 
the century. With an 8 percent budget increase, the organization 
intends to sign up nearly 4,000 volunteers this year, Peace Corps 
Director Mark Gearan today. Currently, 6,700 are serving two-year 
stints in 80 countries. With about half those ending terms, the 
year-end total is expected to exceed 7,100. The Peace Corps budget

that Microsoft Corp. be prevented from using its dominant Windows 
operating system to favor its own software products. The chief 
executive officer for Intuit Inc., which makes the popular Quicken 
personal finance software, testified today as the Microsoft 
antitrust trial resumed after a lengthy holiday break. William 
Harris complained that Microsoft holds unparalleled influence in 
the high-tech industry because Windows, which functions as the 
central nervous system for most computers, is an ``essential 
service'' for which ``there is no effective substitute.''

	Euro Trading Ushers in New Era  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Asian financial markets on Monday welcomed the  
debut of Europe's new common currency, the euro, which some traders 
see as a ready alternative to the U.S. dollar -- long an unrivaled 
safe haven for the world's investors. Demand for the euro in early 
trading pushed its value up to $1.1862 and 134.77 Japanese yen, 
well above expectations. But trading was limited and cautious as 
many investors awaited the reaction to the euro on its home turf, 
Europe. Still, bankers and traders were abuzz with preparations to 
handle increased trading in the coming weeks and months.

	Israelis Injured in Attack on Bus  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Gunmen fired on a bus carrying Israeli settlers  
Monday, Israel radio and army radio reported. Two people were 
injured, one seriously. Palestinian militants are suspected of 
carrying out the attack, the radios reported. The attack took place 
in the divided West Bank city of Hebron, which is controlled by the 
Palestinian Authority, except for some enclaves of Jewish settlers 
in the city's center. The bus was riddled with bullets, Israel 
radio said. The Israeli army reinforced its troops in Hebron as a 
result and imposed a curfew on areas under its control.

	Gunmen Kill 16 in Pakistan Mosque  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Gunmen opened fire on Shiite Muslim  
worshippers as they knelt in prayer at a mosque in Pakistan Monday, 
killing 16 people and wounding at least 25 others, police said. As 
many as 13 of the wounded are believed to be in critical condition, 
police said. No one has taken immediate responsibility for the 
killing, they said. The attack in Shah Jamal, 180 miles south of 
the eastern Punjab provincial capital of Lahore, occurred as 100 
Shiite Muslim worshipers were finishing their morning prayers that 
marked the beginning of their daylong fast. Devout Muslims fast 
from sunrise to sunset during the holy month of Ramadan.

	Clinton Eyes Long-Term Care Credit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposing billions of dollars in new help for  
long-term care, President Clinton wants to create a $1,000 tax 
credit for some 2 million American families struggling to tend to 
elderly or disabled relatives. The tax credit, meant to compensate 
caregivers for such expenses as adult day care, respite care and 
reduced work hours, is part of a five-year, $6.2 billion package 
that the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton planned to 
unveil at a White House ceremony Monday. None of it becomes reality 
without Congress, which last year rejected Clinton's attempt at HMO 
reform through a ``Patient's Bill of Rights.''

	Senate Faces Impeachment Decision

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress convenes this week with Senate  
leaders still looking for a middle-ground approach that ends 
President Clinton's impeachment trial quickly while satisfying 
conservatives' demands for full presentation of his alleged crimes. 
The 106th Congress goes into session Wednesday and senators will 
immediately huddle to consider a plan that could end the 
impeachment process within four days. Senate Republicans will meet 
Thursday, and ``my assumption is that this will be the sole topic 
of the conversation,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Sunday on 
ABC's ``This Week.''

	Midwest Storm Leaves 36 Dead  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicagoans dug out from their biggest snowstorm  
in more than 30 years Sunday. About 22 inches of snow had piled up 
from Chicago across northern Indiana as the storm spread snow, ice, 
slush and rain from the Missouri Valley to the East Coast. At least 
36 deaths had been blamed on the storm, 11 of them in Illinois. The 
ice and blinding, wind-driven snow created havoc for air travelers 
through the entire weekend. At Chicago's O'Hare International 
Airport, the nation's busiest, United, American and most other 
airlines canceled the bulk of their flights Saturday.

Sunday to extend their undefeated streak to 11 games. Defenseman 
Roman Hamrlik and left-winger Boyd Devereaux scored 64 seconds 
apart late in the third period to cap the Oilers' comeback before a 
sellout crowd of 17,100 at the Skyreach Centre. Josef Berenek also 
scored for Edmonton.

<HEADLINE> Christian Cult Raises Israeli Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOZA, Israel (AP) -- It was the picture of American-style  
suburban comfort: vans in the driveway, a wooden trellis, parents 
tending the plants spilling over a long balcony, kids in the yard 
sharing their Barbie dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	That serene veneer was shattered Sunday when Israeli police and  
intelligence swooped in on two homes in quiet, wooded Jerusalem 
suburbs, detaining 14 missing members of a Denver-based cult and 
foiling what they said was a bloody plot that the apocalyptic group 
hoped would bring Jesus Christ's return. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult drama three days into 1999 raised the curtain on what  
Israeli authorities fear could be months of turbulence leading up 
to the turn of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Christian pilgrims are expected to visit  
the Holy Land this year, but officials worry the millennium also 
will draw deranged extremists seeking to live out apocalyptic 
fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors of the two spacious homes a mile apart on Jerusalem's  
hilly western outskirts said the people living there were 
unfailingly pleasant -- if remote. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moza, a young Israeli couple were delighted when an American  
family moved in nearby with young children the same age as their 
own 5-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Noam, 31, recalled how her children and the American children  
would play tag, ride bicycles, and teach each other snatches of 
Hebrew and English. 
</P>
<P>
	Noam, who asked that her last name not be used, approached the  
residents when she saw a Colorado plate on a motorcycle parked in 
front of the house. She had spent some time in the western state. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the neighbors were forthcoming -- they said they were  
from Yellowjacket, Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	They would sit on a porch swing on the patio and watch their  
well-dressed, well-fed children cheerfully share candy, balls, and 
Barbie dolls with Noam's children. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they were staying in Israel as tourists for the year  
and that Jerusalem was very special to them. They said they had 
traveled to the Dead Sea, Nazareth, and had explored Jerusalem's 
Old City, including the Temple Mount. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the cult members were planning violent acts in Jerusalem's walled 
Old City and that one possible location was the Temple Mount, the 
site of Jewish-Arab tensions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said cult members believed that being killed by  
police ``would lead them to heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They planned to carry out violent and extreme acts in the  
streets of Jerusalem at the end of 1999 to start the process of 
bringing Jesus back to life,'' said Brig. Gen. Elihu Ben-Onn, the 
national police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Noam grew suspicious when the mother, whom she would not name,  
would not let her children venture far beyond the gate of the 
sprawling stone patio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothered the neighbors because Israelis like to know what  
is going on,'' Noam said. ``When people invited them over for 
coffee they would say no, and Israelis just don't like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors described a similar scene at the house in Mevasseret  
Zion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone just stayed at home all the time. I thought it was  
weird,'' said Nir Hanono. ``The children did not appear mistreated 
in any way, but they seemed very bored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minivans were parked in the driveways of both homes, and  
neighbors recalled repeated visits by small groups of adults and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans first appeared in August; some would disappear,  
and others would come. People who would claim to be members of the 
same family would not interrelate like family, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult members -- including three families as well as  
individuals -- did not resist arrest when police raided. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, was heavily  
involved in the swoop. The Americans had been under surveillance 
for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Cult leader Monte Kim Miller, 44, was not among those detained;  
police said he was not in Israel. Police would not release names of 
any of the suspects detained, and Israeli law prohibits publication 
of suspects' names until they appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspects may be held up to 48 hours before appearing in court,  
but police said they intend to ask the Interior Ministry, which 
grants or revokes foreigners' permission to remain in Israel, to 
deport them. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the children and their  
mothers were not in jail, but at an ``institutional office.'' 
Ben-Ruby wouldn't say where the rest of the adults were, but said 
the men were ``in custody.'' The group, he said, would not 
necessarily appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Noam said it had been a month since she saw the family she had  
befriended. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really bothers me is that the young kids that my kids  
played with were innocently, not willingly, involved in all this,'' 
Noam said.

<HEADLINE>  Two Israelis Hurt in Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Gunmen hiding in a narrow alley of the  
divided city of Hebron fired two dozen bullets at a passing van 
today, wounding two Jewish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian militants were suspected of carrying out the attack,  
which came two days after the Muslim calendar anniversary of the 
1994 Hebron mosque massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Two women were injured in today's attack, one seriously, said  
Hadassah Hospital spokeswoman Yael Bossem-Levy. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambush took place this morning on a winding road connecting  
the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba and the Israeli-controlled 
center of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
	The road has been the scene of two other shooting attacks, said  
the Kiryat Arba mayor, Zvi Katzover, who demanded that more 
soldiers be posted there. 
</P>
<P>
	In a first step, the Israeli army placed a curfew on the  
downtown area under its control, barring Palestinians from leaving 
their homes. Troops also enforced a closure of all of Hebron, 
preventing Palestinians from entering or leaving the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came as the peace process between Israel and the  
Palestinians remained frozen. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu refuses to continue handing over territory promised to 
the Palestinians in the U.S.-brokered Wye agreement. He has accused 
the Palestinians of violating key clauses of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said the Palestinians have made a  
considerable effort to implement their part of the agreement, and 
has called on Israel to continue the withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	About 450 Jewish settlers live in Hebron, surrounded by 130,000  
Palestinians. Most of the city is controlled by the Palestinian 
Authority, while Israel maintains control over the center of town 
where several settler enclaves are located. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, demanded that the  
Palestinian Authority do everything in its power to arrest the 
gunmen, who presumably fled into the Palestinian-run area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the Palestinian Authority to act against these  
terrorists,'' Bar-Illan said. ``Otherwise we will have to draw the 
obvious conclusions about their desire for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian security chief in the West Bank, Col. Jibril  
Rajoub, would only say that he was dealing with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The settler van was driving from the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a  
shrine sacred to Muslims and Jews, to Kiryat Arba. Police said the 
assailants were hiding in a side alley, at a point where the road 
makes a sharp curve, forcing motorists to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was riddled with 21 bullets, witnesses said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the attack, settler leaders huddled at the site,  
while a dozen settler girls read psalms. Katzover demanded that the 
alley be closed and that an additional army post be set up on a 
roof overlooking the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Several streets away, a few Palestinians threw stones at Israeli  
soldiers from rooftops and troops fired rubber-coated steel pellets 
and stun grenades to disperse the stone throwers.

<HEADLINE> Honda Sees Modest Sales for Hybrid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. expects modest sales of its  
gasoline-electric hybrid car after it debuts nationwide in November 
or December, an executive said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Elliott, vice president of American Honda Motor Co., said  
the Japanese automaker expects U.S. sales to be less than 5,000. 
The car also will be sold in Japan and Europe at the same time. No 
price has been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda, which unveiled a prototype of the aerodynamic car at the  
North American International Auto Show's media preview, said it 
will be one of the most efficient gasoline-powered vehicles ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``V V'' uses a lightweight 1-liter, three-cylinder gasoline  
engine assisted by an electric motor and combined with a five-speed 
manual transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	The highly efficient powertrain, combined with the addition of  
lightweight plastic and aluminum body panels, allow the car to get 
an estimated 70 miles a gallon in combined city and highway 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway mileage is as high as 80 mpg, Honda says. That gives the  
subcompact two-seater a range of more than 700 miles a tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle also is cleaner than most conventional cars; it  
meets California's Ultra Low Emission Vehicle standard, Honda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. has been selling its hybrid car, the Prius,  
in Japan since 1997 and plans to begin selling it in the United 
States by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG also  
are working on hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, but don't plan to 
have them ready for sale before 2001.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls vs. Euro's Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the new European common  
currency and the Japanese yen on Monday, as dealers embraced the 
euro's debut amid worries about a slowdown in U.S. economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro arrived on financial markets three days after the  
official Jan. 1 launch by its 11 participating nations. Economists 
and currency traders believe the euro could one day challenge the 
dollar as the international currency of choice. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1806, up  
from its designated starting point of $1.1668 in earlier Asian 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency also was quoted at 112.07 Japanese yen, down  
from 113.57 last Thursday. Financial markets were closed Friday to 
celebrate New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about the expected slowdown in U.S. economic growth this  
year hurt the dollar against both of its major counterparts. The 
dollar also suffered from a late-afternoon downturn in U.S. stocks 
after a Federal Reserve official warned that the U.S. economy 
cannot continue growing at its current pace. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the yen was buoyed by comments from Japan's  
influential deputy finance minister for international affairs, 
Eisuke Sakakibara, who was quoted in a Japanese newspaper as 
predicting a stronger yen and weaker U.S. economy in 1999. The yen 
also was supported by rising Japanese interest rates, which boost 
demand for a country's currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6567 German 
marks, down from 1.6685 late Thursday; 1.3673 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.3740; 5.5556 French francs, down from 5.5980; 1,639.34 
Italian lire, down from 1,654.05; and 1.5268 Canadian dollars, down 
from 1.5479. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound, which is not part of the euro, was quoted at  
$1.6570, down from $1.6595.

<HEADLINE> Vols' Hometown Fans Celebrate Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee's hometown fans broke out  
victory cigars and cheered from the tops of tables as they 
celebrated a 23-16 victory over Florida State for the national 
championship in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was great,'' shouted Jim Schutt, who donned a  
sweatshirt saying the Vols are ``Undefeated, Unbeatable and 
Uncontested!'' as he celebrated with others who had watched the 
game at Bailey's Sports Grille. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are No. 1. There's no question about it,'' he said as fans  
slapped high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans huddled around TVs at home and in bars Monday night as  
temperatures dipped into the teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want some reaction?'' said Eddie Bailey, as he shouted  
``Oh, yeah! The Vols are No. 1 and that's what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed some respect and we've got it,'' said his friend,  
Laura Westbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoxville restaurateur Frank Goddard said the Fiesta Bowl  
matchup between No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2 Florida State was '' ... 
a big, big day in the life of anybody who is a UT graduate, which I 
am, or a UT fan, which I am,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around Tennessee football all my life and I can't  
remember a bigger event,'' said Goddard, whose father played on 
Tennessee's 1951 championship team. ``Maybe the World's Fair (held 
in Knoxville in 1982). Maybe, but I doubt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impact wasn't confined to Knoxville. Gov. Don Sundquist, as  
well as Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe, were among the thousands who 
traveled to the game in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's Nashville Predators moved up the starting time two  
hours for their game against the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, then showed 
the Fiesta Bowl on their Jumbotron. 
</P>
<P>
	It's ``an unofficial state holiday for all intents and  
purposes,'' reasoned Tom Ward, the Predators' executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	With UT students on Christmas break until Jan. 13 and thousands  
of Tennessee fans at the game, the Vols' hometown was strangely 
quiet on game day. But the stay-at-home faithful made plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some restaurants closed, saying they couldn't compete against  
the telecast. The ``Naples'' restaurant gave employees the day off 
and left a recorded message on their phone, ``Go Vols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goddard said his company closed their ``Harry's'' restaurant for  
the day ``due to the tremendous following to Tempe. Most of our 
regulars said they would see us when they return with the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Goddard said his flagship ``Regas'' restaurant, which  
seats 500, was booked by a ``preferred guest'' for a Fiesta Bowl 
party for 50 of his closest friends. ``They said they didn't care 
what it cost,'' Goddard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza delivery services expected a booming business. James  
Bluford, an area manager for Pizza Hut, expected it to ``be as big 
as the Super Bowl, if not bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Vol fans began filling Bailey's Sports Grille hours before  
kickoff to watch the game on one of 23 TVs. ``Just the normal UT 
game, just the normal madness,'' manager Jacqueline Teed-Freisen 
said.

<HEADLINE> Merger Combines Chattanooga Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- The 60-year rivalry for stories,  
readers and revenue between The Chattanooga Times and the 
Chattanooga Free Press ended on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff of each paper gathered in one newsroom to publish the  
first edition of their merged daily papers. The Chattanooga 
Times/Chattanooga Free Press hits the street Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper will have the comics, crosswords and syndicated  
features from both newspapers. And in an unusual move, it will have 
two editorial pages to reflect the conservatism of the afternoon 
Free Press and the more liberal stance of the morning Times. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new morning publication won't look anything like its  
predecessors. It will be more modern-looking than the Free Press, 
known for its daily banner headlines, and have a different design 
and typeface than the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make this newspaper the best in Tennessee ... and  
the best paper for its size in America,'' owner Walter Hussman Jr. 
told the staff at their first meeting. Hussman is chief executive 
officer of WEHCO Media Inc. of Little Rock, Ark., which owns the 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of about 100 crowded into a small section of the main  
newsroom of the Free Press, where cakes decorated with the front 
page of the papers' respective final editions were displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some staffers had worked their entire careers at the papers and  
just hours before had said goodbye to co-workers who had been laid 
off. At least 30 people from both publications lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad,'' said J.B. Collins, 81, who worked at the Free  
Press for 58 years and will continuing covering the City Council 
for the new paper. ``I've just been here too long and worked too 
long for this paper to see it any other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new paper will have a Washington, D.C., correspondent, a  
Georgia Statehouse reporter and expanded coverage of communities 
surrounding Chattanooga such as Dalton, Ga., to the south and 
Cleveland, Tenn., to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussman, who also owns the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, estimates  
circulation will be 76,000 weekdays and about 110,000 Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times had passed the Free Press in average daily  
circulation. It sold 41,229 papers Monday through Saturday, while 
the Free Press sold 40,119 papers. The Free Press also sold 106,200 
papers on Sunday, when the Times did not publish. 
</P>
<P>
	The final editions were published with little fanfare. The  
headline atop the Times read ``Papers merge today.'' The Free Press 
made no mention of the merger after publishing a lengthy story on 
the new paper Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both publications have been running full-page ads in the last  
weeks preparing readers for the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Publisher Paul Neely, who will be an associate publisher  
of the new paper, wrote a column Saturday asking readers to wait 
six months before judging the new product. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look back then and say, `Yes, this is better than  
either paper was before,' then we'll have passed the main test we 
are applying to ourselves,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lutgen, managing editor of the merged paper and the former  
managing editor of the Democrat-Gazette, said ``the end result is 
something that will knock your socks off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The merger leaves only 52 U.S. cities with two or more daily  
newspapers. Chattanooga was the last city in Tennessee with 
competing daily papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussman completed his purchase of the Times on Monday. He bought  
the paper from the 13 great-grandchildren of Adolph Ochs, who 
became a Times owner and publisher in 1878 -- 18 years before buying 
The New York Times.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Fed Chief Sees Slow Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  
Atlanta forecast slower but continued growth for the economy in 
1999, while voicing concern Monday that Americans have become 
unrealistic in their economic expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Guynn said that eight straight years of economic expansion  
may have led to what he called ``the institutionalization of 
unrealistic expectations.'' In other words, Guynn said, to many 
Americans, ``economic growth that's not exceptional, that's not 
spectacular, that's merely good, is coming to be seen as not quite 
good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Meehan, a market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald brokerage in  
Stamford, Conn., said Guynn's remarks dampened investors' hopes 
that the Fed would be as aggressive in cutting interest rates to 
prop up the economy as it was during the final months of 1998, when 
it lowered a key short-term rate three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan was among analysts who said Guynn's luncheon comments  
contributed to a sharp reversal of stock prices Monday afternoon. 
The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 168.64 in the 
morning, gave up all of those gains and sank as much as 58.96 in 
the afternoon before managing to bounce back to a small gain. The 
Dow ended the day up 2.84 at 9,184.27. 
</P>
<P>
	During a speech to the Atlanta Rotary Club in which he made his  
forecast for 1999, Guynn projected gross domestic product growth of 
some 2.5 percent, inflation around 2 percent, and unemployment just 
over 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be ``not the exceptional years of 1997 or 1998,  
perhaps, but a very good showing all the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there needs to be ``a reality check,'' emphasizing that  
slower GDP growth isn't the same as slow GDP growth and slightly 
higher inflation isn't the same as accelerating inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers, businesses, investors and policy-makers should not  
proceed as though they were,'' he said. ``Such a delusion could 
have real repercussions for the U.S. economy.''

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President-elect Hugo Chavez on Monday  
named a fellow former coup leader as governor of Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Adm. Hernan Gruber Odreman, who led a failed coup  
attempt by military rebels in 1992, will take over the governorship 
of the federal district of Caracas, which covers about half the 
capital city of six million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruber, 58, ran unsuccessfully in November for governor of  
Miranda state, which includes the rest of Caracas and outlying 
areas. He belongs to Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition. 
Both will take office Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 44, a retired paratrooper who won a landslide victory  
Dec. 6, led a failed coup several months before Gruber's. He and 
other coup leaders eventually were pardoned by President Rafael 
Caldera.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- It wasn't the year of the Big One  
in earthquake-prone Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but 1998 
saw 622 smaller quakes in the area, seismologists reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the tremors were so small only seismographs could detect  
them, but 13 were felt by residents, said the Puerto Rico Seismic 
Network at the University of Mayaguez. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest, a 5.6-magnitude quake on Dec. 7 centered six  
miles south of the British island of Anegada, caused no damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of 1998's earthquakes were centered north of the Virgin  
Islands, in the Mona Passage between the Dominican Republic and 
Puerto Rico, and in southern Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the British Virgin  
Islands lie near the boundary of two pieces of the Earth's crust, 
the North American plate and the Caribbean plate. Pressure between 
the plates produces seismic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1918, a quake off western Puerto Rico killed 116 people,  
including 32 who were drowned by the resulting tsunami.

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The presidents of Peru and Ecuador said  
Monday they will meet later in the month at the countries' newly 
established frontier to formally recognize new border markers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important pass at establishing the frontiers,''  
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said of the meeting planned for 
Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Cement border markers have been set in an area known as  
Lagartococha-Guepi at the southern edge of Ecuador. Several more 
markers remain to be set by a special joint-commission in the 
Cordillera del Condor area of the Amazon rainforest. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries went to war twice over the 48-mile stretch in  
the Andean foothills claimed by both countries and left undefined 
in a protocol ending a 1941 border war.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- A new party of dissidents who  
broke away from El Salvador's ruling party said Monday it doesn't 
have enough money to field a candidate in the March 7 presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirio Waldo Salagado, who would have been the party candidate,  
said the Democratic Liberal Party would participate in the 2000 
municipal and legislative elections, ``when we should have greater 
force and better organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The PLD was formed mostly by dissidents from the Nationalist  
Republican Alliance, or ARENA, who claimed that party members were 
working only to benefit small groups of businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Salgado didn't rule out supporting ARENA candidates if ``there  
is a moral change within the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ARENA candidate, Francisco Flores, leads in opinion polls  
over ex-guerrilla Facundo Guardado of the Farabundi Marti front, 
the former rebel group, and candidates from two other parties.

	Even Lindsay Davenport could not prevent the United States from  
losing its Hopman Cup match against Sweden on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Davenport routed Asa Carlsson 6-2, 6-0 in the opening

<HEADLINE> Siblings Separated in Adoption Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A 4-year-old boy and his 6-year-old sister  
exchanged stuffed animals and hugs in a tearful farewell that could 
spark a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the rights of siblings who are 
adopted or in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's lawyers have appealed to the country's highest court  
to keep the brother and sister together. A ruling in favor of the 
boy could potentially reunite some 35,000 siblings nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the boy -- referred to in court papers as ``Hugo  
L.'' -- said goodbye to his sister, ``Gloria L.,'' in a Department 
of Social Services office in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He will begin a new life with an aunt in New Jersey while his  
sister will remain in Boston's Dorchester section, with the foster 
family that has adopted her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the saddest of sad days,'' Susan Dillard, a  
court-appointed attorney who fought to keep Hugo with his sister 
and foster mother, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo's aunt picked him up at the office, presenting him with an  
Ernie doll the boy has come to adore during dozens of visits with 
the aunt in New Jersey and Boston since March. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meeting, relatives of the aunt and the foster mother  
discussed plans to keep Hugo and Gloria in contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spent a fair amount of time together, and the families  
talked about how the children would keep in touch with each 
other,'' Dillard said. ``I think it really went as well as anyone 
could hope for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farewell came after a ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme  
Judicial Court, which upheld a Juvenile Court decision separating 
the pair. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Drogin, an attorney for the aunt who now has custody of  
Hugo, said she expects the boy will get through an initially tough 
period and come to prosper with his aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying he's going to be happy when he realizes his  
sister and his foster mother are no longer there,'' she said. ``Of 
course he will be traumatized. But he will be happy again. His aunt 
is a wonderful, wonderful lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo's trip through the state's child welfare system began just  
three days after he was born, when he was placed in foster care. He 
may have been injured by cocaine his mother used while pregnant, 
according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hugo turned 2, the state transferred him to the home of his  
sister's foster mother, ``Enid.'' It was a traumatic move for the 
boy, but Hugo prospered under Enid's care, began to call Enid 
``Mommy'' and developed a strong bond with Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo's aunt, however, fought to gain custody. In deciding to  
hand him over to her, the state's highest court acknowledged that 
it had made a ``heart-wrenching choice.''

<HEADLINE> Mouse in House Connects to an iMac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A Macintosh in the house. In MY house?  
</P>
<P>
	Oh, Lord!  
</P>
<P>
	Regular readers know that over the years, this column has been  
about as enthusiastic for the Macintosh line as it has been about 
catching the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	This has drawn many comments, some harsh, from the Macintosh  
faithful, even though more than 90 percent of the personal 
computing world uses Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	My wife is a teacher whose paperwork is Mac-based, so she often  
has had to stay after class to use the school's Macs. 
</P>
<P>
	So for Christmas, I gave her a Mac of her own -- the new iMac. It  
cost about $1,300, plus $150 for the floppy disk drive that should 
have been built in, and another $40 for a cable to feed a printer. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the iMac ideal? Here's the report:  
</P>
<P>
	First, to give the devil and Steve Jobs their due, setup is  
easy. The monitor, speakers, 24x CD-ROM and CPU are integrated, so 
the only connections are those for the keyboard, mouse, power cord 
and, if you use the modem, a phone line. 
</P>
<P>
	At power-on, the Mac OS springs to life and the desktop, with a  
few changes, could be a Windows 98 desktop. Bundled software 
includes AppleWorks, Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, a 
Williams-Sonoma cookbook, Quicken and more. 
</P>
<P>
	With its 233-megahertz PowerPC G3 processor and 32 megabytes of  
RAM, the iMac is speedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now for some gripes:  
</P>
<P>
	Because the cables connecting the keyboard, phone and printer  
are fed through a little round window on the side of the machine, 
they sprawl across the right side of your desk instead of being 
tucked away at the back. And the mouse and disk drive connect to 
the USB port on the keyboard, which means more cables to get in the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is no built-in floppy drive, there is a built-in  
10/100base-T Ethernet connection -- which for most home computers is 
about as useful as a leaky bucket. The day might come when several 
home computers are linked through an in-house network, but it 
probably won't be soon for most of us. 
</P>
<P>
	The keyboard feels small and cramped, and the translucent, round  
mouse, though nifty looking, is too small to use comfortably for 
long periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the iMac is easy to use, and its built-in 56  
kilobits-per-second modem supporting V.90 and K56flex makes it a 
good Net surfer. PC users will puzzle for a while about how to 
eject a floppy (it's done from the screen, not with a button). 
Building a handle into the main unit ought to win someone on the 
design team a pat on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1,450 total cost, without printer, would have covered a PC  
in the same processor range, or higher, probably bundled with a 
printer. But one national retailer now offers an Epson 640 color 
printer with an iMac for $1,299, which evens out the price 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Bottom line: While I still prefer Windows 98, the iMac is worth  
considering, especially if its price drops $100 or so and your main 
interest is Net surfing or home use. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Activity Slows Down </HEADLINE>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Manufacturing activity slowed in December for  
the seventh straight month, dropping to its lowest level in almost 
eight years as global economic problems continued to hinder 
exports. But investors ignored the sharper-than-expected cooling of 
the industrial economy as stocks began 1999 with sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was up 145.99, or by 1.6  
percent, at 9,327.42 by early afternoon, moving within 50 points of 
the record high 9,374.27 reached Nov. 23. Broader stock indexes, 
also led a continued charge by technology stocks, were in record 
territory in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported today  
its monthly index of business activity fell to 45.1 percent last 
month -- its lowest level since May 1991. Economists had predicted 
the index would rise slightly from its November level of 46.8 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Any reading under 50 percent is a sign of contraction in the  
industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The private group's report is compiled from a survey of  
corporate purchasing executives nationwide. It is widely followed 
by economists because it is usually the first indicator of how the 
economy performed in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to lingering economic troubles abroad, American  
manufacturers were hurt by slowing domestic demand, as seen in the 
largely disappointing Christmas shopping season, said David Resler, 
chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be a matter of concern for the overall economy,''  
Resler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wall Street was extending gains from an impressive  
fourth-quarter surge that reversed a summer swoon. The Dow, 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list and Nasdaq composite index all 
ended 1998 with an unprecedented fourth straight year of 
double-digit gains, helped by falling interest rates and low 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street also was watching the strong launch of the euro, the  
single currency for 11 European nations. While the toppling of 
financial barriers is expected to make Europe a tougher competitor 
to the United States, it also is expected to make it easier for 
U.S. companies to do business in Europe and less costly for U.S. 
traders to invest in European businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers' report gave further support to  
expectations that the U.S. economy will continue to grow in 1999, 
but at a slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``New orders continue (to be) weak as we proceed into 1999 and  
prompt concerns about the manufacturing sector as we move into the 
first quarter,'' said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the NAPM's survey 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports continued to decline in December, although at a slower  
pace, as purchasing executives expressed concern about the steel 
industry in particular, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices dropped at a faster rate, a trend that plagued the  
manufacturing sector through all of 1998. Production also declined 
at a faster clip. 
</P>
<P>
	With struggling manufacturers being forced to cut jobs to save  
money, manufacturing employment dropped at a faster rate last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the decline in manufacturing, the economy recorded its  
92nd consecutive month of growth in December, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the economy's expansion continues past this year, it would  
become the longest in U.S. history. The current period of growth 
began in March 1991.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says It Can't Protect Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq warned that it could no longer  
protect American and British aid workers in the country from ``deep 
popular anger,'' and insisted Monday that the United Nations should 
replace them for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq issued a note to the United Nations to clarify statements  
made in Baghdad last week saying that U.S. and British humanitarian 
workers were no longer welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sense of anger that besets 22 million Iraqis may find  
expression in unfriendliness on the part of some of them vis-a-vis 
program personnel of the United States or British nationality, 
particularly in the case where those dear to them were killed in 
the barbarous United States and British bombardment,'' the note 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British forces bombed Iraqi military and communications  
buildings Dec. 16-19 after U.N. arms inspectors accused Baghdad of 
obstructing their efforts to search out and destroy Iraq's weapons 
of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. resolutions don't allow Iraq to dictate the composition of  
U.N. teams. Nevertheless, host countries are responsible for the 
safety of U.N. personnel on their territory and Iraq's claim that 
it cannot ensure that security puts the United Nations in a bind. 
</P>
<P>
	John Mills, spokesman for the U.N. program in Iraq, said Monday  
that Baghdad would allow four Britons working for contractors and 
three Americans, including two senior U.N. officials, to remain in 
Iraq but would not renew visas for nine Britons and an American 
working with the humanitarian programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi note said, ``The prime fact is the deep popular anger  
in Iraq against the United States and the United Kingdom as a 
result of this unwarranted aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi decision, if carried out, would increase tensions at a  
time when the entire U.N.-Iraq relationship -- weapons inspections, 
sanctions and the humanitarian program -- is being reassessed after 
months of crises over arms searches that culminated in the Dec. 
16-19 missile campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. humanitarian team, made up of about 400 people, is in  
Iraq to distribute food and medicine under the U.N. oil-for-food 
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has been barred from selling oil on the open market since  
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The embargo cannot be lifted until 
U.N. inspectors certify Iraq is free of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Washington, State Department Spokesman James P.  
Rubin said one of Saddam's sons, Qusai Hussein, had directed the 
killing of hundreds of Iraqi dissidents in November in the Shiite 
region on southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Egypt, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa denounced what he said  
was a campaign against Egypt in the official Iraqi media. Tensions 
between the countries have been running high since Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak said Saddam was responsible for his 
country's woes.

<HEADLINE> Fiesta Bowl Marks Jackson's Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There was no ``Whoa Nellie'' at the end of Keith Jackson's final  
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran announcer, whose booming voice and down-home sayings  
have made him synonymous with college football for the past 26 
years, ended his career on Monday night at the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tennessee 23, Florida State 16. And so it is done. I say  
goodbye to all of you. God bless and good night,'' were the 
70-year-old Jackson's final words as he signed off for the last 
time a little past midnight EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson joined ABC in 1962 and has covered the big events -- the  
NBA, the NFL, baseball and the Olympics -- and the obscure ones -- 
like wrist wrestling on ``Wide World of Sports. But it is the 32 
years of calling college games from small towns like Tuscaloosa, 
Ala., and State College, Pa., that he will be remembered most for. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final telecast, he tried to divert the attention away  
from himself and onto the field for most of the game, but it wasn't 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Griese, his partner of 12 years, brought it up on numerous  
occasions during the first half and dumped a Gatorade container 
full of confetti on Jackson's head near the conclusion of the game. 
During halftime, ABC aired a four-minute clip of Jackson's career 
highlights. 
</P>
<P>
	And even Jackson brought up his retirement late in the fourth  
quarter, despite his insistence before the game that he would not 
talk about himself. He thanked Griese, sideline reporter Lynn Swann 
and the production staff at ABC for their help through the years. 
</P>
<P>
	At halftime, Griese informed Jackson that ABC and Washington  
State, his alma mater, have established a Keith Jackson 
Distinguished Presidential Scholarship, a $100,000 scholarship that 
will be given to the top WSU student in recognition of Jackson's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson will also receive the 1999 Gold Medal Award from the  
National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame on Dec. 7 at 
the annual awards dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, its highest honor, is presented to individuals who  
have demonstrated integrity, achieved success, and have carried the 
basic values taught in amateur sport into their professional life. 
</P>
<P>
	Past recipients of the award include former baseball great  
Jackie Robinson, President John Kennedy, and actor John Wayne.

<HEADLINE> Bin Laden Gives Mixed Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire  
accused of plotting bombing attacks on two American embassies in 
Africa, told one U.S. news magazine that he did not order the 
attacks and another that he did ``instigate'' them. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixed messages come from interviews released over the  
weekend that are to be published in the Jan. 11 issues of Newsweek 
and Time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden previously had denied involvement in the Aug. 7  
bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 
people, including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated that denial in the interview with Newsweek,  
conducted Dec. 22: ``I did not order them but was very glad for 
what happened to the Americans there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the next day, Dec. 23, he told Time's reporter that he did  
``instigate'' the attacks -- the closest he has come to admitting 
personal involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the instigation for jihad (holy war) against the Jews and  
the Americans ... is considered a crime, then let history be a 
witness that I am a criminal,'' bin Laden said. ``Our job is to 
instigate, and by the grace of God, we did that, and certain people 
responded to this instigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden is consistent on two subjects -- defending the  
acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and denying that he is 
ill, as some U.S. reports have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acquiring weapons for the defense of Muslims is a religious  
duty... And if I seek to acquire these weapons, I am carrying out a 
duty,'' he told Time. ``It would be a sin for Muslims not to try to 
possess the weapons that would prevent the infidels from inflicting 
harm on Muslims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Newsweek interview, he called it ``very strange'' that  
America and Israel could have such weapons, ``but if a Muslim state 
like Pakistan tries to defend itself... everything should be done 
to prevent it from doing so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interviews were conducted by Pakistani reporters who had  
received clandestine invitations to bin Laden's mountain base in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to reports that he is ill, bin Laden told Newsweek,  
``The Americans are committing another lie. I'm healthier now than 
at any time before.'' Time said bin Laden seemed ``eager to deny 
reports that he had cancer,'' but used no direct quotes. It noted 
that he walked with a stick because of a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States retaliated 13 days after the bombings with  
cruise missile raids on bin Laden's mountain encampment and on a 
plant in Khartoum, Sudan, that was suspected of making nerve gas 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has offered $5 million for bin Laden's  
capture. Time quoted aides as saying bin Laden relied solely on 
radio and newspapers for outside contact, and avoids using a 
portable satellite phone because the Americans might use the signal 
to target his location. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden told the magazines that two men arrested in East  
Africa and now in custody in the United States had nothing to do 
with the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Time that he knew one of them, Wadih El-Hage, but had  
not seen or heard from him in several years. He told Newsweek that 
the other, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-`Owhali, had been tortured into 
confessing and implicating bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I do know is that those who risked their lives to earn  
the pleasure of God are real men,'' Time quoted him as saying. ``We 
pray to God to end the plight (of the arrested men) and we are 
confident they will be exonerated.''

<HEADLINE> NBA on Brink of Losing Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Stern is finally back from his two-week  
stay in Aspen, Colo., and now he has to decide when to take one 
last shot at saving the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA players' union has called all 19 players on its  
negotiating committee, telling them to arrive in town by Tuesday 
morning. What remains to be seen is when -- or if -- the commissioner 
and the owners will agree to meet with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline is Thursday for reaching a new collective  
bargaining agreement to save the remainder of the season. If no 
deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with one 
ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
that day to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to negotiate. The league is refusing to  
negotiate,'' union director Billy Hunter said Sunday from his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern was scheduled back in his office this morning.  
</P>
<P>
	With less than four full days until the deadline, the biggest  
surprise today would be if Stern and Hunter failed to even speak on 
the telephone. As of Sunday evening, there had been no direct 
contact between them since New Year's Eve, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of the public asking me why we aren't meeting. Ask  
David that,'' Hunter said. ``He's been out in Aspen for two weeks. 
Where is his sense of urgency?'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been little, if any, communication between the sides  
since last Thursday when the union said it would not hand over its 
latest proposal because the league had refused to agree to a 
bargaining session. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has maintained that posture ever since, saying there  
is no need to meet since the owners made their final offer nine 
days ago and it was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players have been asking for a vote on the owners' final  
offer, but the union's negotiating committee -- the only body with 
the power to put a proposal to a vote -- says it will not put 
forward any offer that it does not deem worthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way a deal can be made is to get the people in the  
room, and they'll conclude that,'' union attorney Jeffrey Kessler 
said. ``I don't think the owners want to lose the season any more 
than the players do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have moved toward each other on virtually all of the  
most hotly contested issues, but differences worth tens of million 
of dollars per year remain unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
	If no agreement is reached, the NBA will have gone from being  
the only major U.S. sport to never have lost a game to a work 
stoppage to being the first sport to lose an entire season to a 
labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the first two months of the season have passed and the  
three months of the season have been wiped out. It would take 3-4 
weeks after a settlement was finalized to get ready to play a 45- 
to 50-game season. 
</P>
<P>
	The key sticking point to a settlement could center on how much  
revenue will be paid to the players over the course of the six-year 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the union wants 55 percent of revenue devoted  
to salaries in year 4, while owners have offered 53 percent In the 
fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners are offering 53.5. 
And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- the amount they 
received last season -- while the league is offering 54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Oil Companies Complete Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Pennzoil Co. and Quaker State Corp. have  
completed their merger, bringing together the two most popular 
brands of motor oil and fast oil-change operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger called for Houston-based Pennzoil to split off its  
motor oil, refined products and franchise operations into a 
separate, publicly traded company. That company then merged with 
Quaker State, based in Irving, Texas, to create the new business, 
Pennzoil-Quaker State Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger creates a company with annual sales of $3.2 billion  
and brings together the No. 1 and No. 2-selling brands of motor 
oil. It also combines the company's fast oil-change centers, Jiffy 
Lube and Q-Lube. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to generate savings of $90 million to  
$125 million annually. The new company will take initial 
restructuring charges and other one-time expenditures of $220 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennzoil Co., renamed PennzEnergy Co., will remain an  
independent oil exploration and production company.

<HEADLINE> Niners Coach Says He'll Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Trying to quiet rumors over his job  
security, San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci said Monday 
talks with club management over his stalled contract extension had 
resumed and he's confident a deal will be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we both know what we want,'' Mariucci said, without  
giving a specific timetable on when the deal could be completed. 
``It's a matter of getting it worked out. I'm committed to being 
here and the club has told me that they want me here long-term. 
It's a matter of getting it hammered out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the week leading up to San Francisco's 30-27 playoff victory  
Sunday over Green Bay, there had been rampant speculation that 
Mariucci was coaching for his job. 
</P>
<P>
	The rumors were fueled by the 49ers' ownership picture -- Eddie  
DeBartolo is still awaiting NFL clearance to resume control of the 
team -- and the failure of interim team president Larry Thrailkill 
to make public assurances regarding Mariucci's status. 
</P>
<P>
	Players have been rallying to Mariucci.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's handled all the things that have come to him and this  
disintegration that we've seen over the last couple years of our 
organization,'' said Steve Young, whose 25-yard touchdown pass to 
Terrell Owens with three seconds left snapped San Francisco's 
string of three straight playoff losses to the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair for him to be so excellent, facing the things  
he's had to face. If you think about it, it's 48 players, a few 
coaches and Steve Marriucci. As far as I'm concerned, his record 
kind of speaks for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The franchise already had been rocked by Carmen Policy's  
departure as team president in July and the subsequent resignation 
of Dwight Clark as general manager in late November to join Policy 
in working with the expansion Cleveland franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also talk that Bill Walsh, who coached San Francisco to  
its first three Super Bowls, could rejoin the organization and 
Mariucci has said that remains a distinct possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	But the stalled contract talks, after Thrailkill had promised to  
wrap up the deal by Dec. 1, left a distinct climate of uncertainty 
about Mariucci's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation mounted that perhaps DeBartolo wanted someone else  
to coach the team and that he was keen on bringing back Green Bay 
coach Mike Holmgren, a former San Francisco offensive coordinator 
who could be both coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no public comment from DeBartolo or his sister,  
Denise DeBartolo York, who assumed day-to-day control of the club 
13 months ago when her brother withdrew because of legal problems 
stemming from a gambling fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
	But now it appears Mariucci's status with the team has been  
solidified. Mariucci said Thrailkill gave his agent, Donald Yee, a 
new proposal last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said even though the deal's still not done, he viewed  
the latest offer as a vote of confidence after more than two weeks 
of management silence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told we were going to get this done,'' Mariucci said.  
``I know it's not a written contract, but my word means something 
and I know the club's word means something. Even though it's not 
done, I have faith that it will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mariucci said running back Garrison Hearst, whose  
sore right hamstring cramped near the end of Sunday's game, was 
feeling better Monday and was expected to be available for 
Saturday's divisional playoff at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said X-rays on Charles Haley's bruised hand were  
negative and he too was expected to be able to play against the 
Falcons.

<HEADLINE>  Cambodia King Willing To Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Stung by reminders in the press of  
his past support for the notorious Khmer Rouge, King Norodom 
Sihanouk reiterated today that he is willing to stand trial 
alongside the architects of Cambodia's genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement faxed from Beijing, where the ailing king is  
receiving medical treatment, Sihanouk said he would renounce his 
royal immunity from prosecution to allow a tribunal to judge 
whether he was involved in atrocities committed during the 
murderous rule of the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I've said and written several times, I am ready to appear  
in front of a tribunal in charge of judging the Khmer Rouge and 
their real or supposed accomplices,'' the king said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was responding to a local news report recalling that he was  
briefly head of state during the Khmer Rouge regime. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sihanouk was deposed from power by his army chief Lon Nol  
in a 1970 U.S.-backed coup, he lent his name and popularity to the 
Khmer Rouge forces that were battling Lon Nol's troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Sihanouk was named head of state after the Khmer Rouge seized  
power in 1975, but was locked in his palace by the communists as 
they embarked on their brutal attempt to create an agrarian utopia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Khmer Rouge forced a war-weakened population into  
agricultural collectives that were run like slave labor camps. One 
person in five perished from overwork, disease or execution, 
including 14 members of Sihanouk's royal family. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2 million ultimately died.  
</P>
<P>
	Sihanouk resigned in 1976, but the Khmer Rouge kept him under  
house arrest until they were driven from power by an invading 
Vietnamese army in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The defection to the government last week of two senior members  
of late Khmer Rouge chief Pol Pot's inner circle -- Khieu Samphan 
and Nuon Chea -- has strengthened calls for the aging guerrilla 
leadership to be tried for crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Hun Sen initially asked his country to ``bury the  
past'' and forget about a tribunal, but he renewed his support for 
a trial Friday, under mounting criticism for welcoming Khieu 
Samphan and Nuon Chea back into Cambodian society. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Sen, a low-level Khmer Rouge commander until 1977, has  
refused to arrest the pair until a warrant is issued by a court. 
Instead of showing the defectors to a holding cell, the prime 
minister has given them VIP treatment and a government-arranged 
tour of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	After visits to Phnom Penh, the seaside town of Sihanoukville  
and the ancient Angkor temple complex in Siem Reap, the two 
returned Sunday to the northwestern town of Pailin, the former 
rebel stronghold where they first emerged from hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of Cambodia's leaders, U.N. Secretary General  
Kofi Annan sent a trio of legal experts to Cambodia in November to 
review evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities and assess the 
possibility of bringing the group's senior leaders to justice.

<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Stung by reminders in the press of  
his past support for the notorious Khmer Rouge, King Norodom 
Sihanouk reiterated today that he is willing to stand trial 
alongside the architects of Cambodia's genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement faxed from Beijing, where the ailing king is  
receiving medical treatment, Sihanouk said he would renounce his 
royal immunity from prosecution to allow a tribunal to judge 
whether he was involved in atrocities committed during the 
murderous rule of the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I've said and written several times, I am ready to appear  
in front of a tribunal in charge of judging the Khmer Rouge and 
their real or supposed accomplices,'' the king said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was responding to a local news report recalling that he was  
briefly head of state during the Khmer Rouge regime. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sihanouk was deposed from power by his army chief Lon Nol  
in a 1970 U.S.-backed coup, he lent his name and popularity to the 
Khmer Rouge forces that were battling Lon Nol's troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Sihanouk was named head of state after the Khmer Rouge seized  
power in 1975, but was locked in his palace by the communists as 
they embarked on their brutal attempt to create an agrarian utopia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Khmer Rouge forced a war-weakened population into  
agricultural collectives that were run like slave labor camps. One 
person in five perished from overwork, disease or execution, 
including 14 members of Sihanouk's royal family. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2 million ultimately died.  
</P>
<P>
	Sihanouk resigned in 1976, but the Khmer Rouge kept him under  
house arrest until they were driven from power by an invading 
Vietnamese army in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The defection to the government last week of two senior members  
of late Khmer Rouge chief Pol Pot's inner circle -- Khieu Samphan 
and Nuon Chea -- has strengthened calls for the aging guerrilla 
leadership to be tried for crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Hun Sen initially asked his country to ``bury the  
past'' and forget about a tribunal, but he renewed his support for 
a trial Friday, under mounting criticism for welcoming Khieu 
Samphan and Nuon Chea back into Cambodian society. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Sen, a low-level Khmer Rouge commander until 1977, has  
refused to arrest the pair until a warrant is issued by a court. 
Instead of showing the defectors to a holding cell, the prime 
minister has given them VIP treatment and a government-arranged 
tour of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	After visits to Phnom Penh, the seaside town of Sihanoukville  
and the ancient Angkor temple complex in Siem Reap, the two 
returned Sunday to the northwestern town of Pailin, the former 
rebel stronghold where they first emerged from hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of Cambodia's leaders, U.N. Secretary General  
Kofi Annan sent a trio of legal experts to Cambodia in November to 
review evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities and assess the 
possibility of bringing the group's senior leaders to justice.

<HEADLINE> Peas Protect Pecan Trees From Bugs / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pecan growers can help protect their trees  
from damaging stink bugs by planting peas around their orchards, a 
new government study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The stink bugs will be lured to their favorite speckled purple  
hull peas and pig out on them instead of the moneymaking nut trees, 
the Agriculture Department's research service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stink bugs are the biggest pests to Mississippi pecan growers.  
They usually start out infesting soybean fields, then move to pecan 
trees and stay through the harvest season, the Agriculture Research 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent field study, the research service's entomologist  
Michael T. Smith found that damage to the nut trees from the bugs 
within the pea-protected areas was about 50 percent lower than in 
areas without the border crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like building a moat around a castle,'' Smith said. ``The  
bugs stop at the trap crop to dine and don't make it to the 
farmer's moneymaking crop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pea variety also offers an ongoing feast to the stink bugs  
because it produces pods throughout the season, the research 
service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stink bugs can cause two types of damage to pecan trees:  
so-called ``black pit'' and ``kernel spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black pit occurs when a stink bug, with its needlelike nose,  
pierces the nut and spews a chemical on the kernel, causing it to 
turn black and cease development. 
</P>
<P>
	Kernel spot occurs when stink bugs drill through the pecan's  
shell, ``spit'' on the kernel to make it soft and suck the meat 
out, leaving a black spot on the kernel. 
</P>

	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Three decades after he started growing cotton  
and peanuts in south Georgia, Billy Griggs is wondering if he can 
make it through another year like 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A wet winter, followed by a spring freeze and a summer drought,  
were bad enough. But the weather woes were compounded by dropping 
commodity prices and fallout from the tobacco lawsuits, and some 
Georgia farmers say 1998 was the worst year they can remember -- 
with no signs that things are getting better soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood is almost fear,'' said Griggs, an Unadilla farmer and  
chairman of the Georgia Peanut Commission. ``It's hard to see a 
bright spot anywhere down the tunnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although 1998 will go down as a benchmark for agricultural woes,  
the problems have been building for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the trend started with the GOP-backed 1996  
Freedom-to-Farm measure, which eliminated subsidies that had 
provided a safety net for growers since the 1930s. Subsidies were 
replaced by a free-market philosophy that relied on farmers to 
adjust the size of their crops to market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers started 1998 with soggy fields, brought on by excessive  
rain in the late fall and winter. They had to leave 10 percent of 
the cotton crop in the field because the ground was too muddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a spring freeze battered the peach, blueberry and  
strawberry crops. About $7 million worth of blueberries were lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Later a three-month drought and triple-digit heat decimated  
corn, cotton and soybeans. The University of Georgia Extension 
Service has estimated total 1998 crop losses at $767 million, 
mostly from the drought. 
</P>
<P>
	While farmers were struggling to keep their crops alive, a  
worldwide grain glut pushed commodity prices to their lowest levels 
in memory. The federal government predicted overall farm income 
would drop almost 16 percent in 1998 to $42 billion.

<HEADLINE> Strong Debut for European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe's new currency, the euro, made  
a strong debut today, trading at a high of $1.18 in a sign that 
markets welcomed the single currency as an alternative to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for the euro pushed it up from an expected starting point  
of $1.17 in earlier Asian trading, and it kept on rising as trading 
moved to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Political and banking officials in Europe were heartened by the  
smooth entry on international markets of the currency shared by 11 
European Union nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France and a former  
candidate for the post of European Central Bank chief, said trading 
represented ``the best possible omen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro has been greeted well,'' he said. ``This isn't just  
an absurd craze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said the euro offered  
``friendly'' competition for established currencies and would 
strengthen Europe's profile in international financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn focused on the  
unity created by the euro, saying it would help boost growth and 
cut unemployment in Europe. ``When everybody pushes in the same 
direction, everybody goes quicker,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Notwithstanding the positive market and political reactions,  
euro skeptics made their mark, throwing two pies at Dutch Finance 
Minister Gerrit Zalm as he arrived at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro trading opened today in Sydney, Australia, and proceeded  
smoothly, if quietly, throughout Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was officially launched Jan. 1, when authorities fixed  
conversion rates against the 11 participating European currencies. 
While the euro will not be in consumers' pockets until 2002, it now 
can be used for non-cash, credit card or traveler's check 
purchases. Many major firms are converting their transactions to 
euros, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, trading was limited today as many investors awaited  
developments in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen a lot of inquiries coming in regard to the euro,  
but not a tremendous amount of activity,'' said Peter Chen, 
director of sales for Southeast Asia and North Asia at Deutsche 
Bank in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise in Europe, bankers and traders said they were still  
testing the euro's strength. ``So far it seems market participants 
are trying to get a feel of the proper level,'' said Antti Heinonen 
of Finland's Okobank. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the early caution, the euro's start was stronger than  
many traders had anticipated, and London analyst Cameron Crise said 
he wouldn't be surprised to see the new European currency reach 
$1.20 this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest was expected to remain strong given the European  
Union's economic muscle, which rivals that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the No. 1 candidate for a global key currency, vying with  
the dollar,'' said Minoru Kobayashi, manager of foreign bonds 
investment division at Asahi Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt -- the euro's home, with the European Central bank  
headquartered here -- European Union currency commissioner 
Yves-Thibault de Silguy pressed a button with German Stock Exchange 
officials to begin trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Screens lining the exchange's walls rolled back to reveal rows  
of company names with their share values in euros listed next to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten minutes later, one trader said orders were coming in slowly  
but attributed the sluggish pace to the fact that markets were just 
reopening after the holiday break. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key step toward closer European financial integration  
took place today when the rival London and Frankfurt stock 
exchanges began using computers to monitor one another's trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Boerse executive board member, Reto Francioni, said the  
two exchanges would release details of plans to create an 
Anglo-German market in the coming weeks. The market is considered 
by some to be an interim step toward an expected pan-European stock 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement on the pan-European exchange is likely to be  
made in the coming weeks, Deutsche Boerse chairman Werner Seifert 
told the German daily newspaper Handelsblatt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had a better chance to form a pan-European trading  
platform, even a pan-European stock exchange,'' Werner Seifert was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 nations adopting the euro are Austria, Belgium, Germany,  
Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, 
Spain. Sweden, Denmark and Britain opted to stay out for now; 
Greece did not qualify.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Police Shooting Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Hundreds marched on police headquarters  
Monday to protest the police shooting of a black teen-ager shot 12 
times while sitting in a car with a flat tire. Relatives of the 
young woman demanded a federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The roughly 300 demonstrators included leaders from local civil  
rights groups. Protesters carried signs with photos of the dead 
teen, Tyisha Miller, 19. A banner read: ``Stop police brutality'' 
and a sign proclaimed: ``they murdered innocent teen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests were made.  
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager was killed Dec. 28. A preliminary coroner's report  
said she was shot 12 times, dying from head and chest wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers called to the scene by relatives at about 2 a.m. said  
they found her sitting in the car at a gas station parking lot, a 
gun in her lap. The car had a flat tire. Its doors were locked, the 
windows rolled up and the engine was running. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said she didn't respond until officers broke a window to  
get her gun. She was shot when she grabbed the weapon, according to 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives, who filed a lawsuit Monday demanding a federal  
investigation, claim she was unconscious when she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that, if Tyisha Miller would have been a  
little white girl, she would have been murdered,'' said protester 
Billy Mohammad of neighboring Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities declined to disclose the number of shots fired or  
the number of officers who fired them. 
</P>
<P>
	Four officers -- three white and one Hispanic -- and a white  
sergeant who were at the scene have been placed on paid leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Jerry Carroll met with black community leaders  
after the shooting and promised a full investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI will conduct a preliminary investigation into whether  
Ms. Miller's civil rights were violated, said Thom Mrozek, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. The 
preliminary investigation will determine whether a full 
investigation is warranted, 
</P>
<P>
	Riverside is about 60 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Higher; Dow Up 149 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were broadly higher at midday on the  
first day of trading in 1999 as investors, celebrating last year's 
gains, poured cash from yearend bonuses and other sources into the 
market . 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
149.33 at 9,330.76, only 43.51 points away from its record closing 
high at 9,374.27 last Nov. 23. The blue-chip index finished 1998 
with a gain of 16.1 percent -- the fourth straight year that it rose 
15 percent or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indexes, in which technology stocks are heavily  
represented, were higher as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bull market continues,'' said Charles H. Blood Jr., senior  
financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks continued last month's blockbuster performance  
after Merrill Lynch raised its forecasts for the prices of nine 
companies. Dow component IBM was up 1 3/8 at 185 3/4, while Dow component 
Hewlett-Packard was up 1 7/16 at 69 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online shares were down 3 3/8 at 151 3/4 in leading volume on  
the New York Stock Exchange. But traders said that was because of a 
last-minute surge to 160 on Thursday. The stock was added Friday 
bto the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors brushed off a new report showing a slowing economy.  
The National Association of Purchasing Management said 
manufacturing activity slowed in December for the seventh straight 
month, declining at a faster rate than economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM's monthly index of business activity fell to 45.1  
percent last month, down from 46.8 percent in November. Any reading 
under 50 percent is a sign of contraction in the industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 258 million shares, 
up sharply from Thursday's early pace.

	U.S. financial markets were closed Friday for the New Year  
holiday.

	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The euro wasn't the only thing  
launched today at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Protesters hurled 
two pies, scoring direct hits on the Dutch finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	One protester struck Gerrit Zalm a glancing blow with the first  
pie, spilling what appeared to be custard down his dark suit. As 
Zalm brushed off the mess, another protester pushed a second pie

</P>
<P>
	A furious-looking Zalm was led from the protest by his aides  
while security staff bundled the protesters away. Police arrived 
shortly afterwards, apparently to arrest the pie throwers, who 
chanted slogans against the new European currency.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Iron Eyes Cody, the ``Crying Indian'' whose  
tearful face in 1970s television commercials became a powerful 
symbol of the anti-littering campaign, died Monday. He was in his 
80s or early 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody, whose acting credits date back to silent movies and  
include dozens of films and television shows, was best known for 
the ads from the group Keep America Beautiful that showed him 
shedding a single tear as he watched people litter. 
</P>
<P>
	His exact date of birth wasn't known. Reference books give  
various dates, from 1904 to 1915. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody followed his Cherokee Indian father, Thomas Long Plume, as  
a performer in circuses and Wild West shows and made his first film 
appearance as an extra in the 1919 silent ``Back to God's 
Country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody went on to appear in more than 80 films in Indian roles;  
often his character was listed as simply ``Indian,'' ``Indian 
Chief'' or ``Indian Joe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His other credits included ``Sitting Bull'' in 1954, ``The Great  
Sioux Massacre'' in 1965, ``Nevada Smith'' in 1966, ``A Man Called 
Horse'' in 1970 and ``Ernest Goes to Camp'' in 1987. He also served 
as a technical adviser on Native American matters in films. 
</P>
<P>
	In television, he had guest appearances on ``Bonanza,''  
``Gunsmoke'' and ``Rawhide.''

Post, ex-managing editor of the Valdosta Daily Times and a former 
publisher of newspapers in Mississippi and Kentucky, died Sunday of 
a heart attack. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Devane worked at The Times from 1969 to 1982. He was publisher  
of the Laurel (Miss.) Leader-Call from 1982 to 1986 and publisher 
of the Corbin (Ky.) Times-Tribune from 1986 until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He then worked in marketing and advertising before taking the  
helm of the Mailbox Post in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Devane and a friend started the Valdosta Magazine. He

died Saturday, the ANSA news agency reported. He was 79.

<P>
	Gozzini was the author of a 1986 prison reform bill. Under his  
reforms, prisoners are allowed a partial freedom, including long 
furloughs. While many praise the measure as humane, critics have 
noted that several high-profile inmates, including some accused of 
terrorism, have used the furloughs to escape.

newspapers, died Saturday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	He started a journalism career while studying law, writing for  
Berlin newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938, during the Nazi era, he left Germany for London with  
his Jewish bride. There he wrote ``Germany: Jekyll and Hyde,'' 
which he called his ``first really political book,'' an attempt to 
explain Germany to the British. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Raimund Pretzel, he adopted the pseudonym Sebastian Haffner  
after he began to write for the London Sunday newspaper The 
Observer to shield his family in Germany from retribution by the 
Nazis for his writing. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Berlin in 1954 as a correspondent for The  
Observer, and began to write often controversial commentaries for 
German newspapers and magazines, including Die Welt and Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his books were a well-received biography of Winston  
Churchill in 1967 and the critical essay ``Comments to Hitler,'' a 
German bestseller in 1978. His last book was ``From Bismarck to 
Hitler'' in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Haffner is survived by his wife, a daughter and a son.

before joining The News &AMP; Observer in November 1969.

</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Yaeko Nakamura, a woman adored as Japan's ``Mother  
Teresa'' for her dedication to orphans and the elderly, died 
Saturday. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakamura, joined by her husband Haruka, began her activities for  
the disadvantaged in 1931 by caring for the children of fishermen 
and others making their living on the waterfront near Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
	After their headquarters was destroyed during U.S. bombing raids  
in World War II, the Nakamuras moved to a northeastern suburb of 
the city and established several new facilities for war orphans, 
the homeless and children whose parents had been killed in traffic 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, about 3,000 children have received care at welfare  
homes operated by the Nakamuras, according to Masaharu Hojo, the 
head of one of the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government awarded Yaeko Nakamura the Order of the  
Sacred Treasure in 1969 for her contributions to society.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marshall Perlin, a civil-liberties lawyer who  
worked on the Rosenberg atomic bomb spy case, died Thursday. He was 
79. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlin represented the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and  
Morton Sobell, the Rosenbergs' co-defendant. The Rosenbergs were 
electrocuted in 1953 after their conviction on charges of plotting 
to deliver atomic bomb secrets to the Soviet Union. Sobell spent 
nearly 19 years in prison before his parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlin, who entered the case after the sentencing, argued court  
motions that resulted in hundreds of thousands of pages of 
Rosenberg documents being publicly released. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosenbergs' children, Robert and Michael Meeropol, had asked  
Perlin to reopen the case and prove that their parents had been 
framed. Perlin challenged the CIA, the FBI and the Justice 
Department to release classified papers under the Freedom of 
Information Act.

<HEADLINE> Senate Faces Impeachment Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY JIM ABRAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress convenes this week with Senate  
leaders still looking for a middle-ground approach that ends 
President Clinton's impeachment trial quickly while satisfying 
conservatives' demands for full presentation of his alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 106th Congress goes into session Wednesday and senators will  
immediately huddle to consider a plan that could end the 
impeachment process within four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans will meet Thursday, and ``my assumption is  
that this will be the sole topic of the conversation,'' Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a bipartisan proposal by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the House ``managers,'' or prosecutors, 
would present their case on Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's defense team would have the next day to rebut;  
questions and answers would occupy the third day and senators would 
vote on the fourth day whether the House's accusations of perjury 
and obstruction of justice against the president, even if true, 
warranted removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	If, as expected, a two-thirds majority is not reached, the  
Senate could then, with a simple majority vote, adjourn the trial 
and consider a censure resolution against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told Time magazine  
that the Gorton-Lieberman plan was a ``fair start'' but that the 
situation was fluid and ``it could be blown away by any number of 
people or events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott is under strong pressure from House Republicans and fellow  
conservatives to allow a full trial, including the calling of 
witnesses. Whatever is done, he said, he would be ``bashed by the 
left'' or ``criticized by people on the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP concern is that with a lengthy trial, Republicans will  
be characterized as more interested in punishing the president than 
attending to the nation's business. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties said Clinton should postpone his  
scheduled Jan. 19 State of the Union address if the trial is still 
going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be unseemly and distracting for the president  
to be giving a of the Union address to Congress while he was under 
trial in the Senate,'' Gorton said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., appearing with Gorton, agreed.  
``It's inappropriate to report on the State of the Union as long as 
the president is under impeachment, because the State of the Union 
from the perspective of his administration is unclear,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House today, press secretary Joe Lockhart said the  
president planned to deliver the State of the Union address as 
scheduled, but he did not rule out a change. ``We're planning to 
give that on Jan. 19,'' Lockhart said. ``I'm not aware of any 
discussions or requests from the leadership to adjust that date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, noted that it was not until the era of  
television that the president began to appear personally before 
Congress to outline his legislative goals for the year. Clinton 
could revert to the old practice of submitting his speech in 
writing, Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats made clear they would oppose any plan to conduct  
regular business while the trial was under way. ``How can you have 
a trial impeaching the president of the United States and then, in 
the afternoon or in the morning say, `Oh, we're going to do 
Medicare,' or `Let's now do Social Security,''' Sen. John Breaux, 
D-La., said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Momentum for a quick trial has grown with recognition, even  
among Republicans critical of Clinton, that they do not have close 
to the two-thirds majority needed to remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody believes that it is unlikely at this point  
that two-thirds of the Senate would vote to remove the president 
from office,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers -- GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee  
who would act as prosecutors in the Senate trial -- insisted they 
could carry out a full trial, including the calling of witnesses, 
and still finish in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican who has come out against removing Clinton from  
office, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said nonetheless the 
president should be one of the few witnesses summoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the context here where the president is really asking the  
Senate to ... leave him in office ... we are entitled to hear from 
him in a very sensible, straightforward way,'' he said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told CNN's ``Late Edition'' that  
``when you are having a trial to convict somebody, you don't start 
out by saying they better come and testify.''

<HEADLINE> Del. Lawyer Removed From Courtroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A lawyer who admits to dumping his  
mistress' body at sea and lying about her death lashed out at 
prosecutors Monday and was ordered to leave the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Capano accused federal authorities of ``tormenting'' his  
family while trying to find Anne Marie Fahey's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	When Assistant U.S. Attorney Colm Connolly suggested Capano  
tried to use his daughters to protect himself from a murder charge, 
Capano hissed: ``You heartless, gutless, soulless disgrace for a 
human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge William Swain Lee immediately ordered  
bailiffs to take Capano from the courtroom and recessed the trial 
for the day. Capano shouted ``liar'' at Connolly as he was led out. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly's cross-examination was to continue Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, is a one-time state deputy attorney general and a  
member of one of Wilmington's most influential families. 
Prosecutors say he killed Ms. Fahey, the governor's scheduling 
secretary, and dumped her body in June 1996, because she wanted to 
end their secret affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant claims another mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, found  
him and Ms. Fahey together at his home and accidentally shot her. 
He says he put her body in a cooler and dumped it at sea to protect 
himself and Ms. MacIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre denies even being at Capano's house that night.  
</P>
<P>
	For months after Ms. Fahey disappeared, Capano maintained he  
took her home after dinner and never saw her again. He testified 
Monday that he came forward with his story of the accidental 
shooting because the federal government became involved in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after Ms. Fahey disappeared, President Clinton called Gov.  
Thomas Carper to offer his condolences and any assistance. Carper 
accepted the offer, and a federal investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president of the United States gets involved and I'm  
diving as deep as I can,'' Capano testified. ``Look at what 
happened afterward. Look what you've done. I knew I couldn't trust 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capano suggested that when federal agents raided his brother's  
house in October 1997, they ``set him up'' on a cocaine charge. 
Gerard Capano became a prosecution witness, testifying that he 
helped his brother get rid of a body from his boat.

<HEADLINE> Weekend Blizzard Boosts Grain / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures rose in early trading  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with prices bolstered by the 
weekend blizzard that dumped up to two feet of snow on parts of the 
Midwest. 
</P>

of perceptions the market is oversold. Soybean futures also got a 
lift from a slowdown in bean movement to markets in the wake of the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow blanketed much of the winter wheat crop growing area,  
giving a boost to wheat futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices also rose, getting a minor boost from the  
weather and increased export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery was 2 1/2 cents higher at $2.78 3/4 a bushel;  
March corn was 1 3/4 cents higher at $2.15 1/4 a bushel; March oats were 
2 1/2 cents higher at $1.08 a bushel; January soybeans were 5 1/4 cents 
higher at $5.43 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures prices were higher and pork futures prices were  
mixed in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were .08 cent higher at 60.60 cents a  
pound; January feeder cattle were .08 cent higher at 69.25 cents a 
pound; January lean hogs were .18 cent lower at 32.47 cents a

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed billions of  
dollars in new help for the long-term disabled and the family 
caregivers who support them, including a $1,000 tax credit for some 
2 million American families struggling to tend to relatives. The 
tax credit, meant to compensate caregivers for such expenses as 
adult day care, respite care and reduced work hours, is part of a

consumers can find a wide variety of powerful computers with lots

	``The start, I think, has surprised everybody,'' Ellis said. ``I  
thought we'd be pretty good, but I didn't expect us to come out 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not many people did. The Tigers started the season unranked but  
have vaulted to No. 14 in the latest poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heck, we ought to be 13,'' Ellis joked. ``But I don't pay much  
attention to it, it's just something for the fans to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the fans are finally looking. The Tigers had their first  
sellout of the season last Saturday and responded with a 90-62 rout 
of Tennessee. Only a few tickets remain for Wednesday's SEC West 
showdown against No. 19 Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are all excited over there and it seems like basketball  
has finally become a game there instead of just football,'' 
Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson said. ``We're in for a challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A challenge is something Auburn has so far gone without this  
season. The Tigers are beating opponents by a whopping 29.2 points 
per game, tops in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking down their numbers and I see they are just killing  
everyone, so I'm just hoping like hell we can be within 29,'' 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Tigers are not without there critics. A soft  
non-conference schedule that included teams like Wofford, 
UNC-Asheville and Bethune-Cookman had some wondering what would 
happen when the Tigers are tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Jerry Green was among the critics. But after  
watching Auburn manhandle his Volunteers on Saturday, he's now a 
believer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Auburn continues to play like they did, they're going to  
make their presence known not only within our league, but 
nationally as well,'' Green said. ``They seem to have every piece 
of ammunition you need to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Ellis' arrival five seasons ago, the Tigers always  
seemed to be at least one weapon short. Auburn had only one winning 
season in the six years before Ellis and hasn't been to the NCAA 
tournament since the 1987-88 season, the longest drought of any SEC 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of junior college transfer Chris Porter this season,  
things have finally come together. An explosive and flashy crowd 
favorite, Porter is leading the Tigers with 15.8 points and 8.3 
rebounds while shooting 51 percent from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew they were going to be a team to contend with before the  
season,'' Richardson said. ``You could see the talent and then they 
added the Porter kid, and he's a first-rounder. When you add a guy 
like that in the mix and you were already pretty good ... look 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter has so far been the missing weapon and the added  
attraction for Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans calling themselves the ``Cliff Dwellers'' cram the student  
section hours before tipoff to get a good look at everything from 
Porter's thundering slam dunks and behind-the-back passes to his 
hair style -- he's shown up in anything from braids to a '70s-style 
afro. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cliff Dwellers are always commenting on my hair,'' Porter  
said. ``When I have my braids, they say it's tight or they like it 
like that. And some of them like the 'fro. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's a dream of players everywhere to go before a sold-out  
gym every game, so I'm just glad to see fans excited about us.''

<HEADLINE> Terrapins Take Tumble on Duke Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Maryland's devastating loss to Duke  
caused the Terrapins to take a tumble in both the conference 
standings and the latest Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the immediate impact. Coach Gary Williams must now make  
sure the humbling 82-64 defeat Sunday doesn't have a lasting effect 
on a team that still has the potential to enjoy unprecedented 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	The tangible damage caused by the loss to the second-ranked Blue  
Devils was minimal -- the Terrapins dropped from No. 4 to 5 in the 
poll released Monday and lost a share of first place in the 
Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	There still are nearly two months left in the regular season, so  
a slight drop in the rankings or standings is not a big deal. But 
the Terrapins (13-2, 1-1) know they must tighten up on defense and 
improve their halfcourt attack to become a serious threat to earn a 
berth in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Duke, Maryland committed eight turnovers and missed nine  
of 10 shots during a critical eight-minute stretch of the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played well and we didn't. I don't know how they did it  
to us, but they did it again,'' said Laron Profit, who scored only 
eight points on 3-for-12 shooting in absorbing his sixth loss in 
eight games against Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say I'm more frustrated than disappointed at the way we  
played as a team. We didn't play the way Maryland should be 
playing,'' said guard Steve Francis, who scored only one point 
after halftime and finished 3-for-14 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins certainly didn't perform the way they did over the  
first two months of the season, when they averaged 90 points per 
game on 52 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland shot only 37 percent against Duke, and by midway  
through the second half the outcome was not in doubt. The only 
question now is: Can the Terrapins recover from such a deflating 
defeat at home? 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be all right,'' Williams said. ``We can't let this  
disappointment affect our next game. It's time to be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland tries to get back on track Thursday at Virginia. Then  
comes a home game Sunday against North Carolina State, followed by 
a trip to North Carolina Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Duke, Maryland's halfcourt offense was ineffective after  
the Blue Devils made a concentrated effort to choke the Terrapins' 
lethal transition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to learn how to play when teams get in our passing  
lanes and we can't run our offense,'' center Obinna Ekezie said. 
``We have to make adjustments. We didn't do that against Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier in the season there were some good things said about  
our team,'' Williams said. ``Now there will probably be some things 
said that we won't like. But you have to use it to your benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins still have two months to iron out the flaws. Then  
in March they will attempt to go where no Maryland team has yet 
ventured -- the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Maryland to be a great program,'' Williams said. ``We  
are close.''

<HEADLINE> How Does Internet Impact Language? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Have you been LOL lately?  
</P>
<P>
	No? You must not be Internet savvy. But beware: The expression --  
which means ``laughing out loud'' -- could creep into non-Net 
communication before long. 
</P>
<P>
	How the computer revolution is changing and evolving language  
was among the topics discussed at the recent annual meeting of the 
Modern Language Association. 
</P>
<P>
	One researcher looked at the evolution of an early discussion  
list on the Arpanet, the predecessor of the Internet. The 
discussion list was much like the Internet news groups of today, 
with messages passed among members by computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan C. Herring of the University of Texas, Arlington, said she  
was surprised by many of her findings, mainly that computer 
correspondence did not lead to reduced sentence complexity, poor 
grammar or an abundance of typos. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should reassure parents who think their children's  
grammar will suffer because of the Internet,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, contrary to popular belief, computer correspondence did not  
appear to lead to a homogenous style among users. Instead, writers 
tended to cultivate their own style, perhaps to compensate for the 
impersonal nature of computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Herring also found that computer correspondence tended to become  
less formal, and in fact, less polite, than other communication. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at the archived messages of about 100 computer  
science professionals in the discussion group from 1975 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet provides an interesting laboratory for examining  
language changes, Herring said, noting how computer talk is 
crawling into general use. Take the ``smiley,'' the combination 
colon and end parenthesis that indicate a happy face in Net-speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smiley faces have been around for a long time, where they were  
right side up,'' she said. ``The Internet turned them sideways. Now 
I see more and more people putting them in letters and notes that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers looked at the more subtle ways the World Wide  
Web impacted language. Lisa Gerrard of the University of California 
at Los Angeles examined nearly 200 Web sites created by women, with 
a primary audience of women. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the sites challenged traditional stereotypes -- or tried  
to tweak them. For example, she noted, references to ``chicks'' and 
``bimbos'' were used in an empowering way. A search of the Web 
shows such women's sites as www.brazenhussy.com, www.chickclick.com 
and www.riotgrrl.com 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Rivers of Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, spoke on  
the use of French on the Internet -- or the lack of it. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't a French search engine on the World Wide Web until  
February 1996, Rivers said. Today, only 2 percent of what is 
available on the Internet is in French. Most of what's on the Net 
is in English. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers said the lack of diverse languages on the Web posed the  
question: If a language isn't a part of the Internet, can it 
survive? 
</P>
<P>
	``The very fact that we're not positive on the matter is  
frightening in itself,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Show Unveils Chevy Sedan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Chevrolet reached way back into its past,  
bringing back the late Dinah Shore and her '50s-era Chevy jingle, 
to introduce the latest version of its Impala family sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Impala was unveiled Monday at a media preview of the  
North American International Auto Show. With a nostalgic look at 
the time when Impala ruled the American road, GM said the new 
version was designed to evoke that era while luring younger buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's is going to redefine the market,'' Chevrolet  
marketing general manager Kurt Ritter said. ``It's going to create 
a whole new segment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first Impala was introduced in 1958. By 1965, Chevrolet was  
selling 1.1 million a year, making it the most popular car of the 
time. But the gasoline crises of the '70s and the rise of minivans 
and sport utility vehicles drew many buyers from large sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Impala's unveiling included a video that used special  
effects to show Ritter with Dinah Shore on ``The Dinah Shore Chevy 
Show.'' Ms. Shore used to end the television show by singing the 
jingle, ``See the U.S.A. in a Chevrolet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Impala is a front-drive, six-passenger sedan that comes  
with a V6 engine and an automatic transmission. It will be built at 
the Canadian plant where Chevy builds its Lumina midsize sedan, 
which is smaller than the Impala. The Lumina will remain in 
production for now, but the Impala eventually will replace it. 
</P>
<P>
	Features include traction control, a tire pressure warning  
system and enough back-seat space for three child seats. The Impala 
is expected to sell for about $20,000 when it goes on sale next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevy stylists also tried to evoke the past with details like  
big, round taillights. John Cafaro, chief exterior designer for 
Chevrolet, said the car carried many styling cues that will show up 
in future Chevys. 
</P>
<P>
	Other vehicles introduced Monday included:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A souped-up version of Volkswagen's New Beetle and a  
musclebound Beetle concept car. Beetles with a new 1.8-liter 
turbocharged engine that makes 150 horsepower will go on sale next 
summer for $19,000. The concept Beetle features a ``whale-tail'' 
rear spoiler and a twin-turbo V6. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Four-door versions of the Dodge Dakota and Ford F-150 pickups.  
Dodge said the new Dakota Quad Cab offers an expanded cab capable 
of accommodating three adults in a rear seat. It will be launched 
in October as a 2000 model. Ford said its new F-150 Crew Cab will 
seat six adults and will go on sale early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Mercedes-Benz 2000 S-Class sedan, which goes on sale in  
North America next spring. The big four-door, introduced in Europe 
last year, will come with a choice of two V8 engines and will cost 
about $70,000. The company also showed off a high-performance 
concept version of its M-Class sport utility vehicle with a 
340-horsepower V8.

<HEADLINE> Browns To Interview Art Shell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Another name was added to the list of coaches  
who'll be interviewed for the head job with the Cleveland Browns, 
and this one hadn't popped up before. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Shell, the first black NFL head coach in the modern era and  
current offensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons, is expected 
to meet with Browns President Carmen Policy next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy received permission from Falcons coach Dan Reeves to  
interview Shell last week, and the Browns had hoped to bring Shell 
in for a formal interview on Monday. However, details for a visit 
couldn't be finalized over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've told Art that we want to talk to him and hopefully we'll  
be able to do that soon, as early as next Sunday,'' said Browns 
spokesman Alex Martins. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFC West champion Falcons were idle from the playoffs last  
weekend and will play host to the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday 
at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the NFL, Cleveland, which will return to  
the league next year as an expansion team after a three-year 
hiatus, has been granted exclusive permission by the NFL to 
interview assistant coaches on teams that are in this year's 
playoffs. The Browns, though, are prohibited from offering any of 
those coaches a job until their team has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't talk to Art about it this morning other than to ask  
if they (the Browns) got a hold of him,'' Atlanta general manager 
Harold Richardson said. ``He said, 'Yes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, 52, will be the third coaching candidate interviewed by  
the Browns. Last week, Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian 
Billick and Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak had extensive 
interviews with Policy at the Browns' headquarters in Berea. 
</P>
<P>
	Martins said that no other interviews had been scheduled by the  
Browns for this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, a Hall of Fame offensive tackle with Oakland, became the  
Raiders head coach four games into the 1989 season when Mike 
Shanahan was fired. Shell spent five years with Raiders, leading 
them to three playoff appearances and a 56-41 record before being 
fired after the '94 season. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Shell has rarely been mentioned as a candidate for any  
head coaching job recently despite there still being six vacancies 
around the league. 
</P>
<P>
	After five coaches were fired last Monday, Tampa Bay coach Tony  
Dungy, who is also black, questioned why it is that black coaches 
continue to be overlooked for head coaching positions. The last 17 
head coaches hired since Dungy went to the Buccaneers after the 
1995 season all are white. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's baffling,'' Dungy said. ``There still seems to be a  
perception out there clouding owners' minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said last week he planned to speak with Ray Rhodes, a  
black coach fired by Philadelphia recently, about Rhodes' football 
future but that the discussion would be personal rather than 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never, ever discount Ray Rhodes relative to the coaching  
ranks based upon the level of his talents,'' said Policy, who was 
unavailable for comment Monday. ``But this is something Ray has to 
think out and deal with himself in terms of whether he wants to be 
in a head coaching job this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Browns are awaiting news on two other fronts.  
</P>
<P>
	Following his team's playoff loss in San Francisco on Sunday,  
Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren wouldn't comment on his future with 
the Packers. There is speculation that Holmgren could return to San 
Francisco, freeing 49ers coach Steve Mariucci to rejoin Policy with 
the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were also eager to see which college underclassmen  
would declare themselves eligible for April's NFL Draft by Friday's 
deadline. Cleveland owns the first overall pick and is likely to 
select either Texas running back Ricky Williams or Kentucky 
quarterback Tim Couch, a junior who has a year of eligibility 
remaining.

<HEADLINE> No Fiesta for Tallahassee Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- They were celebrating a national  
championship Tuesday morning on the streets in Tennessee, but not a 
shred of confetti could be found on Tennessee Street near the 
Florida State campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of fans packed into Tallahassee sports bars to watch  
the Fiesta Bowl, and most of them went home disappointed. Tennessee 
upset the No. 2 Seminoles 23-16 Monday night to earn the college 
football title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to sleep for four days after this one,''  
said Freddie Tennell, one of Florida State's loudest rooters at 
BW-3 Grill and Bar. ``It's going to take me that long to get over 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Seminoles fans felt the same way.  
</P>
<P>
	``I almost got arrested I was so mad,'' said Noell Barnidge, a  
27-year-old FSU alumnus. ``The cop said, `I know you're 
disappointed, but you can't throw your hat.''' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his friends, 23-year-old Heather Ford, was ready to move  
on to next year, and to another hangout spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could we go to Denny's?'' said Ford, a Florida State graduate  
student. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Seminoles never led in the game, crowds in  
jam-packed sports bars remained optimistic until defeat seemed 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bummed out,'' said Matt Olesen, a 24-year-old graduate  
student who had his head in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Olesen noted the similarity of his name to FSU quarterback  
Marcus Outzen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder if I could have done a little better,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Disappointment in the Seminoles' performance also put a damper  
on a party at the home of FSU graduate student Dave Pittman and his 
wife, Sharyn. The guests began leaving by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody just decided to go home to watch the rest of it,''  
said a disgusted Dave Pittman. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss also meant Tallahassee police didn't have to put into  
operation a plan to handle the celebration, which included closing 
down a lane of Tennessee Street. In fact, Lt. Ken Bergstrom said he 
didn't know of any arrests associated with parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``In past years we've had some problems when we beat big  
teams,'' he said. But over the years, FSU has played so many large 
ballgames, we don't have near the problems we had 10 or 12 years 
ago.''

<HEADLINE> Woodson Wins Defensive Rookie Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From Heisman Trophy to Defensive Rookie of the Year. Not a bad  
parlay for Charles Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland Raiders cornerback won a close race with Green Bay  
defensive end Vonnie Holliday in balloting by The Associated Press, 
announced today. Woodson, the fourth overall choice in the 1998 
draft, received 24 votes from the nationwide panel of 47 sports 
writers and broadcasters. Holliday, selected 19th overall, received 
22, and Arizona end Andre Wadsworth, the third pick last April, got 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson, the first primarily defensive player to win the  
Heisman, was a starter from the first day of training camp for the 
Raiders. His tight coverage and sure tackling helped turn around 
Oakland's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd give myself a B-minus,'' Woodson said. ``I played pretty  
good, but I didn't do a lot of the little things I could have done, 
as far as watching more film, doing a lot more studying. I pretty 
much played off athletic ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ability helped Woodson get a team-high five interceptions,  
tied with veteran Eric Allen; he ran one 46 yards for a touchdown. 
He did not return kickoffs or punts, as he did at Michigan, and did 
not take a snap on offense, which irked Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it known I wanted to play offense and it never  
happened,'' he said. ``I like being out there on the field. I don't 
like to come off. When I'm on the sideline, I kind of feel 
helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jon Gruden has promised Woodson will be used offensively  
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can give either phase of your football team a jolt,''  
Gruden said. ``When he gets his hands on the ball, he knows where 
to go and how to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holliday, who played at North Carolina, also became an immediate  
starter with the Packers. Under the tutelage of star end Reggie 
White, Holliday flourished quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	He had eight sacks when he broke his right leg near the ankle on  
Nov. 22 at Minnesota and missed the last five games. That might 
have cost him the rookie award. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd always be out there,'' Holliday said. ``Almost  
to the point where I felt I was invincible, things were going so 
well, and you know I felt I had a great chance to break the rookie 
sacks record and I guess be more of an impact player my rookie 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White has advised Holliday not to get too frustrated over the  
missed time, and to look to the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid's going to be great. I'm glad I came back this year  
and got a chance to work with him,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell him what you think he needs to work on and he  
just does it,'' added All-Pro safety LeRoy Butler. ``Usually 
first-round picks think they know it all, i.e. Terrell Buckley, you 
know? This guy here says, well what do I need to work on?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson is the first Raider to win the award. Last year's winner  
was Baltimore linebacker Peter Boulware.

<HEADLINE> Green, White Remain Top Car Colors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Green and white remained the most popular colors  
of new cars and trucks in 1998, but variations of beige, gold, 
brown and blue gained ground, according to an annual survey. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont Automotive, a leading supplier of automotive paints, said  
green has peaked in popularity in North America but still ranks as 
the top color for sports cars, compacts, midsize and full-size 
cars. It ranks second for light trucks after white. 
</P>
<P>
	The company tracks color choices to help it predict trends four  
to six years in advance of automotive production. Robert S. Daily, 
color styling and marketing manager for DuPont, predicted consumers 
will increasingly opt for softer golds and ambers, lighter greens 
and browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we're seeing a shift in consumer interest in natural  
and earth tones to colors such as copper and warm brown,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Early Y2K Glitches Appear Unfounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Worries that the first few days of the new year  
would bring computer problems similar to those expected when the 
dreaded Y2K bug hits appear to be mostly unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
	There were concerns that computers looking a year ahead could  
crash or that the ``99'' in ``1999'' would signal programs to cease 
calculating. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the worriers were proven wrong and computers  
operated smoothly Friday and Monday. But the few glitches that did 
pop up were a sign that a year from now thing could get tricky. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In Singapore, computerized taxi meters went dead at noon Jan.  
1 for about two hours, according to The Sunday Times; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Two medical products, a Hewlett-Packard external defibrillator  
and Invivo's Research Inc.'s Millennia 3500 multiparameter patient 
monitor, perform basic functions properly, but display the wrong 
time and date if not reset properly. More than 39,000 of 
defibrillators and more than 2,000 patient monitors are in use 
around the world; 
</P>
<P>
	-- According to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, Australia,  
computers at police offices in three Swedish airports failed at 
midnight Jan. 1, when they were unable to recognize the year 1999. 
Travelers who needed temporary passports were unable to have them 
issued, although the problem was fixed some hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Anchorage, Alaska, the AM radio station KFQD was unable to  
receive The Associated Press' wire when the date changed. Jay 
White, chief engineer for the station, said the software for 
reading the wire went down Saturday morning and wasn't brought back 
up until Monday morning. When the date changed to Jan. 1, 1999, a 
bug in the out-of-date software hit the ``99'' and ceased to 
function. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are kind of whispers in the wind for what's going to  
happen in the year 2000,'' said Chris LeTocq, a Year 2000 analyst 
at Dataquest Inc., a computer research firm. ``If you're hearing 
stories of software having problems with 1999, that means Year 2000 
is real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems that some organizations faced this weekend  
was the number 9, which is the highest digit that can be plugged 
into a date code. Programmers over time have used a series of 9s to 
indicate ``end of file'' or ``cease operating,'' and this code can 
make the following dates risky: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jan. 1, 1999 - the beginning of the last year in the century;  
</P>
<P>
	-- April 9, 1999 - the 99th day of the last year for the century;  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sept. 9, 1999 - The four nines of ``9-9-99.''  
</P>
<P>
	The other problem that may have cropped up this weekend was  
computers looking ahead a year and choking on the Year 2000 problem 
-- often simply called ``Y2K.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem occurs when some computer programs, especially older  
ones, may fail when the date changes to 2000. Because they were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Breaks for Caregivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed tax breaks and  
other steps Monday to ease the financial burden on families that 
care for a chronically ill or disabled relative. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, carrying a price tag of $6.2 billion over five  
years, drew praise from many Republican members of Congress, who 
said Clinton was resurrecting a GOP idea he once opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted he has changed his tune,'' said Rep. Bill  
Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee 
on health. ``This GOP initiative the president has adopted can make 
a difference.'' He said House Republicans made a similar proposal 
in their 1994 ``Contract With America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Special  
Committee on Aging, applauded Clinton and said he plans to 
introduce two bills this year to make long-term care more 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton does the nation a great service by educating  
Americans about long-term care,'' Grassley said. He called the main 
elements of Clinton's plan ``small but helpful steps'' in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican praise was tempered by concerns about how Clinton  
intends to pay for the proposals, which include a $1,000 tax credit 
meant to compensate caregivers for such expenses as adult day care 
and lost wages in cases in which they must work less in order to be 
home to provide care. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his initiative at a White House ceremony, Clinton  
said the revenue loss from the tax cuts would be fully offset in a 
balanced budget he will submit to Congress in February, but he 
provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of Congress, including Rep. Phil English, R-Pa.,  
said the plan must not be paid for with tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's idea has an excellent chance of moving forward  
if he does not raise taxes or propose other creative 
revenue-raising schemes that have been defeated two and three times 
in the last several Congresses,'' English said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called his plan ``a critical new initiative to give care  
to the caregivers.'' He said long-term care would become an 
increasingly important issue in the 21st century as the baby boom 
gives way to a ``senior boom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Clinton to provide personal testimony to the  
needs of family caregivers was Patricia Darlak of Waldorf, Md., who 
told the White House audience she is struggling to care for her 
mother, who is suffering from dementia. Praising the idea of tax 
credits for caregivers, she said the cost of her mother's care is 
such a burden that she may have to delay her own retirement in 
order to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's four-part initiative also proposes that the government  
start offering federal workers and retirees private, long-term care 
insurance, in the hope that other employers would follow suit. 
Officials estimate that 300,000 government employees would 
participate in the model program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will ask Congress for $625 million in grants to state  
and local ``agencies on aging,'' which were created by the Older 
Americans Act of 1965. The money would be used to set up 
information and referral programs and to provide direct services to 
the millions of children caring for elderly parents at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1,000 tax credit would be available to parents of disabled  
or chronically ill children and any other person providing family 
care to a person -- of whatever age -- with three or more limitations 
in activities of daily living. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Willging, president of the American Health Care  
Association, representing nursing homes and other health care 
providers, called Clinton's plan ``great news'' and a ``balanced 
approach'' that at least will stimulate debate on a topic that has 
gained little attention in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who appeared with the president at Monday's  
announcement, said help for family caregivers is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that there is not a substitute for families  
being able to care for their loved ones,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But 
we sometimes forget that caregivers also need care. They, too, 
carry enormous burdens.'' Mrs. Clinton often appears with the 
president at White House events involving issues of special 
interest to her, such as the presentation of the Eleanor Roosevelt 
Award for Human Rights last month.

<HEADLINE> Dole Quits Red Cross, Eyes 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, a Cabinet member in two GOP  
administrations whose husband lost to President Clinton in 1996, 
said Monday she will leave her job with the American Red Cross to 
pursue a potential White House bid of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, made her plans known as Sen. John Ashcroft  
privately told surprised supporters that he will announce Tuesday 
that he has decided not to run for president. The Missouri lawmaker 
had spent the last year laying the groundwork for a presidential 
bid, and was considered one of the strongest prospects among social 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing 500 cheering, sometimes teary-eyed employees, Mrs.  
Dole announced plans to leave in two weeks, after nearly eight 
years as head of the nonprofit relief group. ``There may be another 
way for me to serve our country,'' she said at the organization's 
historic headquarters two blocks from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview later, Mrs. Dole said she plans to decide by  
March whether to run. ``I'm going to give it serious 
consideration,'' she said. Yet friends and allies say Mrs. Dole is 
determined to run for president if her financial and political 
support is as strong as she suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure she's preparing to commit herself,'' said pollster  
Tony Fabrizio, who worked for former Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's beyond soul-searching,'' said one longtime friend,  
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``She's down to finding out 
whether the money is there are whether the supporters are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her entry would add a compelling wrinkle to a GOP presidential  
field that is still taking shape. In the most recent developments: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Two Ashcroft supporters, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the lawmaker called them Monday and said he won't run. Said a 
third adviser, conservative activist Paul Weyrich: ``My 
understanding is, as one of his advisers, that he is not going to 
run.'' Ashcroft planned to announce his plans Tuesday, and aides 
said they didn't know what he would do. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire formed a presidential  
exploratory committee Monday, but is considered a longshot 
candidate. The step allows him to raise and spend money before 
beginning a formal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, a failed 1996  
candidate, plans to form his committee Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush is considered the strongest of all  
potential candidates but he has not decided whether to run. Dole's 
announcement is further evidence that Bush would be strongly 
challenged if he does seek the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This confirms there will be a wide-open race for the  
Republican nomination,'' said Brian Kennedy, an aide to Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., formed an exploratory committee last  
month and is expected to take the next step. McCain, Alexander and 
Dole would compete with Bush for the allegiance of the party's 
establishment wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft's departure would bode well for other potential  
candidates wooing social conservatives, such as millionaire Steve 
Forbes, activist Gary Bauer and broadcaster Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft was said to be concerned that running for president  
would put his seat in jeopardy in 2000, when Republicans are at 
risk of losing control of the Senate. Ashcroft, after being 
criticized last month for trying to soften his rhetoric on social 
issues, learned that it would be difficult to please social 
conservatives in presidential primaries while appealing to 
mainstream voters who are critical in general elections, advisers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole served as transportation secretary for President  
Reagan and labor secretary for President Bush. She is credited with 
stabilizing the Red Cross, which was under a cloud of scrutiny when 
she took over. The safety of its blood supply, once the focus of 
government attention, is no longer in question. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Cross has been a glorious mission, but I believe there  
may be other duties yet to fulfill,'' she told the employees. 
Afterward, Mrs. Dole said she wanted to leave the nonpartisan Red 
Cross before actively considering a presidential campaign, but said 
she will soon begin talking to activists, potential donors and 
perhaps travel to key presidential states. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole traveled aboard her own plane, kept her own schedule  
and was a nearly flawless surrogate for her husband in 1996. Her 
walk-through-the-audience performance at the GOP convention won 
widespread praise. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls consistently show Mrs. Dole earning the support of more  
than 10 percent of GOP voters in several surveys. She has never run 
for public office. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the announcement Monday, Bob Dole called his wife  
in her office to compliment her performance.

<HEADLINE> New DC Mayor Tries To Reshape City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anthony Williams is beginning his term as  
mayor of the nation's capital with many of the powers that had been 
stripped from his predecessor, Marion Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams arranged a meeting today with department heads and  
senior level staff to present what he called a ``here's where we're 
going, the train's leaving the station kind of thing'' on how to 
make government work for the city's 523,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 47, was sworn in Saturday as the city's fourth elected  
mayor. He had served the past two years as chief financial officer 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his election, Williams has relied on the advice of more  
than 100 members of a transition team. The diverse group of 
volunteers examined a broad range of issues including 
infrastructure, operations, finance, human services, and education. 
They also looked at the return of home rule, the limited 
self-governance granted to the city by Congress, which strikes a 
passionate chord with district voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams begins his tenure with much of the authority that  
Congress had taken from Barry but with city agencies being run by 
people Barry appointed. The financial control board that has 
overseen much of the city government since 1995 agreed to turn back 
the powers to Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some key vacancies. The Department of Public Works is  
without permanent leadership despite a nationwide search that began 
under Barry. There is no director for the Department of 
Corrections, which runs the city's jails. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot may be the Metropolitan Police Department which  
had been plagued by allegations of cronyism, mismanagement and 
overtime abuse. Crime rates have begun to decline and there's been 
a sweeping reorganization of the department since Charles Ramsey 
became police chief in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident he'll allow me to do my job,'' said Ramsey, who  
indicated he likes the idea of the mayor regaining authority over 
key city agencies because it means a coordinated crime-fighting 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Williams must clear dismissals of senior staff with the  
control board. The city also has more than 60 collective bargaining 
agreements that cover about 26,000 of the city's 31,000 employees.

<HEADLINE> IRS Offers New Tax Filing Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new round-the-clock telephone help line and  
Saturday office hours are among new tax filing services Clinton 
administration officials announced Monday to mark the beginning of 
the annual tax-filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that by doing our job better, people will understand  
that the IRS ... is not an enemy of the taxpayers at all,'' Charles 
Rossotti, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, told 
reporters. ``Our job is to be an agent to help the taxpayer meet 
the obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tax filing season that ends April 15 marks the first test of  
the 1998 reform law intended in part to transform the much-maligned 
IRS into a friendlier, more service-oriented agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these changes will take years to complete. But Rossotti  
and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said some things will be 
different right away -- such as fewer busy signals and less time 
spent on hold for people seeking information by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Monday, the IRS will operate its taxpayer help lines  
(1-800-829-1040) 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In the past, 
those lines were staffed 16 hours a day, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this year's filing season, we'll never close,''  
Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, IRS offices in 250 locations will be open on 13  
Saturdays between Jan. 16 and April 10. Last year, such ``help 
sessions'' were held only on the last few Saturdays at a few 
locations before the April 15 tax filing deadline for 1998 taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers should call IRS to find the office nearest them that  
will be open on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
	For people with computer access to the Internet, the IRS site on  
the World Wide Web (www.irs.ustreas.gov) features tax forms, 
changes in tax law, publications, tax tables, answers to frequently 
asked questions and links to other tax-related sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti also said IRS has finished testing some 70,000 computer  
programs to ensure they are ready for 2000, when computer systems 
may be disrupted by a date-related glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	This tax filing season, he said, ``is a test run'' for those  
repairs -- and taxpayers should be on the lookout for errors such as 
wrong tax notices or failure to promptly receive a due refund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be prepared, if there are problems, to respond to them  
very quickly,'' Rossotti said.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Investors Rewarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Invest for the long term.  
</P>
<P>
	That is the advice individual investors hear most often from  
market professionals. And investors who followed that suggestion 
during the stock market's turbulent summer and fall were rewarded 
during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	A sample portfolio for small investors that The Associated Press  
has tracked for more than a year recovered smartly during the final 
quarter of 1998. The portfolio rose 27.38 percent during the 
October-December period after an 11.32 percent drop the previous 
quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, had a 
fourth-quarter gain of 17.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio's best performer was Wal-Mart, which rose more  
than 49 percent, while IBM rose more than 43 percent. The third 
stock in the portfolio, Coca-Cola, managed a gain of better than 16 
percent although the company was hurt by an earnings outlook that 
disappointed Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP has followed the stock market's progress through the  
portfolio created at the close of trading on Oct. 23, 1997. The 
portfolio, consisting of three mutual funds and three widely held 
stocks, has weathered the markets' ups and downs, and as of Dec. 
31, 1998 had increased 43.42 percent since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio was valued at $25,299.85 at its inception and was  
worth $36,284.64 as 1998 ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio's sole losing component during the fourth quarter  
was the T. Rowe Price U.S. Treasury Long-Term Fund, which fell 
nearly 3 percent as investors who had sought the relatively safety 
of bonds during Wall Street's turmoil switched back to stocks as 
the markets calmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two stock funds in the portfolio reflected the market's better  
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio fund, which tracks  
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 large U.S. companies, rose 20.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the portfolio's most troubled holding, the Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter Pacific Growth Fund, was up more than 26 percent. 
Still, the fund remains nearly 22 percent below its Oct. 23, 1997 
price, a result of the continuing financial problems in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Testimony in Microsoft Case Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An economist told the judge in the Microsoft  
trial that the software giant represents a ``predatory'' monopoly 
that sought to crush its rival by illegally combining its dominant 
Windows operating system and its own Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Fisher, an economics professor at the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology, was the government's last announced 
witness in its lengthy antitrust case against Microsoft. At the 
request of U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, Fisher 
submitted his written testimony in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's lawyers were expected to begin questioning Fisher  
as early as Tuesday. Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- 
starting with MIT economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft on Monday criticized Fisher's testimony as ``littered  
with errors, third-hand information supplied by the DOJ (Department 
of Justice) and excerpts from out-of-context e-mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft ``cannot charge a monopoly price because it faces  
competition from rival operating systems, potential market 
entrants, its own installed base and pirated software,'' the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher testified on behalf of IBM Corp. during its years-long  
antitrust fight against the Justice Department, when he worked with 
lawyer David Boies, now leading the government's case. The 
department ultimately dropped the IBM case. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft sought to use Fisher's own words against him, quoting  
his 1983 book about IBM when he wrote: ``Conduct that brings 
profitable higher sales cannot be anti-competitive regardless of 
how uncomfortable it makes competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Professor Fisher's testimony would give readers of his 1983  
book whiplash,'' Microsoft said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its allegations, the government charges that Microsoft  
illegally included its own Internet browsing software within 
Windows as part of a campaign to ``crush'' rival Netscape 
Communications Corp., which makes competing browser software that 
isn't shipped with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher called Microsoft's bundling of its Internet software a  
``predatory anti-competitive act.'' He also told the judge that 
Microsoft's high market share -- in excess of 80 percent -- indicates 
that the company wields monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said Microsoft, using its influence, discouraged Internet  
providers from distributing Netscape's software, and he repeated 
claims that Microsoft sought to stifle emerging rival technologies 
from Intel Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, William Harris, chief executive officer for  
Intuit Inc., which makes the popular Quicken personal finance 
software, reiterated his suggestion that Microsoft be prevented 
from using Windows to favor its own software products. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris asserted that Microsoft holds unparalleled influence in  
the high-tech industry because Windows, which functions as the 
central nervous system for most computers, is an ``essential 
service'' for which ``there is no effective substitute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there is a role for someone, perhaps the court, to  
make a distinction between the operating system and applications,'' 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden wondered whether Harris was  
suggesting government oversight of the industry under a new 
``interstate operating systems commission.'' And he noted the 
predicament of Microsoft guaranteeing software companies the 
opportunity to include their own products as part of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The operating system can't include every application in the  
world, can it?'' Warden asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Harris answered.  
</P>
<P>
	In 47 pages of written testimony, Harris earlier told the judge  
that Intuit feared Microsoft's plans in the mid-1990s to include 
finance software within Windows. Microsoft eventually abandoned the 
idea, called WinATM. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris also was forced to defend his product's overwhelming  
popularity, in light of government claims that Windows gives 
Microsoft monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris acknowledged that Quicken dominates with 65 percent to 80  
percent of the market, and that Intuit's business-level product, 
called Quickbooks, has 84 percent of its market. He said its 
tax-preparation software has 80 percent of that market. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harris said Intuit's dominance is different from Microsoft's  
because customers can switch to another manufacturer's software 
more easily than they can change operating systems.

<HEADLINE> Weather, Iraq Boost Energy Futures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Energy futures traded Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
received a boost from the frigid weather that swept across the 
United States over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures prices also received a lift from concern over  
the latest bellicose statements from Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures prices were higher, cocoa  
futures prices fell, and grain and soybean futures prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil and natural gas futures prices were pushed higher by  
the blast of cold weather that began moving across the nation last 
week and intensified over the weekend, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts call for continued cold over the next six to 10 days,  
particularly in the Midwest, which relies primarily on natural gas 
to warm homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures prices were boosted by Saddam's Sunday address  
to his cabinet, in which he said the ``no-fly'' zones imposed on 
Iraq flout the will of all Arabs. He called the zones illegal and 
vowed that Iraq will fight violations of its airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The no-fly zones, which cover about two-thirds of Iraq, were set  
up by the United States, Britain and France after the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War to stop Iraq from using its air force against Kurdish 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude for February delivery was 29 cents higher at  
$12.34 a barrel; February heating oil was .86 cent higher at 35.14 
cents a gallon; February unleaded gasoline was .97 cent higher at 
37.52 cents a gallon; February natural gas was 12.6 cents higher at 
$2.071 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures prices fell on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa  
Exchange as an expected global supply deficit may not happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The movement of cocoa from the Ivory Coast interior to export  
points this season is running 60,000 tons ahead of last year's 
pace, according to analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential 
Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also is being hurt by the conservative purchasing  
policies of major cocoa processors, who are not rushing to build 
their inventories, instead buying as the need arises, Stevenson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	March cocoa was $6 lower at $1,373 a metric ton.  
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures prices rose on the possibility of tight supplies  
later this year. The 1999-2000 Brazilian coffee crop is expected to 
be smaller than the current crop, which is estimated at around 35 
million bags. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller crop size is expected because of the physiology of  
Brazilian coffee tree, which produces fewer beans every few years. 
</P>
<P>
	March coffee was 4.85 cents higher at $1.226 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices were higher in trading on the  
Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices rallied on reports of dry weather in  
southern Brazil and northern Argentina, raising concerns about the 
future state of the South American soybean crop, which is currently 
considered in good condition. Forecasts call for continued dryness 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying interest in soybean futures also was boosted by the heavy  
snows that blanketed the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were higher in the wake of frigid weather  
in much of the winter wheat crop growing region, even though the 
heavy snow cover is not expected to badly damage the crop. The U.S. 
Agriculture Department's intention to donate 695,000 metric tons of 
wheat to nations with troubled economies also boosted the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices gained support from farmers' struggle to  
move corn to market because of the weekend blizzard. The weather 
may also create an increase in feed demand as animals consume more 
to increase body temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery settled 2 3/4 cents higher at $2.79 a  
bushel; March corn was 1 1/4 cents higher at $2.14 3/4 a bushel; March 
oats were 2 cents higher at $1.07 1/2 a bushel; January soybeans were 
6 cents higher at $5.43 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Germann Is Big Fish in `Ally' Pond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Considering his role as sharkish lawyer Richard  
Fish, Greg Germann should keep his own lawyer on call. With all the 
scenes he gets to steal, he could be nailed for grand larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	Or to put it another way: Germann, playing Ally McBeal's boss at  
a certain loopy Boston law firm, is having more fun than the law 
allows. And why not? He's part of the most focused-on, 
buzzed-about, argued-over series in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in its sophomore season, ``Ally McBeal'' (whose pilot airs  
on Fox tonight at 8 p.m. EST, followed by another repeat at 9 p.m.) 
is an irresistible irritant in the national psyche. The unisex 
restroom ... resident chanteuse Vonda Shepard ... dancing twins and 
that infernal dancing baby. Objection! 
</P>
<P>
	Overruled! Viewers love, hate, can't get enough of  
lawyer-flibbertigibbet Ally (series star Calista Flockhart) and her 
delightfully exasperating world. 
</P>
<P>
	In this well-stocked pond, Germann gets to play the big Fish -- a  
remarkable mix of airy self-obsession, Yuppie smarm and cold-fish 
directness. Not to mention his fetish for wattles, those folds of 
flesh that drape from the throats of certain-age women. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a jerk, for lack of a better word -- but don't quote me,''  
says Germann, grinning at the very idea of Fish. ``I always think 
of him as a 10-year-old boy, who's always forward-moving, to his 
own detriment sometimes, and not really thinking about how his 
behavior might affect other people or fit into social conventions. 
I just love it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Germann, who cleaned apartments for four years until he found  
success in Manhattan theater, had reluctantly moved to Los Angeles 
to pursue TV. There he landed supporting roles in two short-lived 
series: the NBC drama ``Sweet Justice'' (1994-95) and the Fox 
sitcom ``Ned and Stacey'' (1995-97). 
</P>
<P>
	Then, two years ago, he lucked into a show cooked up by David E.  
Kelley, a brilliant writer-producer already hailed for blending 
thorny issues with loony plot twists on ``Picket Fences'' and 
``Chicago Hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting more and more excited,'' Germann recalls. ``Then  
we did the pilot, and I thought it was great. At that point, I was 
certain we were doomed. I thought, `This probably won't find an 
audience. It's not a drama, it's not a sitcom.' But I thought it 
would be fun to do 13 episodes. Then we'd be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong. Then Germann was wrong about another thing: the  
prospective appeal of Fishisms, the epigram-like observations that 
Richard Fish is fond of tossing off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is alone. It's just easier to take, in a  
relationship.'' Or: ``Make enough money and everything else will 
follow.'' Not only did Fishisms become a running joke for the 
character and a signature of the show, they were even destined to 
adorn a line of camisoles and men's underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Germann recognized this as a budding franchise?  
</P>
<P>
	``No! Because I'm an idiot! When I first read the term  
`Fishism,' I thought, `It doesn't sound right to me.' Luckily for 
me, I kept my mouth shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But these days, Germann is happy to speak up about another  
matter. He is clearly bemused by one offshoot of his series' 
polymorphous appeal: viewers' spirited debate over what ``Ally 
McBeal,'' and Ally in particular, truly stand for. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only has Ally been anointed as a cultural phenomenon, she  
was also snapped up for the Zeitgeist Follies as a symbol. But of 
what? America's sweetheart? Feminist icon? Feminist washout? The 
polemic rages on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ally -- she's pretty quirky,'' Germann says. ``She's a mess.  
She's clearly got problems, whining about her job and not having a 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I, for one, know plenty of women who -- well, you could say  
they're whining, or you could say they just don't know how to 
balance a career and a personal life. But I kinda don't understand 
how people are looking at this show to depict reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a strange thing about commercial television: Viewers are  
conditioned to see the characters on network series as role models, 
reflecting not who the viewer is, but who the viewer longs to be. 
So if Ally doesn't measure up to one ideal or another, this lapse 
gets the audience stirred up. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want her character to be stronger,'' Germann says.  
``Why? What would we gain? Then they say, `Her skirts are too 
short. Lawyers don't dress like that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He sighs. ``I'm thinking: `This is a TV show! Sometimes we act  
out fantasies. We sing, we dance. We're just trying to do a show 
that's sexy and fun and silly, that has a heart.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider that a Germannism.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Advocates Hope the Euro Succeeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As Europe heralds the birth of its new currency,  
advocates are hoping that the prosperity it could unleash on the 
continent will also spread to the United States and other parts of 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	But should the ambitious project falter, critics warn, the  
damage would spread just as easily beyond Europe's borders. 
</P>
<P>
	If the euro strengthens too much against the dollar, it could  
lure global investors away from U.S. financial markets and force 
interest rates higher in America. If the euro weakens sharply 
against the dollar, it could hurt U.S. exporters who would have to 
compete with cheaper goods from European rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Worst of all would be if the whole euro system itself runs into  
trouble. If certain European countries can't abide by the economic 
rules they've set for membership in the currency club, they might 
be forced to pull out of the system, which could lead to financial 
turmoil in Europe and exacerbate the continent's protracted 
unemployment problem. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. government officials have long supported the euro endeavor.  
President Clinton issued a statement welcoming the euro's debut 
Monday, saying ``a strong and stable Europe, with open markets and 
robust growth, is good for America and for the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having just one currency to deal with instead of 11 could make  
it much easier for U.S. companies to sell products to Europe's 290 
million consumers. And if the euro has the hoped-for effect of 
boosting economic growth, those consumers will be even more likely 
to buy U.S. goods. The more the euro rises against the dollar, the 
more affordable American-made products would be for Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great market opportunity, especially for smaller  
companies who have fewer currencies to deal with,'' said Wolf 
Brueckmann, who handles European affairs for the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce in Washington. ``European consumers will be easily able to 
compare prices, and this will help U.S. companies that are 
competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, some economists worry that if the euro is  
strong over the long term, it could begin to challenge the dollar's 
position as the world's most widely accepted currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's unchallenged dominance as the global reserve  
currency has had great benefits for the United States, especially 
in the U.S. government bond market. Huge inflows of money from 
foreign investors who have no better place to park their dollars 
have kept bond prices high and interest rates low, keeping 
borrowing costs low for the U.S. government as well as homeowners 
and car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	But if those international investors had other places to put  
their money, such as a strong European bond market, some say it 
could erode the value of U.S. Treasury bonds, pushing up interest 
rates in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the euro is going to be a rival to the dollar,''  
said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy 
Institute, a public policy research institute. ``It is likely to 
raise interest rates in the U.S. and could result in a somewhat 
weaker dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, however, are doubtful that the mighty dollar can be  
unseated anytime soon as king of the global currencies. During the 
1980s, some feared that the new economic dominance of Japan would 
help push that nation's currency, the yen, to a new status as a 
global reserve currency. But that never came to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this early juncture, it's a little bit naive to believe  
that they've got a super-currency, a dollar-killer,'' said David 
DeRosa, a former currency trader who now teaches international 
finance at the Yale School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Of far greater concern, DeRosa says, is the possibility that  
internal economic problems in Europe might lead to a complete or 
partial breakdown of the currency union. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible culprits could include severe regional recessions in  
one or two countries which could tempt governments to ratchet up 
spending in an effort to create jobs. But excessive deficit 
spending is prohibited under the fiscal austerity treaty that the 
11 countries signed in order to keep the currency stable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the currency project ever breaks up, I look for a meltdown  
in the European bond market and much higher interest rates in 
southern Europe. That could bring on a recession there and then our 
export industries could get hit,'' DeRosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should wish our friends in Europe all the best, but this  
euphoria over the euro is unwarranted because the project has 
definite risks to it,'' he said. ``It's going to have benefits as 
long as they can hold it together.''

<HEADLINE> New Yorkers Wary After subway Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sylvia Zimmerman stopped riding the subway 10  
years ago after she was mugged. After reading about the city's drop 
in crime, she had finally summoned the courage to go underground 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the slaying of a young woman -- shoved by a stranger under  
the wheels of a Manhattan train -- has Mrs. Zimmerman and other New 
Yorkers looking over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendra Webdale, 32, was decapitated as the first three cars of  
an uptown train ran over her in the 23rd Street and Broadway 
station shortly after 5 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this is not a sign that crime is making a return,''  
worried Mrs. Zimmerman, 65, a Manhattan native. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've felt so safe ever since I moved here,'' said Jenna  
Gamble, 29, who moved to Manhattan from Dallas a year ago. 
``Nothing bad has ever happened to me. But I come into the station 
where that woman was killed nearly every day, and this has really 
scared me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right after the incident, the subway motorman shouted at  
passengers to surround and hold the suspect, Andrew Goldstein, 29. 
Police said Goldstein, who was charged with second-degree murder, 
was carrying medical papers indicating he was under psychiatric 
care at an outpatient clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Webdale, a receptionist at Masterdisk Corp., a record  
company, was apparently a random victim, said Lt. John Shields of 
the 13th Detective Squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``He spoke to her briefly, he asked her the time,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor William Greenbaum said at least three witnesses saw  
Goldstein push Ms. Webdale off the platform, and that the suspect 
has admitted to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has seen a decline in murders, other violent crimes and  
subway crimes in the past few years. Only one person was murdered 
in the subways last year, compared with four in 1997 and 26 in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The last death of someone pushed onto the tracks was on Jan. 4,  
1995, when a homeless man shoved Soon Sin, 63, a retired seamstress 
from Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein's court-appointed attorney, Kevin Canfield, said his  
client is very disturbed. ``He has a history of schizophrenia,'' 
Canfield said after Goldstein's brief arraignment. ``He has been 
under a doctor's care for some time'' and taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein was ordered held without bail, placed under a suicide  
watch and told to undergo a psychiatric exam.

<HEADLINE> Saywer, Gibson Named 'GMA' Hosts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Making a bold move to turn around ``Good Morning  
America,'' ABC today said Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson will take 
over as interim co-hosts of the struggling program in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a return to morning television for both of them: Ms. Sawyer  
was host of the ``CBS Morning News'' from 1981-84, and Gibson ended 
11 years as ``Good Morning America'' host just last April. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's current hosts, Kevin Newman and Lisa McRee, will both  
be given new assignments at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News President David Westin said the network's news division  
wanted to make a strong statement that it was committed to 
improving the program by bringing back ``warmth with intelligence 
and a sense of family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how long Ms. Sawyer and Gibson will do the job  
before handing ``Good Morning America'' to a new set of hosts. Ms. 
Sawyer said it would probably be ``a few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll do it for as long as it takes,'' Gibson said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Good Morning America'' has sunk well behind NBC's ``Today''  
show in the ratings over the past few years. The slide continued 
when McRee took over for Joan Lunden in September 1997 and Newman 
replaced Gibson last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman will become a correspondent for ABC's ``Nightline,''  
Westin said. McRee, who is pregnant, will be a Los Angeles-based 
ABC News correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sawyer and Gibson will start on Jan. 18.

<HEADLINE> Weather Boosts Grain, Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were higher in  
trading Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices rallied on reports of dry weather in  
southern Brazil and northern Argentina, raising concerns about the 
future state of the South American soybean crop, which is currently 
considered in good condition. Forecasts call for continued dryness 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying interest in soybean futures also was boosted by the heavy  
snows that blanketed the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were higher in the wake of frigid weather  
conditions in much of the winter wheat crop growing region, even 
though the heavy snow cover is not expected to badly damage the 
crop. The U.S. Agriculture Department's intention to donate 695,000 
metric tons of wheat to nations with troubled economies also 
boosted the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices gained support from farmers' struggle to  
move corn to market because of the weekend blizzard. The weather 
may also create an increase in feed demand as animals consume more 
to increase body temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery settled 2 3/4 cents higher at $2.79 a  
bushel; March corn was 1 1/4 cents higher at $2.14 3/4 a bushel; March 
oats were 2 cents higher at $1.07 1/2 a bushel; January soybeans were 
6 cents higher at $5.43 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock and meat futures prices were mixed in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were .90 cent lower at 59.62 cents a pound;  
January feeder cattle were .50 cent lower at 68.67 cents a pound; 
February lean hogs were 1.93 cents lower at 30.72 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were .02 cent higher at 42.77 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Drops, Tokyo Stocks Plunge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar dropped against the yen Monday as the  
euro made a strong debut on Asian currency markets. Japanese share 
prices plunged on worries about the stronger yen in the first 
trading session of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.86 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
1.34 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its New York 
level of 113.57 yen late Thursday. It ranged during the day from 
112.74 yen to 113.98 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Thursday and Friday for  
the New Year's holidays. On Monday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed 
at the end of morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell amid active futures-led selling on worries  
over a steep gain in the yen against the dollar, which tends to 
hurt major Japanese exporters. A higher yen tends to make Japanese 
exports more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 426.28 points,  
or 3.08 percent, to close at 13,415.89 points, the lowest average 
since Oct. 16. On Wednesday, the average closed down 1.84 points, 
or 0.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar sank in early trading  
on worries about the state of U.S. and Latin American financial 
markets but regained some strength later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, on the other hand, held its own after a slow start,  
rising as high as $1.1886 during the day, well above the fixing 
rate of $1.16675 set Thursday by the European Commission. It traded 
at $1.1873 late in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro cost 134.94 late afternoon in Tokyo, up from its  
initial fixing of 132.80 yen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro, after all, has big potential. It's the No. 1  
candidate for a global key currency, vying with the dollar,'' said 
Minoru Kobayashi of Asahi Life Insurance. ``It's a buy at least for 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all  
issues listed on the first section fell 22.07 points, or 2.03 
percent, to close at 1,064.92. The TOPIX finished down 1.84 points, 
or 0.17 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are worried about a continued decline of the dollar  
and uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, 
general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	About 118.39 million shares changed hands on the first section,  
up from 127.09 million Wednesday. Declining issues outnumbering 
advances 940 to 180, and 125 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.990 percent from Wednesday's finish of 2.010 
percent, driving its price up to 98.48 yen from 98.33 yen.

<HEADLINE> NBA Owners Reject Players' Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBA owners turned down the union's latest offer  
Monday. The players vote next. 
</P>
<P>
	In a day of fast-moving developments in the NBA lockout, the  
stage was set for a dramatic countdown to Thursday's deadline for 
scrapping the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' commissioner David Stern  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't rule it out, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Nine owners on the labor relations committee unanimously  
rejected the union's proposal and recommended scrapping the rest of 
the 1998-99 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting open to all 400 players will be held Wednesday in New  
York, and a vote will be taken on the owners' final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's 19-player negotiating committee will recommend that  
the offer be rejected ``to assure that the owners understand the 
level of player resolve and the degree of opposition to the NBA's 
onerous demands,'' union director Billy Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	News of an upcoming player vote came as a surprise, since the  
union had insisted it would not present any proposal for a vote 
unless its negotiating committee recommended it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they elect to go against the recommendation, then we'll  
have to live with that,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern had been calling for a player vote for more than a week.  
</P>
<P>
	``The majority has a right to control the destiny of an  
organization, and that's between them and their leadership,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing delivered the proposal  
to Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik at a hotel across the 
street from NBA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Stern: ``I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours.  
Instead, I saw one that went backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Granik: ``Based upon how far apart we are, there's a lot  
more needed to be done than simply tweaking the offers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Granik also said the owners' negotiating committee  
would meet in New York, perhaps Wednesday night. But it is 
uncertain if there will be a meeting with the players' committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait and see what they're going to do,'' Ewing said.  
``It's all a waiting game right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If no deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with  
one ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
Thursday to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned and see on Thursday how close we are,'' Stern said.  
``In order to see who's more accurate in his depiction of where we 
are, we're going to have to lose a season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA, which was supposed to begin its season Nov. 3, had  
never lost a game to labor strife until this season. So far, the 
first two months of the season have been wiped out. It would take 
three to four weeks after a settlement to begin a season of 45 to 
50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' Stern said, opening the  
door for the first time to using replacement players in the 
1999-2000 season. ``It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on, 
but obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we'll rebuild the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said if a new league was formed, it would probably take  
the top 100 players and leave the rest -- the middle-class that the 
union has said it is fighting for -- out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	The union presented its offer at an hour-long meeting that  
represented the first face-to-face talks between the sides since 
Dec. 27. That's when they met for five hours near Denver and the 
league made its ``final'' offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has told all 19 players on its negotiating committee  
to be in New York by Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Williams of the Knicks, a member of the union's executive  
committee, thinks the deadline might be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a deal was done on the 9th or 10th, I'm sure David wouldn't  
say that just because we didn't do it on 7th the season is over. 
It's a business, and sometimes you have to posture,'' Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's new offer included a limit on how much any player  
can earn. If accepted, the NBA would be the only professional 
sports league to limit the amount of money a top athlete is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The key sticking point could center on how much revenue will be  
paid to the players during the six-year deal. The sides also differ 
on the length and terms of a new rookie salary scale and the dollar 
value of two salary cap exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the union wants 55 percent of revenue devoted  
to salaries in the fourth year, while owners have offered 53 
percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners 
are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- 
the amount they received last season -- while the league is offering 
54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft,  
signed with Kinder Bologna of the Italian League for $3 million. 
The 7-foot-1 center can return to the NBA on Feb. 15 if the lockout 
is lifted and still would receive $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Woods, the agent for Toronto's Kevin Willis, refiled an  
unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations 
Board against the union for allegedly breaching its duty of fair 
representation.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Fed Chief Sees Slow Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- More economic growth is ahead in 1999, but it may  
not live up to the raised -- and unrealistic -- expectations many 
Americans have developed, a Federal Reserve official says. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Guynn, president and chief executive officer of the Federal  
Reserve Bank of Atlanta, forecast slower but continued growth for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he expressed concern Monday about ``the  
institutionalization of unrealistic expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the Atlanta Rotary Club, Guynn projected gross  
domestic product growth of some 2.5 percent, inflation around 2 
percent, and unemployment just over 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be ``not the exceptional years of 1997 or 1998,  
perhaps, but a very good showing all the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there needs to be ``a reality check,'' or an  
understanding that slower GDP growth isn't the same as slow GDP 
growth and slightly higher inflation isn't the same as accelerating 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	To many Americans, he said, ``economic growth that's not  
exceptional, that's not spectacular, that's merely good, is coming 
to be seen as not quite good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers, businesses, investors and policy-makers should not  
proceed as though they were,'' he said. ``Such a delusion could 
have real repercussions for the U.S. economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said governments at all levels need to continue budgetary  
restraint and not ``get addicted to extraordinary levels of 
revenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guynn's other caveat on his economic forecast was the assumption  
that Asia ``has finally bottomed out.'' But if Japan doesn't move 
toward recovery and the Asian malaise spreads to Latin America, 
``all bets are off,'' he said. Guynn considers that ``a remote 
possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the 1998 U.S. economic performance came despite  
the Asian crisis, which he said demonstrates the economy's balance, 
momentum and low-inflation policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new year's more moderate level of economic growth,  
combined with ongoing low levels of inflation, ought to ensure that 
the economic expansion continues into the next millenium,'' Guynn 
said.

<HEADLINE> Public Clamors for Ventura Wares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- With appearances on network news and  
late-night talk shows, CNN and C-SPAN, Jesse Ventura has peddled 
his political shtick to millions. Now, quite a few of them are 
literally buying it. 
</P>
<P>
	You'd expect the Reform Party governor to be popular in the  
state that just elected him. But his appeal has gone national, with 
people all over the country gobbling up Ventura T-shirts, hats and 
bumper stickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen (Ventura merchandise) all over the place. You  
combine the yearning for a different political way with the 
personality of Jesse and you see what you get,'' said Dean Barkley, 
Ventura's campaign chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kahn, a retiree who lives in Windsor, Calif., had his  
niece in Minneapolis ship two black Ventura T-shirts his way. He's 
keeping one for himself and giving the other to his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was really interesting that he won. I'm not just  
buying the T-shirts for a joke,'' said Kahn, who followed Ventura 
during his pro wrestling days. Kahn still has an original Ventura 
action figure from when his children were young. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ventura rush started the day after his surprise victory Nov.  
3. 
</P>
<P>
	Salesmen started calling Host Marriott, concessionaire at the  
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, early the next morning 
and they've had hundreds of calls since, said marketing manager 
Sarah Londerville. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Marriott has sold 5,000 T-shirts emblazoned with ``My  
governor can beat up your governor'' at its five airport gift shops 
in the past two months, Londerville said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 51 Target stores in Minnesota, supplies of ``Mind Your  
Body'' T-shirts and sweatshirts, ``Man of Action'' hats and ``My 
governor can beat up your governor'' mugs have to be replenished 
every week, said Target spokeswoman Denise Workcuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Signature Group, one of the few companies licensed to sell the  
goods, has shipped products to J.C. Penney Co. and Musicland Stores 
across the country. Mervyn's also is opening a national account, 
said Peter Lambert, co-owner of the Plymouth-based retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Friedline, Ventura's former campaign manager, said recently  
that he got 25 requests for Ventura T-shirts in a three-day span. 
Only two of them were from Minnesotans. Now he's trying to figure 
out how to reprint and sell Ventura's campaign lawn signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in charge of marketing a governor. Who would have ever  
thought that would happen?'' Friedline said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next item that will mix politics with the free market is a  
beefy action figure in Ventura's likeness, bald head and all. 
Contrary to the wild attire of the Ventura doll from his wrestling 
days, the new one -- due out this spring -- shows the governor in a 
business suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's custom-made doll stole the show in Ventura's campaign  
commercials, which depicted two boys playing with a Ventura doll 
banging his fist on a desk and dismissing Evil Special Interest 
Man. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hillsman, the man who produced Ventura's campaign ads, said  
they created the doll -- a combination of several action figure 
parts -- as a surrogate for the candidate who didn't have enough 
time to shoot the TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea that there'd actually be people clamoring for an  
action figure. But this is America,'' Hillsman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he's flattered by the demand for products with his  
face or name. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to do everything I can for the state of Minnesota.  
If that's part of it then, yeah, I suppose it's gratifying to know 
that I'm already helping,'' he said ahead of his Monday swearing-in 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ventura profited from the sale of his first action figure  
during his pro wrestling days (he bought a Porsche with the 
proceeds), he won't see any of it this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, his campaign is amassing the proceeds from its sales  
for future campaigns. In the two months since the election, 
Ventura's campaign has sold tens of thousands of dollars in 
T-shirts and hats at $20 a clip. Other products are being 
discussed, including a Ventura educational comic book that would 
promote a healthy lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	A nonprofit corporation, Ventura for Minnesota Inc., has been  
formed to license the products. Profits are being held in escrow 
until the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Disclosure Board 
determines how Ventura's office can spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism, culture and sociology at  
New York University, said Ventura's popularity will eventually wane 
outside Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said he can't think of another governor who has been  
able to market himself as Ventura has done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine anything competing,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> FIFA, IOC Fight Over Drug Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Soccer is prepared to be tossed out of  
the Olympics in a drug-testing dispute, the medical chief of the 
sport's international body said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel D'Hooghe, chairman of FIFA's medical committee, said the  
federation never would bow to the International Olympic Committee's 
demand for minimum two-year suspensions for doping. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if FIFA stands alone, it is old and big enough to take  
care of itself,'' D'Hooghe said in a telephone interview with The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Hooghe's comments came two days before FIFA president Sepp  
Blatter meets with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch to try to 
resolve their differences on doping before the Feb. 2-4 world drug 
summit in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC wants all Olympic sports federations to apply common  
rules and penalties, including a minimum two-year suspension for 
athletes using steroids and other major performance-enhancing 
drugs. If federations refuse to apply the rule, they risk being 
dropped from the Olympic program. 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer, cycling and tennis have expressed reservations to the  
Olympic resolution. The other 32 Olympic federations have approved 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only tell you that FIFA will never change its opinion on  
this,'' D'Hooghe said. ``You really don't think we will come around 
to the two-year proposal, do you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer has been in the Olympics since 1900 but has had trouble  
fitting into the games. FIFA has always made sure that its World 
Cup, which started in 1930, would not be overshadowed by an Olympic 
soccer tournament.

<HEADLINE>  Panthers Name Seifert As New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Two years of fishing, traveling and  
broadcasting were enough for George Seifert. The coach with the 
best winning percentage in NFL history resurfaced Monday to lead 
the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert will be the coach and will have the final say in all  
personnel matters for a 4-year-old franchise that has fallen on 
hard times since advancing to the NFC championship game in just its 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, 58, received a five-year contract that will pay him an  
average of more than $2.4 million annually, according to sources 
who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a few moments in your life when you're kind of  
overwhelmed by the situation,'' Seifert said. ``I've been involved 
in some pretty exciting times, but I don't know that I've been 
involved in one where I feel as proud and excited as I do right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert's hiring came eight days after the Panthers fired Dom  
Capers, who helped them achieve unprecedented success for NFL 
expansion teams but was unable to sustain an early wave of 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Jerry Richardson thinks the Panthers can recapture  
their winning ways with Seifert, who won 76 percent of his games 
(108-35) with San Francisco from 1989-96. Under Seifert's 
direction, the 49ers won two Super Bowl titles and never won less 
than 10 games in a season, numbers that Richardson found impossible 
to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very difficult to have the highest winning percentage in  
the National Football League. That is not a slam dunk. That is a 
very difficult thing to do,'' Richardson said. ``And the gentleman, 
he's won Super Bowls. He's done everything you could expect a coach 
to do as far as I was concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared as if Seifert's NFL resume was finished when he left  
the 49ers. He spent two years fishing, hiking and traveling with 
his wife, Linda, and dabbled as a television analyst for NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Seifert said he never lost the desire to coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last couple of years I've kind of been living in a gray  
twilight,'' he said. ``It's an empty feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That feeling passed when he met with Richardson last Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a sense and a feeling that I was at home,'' Seifert  
said. ``I was at peace with myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also said he quickly felt at ease with Seifert.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll be very compatible,'' the owner said. ``He's a  
very focused person and he clearly understands what our 
expectations are. There's no misunderstanding. We want to do 
everything we can to create an environment to win football games, 
pure and simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers haven't been doing much of that since 1996, when  
they unseated Seifert's 49ers for the NFC West title on the way to 
a 13-5 season that ended in the NFC title game. Carolina has lost 
21 of 32 since then, including a franchise-worst 4-12 record this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert said he wants the Panthers to throw the ball more but  
stay with their West Coast-style controlled passing offense, a 
strategy that worked well in his days at San Francisco. That news 
met with approval from Carolina quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who 
was among those attending the news conference in Ericsson Stadium 
to announce Seifert's hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about the fact that I don't have to open up a new  
playbook and start over again,'' said Beuerlein, who was the NFL's 
most accurate passer this season. ``I get to see the same offense 
two years in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensively, changes are likely for a team that finished at the  
bottom of the NFL rankings in 1998. Seifert said the Panthers' 3-4 
alignment may not be completely scrapped but could share a 
significant amount of time with a more conventional 4-3 set, 
depending on how Carolina's personnel fit in with his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert already has part of his new staff on hand. The Panthers  
are retaining three of Capers' assistants -- offensive coordinator 
Gil Haskell, tight ends coach Don Breaux and wide receivers coach 
Richard Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert said he wants to move quickly to fill several defensive  
assistant coaching spots, including that of defensive coordinator. 
Several newspapers have reported that one candidate for that job 
could be Ray Rhodes, fired last Monday as Philadelphia's coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert's primary task in the coming weeks will be to get  
reacquainted with a league in which he worked for 17 years before 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heck of a responsibility but a very exciting one. I'm  
ready to get started,'' he said. ``I'm more excited than I ever 
thought I would be about coming back into coaching.''

<HEADLINE> Becker, Rios Slam State of Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Boris Becker calls it ``sick.'' Marcelo Rios calls  
it ``boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men's tennis is coming under attack again -- this time on the eve  
of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker, the former three-time Wimbledon champion, called for the  
ATP Tour to stage less tournaments and force the top players to 
play each other more often. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be that Pete Sampras doesn't have to play against a  
top 10 player until August -- that points to a system that's 
literally sick,'' Becker told the Berlin daily, the Tagesspiegel. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, the No. 2-ranked player, said the game should be slowed  
and players allowed to display emotions on court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tennis has gotten boring -- unjustifiably so,'' the Chilean  
said in the German magazine, Der Spiegel. ``Especially the top 
players are constantly watched, constantly punished and therefore 
always more well-behaved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rios echoed the sentiments of former great John McEnroe. The  
American, known for his outbursts on court, has said the game lacks 
personalities because few players risk showing emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's true,'' Rios said. ``It's schizophrenic and the biggest  
problem of the tour is not that personalities are lacking, but 
showing emotions is forbidden. That's why the top players are so 
colorless and boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I throw a racket, I'm mad at myself,'' he said. ``I'm not  
trying to kill anybody. So why do I have to be penalized right 
away?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker has cut back on his playing schedule the past two seasons  
to concentrate on his business interests. 
</P>
<P>
	He attacked the heavy schedule of players that led to an exodus  
of top names withdrawing from the season-ending ATP Championships 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened at the end of last season can't be allowed to  
repeat itself,'' Becker said. ``That was damaging to tennis. All 
the withdrawals make it clear the ATP has to slim down. Less 
tournaments mean higher quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, one of the few return specialists in a sport dominated by  
hard servers, said the game needed to be slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would slow down the balls and the surfaces or brake racket  
development,'' he said. ``Spectators today see a good serve, 
sometimes a return and that's all. They can't enjoy tennis anymore 
because nothing happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ATP has announced plans to streamline the tournament  
schedule while reforming the current computer ranking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios said he favored plans of the ATP Player's Union to market  
the game by casting a three-sided rivalry with him as the bad boy, 
Pete Sampras as the nice guy and Australia's Pat Rafter as the 
favorite of female fans because of his good looks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's OK that way,'' he said. ``It's the truth: We're the best  
and we need this rivalry to make the game interesting again.''

<HEADLINE>  Travelers Stuck in Storm Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Frustration grew to tears Monday as travelers waited for  
airlines and airports to recover from the crippling weekend 
snowstorm in the Midwest, and a new onslaught of snow shut down the 
snow-smart city of Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	School was out for hundreds of districts from Iowa to New  
Hampshire because of slippery roads and sidewalks, and Purdue 
University in Indiana shut down operations for the first time since 
1984, although classes were on winter break. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 59 deaths were blamed on the storm from Nebraska across  
the Midwest into Canada and New England, and cold air that rolled 
southward behind the storm was blamed for two deaths in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the storm piled near-record amounts of snow on  
the Midwest, shutting down railroads, highways and towns and 
airline flights, tempers frayed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport as 
Northwest Airlines skipped all morning flights because of the ice 
and drifting snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a series of: You go to a gate, you wait in line for  
an hour, you get on standby for a flight, you wait an hour for the 
flight, then get delayed,'' groused Roger von Doenhoss, who had 
been waiting since Saturday for a flight home to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they told us the plane was frozen. So then, the crew  
becomes illegal (over legal duty hours) because it takes too long 
to take off and the flight gets canceled, so you start all over 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Brown of Ann Arbor, Mich., had been trying for two days  
to get his grandson on a flight home to Florida, and spent part of 
the time watching people. 
</P>
<P>
	``One lady had been here two days and couldn't understand why  
she couldn't be first in line for the next departure,'' Brown said. 
``She broke into tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed up and walked around this stupid airport all  
night,'' said Asuka Hirayma, 16, trying to continue her trip from 
Osaka, Japan, to Boston. ``There was nothing to do. It's so boring. 
I hate this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of flights also had been canceled at Toronto's Pearson  
International Airport, and Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
International said it could be Wednesday before the backlog was 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were nearly back to normal Monday at Chicago's O'Hare  
International Airport, where nearly two feet of snow fell. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were long lines as Monday morning business  
travelers mixed with people waiting since their weekend flights 
were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	As far away as Denver, about 800 passengers were waiting for  
connections Monday, said Tom Renville of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, Gov. Jim Edgar on Monday declared the entire state  
a disaster area. In addition to allowing the state to coordinate 
state resources to aid local governments, the declaration makes 
possible a request for federal assistance for counties that 
demonstrate the need. 
</P>
<P>
	The drifting, blowing snow also snarled travel on the ground.  
Sections of four Indiana highways were closed Monday afternoon, 
down from 14 in the morning, but an 81-mile stretch of Interstate 
65 in northwestern Indiana was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 highway refugees forced off I-65 had spent part of  
the weekend at Faith Baptist Church in Lafayette, Ind., many 
sleeping head-to-toe on pews and floors, and they rushed for the 
doors Monday when the highway reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	``The church people and the Red Cross did an awful lot of work.  
They had everything you could want,'' said Kathy Colvin of LaPorte, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana legislative leaders postponed the beginning of their  
1999 session from Tuesday until at least Wednesday because of the 
travel problems. 
</P>
<P>
	While the storm itself was gone, the wind and cold air it left  
behind brought a threat of more snow around parts of the Great 
Lakes, including a foot forecast in western Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo, N.Y., got so much lake-effect snow fed by moisture from  
Lake Erie that nonessential travel in the city was banned Monday, 
and the airport and all public offices were closed. Snow fell at a 
rate of up to 2 inches an hour and wind gusting to 45 mph caused 
blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing is to have thousands of cars on the road,''  
said Mayor Anthony Masiello. 
</P>
<P>
	By 9 p.m., nearly 13 inches of snow had fallen, and another  
less-severe band of snow was expected to move through late Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is outrageous. This is just crazy!'' said Rena Crocker as  
she walked along a snow-blanketed Buffalo street with her 
7-year-old son, Julian, who was bundled up all the way to his eyes 
and snow-covered lashes. Low on groceries, the two were headed to a 
friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had such a beautiful winter so far,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Buffalo averages 93.2 inches of snow each winter, it  
didn't start this season until 7.1 inches fell on Christmas Day.

	GOP Clears Clinton Speech in House  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's invitation to deliver a  
State of the Union address on Jan. 19 stands, House Republican 
leaders decided today, despite a looming impeachment trial in the 
Senate. This weekend, senators from both parties had suggested such 
a speech delivered in Congress before lawmakers would be 
inappropriate because of the trial. ``We expect to see him on the 
19th,'' said a spokesman for incoming House speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq today warned it could no longer  
protect American and British aid workers in the country from ``deep 
popular anger,'' and insisted the U.N. should replace them for 
safety reasons. U.N. resolutions don't allow Iraq to dictate the 
composition of U.N. teams. Nevertheless, host countries are 
responsible for the safety of U.N. personnel on their territory.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole today announced her resignation  
as president of the American Red Cross in an apparent move to 
pursue a potential White House bid. Dole, wife of 1996 GOP 
presidential candidate Bob Dole, said, ``I believe there may be 
another way for me to serve our country.'' There are plans to form 
a presidential exploratory committee within the next month, 
according to an aide.

	Winter Storm Damage Mounts  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Travelers waited for airlines and airports to  
recover from the winter storm that ravaged the Midwest this weekend 
and left at least 59 dead in its wake. Two days after the storm 
piled near-record amounts of snow across the region, numerous 
railroads, highways and airports were still affected. Hundreds of 
school districts from Iowa to New Hampshire also remain closed 
because of slippery roads and sidewalks.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House plans to allow more contact  
between Americans and Cubans and to substantially increase the 
number of Americans eligible to send money to needy Cubans, senior

	BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) -- Thousands of refugees  
from neighboring Congo have been flooding across the border into 
the Central African Republic to escape fighting in the region,

rebel advances in northern Congo, close to the border with the 
Central African Republic. Congo's President Laurent Kabila has been

	The misery created by the huge winter storm stretched into a  
third day today with frustrated air travelers still waiting for 
flights, highways slippery or clogged by snow and thousands of 
customers with no electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of school districts canceled classes today from Iowa to  
Ohio and in parts of New England. Purdue University in West 
Lafayette, Ind., canceled all classes today for the first time 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Police counted scores of accidents on ice-covered roads from  
Maine to South Carolina, and some Indiana roads were simply closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of desolate out there,'' said Jeff Schneider, a road  
commissioner for Hittle Township in central Illinois. ``I don't see 
anybody but me, and I'm wondering why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 49 deaths had been blamed on the huge snow and ice  
storm in the eastern half of the nation since Friday, many due to 
heart attacks brought on by shoveling snow. An additional seven 
deaths were reported in Ontario, where many towns were virtually 
shut down by 16 inches of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the snow belt, temperatures hit 29 below zero today in  
North Dakota and the wind chill at Morris, Minn., was 64 below. 
Three weekend deaths were blamed on the cold in Oklahoma and 
Nebraska. Even Georgia had lows in the teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Old Man Winter can just go away now and give us  
80-degree weather,'' said Karen Erickson, who found her car covered 
by a snowdrift in Fond du Lac, Wis. ``He made his point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, where 12 people died, 21.6 inches of snow fell at  
O'Hare International Airport from Friday through early Sunday, the 
biggest total for a single storm since 23 inches fell during a 
blizzard in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The blowing snow brought air travel to a near standstill  
Saturday as most major carriers canceled the bulk of their flights 
in and out of Midwest hubs. That made Sunday -- already expected to 
be one of the busiest travel days of the year -- frustrating for 
even the most patient travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines canceled 60 percent of its flights out of  
Chicago on Sunday, and American Airlines canceled at least half. By 
this morning, there were only a few cancellations at the airport, 
but there were still many stranded travelers trying to crowd on 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, Northwest Airlines' largest hub, the company managed  
only a handful of flights Sunday. So many travelers were left 
waiting that Northwest told people not already at the airport to 
stay home and try again later. 
</P>
<P>
	And today, Northwest said, none of its flights would land at  
Detroit before noon and continued cancellations and disruptions 
were expected throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of flights also were canceled Sunday at Toronto's  
Pearson International Airport, and Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
International said it could be Wednesday before the backlog is 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Some roads weren't much better. Sections of 14 Indiana highways  
were closed today, although an 81-mile stretch of Interstate 65 in 
northwestern Indiana was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Highways in parts of the East turned into skating rinks. Four  
people were killed and as many as 23 others injured Sunday in a 
16-vehicle accident on icy Interstate 81 in Virginia. Ice was also 
blamed for a 50-car pileup on New York's Grand Central Parkway and 
a 23-vehicle chain-reaction wreck on I-80 in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	And the snowfall wasn't over. An additional foot was forecast  
today in southwestern Michigan. And Buffalo, N.Y., got so much 
lake-effect snow fed by moisture from Lake Erie today that travel 
in the city was banned, and the airport and all public offices were 
closed. Snow fell at a rate of 1 to 2 inches an hour and wind 
gusting to 45 mph caused blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow turn to sleet and rain as the storm moved eastward.  
More than 2.4 inches of rain fell Sunday in New York City's Central 
Park, a record for the date. Bridgeport, Conn., had a record 2 
inches and Plymouth, Mass., picked up about 4.75 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 450,000 customers across the eastern half of the  
country lost power at some point during the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest hit was South Carolina, where almost a quarter of a  
million customers lost power and roughly 100,000 were still in the 
dark this morning. Duke Energy said it could be Tuesday before all 
power is restored.

<HEADLINE>  Travelers Stuck in Storm Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Frustration grew to tears Monday as travelers waited for  
airlines and airports to recover from the crippling weekend 
snowstorm in the Midwest, and a new onslaught of snow shut down the 
snow-smart city of Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	School was out for hundreds of districts from Iowa to New  
Hampshire because of slippery roads and sidewalks, and Purdue 
University in Indiana shut down operations for the first time since 
1984, although classes were on winter break. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 59 deaths were blamed on the storm from Nebraska across  
the Midwest into Canada and New England, and cold air that rolled 
southward behind the storm was blamed for two deaths in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the storm piled near-record amounts of snow on  
the Midwest, shutting down railroads, highways and towns and 
airline flights, tempers frayed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport as 
Northwest Airlines skipped all morning flights because of the ice 
and drifting snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a series of: You go to a gate, you wait in line for  
an hour, you get on standby for a flight, you wait an hour for the 
flight, then get delayed,'' groused Roger von Doenhoss, who had 
been waiting since Saturday for a flight home to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they told us the plane was frozen. So then, the crew  
becomes illegal (over legal duty hours) because it takes too long 
to take off and the flight gets canceled, so you start all over 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Brown of Ann Arbor, Mich., had been trying for two days  
to get his grandson on a flight home to Florida, and spent part of 
the time watching people. 
</P>
<P>
	``One lady had been here two days and couldn't understand why  
she couldn't be first in line for the next departure,'' Brown said. 
``She broke into tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed up and walked around this stupid airport all  
night,'' said Asuka Hirayma, 16, trying to continue her trip from 
Osaka, Japan, to Boston. ``There was nothing to do. It's so boring. 
I hate this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of flights also had been canceled at Toronto's Pearson  
International Airport, and Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
International said it could be Wednesday before the backlog was 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were nearly back to normal Monday at Chicago's O'Hare  
International Airport, where nearly two feet of snow fell. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were long lines as Monday morning business  
travelers mixed with people waiting since their weekend flights 
were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	As far away as Denver, about 800 passengers were waiting for  
connections Monday, said Tom Renville of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, Gov. Jim Edgar on Monday declared the entire state  
a disaster area. In addition to allowing the state to coordinate 
state resources to aid local governments, the declaration makes 
possible a request for federal assistance for counties that 
demonstrate the need. 
</P>
<P>
	The drifting, blowing snow also snarled travel on the ground.  
Sections of four Indiana highways were closed Monday afternoon, 
down from 14 in the morning, but an 81-mile stretch of Interstate 
65 in northwestern Indiana was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 highway refugees forced off I-65 had spent part of  
the weekend at Faith Baptist Church in Lafayette, Ind., many 
sleeping head-to-toe on pews and floors, and they rushed for the 
doors Monday when the highway reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	``The church people and the Red Cross did an awful lot of work.  
They had everything you could want,'' said Kathy Colvin of LaPorte, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana legislative leaders postponed the beginning of their  
1999 session from Tuesday until at least Wednesday because of the 
travel problems. 
</P>
<P>
	While the storm itself was gone, the wind and cold air it left  
behind brought a threat of more snow around parts of the Great 
Lakes, including a foot forecast in western Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo, N.Y., got so much lake-effect snow fed by moisture from  
Lake Erie that nonessential travel in the city was banned Monday, 
and the airport and all public offices were closed. Snow fell at a 
rate of up to 2 inches an hour and wind gusting to 45 mph caused 
blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing is to have thousands of cars on the road,''  
said Mayor Anthony Masiello. 
</P>
<P>
	By 9 p.m., nearly 13 inches of snow had fallen, and another  
less-severe band of snow was expected to move through late Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is outrageous. This is just crazy!'' said Rena Crocker as  
she walked along a snow-blanketed Buffalo street with her 
7-year-old son, Julian, who was bundled up all the way to his eyes 
and snow-covered lashes. Low on groceries, the two were headed to a 
friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had such a beautiful winter so far,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Buffalo averages 93.2 inches of snow each winter, it  
didn't start this season until 7.1 inches fell on Christmas Day.

<HEADLINE> Cell Injections Suppress HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the first time, researchers have suppressed HIV in infected  
patients by giving them injections of cells made from their own 
immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the latest drugs, many patients show little sign of  
HIV infection in their blood but carry lingering traces of the AIDS 
virus in lymph nodes and other hard-to-reach places. The new 
approach could point to new paths for destroying such remnants of 
the virus, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they say the new technique can't be used immediately to  
treat large numbers of patients, it is encouraging because it 
appears to curb the virus temporarily in lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``An area we want to consider is: Is it possible to rid somebody  
of infection?'' said the study's chief author, virologist Scott 
Brodie at the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The new research will be published Tuesday in the January issue  
of the monthly journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	HIV propagates by attacking a kind of immune cell known as a  
helper T-cell. The researchers chose three patients and isolated 
from their bodies another type of white blood cell, known as a 
killer T-cell, which destroys HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	By cloning and other means, they grew huge numbers of each  
patient's killer T-cells in a laboratory and genetically engineered 
some with markers to trace their movement within the body. They 
then reinjected massive amounts back into each patient and traced 
the migrating cells to lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	There, the new killer T-cells knocked down the number of  
infected helper T-cells, in some cases to undetectable levels, 
according to the researchers. The effect was temporary, though, as 
the new cells disappeared within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dr. Roger Pomerantz, chief of infectious diseases at  
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, who is familiar with the 
research, called it an exciting early step toward eradicating HIV 
``where it hides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While praising the long-term value of the work, Dr. Anthony  
Fauci, who is working on his own treatment to eradicate virus 
remnants, cautioned that the University of Washington technique is 
so advanced that it limits immediate practical use. ``It's too 
expensive, it's too time-consuming, it's too complicated,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another AIDS study appearing Tuesday in Nature Medicine points  
to a second approach in replenishing the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that an HIV infection shortens the life span  
of both killer and helper T-cells to less than a third of normal, 
and production of replacement cells lags behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Many researchers have theorized that HIV irreparably breaks down  
the body's cell-replacement capacity through overuse. 
</P>
<P>
	This study, however, suggests otherwise: that the replacement  
capacity survives and can be refreshed with standard HIV treatment, 
known as a drug cocktail. The researchers said the standard 
treatment seems somehow to increase the production of immune cells 
by an average of three or four times. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists say this research will intensify the search for  
ways of reviving the body's ability to fight disease once it is 
damaged by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief author, Dr. Marc Hellerstein of the University of  
California, San Francisco, said such research should ultimately 
show whether later-stage AIDS patients largely cleared of infection 
through drug therapy can ``really regenerate normalcy in their 
immune systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McCune, another member of the research team, suggested  
such approaches also might apply to cancer and other diseases.

<HEADLINE> Ticker Symbols Get New Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mergers, corporate spinoffs and name changes may  
affect the newspaper stock listing you've followed for years. 
</P>
<P>
	These changes in stock market tables at the start of 1999 are  
among the notable moves: 
</P>
<P>
	--The takeover of Amoco Corp. by British Petroleum Co. PLC was  
completed as 1998 ended. The new company is called BP Amoco PLC, 
with a trading symbol of BPA, and appears in newspaper New York 
Stock Exchange lists as BP Amoco. 
</P>
<P>
	--Although known as Alcoa since 1929, Aluminum Company of  
America, the world's largest producer of aluminum, is making it 
official by changing it's name to Alcoa Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh-based company made the change to reflect the  
global scope of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The name used in newspaper stock tables still is Alcoa, but the  
listing changes places alphabetically in The Associated Press 
tables, which are alphabetized by full corporate name. 
</P>
<P>
	--Washington Water Power Co., the Spokane-based energy producer,  
has changed it's name to Avista Corp. Deregulation has moved the 
company out of its traditional Northwest service area so company 
officials figured it was time to leave the geographic-based name 
behind. The ticker symbol and newspaper abbreviation on the NYSE 
has changed from WWP, WashWtr, to AVA, Avista. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two Nashville, Tenn.-based Real Estate Investment Trusts, or  
REITs, that own correctional facilities, CCA Prison Realty Trust, 
and Corrections Corp. of America, have merged to become Prison 
Realty Corp. The ticker symbol is PZN and the newspaper listing on 
NYSE tables is PrisonR. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hilton Hotels has spun off it's casino gaming businesses, which  
is now called Park Place Entertainment. Hilton shareholders got 
Park Place shares on a one-for-one basis. Park Place closed at 
$7.50 a share Monday, which was reflected in Hilton's stock, which 
was about $19 before the spinoff but was shown on the tables as 
rising $1.87 1/2 to $14.62 1/2 Monday after adjusting for the separation 
of the businesses. The NYSE ticker is PPE. The newspaper listing is 
ParkPl n. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rockwell International, the aerospace giant, spun off Conexant  
Systems at the rate of one-half share for each share of Rockwell 
held. Conexant became the world's largest company that exclusively 
provides semiconductor products for communications applications. 
Rockwell shares went from $48.56 1/4 before the move to $41.12 1/2 to 
reflect the distribution. The Nasdaq ticker for Conexant is CNXT. 
It appears as Conexnt n in listings. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bindley Western Industries, an Indianapolis-based drug  
wholesaler, spun off Priority Healthcare, a provider of specialty 
pharmaceuticals and related medical supplies. Bindley holders got 
0.448 of a Priority share, which put Bindley shares at $31.81 1/4 from 
the previous $49. The Nasdaq ticker for Priority is PHCC. The 
newspaper listing is PriHlthc. Bindley's NYSE ticker is BDY, and is 
Bindley s in NYSE tables. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cincinnati Bell, with a ticker symbol of CSN, distributed  
shares of its customer service and billing subsidiary, Convergys 
Corp, on a one-for-one basis. The move took Cincinnati Bell's 
shares from $37.81 1/4 to $17.43 3/4. The NYSE ticker of Convergys is CVG 
and newspaper name is Cnvrgys n.

<HEADLINE> Gas Explosion in Western Virginia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WYTHEVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A leaking natural gas line exploded in  
western Virginia, destroying a home and business and lighting up 
the pre-dawn sky with an orange glow that could be seen for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was killed in the explosion early Sunday, but two  
firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the flames that took 
four hours to bring under control. Several thousand people were 
left without heat in temperatures below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion and fire at a substation of United Cities Gas  
about 65 miles west of Roanoke destroyed Stuart Crigger's house and 
a motorcycle shop belonging to Dwight Grubb. 
</P>
<P>
	Crigger was at work at the time, but his four cats were killed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They told me if I was in the house, I would have been killed  
because my bedroom was right next to the substation,'' said 
Crigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Grubb lost his entire inventory. ``There's nothing left,'' said  
his wife, Margaret Anne. 
</P>
<P>
	People as far as 20 miles away could see the fire.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like the sun was coming up. It looked like a big  
orange glow in the sky at 2 a.m.,'' said John Eastwood, Wytheville 
fire inspector. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the leak was under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	United Cities had to cut off service to about 1,500 homes and  
businesses, and crews worked overnight to restore service, said 
spokeswoman Judy Moss.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Sets Up Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King has gone online with an  
official World Wide Web site to counter thousands of ``unofficial'' 
sites that sometimes propagate misinformation about him. 
</P>
<P>
	The site (www.stephenking.com) was receiving ``hits'' even  
before its official debut in the middle of last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The two staffers in the horror writer's Bangor office who answer  
about 400 letters a week knew they had to do something after they 
started getting letters containing the phrase ``I saw on your Web 
site...'' 
</P>
<P>
	People were sending books for King to sign, manuscripts for him  
to review and questions for him to answer personally all because 
they'd read on the Internet that he did those things. 
</P>
<P>
	King agreed to his own online presence so fans will be assured  
of getting facts, not rumors, said Marsha DeFilippo, his assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	And some of the rumors are pretty crazy, said William Thornton,  
production director for I-Forge Design Factory, a Web design and 
corporate image-shaping business in Winslow, which developed King's 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a rumor floating around that he's retired,'' said  
Thornton. ``Some of them will say that on Halloween he gives tours 
of his house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of online pages contain pictures, data, music,  
games, puzzles, drawings and writings about King. Hundreds of 
pages, created in countries around the world, are devoted strictly 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sites have names like The Stephen King House O'Love, Hungarian  
Stephen King Headquarters and Wilkomman auf Meiner King Page. 
</P>
<P>
	There are Web pages devoted to the beer King's characters drink;  
people named Stephen King; and what makes the real King tick. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone in Greece publishes a monthly electronic magazine,  
dubbed Insomnia, devoted to King. There are several e-mail lists, 
newsgroups and real-time chat channels focused on King. 
</P>
<P>
	Even his own name has not always been his. The Web address  
``stephenking.com'' was registered by the Book of the Month Club 
until King managed to get it back from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	King himself is not a wired guy. He doesn't spend his free time  
surfing the Web or hanging out in Internet chat rooms. He has never 
published an e-mail address for himself or his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been avoiding it for years, which is why I think we  
haven't had (a site) sooner,'' DeFilippo said.

<HEADLINE> Winning America's Cup Yacht Saved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Team New Zealand sailors tore off  
their shirts and formed a bucket brigade to save their America's 
Cup-winning boat from sinking in the Hauraki Gulf Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Black Magic II began taking on water a few miles north of  
Rangitoto Island after her rudder broke. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of the boat, one of the two in which New Zealand won  
the Cup in 1995, heard a bang and rushed below deck, finding 
themselves knee-deep in water. 
</P>
<P>
	Team New Zealand designer Tom Schnackenberg, who was on board,  
said it was all hands below deck to stop the boat from going under. 
</P>
<P>
	``The water was coming in pretty fast,'' he said. ``The boys  
took their shirts off and we were chucking them around the hole to 
try to plug it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the bucket brigade going and we were using our drink  
pump, which makes fresh water, to try to empty it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The local Coast Guard came to the boat's rescue with three  
larger pumps and the Auckland police launch Deodar arrived with 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we hadn't been able to stop the water coming in, we would  
have sunk pretty easily,'' Schnackenberg said. ``If the hull was 
weaker around the rudder we would have been in a lot more 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black Magic II had been racing against Black Magic I when it hit  
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the seawater was drained, the yacht was towed back to the  
America's Cup village at the Viaduct Basin by Team New Zealand 
towboats.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall at Mid-Session / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar dropped to its lowest level in almost 19  
months on Tuesday amid growing pessimism about the outlook for the 
American economy. Japanese stocks declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.54 yen at midday, down 2.32 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo and also below its level of 112.07 yen in New York. 
The dollar last traded below the 112 yen level in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 256.92 points, or 1.92 percent, to  
13,158.97 points at the end of the morning trading session. On 
Monday, the average lost 426.28 points, or 3.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar fell as low as 110.79 yen early  
on but staged a partial recovery later as traders rushed to cover 
short, or oversold, positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency was expected to continue to face selling  
pressure, however. Traders attribute the dollar's weakness to a 
narrowing interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan, as 
well as growing pessimism about the prospects for American economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A late-afternoon downturn Monday on Wall Street also weighed on  
the Japanese market. The sudden drop in New York was triggered by a 
U.S. Federal Reserve official's warning economic growth was 
unlikely to continue growing at its current pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,184.27 points  
Monday, up just 2.84 points. It had gained as much as 168.64 points

<P>
	Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, said Tuesday that the  
yen's surge against the dollar was due largely to the euro's debut 
on currency markets, Kyodo News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro's birth is probably a new factor in the markets,'' he  
was quoted as saying, adding that he expects rates to stabilize in 
a month or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, officially introduced on markets Monday, was trading  
at $1.1820 midday in Tokyo, lower than $1.1828 late Monday in New 
York. The euro was at $1.1873 in Tokyo late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the euro traded quietly against the dollar in Tokyo,  
the new European currency gyrated wildly against the yen on its 
second official trading day. It swung between 132.88 yen and 130.94 
yen in morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was at 132.21 yen as of midday, down from 132.76 yen  
earlier in Tokyo and below 132.39 yen in New York late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plunge below 131.00 yen was blamed on position unwinding by  
people who bought too much of the new currency during its debut on 
Monday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments by Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's influential deputy  
finance minister for international affairs, also propped up the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking about an article in Tuesday's Nihon Keizai business  
daily in which he was quoted predicting a stronger yen in 1999, 
Sakakibara said, ``I only meant that the dollar won't rise to the 
140 yen level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo stock market, prices opened lower due to a  
strengthening yen and the gloomy outlook for the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors fear the yen's rally may cause some Japanese companies  
to revise downward their profit forecasts for the current fiscal 
year, which concludes at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is weak and the yen is strong, so many companies  
could be forced to revise earnings down this month or next,'' said 
Yoshihiko Kuroichi, manager of the research department at Kankaku 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section shed 18.50 points, or 1.77 percent, to 1046.42 
points. The TOPIX closed down 22.07 points, or 2.03 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.960  
percent from Monday's finish of 1.990 percent, driving its price up 
to 98.72 from 98.48 yen.

<HEADLINE> Schiphol Airport To Get Renovated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Schiphol Airport will spend 1  
billion guilders, or $532 million, on renovations this year to 
accommodate a rising number of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast-growing airport on the outskirts of Amsterdam will  
renovate and expand its central waiting lounge and build a new 
shopping center for passengers, Schiphol president Gerlach 
Cerfontaine said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerfontaine said that Schiphol, Europe's fourth busiest airport,  
expects passenger traffic to increase 7 percent this year compared 
to 1998 while cargo traffic should rise 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing preliminary figures, Cerfontaine said 34.4 million  
passengers traveled through Schiphol in 1998, up 9 percent from 
1997, while cargo freight was unchanged at 1.16 billion tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial crisis in Asia, the relocation of several airlines  
from Schiphol early last year and capacity limitations at the 
airport all depressed growth in cargo traffic in 1998, Schiphol 
said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress convenes this week with Senate  
leaders still looking for a middle-ground approach that ends 
President Clinton's impeachment trial quickly while satisfying 
conservatives' demands for full presentation of his alleged crimes. 
The 106th Congress goes into session Wednesday and senators will 
immediately huddle to consider a plan that could end the 
impeachment process within four days. If, as expected, a two-thirds 
majority is not reached, the Senate could then, with a simple 
majority vote, adjourn the trial and consider a censure against 
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Make Basic NFL Playoff Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The song was ``New York, New York.''  
The singer was defensive lineman John Jurkovic. And the refrain 
echoed through the hallways at Alltel Stadium Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jacksonville Jaguars are going to New York to play the Jets  
in a second-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: In their 25-10 victory over the New England  
Patriots, they accomplished the two things coach Tom Coughlin has 
been talking about for more than a year -- running the ball and 
stopping the run. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a year ago this week that the Jaguars returned home from  
a 42-17 wild-card loss at Denver where they allowed 310 yards 
rushing and gained only 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Improving in both areas became Coughlin's year long obsession  
and on Sunday, the work paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Taylor rushed for 162 yards, the third-highest postseason  
total by a rookie. The defense allowed only 35 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive effort was surprising, considering the Jaguars had  
allowed 180 rushing yards to the Minnesota Vikings two weeks ago 
and 205 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Minnesota totals and Steelers totals were not something I  
was very excited about on defense,'' Coughlin said. ``But we made a 
good stand and played with outstanding intensity. It was one of our 
overall better defensive games, to the point where the ability to 
follow our game plan all the way through, was as (good) as what 
we've done all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars held Robert Edwards to 28 yards on 17 carries and  
didn't allow a run of more than seven yards. It was an important 
step forward at the right time for a rush defense ranked 22nd in 
the NFL after the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	New England came in averaging 153 yards rushing in its previous  
three games, but never got going against the suddenly stout 
Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what we were statistically, I don't care what we  
were statistically,'' said Jurkovic, a run-stopping specialist. 
``We did win 11 games in the regular season and you don't win 11 
games in the NFL without having a halfway decent defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's performance wasn't as big a surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	He did it with his usual mix of power and speed. His best play  
wasn't necessarily his longest. Rather, it was a 21-yard gain in 
which he headed right, stopped quickly, pivoted and headed toward 
the left sideline while pointing Tony Boselli towards a block 
downfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just dove at some guy and completely whiffed,'' Boselli  
said. ``I made him run behind me. You're not going to catch Fred if 
you get him running behind a block.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars know it's Taylor's big-play potential that gives  
them their best chance at New York, especially with quarterback 
Mark Brunell still bothered by an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell said he didn't worsen the injury against the Patriots,  
although he took a direct hit to the ankle just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin conceded the days of Brunell scrambling and making  
plays outside the pocket could be over for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's going to ever be -- in this season -- what  
you'll see next preseason,'' Coughlin said. ``These things have a 
way of limiting you. But we'll see. We have plenty of things 
available to us if he can't move well enough.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marshall Perlin, a civil-liberties lawyer who  
worked on the Rosenberg atomic-bomb spy case, died Thursday after a 
brief illness. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlin represented the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and  
Morton Sobell, the Rosenbergs' co-defendant. The Rosenbergs were 
electrocuted in 1953 after their conviction on charges of plotting 
to deliver atomic-bomb secrets to the Soviet Union. Sobell spent 
nearly 19 years in prison before his parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlin, who entered the case after the sentencing, argued court  
motions that resulted in hundreds of thousands of pages of 
Rosenberg documents being publicly released. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosenbergs' children, Robert and Michael Meeropol, had asked  
Perlin to reopen the case and prove that their parents had been 
framed. Perlin challenged the CIA, the FBI and the Justice 
Department to release classified papers under the Freedom of 
Information Act.

</P>
<P>
	TEMPLETON, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry Quarry, a popular heavyweight  
boxer who fought Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson and eventually 
lapsed into a punch-drunk fog, died Sunday after being taken off 
life support. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry was hospitalized Dec. 28 with pneumonia and then suffered  
cardiac arrest while at Twin Cities Community Hospital. He died 
after family members told doctors to remove him from life support. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry, who earned $2.1 million in purses as a top contender in  
the 1960s and '70s, later lived on Social Security checks. By the 
age of 50, the pounding he had taken in the ring turned him into a 
confused, childlike man whose relatives had to take care of him. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered from dementia pugilistica, severe brain damage  
caused by repeated blows to the head. Neurological tests revealed 
early signs of dementia in 1982, before his short-term memory loss 
and motor skills deteriorated so noticeably and before his last 
three fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the highlights of Quarry's career were two fights against  
Patterson, the former heavyweight champion. The first ended in a 
draw, and he won the second on a controversial split decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry, a 6-foot, 195-pounder, earned his biggest payday of  
$338,000 by fighting Ali when Ali returned from his banishment from 
boxing in 1970.

<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- James Herbert Taylor, who made notable  
contributions to the science of molecular genetics, died Tuesday. 
He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, a professor emeritus of biology at Florida State  
University, was an organizer of the American Society for Cell 
Biology, and served as its president in 1969 and 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a professor at Columbia University when he proved in  
collaboration with colleagues at the Brookhaven National Laboratory 
that DNA in higher organisms preserves its continuity as unbroken 
molecular chains during replication. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was appointed professor of molecular biology at the  
Institute of Molecular Biophysics at Florida State in 1964. In 
1971, he was recognized for his original research by election to 
the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor retired from teaching in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Dole Quits Red Cross, Eyes 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, wife of 1996 GOP presidential  
candidate Bob Dole, announced her resignation from the American Red 
Cross today, apparently to pursue a potential White House bid of 
her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, in announcing her departure, hinted of her  
aspirations. ``At this important time in our national life, I 
believe there may be another way for me to serve our country. The 
Red Cross has been a glorious mission field, but I believe there 
may be other duties yet to fulfill,'' she told employees of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and allies said she didn't want to explore her  
presidential aspirations while still affiliated with the 
nonpartisan Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she wants the opportunity to seriously consider it and  
you can't really do that when running a $2 billion nonprofit 
organization,'' said Jenna Dorn, president of the National Health 
Museum and a Dole friend. 
</P>
<P>
	One Dole adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there  
are plans to form a presidential exploratory committee within the 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's announcement comes as another GOP hopeful appears to  
be getting a case of cold feet. Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., a 
conservative former governor who spent the last year laying the 
groundwork for a presidential campaign, has told at least one 
backer he is not likely to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Several supporters and Republican operatives said over the  
weekend they believe he will not take the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft is scheduled to announce his intentions Tuesday. None  
of the officials professed to know for certain what Ashcroft had 
decided to do, which is notable because until recently the senator 
was widely expected to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us want him to run -- his staff and supporters,''  
spokeswoman Juleanne Glover said today. ``He's clearly had the best 
year of anybody considering running. But the only announcement of 
his intentions will be made by himself, the senator, (Tuesday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several backers, particularly Missouri financial supporters, are  
said to be urging Ashcroft to concentrate on retaining his seat in 
2000. Popular Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan has decided to challenge 
Ashcroft. 
</P>
<P>
	Running for the presidency and re-election to the Senate would  
be tricky for Ashcroft: He has been courting social conservative 
leaders in his White House bid, a move that backers say could put 
him at odds with mainstream voters in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts last month to reshape his message for a broader, more  
moderate national audience drew criticism from social conservatives 
such as Paul Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's departure from the American Red Cross frees her up  
to decide whether she could raise the money and build enough 
support to run for president, several friends and allies said. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mrs. Dole  
recently decided that she wants to run for president but must still 
determine whether she could mount a viable campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's pretty serious about this and would not have left the  
Red Cross if she wasn't,'' said pollster Tony Fabrizio, who worked 
for Bob Dole. ``I'm sure she's given this a lot of thought and I'm 
sure she's preparing herself to commit herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fabrizio said Mrs. Dole would mount a serious challenge to Texas  
Gov. George Bush and millionaire Steve Forbes, both considered 
early front runners for the GOP nomination though neither has 
announced their candidacies. ``I think she turns this campaign 
upside down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole is considered a strong prospect for a vice  
presidential nomination whether or not she runs for president, 
Republicans activists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole was a Cabinet member in two Republican  
administrations, serving as President Reagan's transportation 
secretary and President Bush's labor secretary. Earlier, she held 
staff positions in the White House and was a member of the Federal 
Trade Commission.

<HEADLINE> Trucks of Future Look Like Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- More automakers are blurring the line between car  
and truck in their latest offerings on display at the North 
American International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	What some consider the dawn of new-age SUVs became more evident  
Monday, when manufacturers during the North American International 
Auto Show unveiled everything from sport utes with pickup-truck 
beds to vehicles that are part sedan, part SUV, part van. 
</P>
<P>
	That's logical to analyst Art Spinella of CNW Marketing  
Research, which has found that defections of SUV owners to anything 
kind of vehicle have risen yearly from 9 percent in 1995 to 26 
percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've effectively said we've had an SUV, it was fun, and now  
it's time to try something else,'' he said by telephone from his 
Oregon office. ``What it really shows is that an SUV line has to be 
faddish for its drivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new arrivals:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Nissan Motor Co.'s Xterra, touted by the Japanese automaker as  
a midsize SUV meant to attract active, young outdoor enthusiasts 
ready to use the vehicle's cargo bay for mountain bikes and its 
rear-door compartments for first aid kits or tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan expects the Xterra -- pronounced x-TEAR-uh -- to go into  
production in March at its Smyrna, Tenn., plant and reach showrooms 
in May. The company expects the Xterra -- with available four- and 
6-cylinder engines -- would compete with and be priced competitively 
to the smaller Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, perhaps in the low 
$20,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ford Motor Co.'s Explorer Sport Trac, which is an Explorer SUV  
cab mated to a 4 1/2-foot bed adapted from the Ranger pickup truck. 
Ford is targeting consumers considering SUVs, sports coupes and 
compact pickups. The automaker expects the Sport Trac to hit 
showrooms early next year but did not immediately specify the 
vehicle's price. 
</P>
<P>
	To Ford's design chief J Mays, ``it's all a redefinition of what  
we know as a car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks different because it is different and represents the  
birth of an entirely new segment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford last week introduced the Lincoln Blackwood concept truck --  
another SUV-pickup hybrid -- at the Los Angeles auto show. It 
combines a short, aluminum-lined pickup bed to the front end and 
cab of the company's high-profit Lincoln Navigator. A production 
version could reach showrooms within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	-- BMW's X5, a luxury car-like SUV dubbed by the German automaker  
as a ``sport activity vehicle.'' It's BMW's first sport utility and 
has its own, unique platform and -- to its creator -- the luxury 
attributes and smooth ride the company long has touted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a BMW through and through,'' said BMW board member  
Wolfgang Reitzle. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to specify how many X5s the company expects to  
initially produce at its Spartanburg, S.C., plant. Reitzle said the 
base price would be below $40,000, with an eight-cylinder version 
to fetch less than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking further down the road, Mitsubishi unveiled its ``Mad  
Max,'' a futuristic, boxy concept machine the Japanese automaker 
describes as a ``super sports utility'' perhaps fitting for the 
roads beyond Thunderdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Nissan will unveil its concept called the ``SUT,'' or  
sport utility truck. Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division will debut a 
crossover SUV hybrid off a Contour platform, and Hyundai will 
introduce a car-based SUV.

<HEADLINE> Black Farmers May Settle Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is about to make a  
multimillion-dollar settlement with black farmers who claim the 
department discriminates in the awarding of loans and subsidies, a 
spokesman for the farmers says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's imminent,'' Sam Taylor told The Associated Press on  
Monday. Attorneys were expected to meet sometime today with the 
judge overseeing a lawsuit that had sought $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very, very few points that are not in agreement,''  
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on how many farmers qualify, the settlement could cost  
the government as much as $375 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- claiming years of discrimination through denial of  
farm loans, crop subsidies and other benefits -- was filed in 1997, 
shortly after the Agriculture Department admitted its own process 
of resolving discrimination complaints had been in disarray and had 
caused a huge backlog. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, farmers taking part in the lawsuit would  
get $50,000 tax-free payments from the government and any debts to 
the government would be erased, Taylor said. The average farmer's 
debt is between $75,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs say they already have 1,000 names in the lawsuit  
and estimate that as many as 2,000 more farmers could join the 
settlement. The government has used lower estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	While not confirming an agreement, Tom Amontree, spokesman for  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, said, ``The president and 
secretary put in a lot of time on this issue and it looks like all 
that hard work is paying off. We hope to have a settlement soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys on both sides are pushing to finalize the deal before  
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman goes on a two-week vacation 
Wednesday, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 1. It covers claims  
from 1997 back to 1983, the year the Reagan administration 
disbanded the department's office of civil rights. The office was 
restored in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement being finalized has three options for farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	The majority of farmers are expected to take the first option,  
which includes the $50,000 payment, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We surmise at least 85 to 95 percent of all claimants'' will  
take the first option because it has a lower standard of proof, 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second category is for farmers who have a better-documented  
case of discrimination and much higher damages, Taylor said. Those 
farmers would agree to have their cases settled by an independent 
arbitrator to be appointed by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The final category would be an ``opt out'' category for a small  
group of farmers who are party to the lawsuit but may be near 
independent settlements with the Agriculture Department. Officials 
have been unable to settle those cases while the lawsuit was 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending deal is significantly higher than the  
$15,000-per-farmer offer the agency made this summer, plaintiffs 
said. But it still is less than the $3 billion the farmers 
initially sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman gave the plaintiffs a significant victory in October  
when he agreed to certify them as a class. That same month, the 
department's inspector general complained that the agency's civil 
rights office remained in disarray with a significant backlog. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing in November, Friedman chastised attorneys over  
their inability to reach a settlement and questioned why the 
government, which had admitted discrimination, was unable to reach 
a deal.

<HEADLINE> New Beetle Named Car of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Volkswagen's New Beetle and the redesigned Jeep  
Grand Cherokee were named the 1999 North American car and truck of 
the year Sunday by a panel of automotive journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of the popular New Beetle came as no surprise,  
given its unusual design and the long waiting lists of those who 
were willing to buy the car even before it arrived in showrooms 
last year. The modern interpretation of the original Beetle has 
been an automotive phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	But Volkswagen AG Chairman Ferdinand Piech said he was caught  
off guard. He lost a $20 bet with Volkswagen board member Klaus 
Kocks that the Bug wouldn't win. Piech said he came to that 
conclusion when VW officials had not heard from the panel before 
Monday's awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I paid and I'm happy I could pay,'' Piech said. ``I'm happy to  
lose it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Beetle recently went on sale in Europe and eventually will  
be sold in Asia as well. Piech said he has been surprised at its 
popularity in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't expect that it would have the same breakthrough in  
Europe,'' he said. ``We thought Europe was more for the Golf, 
America was more the Beetle. But now, Beetle sells in both places 
very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piech said he believes one reason the car has done so well in  
the United States is that it was designed here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grand Cherokee was redesigned for 1999 and has followed in  
the successful footsteps of the original. The midsize sport utility 
vehicle was introduced in 1992 and has been one of DaimlerChrylser 
AG's most successful and profitable vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual awards are presented at the North American  
International Auto Show.

<HEADLINE> Sniper Opens Fire on I-80 in Nev. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A man was shot in the chest Monday by a sniper  
targeting traffic on Interstate 80. Three other vehicles were hit 
by gunfire, forcing the closure of the highway from the outskirts 
of Reno to the California state line. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded man was able to drive several miles to a fire  
station. He was hospitalized with a wound that police said wasn't 
life-threatening. Two other people were hurt by flying glass from 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of law officers, a SWAT team and two helicopters from the  
Nevada Highway Patrol were searching the area as the interstate 
remained closed in both directions Monday afternoon for about 10 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for somebody that likes to shoot at cars,''  
Washoe County sheriff's Sgt. Bob Towery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were having trouble pinpointing where the shots came  
from because the vehicles struck by gunfire all kept moving for 
various distances before pulling off the highway, Towery said. All 
the shootings came between 9 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In two cases, bullets traveled ``right through the center of the  
windshield between the seats,'' Towery said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The window kind of exploded. I heard a loud pop, glass  
shattered in my face,'' Carl Ruggiero of Reno said. ``I thought I 
got hit by a rock from a truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 80 would remain closed until it was deemed safe to  
reopen it, Towery said. Traffic was rerouted along old U.S. 40 
paralleling the interstate.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Challenges No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein said the  
``no-fly'' zones imposed on Iraq flout the will of all Arabs, in 
comments apparently aimed at stoking Arab anger against the United 
States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam called the zones illegal and vowed that Iraq will fight  
violations of its airspace ``with all its courage and bravery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks to his Cabinet on Sunday were his first comments on  
the no-fly zones since top officials said last month that Iraq 
would fire on Western warplanes patrolling the areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The no-fly zones, which cover about two-thirds of Iraq, were set  
up by the United States, Britain and France after the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War to stop Iraq from using its air force against Kurdish 
rebels in northern Iraq and Shiite Muslims in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	Defying Saddam's threats, a U.S.-led force based in Turkey  
resumed patrolling in northern Iraq after the New Year holiday, a 
U.S. official said today in Ankara. 
</P>
<P>
	The flights were resumed Sunday after a two-day break, said  
Senior Airman Adam Stump, a spokesman for Operation Northern Watch, 
which enforces a no-fly area above the 36th parallel in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam said the no-fly zones are ``not only a stark violation of  
international laws and norms, especially those of the United 
Nations, but ... of Security Council resolutions themselves.'' His 
remarks were carried by the official Iraqi News Agency and later 
read on Iraqi television. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they are violating ... is the will of the Arab nation and  
the will of the Iraqi people... which is determined to fight back 
with all its courage and bravery,'' Saddam said. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed to be trying to inflame Arab anger against the United  
States and Britain, which launched four days of airstrikes against 
Iraq in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters took to the streets in several Arab capitals after  
the air raids, but Arab states have taken little action to support 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen  
met this weekend in Egypt to discuss a planned Arab League meeting 
that is expected to formulate the group's stand on the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam also sought to cast doubt on U.S. claims that its planes  
were firing back when they fired missiles and bombs at Iraqi 
anti-aircraft batteries in two recent clashes.

<HEADLINE> London Ready For Euro Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The City of London, the world's largest financial  
center, threw itself into trading of the new single European 
currency today, even though Britain has opted to sit out the 
monetary alliance for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Britain is not participating in the euro, which  
replaces the currencies of 11 of the 15 European Union countries, 
London cannot afford to ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of the world's foreign exchange deals are made in  
London, six times more than in Germany's financial capital, 
Frankfurt. London is home base to 500 international banks. 
</P>
<P>
	And any British investment bank that wants to buy and sell  
shares in European companies will have to be able to do it in 
euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Exchange rates for the 11 currencies were not fixed until  
Thursday, so like their counterparts across Europe, staff at banks 
and other financial firms in the City worked throughout the weekend 
to prepare for the launch, converting their positions into euros 
and changing their systems to ensure a smooth run at the start of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England said Sunday night that the conversion  
appeared to have gone smoothly and that banks were ready. 
Individual banks put the final touches on their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists predicted that trading in the euro may mean a bumpy  
ride for the pound. David Kern, group chief economist for NatWest, 
said currency markets were likely to remain volatile with both the 
pound and the U.S. dollar losing ground to the new euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro and national currencies will operate in parallel until  
2002, when single currency notes and coins will go into circulation 
and supplant the familiar francs, lira and guilders. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has said it will wait to  
decide whether joining the single currency is in Britain's economic 
interest and then put the question to Britons in a referendum.

Fisk and Dale Murphy are rookie candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of holdover hopefuls is also strong with Tony Perez,  
Jim Rice, Tommy John, Gary Carter and Bruce Sutter. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 26 players have been elected in their first year of  
eligibility, but only once have three been taken at the same time -- 
that was at the original election in 1936 when Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, 
Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson were picked. 
</P>
<P>
	And lately, it's been getting harder and harder to get in, as  
300-game winners Don Sutton and Phil Niekro both had to wait 
several years for enshrinement. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 10-year members of the Baseball Writers' Association of  
America have taken a total of only five players in the last six 
elections. It takes 75 percent to make it -- Ryan and Brett are 
considered locks this time, while Yount's chances appear more 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the years, Joe DiMaggio, Roy Campanella and Harmon  
Killebrew were among the candidates who did not get elected on the 
first try. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it comes down to each individual who votes and what  
their criteria is,'' Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that always leads to spirited debates, the kind that  
occur only in baseball. Do fans ever argue whether Phil Simms 
belongs in the NFL hall or if Dominique Wilkins deserves to be in 
the NBA shrine? 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies at Cooperstown are scheduled for July 25.  
The Hall of Fame exhibition will be the next day, and it seems 
fitting that Ryan's Texas Rangers will take on Brett's Kansas City 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall's membership of 237 probably will increase again on  
March 2 when the Veterans Committee votes in Tampa, Fla. Former 
manager Dick Williams and Bill Mazeroski figure to draw support. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, the greatest power pitcher in baseball history, set or  
shared 53 major league records when he retired in 1993 after a 
27-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan struck out 5,714 and went 324-292 for the New York Mets,  
California, Houston and Texas, tying him with Sutton for 12th in 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he never won a Cy Young Award, and despite his .526  
winning percentage ranking the lowest among all 300-game winners, 
Ryan's sheer domination most likely will land him a place in the 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett is 13th on the career hits list with 3,154 and was a  
13-time All-Star. The third baseman hit .305 in a 21-year career 
spent entirely with the Royals, and is expected to easily make it. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount had 3,142 hits in 20 seasons with Milwaukee and won AL MVP  
awards at shortstop and center field. An All-Star only three times, 
his .285 average may put him on the borderline. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since that 1936 election, however, has a player with 3,000  
hits failed to be elected in his first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk (376 HRs) holds baseball's record for most home runs by a  
catcher. In 24 seasons, his most memorable homer was the one that 
won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy (398 HRs) won consecutive NL MVP awards with Atlanta. He  
was a seven-time All-Star and won five straight Gold Gloves in 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez is on the ballot for the eighth time, having come close  
with 68 percent last year. He had 1,652 RBIs, most among eligible 
players not already in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Lolich, 217-191 and MVP of the 1968 World Series, and  
Minnie Minoso, a .298 career hitter, are on the ballot for the 15th 
and final time.

<HEADLINE> Boston College Debuts in Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Talk about coming out of nowhere.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Boston College didn't receive a single vote in The  
Associated Press women's basketball poll. On Monday, thanks to its 
upset of Notre Dame, Boston College received enough votes to be 
ranked 25th -- its first appearance ever in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've worked hard for what we've done this year, but this has  
been something we've been working hard at the last two years, 
especially the junior and senior class,'' BC coach Cathy Inglese 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked as a team about going to the NCAA tournament,  
we've talked about beating top teams,'' she said. ``It's nice when 
you can see all that hard work pay off. It's pretty exciting for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College (10-1) and No. 23 Ohio State (9-3) were the first  
newcomers in the poll in four weeks. But there was no change at the 
top. Connecticut remained No. 1 for the seventh straight week, 
while No. 2 Tennessee and No. 3 Purdue have held those spots for 
five consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (11-0) received 37 of 40 first-place votes from a  
national media panel after posting two more lopsided victories, 
74-43 over Villanova and 116-71 over West Virginia. The Huskies are 
averaging 101.5 points and have an average victory margin of 39. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn had 997 points in the voting, Tennessee (11-1) had 963 and  
Purdue (9-1) 915. Tennessee, which has won 10 straight since its 
loss to Purdue, received the three other first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia (12-0) remained fourth, Louisiana Tech (10-2) was fifth  
and North Carolina (16-1) held at No. 6. Texas Tech moved up one 
spot to seventh and was followed by Colorado State, Notre Dame and 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion jumped three places to lead the second 10 and  
Clemson fell two spots to 12th after suffering its first loss, 
67-66 in overtime to Virginia. Duke climbed four places to 13th and 
was followed by Virginia Tech, Rutgers, Iowa State, Penn State, 
Alabama, Florida and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, Virginia, Ohio State, Memphis and Boston College held  
the final five spots. Santa Clara and George Washington dropped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (9-3), which has won eight of its last nine, broke  
into the Top 25 after a 72-54 victory at Penn State. It's the first 
national ranking for Ohio State since the week of Jan. 3, 1995, 
when the Buckeyes were 22nd -- the only time that season they were 
ranked. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Boston College won 35 games the past two years, the 78-65  
victory over then-No. 7 Notre Dame last week was its first over a 
Top 10 team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles are led by veterans Cal Bouchard, a first-team  
all-Big East pick last season, Whitney Steele and Paula Bacso. 
They're also getting solid play from junior Alissa Murphy and 
freshmen Becky Gottstein and Nicole Conway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really felt if Cal and Paula and Whitney played the same,  
we'd be fine,'' Inglese said. ``The key is Alissa coming in and 
stepping it up. She's probably been our most consistent player. 
When you throw Becky into the mix and Nicole Conway, we've been 
able to develop that depth we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BC's next task is to stay in the Top 25, and the Eagles will be  
challenged immediately. They have games this week with Syracuse, 
Seton Hall and Georgetown, all at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to be my message at practice,'' Inglese said.  
``I'll congratulate them on making the Top 25 and after practice, 
I'll talk to them about how they worked too long and too hard to 
give it away after a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to get in, especially for a team like us,'' she  
said. ``Once you get in, when you lose or game or two, you drop out 
easier. We've got to be consistent and just keep playing.''

<HEADLINE> Two Children Die in Newark Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Two baby girls died Monday night in an  
apartment fire that apparently was caused by a space heater, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were ages 2 and nine months, police Sgt. Derek Glenn  
said. Their relationship was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's parents were being questioned by homicide  
investigators, Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're investigating the possibility that the parents had left  
the apartment to go to the store and the kids were left 
unattended,'' he said. ``It appears it was somehow caused by a 
space heater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve families lived in the building. Glenn did not know how  
many apartments were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Langenbach, chief of the arson squad, said the fire was  
believed to have started in a third-floor apartment. The girls were 
found in an adjacent apartment.

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Six of the seven surviving octuplets were  
breathing on their own Monday, while one continued receiving 
assistance from a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	Baby girls Ebuka, Chidi, Chima, Echerem and brothers Jioke and  
Ikem were breathing without assistance at the neonatal unit of 
Texas Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Their sister Gorom, the youngest octuplet, who underwent surgery  
to repair an abdominal perforation on Dec. 26, remained attached to 
mechanical ventilators. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven remained in critical but stable condition. They are  
expected to remain at Texas Children's Hospital until at least 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies' mother, Nkem Chukwu, delivered Ebuka on Dec. 8 and  
her seven siblings on Dec. 20. The tiniest, Odera, died of heart 
and lung failure Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven babies are being fed intravenously, but two -- Chidi  
and Echerem -- also are receiving tiny amounts of breast milk.

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn Eagle Predicted the Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Electric lights will diminish crime and  
sidewalks will be kept sparkling clean. The new sport of hockey 
should increase in popularity but Brooklyn will lose its baseball 
team. Japan will become mighty and Germany will annex Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	These were some of the predictions at the dawn of the 20th  
century as reported by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle in an edition 
headlined ``Things will be so different a hundred years hence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Newsday of Long Island reprinted that entire 16-page  
issue of the Eagle, dated Dec. 30, 1900, as ``a reminder of how 
much the world has changed, and is changing, still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Eagle's crystal-ball readings were astoundingly  
sound. ``The most potent force in modern commercial distribution, 
advertising, is sure to have a larger part in the world's life the 
coming hundred years than it has ever had before,'' read one 
article. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Eagle's essayists was suffragist Susan B. Anthony.  
Writing 20 years before the Constitution was amended in 1920 to 
guarantee women the right to vote, she predicted it would come to 
pass and added that women would become ``the peer of man in 
education, in art, in science, in literature: In the home, the 
church, the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another writer predicted that the ``union of the telephone and  
phonograph'' would bring theater, opera, lectures and mass meetings 
``into the salon of one's own home. Under these circumstances 
people of the twentieth are likely to become confirmed 
stay-at-homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some writers got it all wrong. One said the disappearance of  
horse carriages would eliminate house flies and street noise, 
another predicted that ``smooth, sanitary pavements used by 
posterity will be kept thoroughly clean,'' and one headline 
proclaimed ``Science may find means to bring dead to life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some observations from the Eagle show how little things have  
changed, such as this one: ``The poor are dependent for their 
education on the public schools ... The rich select the best 
private schools where their sons may receive careful personal 
attention of teachers such as it is impossible for the overburdened 
public school teacher to give to the members of her larger class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An article on sports complained about the ``chaotic state'' of  
baseball, blaming the owners for exploiting the players. The 
article also predicted that Brooklyn's baseball team would be 
``forced out'' despite an argument that ``the city is big enough to 
maintain two clubs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One article predicted the ``imminence of aerial transport''  
consisting of ``the motor-driven balloon and ... the aeroplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A page on global affairs got a few things wrong. Writing 14  
years before World War I, one writer said the development of an 
``international court will prevent war.'' He also forecast the 
emergence of a French-Italian state and said Turkey would join with 
Hungary to ``become one of the four first-class powers of Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the same writer also got a few things right, predicting that  
England would be ``shorn of power,'' Japan would ``become mighty'' 
and that Germany would annex Poland and merge with Austria.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Offer Seat-Belt Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will install a device that warns  
unbuckled drivers with an intermittent chime until they buckle 
their seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belt-Minder system will be used throughout Ford's U.S.  
product line starting later this year. President Jac Nasser 
announced the system Monday at the North American International 
Auto Show's media preview. 
</P>
<P>
	A sensor in the belt buckle determines if the driver has buckled  
up; if not, a red light on the dashboard goes on and an 
intermittent chime sounds until the belt is latched. On most cars 
and trucks, a chime and light go on only when the ignition is 
turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it will improve safety belt usage tremendously,''  
Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers who don't want to wear their belts can disable the  
intermittent chime by buckling, then unbuckling their belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said seat belts are ``the most effective safety device  
there is,'' but that many who occasionally fail to buckle up say 
they simply forget or are too hurried. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said the system eventually will be expanded to include the  
front passenger seat. The No. 2 automaker said major insurance 
companies are considering discounts for those who own or lease 
vehicles equipped with the Belt-Minder.

<HEADLINE> Two Pulled From Oregon Mountain River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESTACADA, Ore. (AP) -- Rescuers swam through whitewater to reach  
two people stranded in the middle of the Collawash River early 
Sunday after their car hit a patch of ice and slid down a 30-foot 
embankment into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	A caller told authorities that there was a car floating down the  
river about 12:30 a.m. deep in the Mount Hood National Forest, with 
one person on the car's trunk and another still inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were fortunate as remote as the area was to be  
discovered as soon as they were,'' said Ed Kirchhofer, battalion 
chief with the Clackamas County Fire District No. 1. ``There's just 
not that much traffic up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time authorities arrived, the strong current had dragged  
the car about 50 yards downstream. Both people were perched on the 
roof of the partially submerged car. 
</P>
<P>
	A rescuer who swam through 25 yards of whitewater to reach the  
car was able to bring one victim to safety. But the car broke free 
from a rope when another rescuer tried to reach the second victim, 
who was later brought to shore. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, Chris Marie Spooner, 21, and Edward Joseph Miller,  
24, were treated at a local hospital and released. Their hometowns 
were not known.

<HEADLINE> NHL's Blues Given Record $1.5M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues were fined an NHL-record  
$1.5 million on Monday as commissioner Gary Bettman settled a 
4-year-old tampering case involving defenseman Scott Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues said they won't contest the fine, levied by Bettman  
for violation of the NHL constitution and by-laws. He also ordered 
the Blues to surrender one first-round pick to the New Jersey 
Devils between 1999 and 2003. The Devils had sought five 
first-round picks as compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils get $1.425 million of the fine amount, and the rest  
goes to the NHL, payable within 120 days of Dec. 28, the day the 
penalty was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Devils have been awarded the one-time right to  
trade first-round positions with St. Louis in any other Entry Draft 
over the time period. The Devils must inform the NHL by May 1 
preceding each Entry Draft when they plan to exercise the option, 
and the Blues have a one-time deferral right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I view the Blues' conduct with respect to Mr. Stevens to be  
abhorrent and deserving of the harshest sanctions,'' Bettman said 
in a release. ``Violations of the no-tampering provisions directly 
undermine the integrity of the league and the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues admitted wrongdoing under prior management, and  
cooperated with the league's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very tough, very bitter day,'' Blues president Mark  
Sauer said during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am appalled at the severity of the penalty,'' chairman Jerry  
Ritter said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Sauer added: ``The commissioner's ruling is final.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bettman fined the Blues $500,000 for tampering for having  
``engaged in conduct detrimental to the league and the game of 
hockey'' by negotiating terms of a free-agent offer to Stevens 
prior to the free-agent signing period that began July 1, 1994. The 
team was fined an additional $1 million for entering into a side 
deal with Stevens and his agent, the late Richard Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils matched the Blues' four-year, $17.5 million offer  
sheet signed by Stevens on July 4, 1994 -- then the highest ever 
made to a defenseman and $7 million more than the Devils' last 
offer. The fallout from the side deal was New Jersey also had to 
paid Stevens $500,000 the Blues had owed as deferred compensation 
arising from Stevens' signing bonus from his one season with the 
team in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the deal, the Blues were relieved of their  
compensation obligation if another team signed Stevens on the same 
terms as their offer sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman's ruling comes more than five months after a July 27,  
1998 hearing involving the Blues and Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Sauer, Blues general manager Larry Pleau took the medicine  
surprisingly well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess if you're in the stock world doing these types of  
things, you may be in jail'' for such actions, Pleau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ritter: ``I'm more appalled at the legacy left to the  
Blues and their fans by the management team led by (chairman Mike) 
Shanahan and (president Jack) Quinn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' general manager and president, said  
he felt any team guilty of tampering ``should be reprimanded to the 
highest order because it's not the way it should be done. I feel 
very strongly on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues and Devils were at odds throughout the early 1990s,  
with Stevens the focal point. St. Louis pried Stevens away from 
Washington by signing him to a free agent deal in 1990, then lost 
him to New Jersey as compensation for signing Devils free agent 
Brendan Shanahan. The Blues' determination to get him back 
apparently led to the tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation, dormant for a long time, heated up again in  
the last year after disclosures to the Devils from a former member 
of the front office. Sauer, the Blues' president since 1996, said 
the team found documents that indicated the former front office 
negotiated a contract with Stevens ``weeks'' before the signing 
period began. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate the honest and straightforward manner in which  
current Blues management has dealt with this proceeding,'' Bettman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine comes on the heels of the Blues' fourth cash call in as  
many years, this one for $17.7 million with much of the extra money 
paying deferred compensation to players no longer on the roster. 
The team is owned by a consortium of local businessmen who have 
pumped an additional $70 million into the Blues and the Kiel 
Center, which opened in 1994, during the four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauer said the fine was taken into account in the latest cash  
call, and said the team's operation will not change.

<HEADLINE> Cell Injections Suppress HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Targeting HIV in hard-to-reach lymph nodes, researchers for the  
first time have curbed the AIDS virus by injecting patients with 
cells made from their own natural defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The research published today in the January issue of Nature  
Medicine could lead to new ways of attacking the AIDS virus in 
parts of the body where it has eluded standard drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers were able to suppress HIV by giving a patient  
injections of cells fashioned from his own immune system. Though 
scientists say the new method can't be used immediately to treat 
large numbers of patients, it is encouraging because it appears to 
curb the virus at least temporarily in lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``An area we want to consider is: Is it possible to rid somebody  
of infection?'' said the study's chief author, virologist Scott 
Brodie of the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	HIV propagates by attacking a kind of immune cell known as a  
helper T-cell. The researchers chose three patients and isolated 
from their bodies another type of white blood cell, known as a 
killer T-cell, which destroys HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	By cloning and other means, they grew huge numbers of each  
patient's killer T-cells in a laboratory and genetically engineered 
some with markers to trace their movement within the body. They 
then reinjected massive amounts back into each patient and traced 
the migrating cells to lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	There, the new killer T-cells knocked down the number of  
infected helper T-cells, in some cases to undetectable levels, 
according to the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect was temporary; the new cells disappeared within three  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dr. Roger Pomerantz, chief of infectious diseases at  
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, who is familiar with the 
research, called it an exciting early step toward eradicating HIV 
``where it hides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While praising the long-term value of the work, Dr. Anthony  
Fauci, who is working on his own treatment to eradicate virus 
remnants, cautioned that the University of Washington technique is 
so advanced that it limits immediate practical use. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too expensive, it's too time-consuming, it's too  
complicated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another AIDS study appearing today in Nature Medicine points to  
a second approach in replenishing the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that an HIV infection shortens the life span  
of both killer and helper T-cells to less than a third of normal, 
and production of replacement cells lags behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Many researchers have theorized that HIV irreparably breaks down  
the body's cell-replacement capacity through overuse. 
</P>
<P>
	This study, however, suggests that the replacement capacity  
survives intact and seems to be refreshed by a standard HIV 
treatment, known as a drug cocktail. The researchers said the drug 
therapy seems to increase the production of immune cells by an 
average of three or four times. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists say this research will intensify the search for  
ways of reviving the body's ability to fight disease once it is 
damaged by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief author, Dr. Marc Hellerstein of the University of  
California, San Francisco, said such research should ultimately 
show whether later-stage AIDS patients largely cleared of infection 
through drug therapy can ``really regenerate normalcy in their 
immune systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McCune, another member of the research team, suggested  
such approaches also might apply to cancer and other diseases.

<HEADLINE> Storm Forecasting Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Meteorologist Tom Skilling cut short a vacation  
in Alaska so he could return home a day before a snowstorm hobbled 
travel through Chicago. He knew the storm was coming because he had 
predicted it a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to advancements in radar, computers and satellites,  
Skilling and other forecasters had a far clearer picture of what 
was coming than they had during the city's previous major 
blizzards. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't know exactly how serious it would be, but their  
warnings -- combined with the storm's arrival on a holiday weekend 
instead of during the busy work week -- helped soften its blow. 
</P>
<P>
	From Friday through Sunday, 21.6 inches of snow fell at  
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, including a one-day record 
of 18.6 inches for Saturday. The city's greatest sustained storm 
dumped more than 34 inches over 10 days in January 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine this one coming on a work week?'' Skilling,  
who has been a forecaster for 30 years, wondered Monday from his 
office at WGN-TV. ``The weekend timing of this was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the warnings, however, at least 16 deaths in Illinois  
were linked to the storm, with most victims suffering heart attacks 
while shoveling snow. They were among more than 55 storm-related 
deaths from the Plains to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had seen signs that a fierce Midwest storm could  
develop more than a week in advance, thanks to sophisticated 
computer models that provide speedy, high-resolution mathematical 
simulations of the way weather systems form and move. 
</P>
<P>
	The first clue was an upper air disturbance coming off the east  
coast of Asia. Weather satellites tracked it as it turned into a 
storm system over the northern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The signs became clearer as meteorologists factored in the  
movement of the jet stream, an Arctic air mass entrenched over the 
upper Great Lakes and moisture over the balmy Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	As early as Christmas Day, Skilling said, he ``saw a system  
developing that looked pretty interesting, pretty ominous. That 
doesn't necessarily mean they always pan out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But by Monday, Dec. 28, ``We knew it was going to hit,'' said  
National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Merzlock. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, there was little warning of the Jan. 26, 1967,  
blizzard because ``computer modeling was, relatively speaking, in 
its infancy,'' Skilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellites and radar also were much less sophisticated in '67.  
And that storm hit on a Thursday. Abandoned buses and cars stuck in 
snow drifts in the middle of major thoroughfares were a common 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Even during the January 1979 storm, which helped boot an  
unprepared mayor out of office, weather technology was ``nothing 
like we have today,'' Skilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to today's technology, however, Chicago's Streets and  
Sanitation Department began preparing six days in advance, said 
spokesman Terry Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	Most major streets remained open and there were no major traffic  
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was ready.  
</P>
<P>
	``They always say we're going to get 2 or 3 inches and then it  
turns out to be just some flurries,'' said Jamie Silver, manager of 
a Thompson Food Basket in Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't stock up in time and storm-frightened shoppers cleaned  
out the store's milk and bread shortly after opening Saturday. 
``We're talking about hundreds of loaves, gone in minutes,'' Silver 
said.

<HEADLINE> Reluctant Bride Found at US Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Authorities say a woman who refused to go  
along with an arranged marriage was kidnapped and forced into a car 
trunk by her would-be fiance and her uncle, who were arrested when 
they allegedly tried to smuggle her over the U.S.-Canada border. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid Nader, 29, and Jamal Nasser Aziz, 37, both natives of  
Afghanistan, were arrested Friday and are being held without bail. 
They face kidnapping charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were arrested after an inspector at an Immigration and  
Naturalization Service inspection booth at the Rainbow Bridge in 
Niagara Falls sensed something suspicious about Aziz, who was 
driving the car, and asked him to open the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, he discovered Nader and Mine Betoor of Toronto, who was  
handcuffed. Her feet were tied with ropes and a scarf was stuffed 
in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Betoor, whose age was not released, told authorities that  
her parents had arranged a marriage between her and Nader. 
</P>
<P>
	After refusing to travel to Nader's home in San Francisco to be  
married, Ms. Betoor was knocked out with a blow to the head and 
imprisoned in the basement of a home in Etobicoke, Ont., for more 
than two days before being forced into the trunk, police said. 
Aziz, her uncle, threatened to kill her if she made noise or tried 
to escape, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Betoor was released after treatment at Niagara Falls  
Memorial Medical Center for undisclosed injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ms. Betoor has lived in Canada since 1995 and  
is seeking permanent resident status there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pushes for Kosovo Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Little time remains for a negotiated  
settlement of the conflict in Serbia's war-ravaged Kosovo province, 
the State Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Department spokesman James P. Rubin also stressed that several  
hundred international cease-fire monitors will remain in place in 
Kosovo despite an upsurge in fighting over the Christmas weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the situation in Kosovo were to deteriorate to a point  
where it was no longer possible to provide adequate security 
guarantees, the NATO extraction force based in Macedonia stands 
ready to assist in the extraction and evacuation of the monitors,'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to an 1,800-strong NATO unit deployed in  
neighboring Macedonia. It is on hand to pull out the unarmed 
observers if fighting between Serbian government forces and ethnic 
Albanian secessionists resumes at the end of the harsh Balkan 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current security environment, although of concern, does  
not warrant re-evaluating that mission,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 people died and some 200,000 were left homeless  
in fighting last year between the two sides. The conflict ended in 
a tenuous ceasefire negotiated in October by U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	But negotiations on Kosovo's future status have stalled since  
then, and violent incidents have strained the truce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think both sides need to understand that there is not that  
much time left for a negotiated solution which can give the 
legitimate rights to the people of Kosovo and protect the national 
interests of the Serbs before we face the prospect of renewed and 
very dangerous conflict this spring,'' Rubin said.

	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The euro wasn't the only thing  
launched today at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Protesters hurled 
two pies, scoring direct hits on the Dutch finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	One protester struck Gerrit Zalm a glancing blow with the first

<HEADLINE> Retailers Slash Computer Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even though cheap computers flew off store  
shelves this Christmas, retailers are stuck with a supply of more 
expensive PCs, and now many are offering big discounts to clear out 
their higher-priced inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	That means consumers can find a wide variety of powerful  
computers with lots of goodies attached for around $1,000, well 
below what they would have paid a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to buy a higher-end system, this is the time to  
buy,'' said Matt Sargent, an analyst at ZD Market Intelligence, a 
research firm based in La Jolla, Calif. ``The stores are 
overstocked and they want to clear their shelves to make room for 
new inventory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a strong year for the computer industry, largely because  
prices dropped to levels affordable enough to appeal to the masses. 
</P>
<P>
	According to new research from ZD Market Intelligence, the  
average retail selling price for a personal desktop computer was 
$983 in November, the first time it dropped below $1,000. A year 
ago, the average price was $1,329. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, market share increased sharply for cheap computers.  
In October, PCs under $600 accounted for 5.5 percent of retail 
sales. By November, they accounted for 16.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing consumers' appetite for lower prices, retailers  
counted on the less-expensive computers to entice shoppers to their 
stores during the holidays. It was hard to miss the barrage of 
advertisements touting computers for as little as $400. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of promotions out there for the low-priced  
computers, but the more expensive ones they didn't promote as much 
and didn't sell as many,'' said David Goldstein, president of 
Channel Marketing Corp. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, retailers hope price cuts on higher-end models move  
products out of stores quickly. Manufacturers are already shipping 
new inventory, and the outdated computers have almost no shelf 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the discounts, consumers can get more computing power  
for less money that ever before. Many of these PCs offer more fast 
processing and extensive memory than the cheaper variety. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the deals Best Buy is offering this week is a a Packard  
Bell 350 megahertz computer, also with monitor and printer, for 
$999.70, down from $1376.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio Shack is marking down its entire line of Compaq computers,  
the only brand that it sells at its 7,000 stores. Among its 
discounts is a 300 megahertz desktop computer, with monitor and 
printer, for $950, down from $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Online retailer Cyberian Outpost has a deal on a Compaq notebook  
computer with 266 megahertz for $1,200, down from $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
	``January is one of the biggest months for new models,''  
Goldstein said. ``They have to make room for the new computers 
immediately.''

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn Eagle Predicted the Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Electric lights will diminish crime and  
sidewalks will be kept sparkling clean. The new sport of hockey 
should increase in popularity but Brooklyn will lose its baseball 
team. Japan will become mighty and Germany will annex Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	These were some of the predictions at the dawn of the 20th  
century as reported by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle in an edition 
headlined ``Things will be so different a hundred years hence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Newsday of Long Island reprinted that entire 16-page  
issue of the Eagle, dated Dec. 30, 1900, as ``a reminder of how 
much the world has changed, and is changing, still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Eagle's crystal-ball readings were astoundingly  
sound. ``The most potent force in modern commercial distribution, 
advertising, is sure to have a larger part in the world's life the 
coming hundred years than it has ever had before,'' read one 
article. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Eagle's essayists was suffragist Susan B. Anthony.  
Writing 20 years before the Constitution was amended in 1920 to 
guarantee women the right to vote, she predicted it would come to 
pass and added that women would become ``the peer of man in 
education, in art, in science, in literature: In the home, the 
church, the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another writer predicted that the ``union of the telephone and  
phonograph'' would bring theater, opera, lectures and mass meetings 
``into the salon of one's own home. Under these circumstances 
people of the twentieth are likely to become confirmed 
stay-at-homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some writers got it all wrong. One said the disappearance of  
horse carriages would eliminate house flies and street noise, 
another predicted that ``smooth, sanitary pavements used by 
posterity will be kept thoroughly clean,'' and one headline 
proclaimed ``Science may find means to bring dead to life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some observations from the Eagle show how little things have  
changed, such as this one: ``The poor are dependent for their 
education on the public schools ... The rich select the best 
private schools where their sons may receive careful personal 
attention of teachers such as it is impossible for the overburdened 
public school teacher to give to the members of her larger class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An article on sports complained about the ``chaotic state'' of  
baseball, blaming the owners for exploiting the players. The 
article also predicted that Brooklyn's baseball team would be 
``forced out'' despite an argument that ``the city is big enough to 
maintain two clubs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One article predicted the ``imminence of aerial transport''  
consisting of ``the motor-driven balloon and ... the aeroplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A page on global affairs got a few things wrong. Writing 14  
years before World War I, one writer said the development of an 
``international court will prevent war.'' He also forecast the 
emergence of a French-Italian state and said Turkey would join with 
Hungary to ``become one of the four first-class powers of Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the same writer also got a few things right, predicting that  
England would be ``shorn of power,'' Japan would ``become mighty'' 
and that Germany would annex Poland and merge with Austria.

<HEADLINE> Fiesta Bowl Coaches Join in Prayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Florida State coach Bobby Bowden left his  
seat in the pew opposite Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer and headed 
to the pulpit, wondering all the time about the color of the carpet 
and upholstery in the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me ask you a question first,'' Bowden said, interrupting  
the Rev. Dan Yeary as he was about to discuss the coach's religious 
faith. ``Is there any significance in all this orange here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The minister, suddenly realizing the predominant color in his  
North Phoenix Baptist Church matched Tennessee's favorite hue, 
offered Bowden a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you win the national championship and they increase your  
salary,'' Yeary quipped, ``just give us a little tithe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of their battle for the national championship, Bowden  
and Fulmer joined in prayer Sunday. They both spoke to worshipers 
about their religious faith, as did Tennessee kicker Jeff Hall -- a 
member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes back on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, the coaches face each other across the field as  
top-ranked and undefeated Tennessee takes on No. 2 Florida State in 
the Fiesta Bowl. The Volunteers will be seeking their first 
national title since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the day before a national championship, with all the stress  
and all the pressure, the leaders of these two teams have chosen to 
be in the Lord's house,'' Yeary said to the applause of his 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Tennessee team also attended the church service,  
surrounded by fans whose rental cars were festooned with orange 
flags and pompoms. Balloons -- orange and white for Tennessee, 
garnet and gold for the Seminoles -- were attached to some pews. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer even wore a gaudy orange tie.  
</P>
<P>
	Yeary surveyed his congregation, swollen by about a hundred  
large young men and out-of-towners dressed in orange, and 
apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our choir could not learn `Rocky Top' in time for this,'' the  
reverend said, referring to the song that accompanies every 
Tennessee score. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State will be led by a sophomore quarterback, Marcus  
Outzen, making just his third college start. The starter for most 
of the season, Chris Weinke, is recovering from spinal surgery and 
is restricted to a role as Outzen's mentor for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's offense also lost a key player when tailback Jamal  
Lewis hurt his knee and was lost for the year. But that happened in 
the fourth game of the season, giving the Vols time to adjust. 
Sophomore Travis Henry took his place, responding with five 
100-yard rushing games. 
</P>
<P>
	Since replacing Johnny Majors as Tennessee coach in 1992, Fulmer  
has led the Vols back among college football's elite. But the 
Volunteers were not expected to be so good this season, especially 
after the graduation of No. 1 draft pick Peyton Manning. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State is the only school to finish among the top four in  
the nation in 11 consecutive seasons, and won the national title in 
1993. But it took Bowden nearly 40 years of coaching -- including 18 
in Tallahassee -- to win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer hopes he doesn't have to wait as long for his first  
national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we win, then early in my career I'd have that weight lifted  
off my back,'' Fulmer said. ``We expect at some point to win a 
national championship, hopefully this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the game was played, there was at least one person  
wondering whether the Fiesta Bowl really would crown the national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State coach John Cooper appealed to voters in The  
Associated Press poll, saying they should consider the Buckeyes for 
the national title if Florida State barely beats No. 1 Tennessee 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, with one loss this season, defeated Texas A&AMP;M 24-14  
in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame John one bit for feeling the way he does,''  
Bowden said Sunday. ``John might have the best team in the nation, 
but if Tennessee wins, it will be the national champion. And if we 
win, we will be national champions. That's the way it was drawn up 
this year, and I sympathize with John because I've been in his 
place before.''

	Storm Spreads Misery Across East  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The misery created by the huge winter storm  
stretched into a third day today with frustrated air travelers 
still waiting for flights, highways slippery or clogged by snow and 
thousands of customers with no electricity. Hundreds of school 
districts canceled classes from Iowa to Ohio and in parts of New 
England. Police counted scores of accidents on ice-covered roads 
from Maine to South Carolina, and some Indiana roads were simply 
closed. At least 49 deaths had been blamed on the huge snow and ice 
storm. United Airlines canceled 60 percent of its flights out of 
Chicago yesterday, and American Airlines canceled at least half.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., a conservative  
former governor who spent the last year laying the groundwork for a 
presidential campaign, may be getting cold feet. Several supporters 
and Republican operatives said over the weekend that they believe 
he will not run for president. Ashcroft is scheduled to announce 
his intentions tomorrow. At the same time, Elizabeth Dole, wife of 
1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole, plans to resign 
today as president of the American Red Cross in what supporters 
hope will set the stage for her own run for the White House in 
2000.

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Rebel fighters outlined their vision  
of Kosovo's future today, saying the province must be free from 
Serbia's rule and the rebels recognized as a regular army. Kosovo 
is an overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province in Serbia, the 
dominant republic in Yugoslavia. The Serbian government refuses to 
grant the province more than limited self-rule, while ethnic 
Albanians insist on independence. Until 1989, Kosovo enjoyed broad 
autonomy, which Serbia then revoked. The Serbian government was 
expected to reject the KLA demands.

	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The detective leading the  
investigation into Northern Ireland's worst terrorist attack says 
he has identified key members of the IRA dissident gang responsible 
-- but does not yet have enough evidence to convict them, a 
newspaper reported today. Police have been working to capture the 
renegade Irish Republican Army members behind the Aug. 15 car 
bombing in Omagh that killed 29 people and wounded 370. The IRA 
dissidents, dubbed the Real IRA by Irish media because they refuse 
to use a different name, oppose the July 1997 cease-fire being 
observed by the parent organization.

<HEADLINE> Car Set On Fire at Arabic Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A manager at a prominent Arabic newspaper says  
the business received harassing telephone calls before a car was 
driven inside the paper's printing facility and set afire. 
</P>
<P>
	The message, in Arabic, ``was someone cursing, but there were no  
specifics, no nothing,'' said Yazid Mourani, president of Media 
Marketing Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a 1992 Mitsubishi was driven through a steel gate at  
the Al-Hayat facility in Queens on Friday afternoon and set on 
fire. It caused minor damage to the building, where newspapers are 
printed for New York City, but there were no injuries and no 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1997, letter bombs were sent to offices for the  
newspaper in Washington, in London and at the United Nations. Two 
people were injured when the bomb sent to the London office 
exploded. The other bombs were discovered before they detonated. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, owned by a member of the Saudi royal family, is  
one of the largest and most influential Arabic-language papers in 
the world and is popular among expatriates in the West. Although it 
has run articles criticizing Saddam Hussein and fundamentalism, its 
general news coverage is considered unbiased with moderate 
editorial positions. 
</P>
<P>
	A terrorism task force of local and federal law enforcement  
officials was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper officials who could comment further were not  
immediately available this morning.

<HEADLINE> NBA Owners Reject Players' Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBA owners rejected the union's latest  
collective bargaining proposal Monday night and recommended 
canceling the rest of the 1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern left the door open for more talks, but  
said a settlement before Thursday - the owners' deadline for saving 
the season -- ``doesn't seem likely at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours. Instead, I  
saw one that went backward,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union director Billy Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing  
delivered the proposal to Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik 
at a hotel across the street from NBA headquarters. A few hours 
later, Granik said the owners' labor relations committee had turned 
it down in a 9-0 vote and recommended canceling the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The union later said the players will meet Wednesday in New York  
to vote on the owners' latest offer, with the union's negotiating 
committee recommending it be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always hope, but right now we don't have any meetings  
scheduled,'' Granik said. ``Based upon how far apart we are, 
there's a lot more needed to be done than simply tweaking the 
offers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News of an upcoming player vote came as a surprise, since the  
union had insisted it would not present any proposal for a vote 
unless its negotiating committee recommended it. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the vote, the union said, was ``to assure that  
the owners understand the level of player resolve and the degree of 
opposition to the NBA's onerous demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern had been calling for a player vote for more than a week.  
</P>
<P>
	``The majority has a right to control the destiny of an  
organization, and that's between them and their leadership,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Granik also said the owners' negotiating committee  
would meet in New York, perhaps Wednesday night. But it is 
uncertain if there will be a meeting with the players' committee. 
</P>
<P>
	If no deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with  
one ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
Thursday to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned and see on Thursday how close we are,'' Stern said.  
``In order to see who's more accurate in his depiction of where we 
are, we're going to have to lose a season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said the union would have to make major changes in its  
proposal for there to be any chance of saving the season, which was 
supposed to begin Nov. 3. So far, the first two months of the 
season have been wiped out. It would take three to four weeks after 
a settlement to begin a season of 45 to 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' Stern said, opening the  
door for the first time to using replacement players in the 
1999-2000 season. ``It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on, 
but obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we'll rebuild the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said if a new league was formed, it would probably take  
the top 100 players and leave the rest -- the middle-class that the 
league has said it is fighting for -- out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	The union presented its offer at a meeting that lasted roughly  
an hour and included Stern, Granik, Hunter and Ewing. It 
represented the first face-to-face talks between the sides since 
Dec. 27 when they met for five hours near Denver and the league 
made its ``final'' offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has told all 19 players on its negotiating committee  
to be in New York by Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Williams of the Knicks, a member of the union's executive  
committee, thinks the deadline might be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a deal was done on the 9th or 10th, I'm sure David wouldn't  
say that just because we didn't do it on 7th the season is over. 
It's a business, and sometimes you have to posture,'' Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's new offer included a limit on how much any player  
can earn. If accepted, the NBA would be the only professional 
sports league to limit the amount of money a top athlete is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	If no agreement is reached, the NBA will become the first U.S.  
league to lose an entire season to a labor dispute. Until now, it 
had never lost a game to a work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
	The key sticking point could center on how much revenue will be  
paid to the players during the six-year deal. The sides also differ 
on the length and terms of a new rookie salary scale and the dollar 
value of two salary cap exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the union wants 55 percent of revenue devoted  
to salaries in the fourth year, while owners have offered 53 
percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners 
are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- 
the amount they received last season -- while the league is offering 
54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft,  
signed with Kinder Bologna of the Italian League for $3 million. 
The 7-foot-1 center can return to the NBA on Feb. 15 if the lockout 
is lifted and still would receive $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Woods, the agent for Toronto's Kevin Willis, refiled an  
unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations 
Board against the union for allegedly breaching its duty of fair 
representation.

<HEADLINE> UConn Stays Atop Men's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Connecticut was No. 1 in The Associated Press' college  
basketball poll for the sixth straight week Monday, but the 
Huskies' lead over No. 2 Duke was sliced by 15 first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (11-0) was No. 1 on 55 ballots and received 1,756  
points from the national media panel after decisive wins last week 
over Villanova and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (13-1), who convincingly beat then-No. 4  
Maryland on the road Sunday, received 13 first-place votes and 
1,698 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In last week's poll, the Huskies had 63 first-place votes and  
1,763 points, while Duke had six and 1,687. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati (12-0), the only team to beat Duke this season,  
remained third after beating North Carolina-Wilmington in its only 
game last week. The Bearcats received three first-place votes, one 
more than the previous poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford and Maryland switched places at Nos. 4 and 5, while  
Kentucky moved up one spot to No. 6. UCLA, which handed Arizona its 
first loss of the season last weekend, moved from 10th to No. 7 and 
was followed by Arizona, Purdue and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	The Top Ten ranking was St. John's first since Dec. 16, 1991,  
while Kentucky extended its streak of being in the Top Ten to 85, a 
run that started Feb. 14, 1994. Duke has the second-longest Top Ten 
streak at 33 weeks, while Connecticut, at 17, and Stanford, at 10, 
are the only others in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, which holds the longest current streak of being  
ranked at 143 weeks, dropped from ninth to No. 11 after losing to 
California and beating Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels started their run of consecutive rankings with the  
preseason poll of 1990-91, two polls longer than Kentucky's current 
streak and 10 longer than Kansas'. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State was 12th and was followed by Indiana, Auburn, New  
Mexico, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas and Syracuse. The last 
five teams in the poll were Clemson, Texas Christian, Oklahoma 
State, Wisconsin and California. 
</P>
<P>
	California entered the rankings with a 9-2 record and having  
lost its last game, 71-69 in overtime to Oregon at home. That ended 
a seven-game winning streak that included the 78-71 victory over 
North Carolina in the Pete Newell Challenge. The Golden Bears were 
last ranked during the 1996-97 season when they made a one-week 
appearance at No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh (8-5) dropped out of the rankings from No. 23 after  
losing four of its last five games. The Panthers had been ranked 
for five straight weeks, reaching as high as No. 20, after beating 
Xavier and Kentucky on consecutive nights in the Puerto Rico 
Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	This week was Kentucky's 600th appearance in the poll, a number  
second only to North Carolina's 608. UCLA, at 528, is the only 
other school to appear more than 500 times in the AP rankings which 
started Jan. 20, 1949.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Trade Center Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's highest court will hear arguments  
this week into whether the operator of the World Trade Center must 
turn over documents to victims of the 1993 bombing about the 
complex's vulnerability to such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for victims of the attack, which killed six people and  
injured 1,000, are suing the Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey, which runs the center. They contend that the agency had 
been warned as early as 1985 about the complex's susceptibility to 
a bomb attack in its underground parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Kovner, a lawyer for a coalition of bombing victims, will  
argue before the Court of Appeals on Tuesday that the 62 documents 
are ``pivotal'' to proving that the Port Authority is liable for 
damages because of its alleged negligence at responding to security 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Port Authority has argued unsuccessfully before two lower  
courts that the documents the victims are seeking are confidential 
communications, exempt because disclosure could harm the public 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Port Authority lawyer Milton Pachter plans to argue that  
releasing the documents ``would create a serious danger to the 
members of the public'' because terrorists could glean information 
to aid a future attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovner counters that the Port Authority is seeking a ``radical  
and unwarranted expansion of the bounds of privilege.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Included in group bringing the suit are relatives of those  
killed, people who were injured and companies which say they lost 
millions by being displaced from the building in the weeks 
following the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Four militant Muslims said they plotted the bombing to protest  
the United States' foreign policy in the Middle East. They were 
each sentenced to 240 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims say the most damning documents held by the Port  
Authority are consultants' analyses of an in-house security study 
conducted in 1985. That report said the center's underground 
garages posed a security problem and recommended measures such as 
random inspection of vehicles for explosives. The bombers left the 
explosives in a rental van parked in one of the lots. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts have ruled that the documents must largely be  
released, except for some sensitive information about police 
informants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Appeals is expected to rule on the case within a  
few months.

<HEADLINE> 2 Arrested in California Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two Chinese immigrants have been arrested and  
accused of kidnapping the 17-year-old son of a wealthy developer in 
an attempt to get $1.5 million in ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuan Nan Chen, who was missing for three weeks, was rescued  
Monday at the home of one of his alleged captors just as his father 
was paying $500,000 ransom in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen's legs and arms were chained and his eyes and mouth were  
covered with duct tape, but he was physically unharmed, according 
to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Xu Lin Wang, 27, of Temple City and Xue Nan Wang of New York  
were caught at the home and scheduled to be charged today with 
hostage taking. The two, who are unrelated, could be sentenced to 
life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen was grabbed Dec. 15 from the garage of his family's San  
Marino home. Two days later, associates of the kidnappers contacted 
Chen's father and demanded a $1.5 million ransom be delivered in 
the Fujian Province in China. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the father, Fu Shun Chen, delivered $500,000 in  
ransom to two men in Fujian. The two were immediately arrested by 
Chinese authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	At about the same time, police swooped in on the Temple City  
home of one of the suspects and found Chen. His whereabouts was 
determined through phone taps and information from a neighbor to 
the home, 12 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Clinton Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Within hours after the ceremonial convening of  
the 106th Congress on Wednesday, newly sworn-in members of the 
House will vote on authorizing key lawmakers to present evidence 
against President Clinton in a Senate impeachment trial, officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Hastert, the Illinois Republican on the brink of  
election as House speaker, who said the House will vote Wednesday, 
said he hopes the proposal -- identical to the one that cleared the 
House in December -- will pass. GOP vote counters expressed 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would certainly like to see Henry Hyde be able to present  
the testimony and what he needs to do to put his case forward,'' 
Hastert said in a reference to the Illinois lawmaker who chaired 
the impeachment inquiry in the House. House rules require that the 
new Congress vote on the managers of the trial, who were named by 
the lame duck House in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert made his comments as Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., struggled to line up fellow Republicans behind a 
bipartisan plan for a truncated trial-like proceeding that could be 
wrapped up within days, without testimony from any of the key 
principals in the case. Key conservatives expressed unhappiness 
with the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, the president's lawyers continued to develop  
an elaborate defense that could take weeks or months to present if 
the case goes to a full-blown trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers familiar with the developing defense strategy said  
lawyers are working on trial motions concerning evidence and an 
opening presentation that would sharply attack the House 
conclusions and the evidence from prosecutor Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening presentation ``would be far more extensive and  
sharper in tone and content'' than the one Clinton's lawyers made 
before the House Judiciary Committee in arguing the evidence didn't 
warrant impeachment, one lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved two articles of impeachment on Dec. 19,  
accusing Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice in 
connection with an attempt to conceal his sexual relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 

</P>
<P>
	The requirement for a repeat vote on appointing so-called House  
managers, or prosecutors, in the new Congress means newly elected 
lawmakers will vote on the momentous issue on their first day in 
office. It also gives fresh opportunities to Democrats -- who gained 
seats in the November elections -- to affect the course of an 
impeachment they have sought to thwart. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, listed  
several options, including a new attempt to place the House on 
record in favor of censure, a plan to try and limit the 
jurisdiction of the House's prosecutors and a plan to try to add 
Democrats to the team of prosecutors. While each of these 
suggestions is under discussion, each has pitfalls and Democrats 
may ultimately decide against pursuing any of them, these officials 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The certainty of a House vote on Wednesday stood in marked  
contrast to the unsettled situation in the Senate, where Lott 
struggled to fashion a procedure for a trial that could satisfy 
half his own GOP members and win Democratic support. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stab at bipartisanship, two lawmakers have outlined a  
procedure calling for Hyde to present evidence for one day, the 
White House to have a day for rebuttal, and the Senate to take a 
quick vote to determine whether a full-blown trial should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference in his home state of Washington, Republican  
Sen. Slade Gorton said the plan he and Democratic Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman of Connecticut developed will proceed only if a majority 
of each caucus supports it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats apparently are in favor and his ``best guess'' is that  
a majority of the Senate agrees, but ``Senator Lott will propose 
the plan, I believe, only if a majority of Republicans favor it,'' 
Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had no head count within the GOP caucus or the full  
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott met with aides and outside advisers during the day and  
arranged a session with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
for Tuesday. All senators are expected back in the Capitol on 
Wednesday for the opening of the new Congress, and no formal 
decisions are expected until then on proceedings for the first 
presidential impeachment trial since Andrew Johnson's in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of raw numbers, Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in  
the Senate, far short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict 
Clinton and remove him from office, even if all GOP lawmakers voted 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Democrats are well shy of the simple majority  
needed to adjourn any trial and move promptly to a vote on censure, 
and are unlikely to be able to peel away enough Republican 
defectors to be able to do so, at least in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
	With the White House expecting eventual negotiations over a  
censure, presidential advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Clinton was comfortable making an acknowledgment similar to 
the one White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff made in testimony 
last month. Ruff testified that reasonable people might conclude 
Clinton made false statements under oath but that the president 
believed he was being evasive, but not lying. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it (a censure proposal) goes farther than that, it's a  
tougher sale,'' one outside adviser said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The split within Republican ranks was underscored during the day  
when Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota, a conservative, and Sen. Arlen 
Specter of Pennsylvania, a moderate, both spoke out against the 
suggestion floated by Gorton and Lieberman. Sen. Don Nickles, 
R-Okla., the GOP whip, has privately expressed opposition, 
according to GOP officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Lott, Grams said he was fearful of a proposal to  
``shortcut the procedure. ... I simply believe we must accept our 
responsibility to conduct the impeachment trial, followed by a vote 
to remove or retain the president,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter told reporters, ``I think it is very difficult to  
conduct a trial if you don't have witnesses. It's pretty hard to 
have a trial without witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt of the tremendous public clamor to have this  
matter concluded at an early date. ... It has to be done right.''

<HEADLINE>  New Speaker Promises To Get To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker-to-be Dennis Hastert said Monday  
his most important task will be to restore public faith in Congress 
through hard work and an end to partisan rancor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is clear,'' the Illinois Republican said before  
his first meeting of the year with the newly elected House GOP 
leadership. ``The American people want us to go to work, they want 
us to produce good policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making laws that address the needs of Americans, he said, is  
``our first and most important step in restoring faith in this U.S. 
House of Representatives'' after a year of presidential scandal and 
little legislative achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert named reform of Social Security and Medicare, tax  
relief, improvements in education and a stronger national defense 
as his party's top goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that, with Republicans holding a slim 223-211  
majority in the new Congress, he must reach out to Democrats and 
end the political divisions that blocked key bills in the last 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a person who believes that we need to work  
across the aisle,'' he said. ``There are a lot of issues out there 
that the American people want to see passed and want to see done 
which certainly can be done on a bipartisan basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-term congressman vaulted to his party's leadership  
position following the resignation of Newt Gingrich in the wake of 
GOP losses in the November election and the startling announcement 
last month by Gingrich's heir-apparent, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., 
that he had had an extramarital affair and would not run for the 
speakership. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said he would give committee chairman a greater role in  
putting forward the legislative agenda. Gingrich relied more on an 
inner group of confidants. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, a soft-spoken former high school teacher, said his  
style will also differ from the outspoken Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend not to talk about those issues but deliver,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> MacWorld Computer Show Opens Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The iMac is not merely a popular computer  
that single-handedly helped pull Apple Computer Inc. back from the 
brink. It's the new fashion trend in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by the desktop machine's recent climb to No. 1 in  
retail sales, computer designers are rolling out a new breed of 
products wrapped in similar translucent casing through which inner 
circuitry is faintly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	They range from computer mice to joysticks that seem like tools  
from an alien space ship. And veteran industry watchers expect 
Apple to sell other computers, including a laptop due out next 
spring, that take cues from the iMac's design. 
</P>
<P>
	Even chip maker Intel Corp., which Apple publicly roasted in  
advertisements last year, is prodding other big computer makers 
like Compaq to reshape the clunky, beige machines on most desks. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that there haven't been other attempts to change the  
traditional computer look. Sony several years ago introduced a 
sleek, black desktop that never really took off. But the 
jellybean-like iMac, which comes equipped with a built-in monitor, 
seems to be transforming computer fashion the way Swatch started a 
new craze in watches. 
</P>
<P>
	And the iMac offers more than a new look. It also appeals to  
computer users who crave simplicity. The iMac's connectors are 
located conveniently on the side, instead of the back, and the 
machine can quickly be hooked up to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's $1,300 iMacs accounted for 7 percent of all PCs sold at  
retail in the United States in November, giving it the top-selling 
spot and helping to double Apple's overall retail market share to 
10 percent, market researcher PC Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures suggest the iMac has helped Apple stem a defection  
of Mac customers to personal computers that run on Microsoft's 
Windows operating system, a trend that contributed to two years of 
red ink at the once-prosperous computer pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder and interim chief executive,  
hopes to try to extend the recent success to other products. Some 
analysts say he has little choice in an industry increasingly 
dominated by cheaper Windows machines, which cost as low as $400 
excluding the monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve has concluded the only way to differentiate himself is  
industrial design and ergonomics,'' said Tim Bajarin of Creative 
Strategies Research International, a Campbell, Calif. consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement over the technology design trend is evident at  
the MacWorld Expo computer show, opening here today. The number of 
exhibitors is up 15 percent to 420 this year, reflecting an 
increase in companies making iMac-related products, said show 
manager Rob Scheschareg. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan-owned Mace Group Inc. is showing off four products from  
its Macally unit -- iMouse, iStick game joystick, iBall trackball, 
and the iHub for connecting peripherals -- all encased in bluish, 
clear plastic like the iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple wasn't commenting on its future plans for see-through  
computers. A spokeswoman said the company won't use the show to 
unveil details of a new low-cost laptop computer due out next 
spring. But the industry is buzzing with speculation the new 
portable will sport a stylish, translucent looked modeled on the 
iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard it's quite different from any portable we've ever  
seen,'' Bajarin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also is taking a more conventional route to boost demand  
for its machines: Speeding them up. The company is expected to 
introduce a new iMac with a more powerful microprocessor and 
possibly drop the price of the current version, which is equipped 
with a 233-megahertz chip. The new iMac reportedly will debut in 
February for a price similar to the current $1,300 ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also is set to roll out its new line of G3 professional  
desktop systems, code-named Yosemite. The new models will sport 
speedier microprocessors and higher-capacity storage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jobs is not expected to change one oft-criticized feature of  
the iMac: Its lack of a floppy drive, a turnoff to those dependent 
on disks for storing and transferring files. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the company's success with the iMac, it remains an open  
question whether the company can sustain its momentum and become a 
major rival again to makers of Windows-based machines. One 
lingering concern is whether software makers will continue to 
develop exciting new programs for the Mac.

<HEADLINE> NBA's Top Pick To Play in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 overall pick in the  
NBA draft, is set to become the highest profile player to head 
overseas because of the NBA lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center out of Pacific University will arrive in  
Italy on Tuesday to sign a contract with European club champion 
Kinder Bologna, a spokesman for the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes an escape clause that would allow Olowokandi,  
who was picked by the Los Angeles Clippers in June's draft, to 
return to the NBA if the lockout ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're betting the NBA season won't start,'' Kinder spokesman  
Marco Angrisani told The Associated Press in a telephone interview 
Monday. ``We have reached a tentative agreement with Olowokandi's 
agent and now we're just waiting for him to get here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout has scrapped the first three months of the NBA  
season, and Commissioner David Stern says he'll recommend canceling 
the entire season if there's no agreement with players by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi is the latest in a recent series of players jumping  
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Arvydas Sabonis of the Portland Trail Blazers has joined  
Lithuania's Zalgiras Vilnius, and Vlade Divac, who played with the 
Charlotte Hornets last season, is with Red Star Belgrade. Those 
teams will meet in a Euro League game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Vinny Del Negro of the San Antonio Spurs joined Kinder's  
cross-city rival TeamSystem Bologna over the weekend in a deal that 
includes an escape clause and will pay him a reported $900,000 if 
he finishes the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Bologna teams, which faced off in last season's Italian  
League finals, won by Kinder, are currently tied for second in the 
standings behind Varese. 
</P>
<P>
	Angrisani said Olowokandi's deal gives the player until Feb. 15  
to return to the NBA. He would not say how much the contract is 
worth, but said it is comparable to Del Negro's. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, of course, you have to pay someone like Olowokandi more  
than Del Negro,'' Angrisani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, a Nigerian who grew up in England and has been  
playing competitive basketball for just three years, should make 
his debut in a Euro League second-round game Thursday at Greek team 
PAOK Salonica. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates with Kinder would include Predrag Danilovic, a  
Yugoslav who had stints with the Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks, 
and Radoslav Nesterovic, who was taken 17th overall in the draft by 
the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi's home debut would be Sunday against Reggiana in  
Italian League action. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of time. He gets here Tuesday, has medical  
visits and then signs, and Wednesday he'll get on a plane for 
Greece,'' Angrisani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was the deadline for registering players for Euro League  
play, and Angrisani said Olowokandi had already filled out the 
necessary paperwork from the United States.

<HEADLINE> Local Has Edge in New Balance Mile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Nohilly won't have any steeplechase barriers  
to clear Saturday night, so he'll have to settle for running a mile 
over a flat track -- but with an added incentive. 
</P>
<P>
	Nohilly, one of the nation's top steeplechasers, will be among a  
10-man field in the men's mile at the New Balance Games at the 
Armory Track &AMP; Field Center. 
</P>
<P>
	If the winner breaks four minutes, he will be guaranteed $5,000.  
Twenty minutes after the men's race, the women will contest the 
mile, and if no one breaks 4:33, the men's winner will get $10,000. 
If the women's winner runs under 4:33, she will also receive 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nohilly, whose top mile finish is 3 minutes, 59.50 seconds  
outdoors, will be at a disadvantage because he doesn't specialize 
in the event, but he will have a big factor in his favor -- he will 
be running on his ``home'' track. 
</P>
<P>
	Nohilly trains on the new six-lane Mondo banked Armory track,  
and is impressed with the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' he said Monday at the New York Track Writers'  
luncheon. ``I walk in there and say this is amazing. The surface is 
fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So fast that Nohilly recently ran 26 seconds for 200 meters.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never run 26,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Those kind of performances have buoyed Nohilly's confidence for  
Saturday's race against a field that includes Richie Boulet, a 
3:52.69 miler, and 1992 Olympian and two-time national outdoor 
champion Terrence Herrington, who has run the mile in 3:53.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Boulet and Herrington are much faster and natural  
milers, Nohilly could be helped by the timing of the meet. It's 
early in the season, and runners are not yet in top form. 
</P>
<P>
	Nohilly has been working very hard, and is coming off his first  
marathon, the New York City Marathon in November, in which he ran 
2:38 after ``hitting the wall'' over the final six miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Training for that distance, though, has kept him strong, and  
instilled the possibility in him that he could ``steal'' the mile -- 
and the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the mile,'' said Nohilly, the 1989 NCAA steeplechase  
champion while at Florida. ``If I were a better miler, I would 
choose that event. I like the strategy involved in the mile. 
Strategy is everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't go out from the gun and run hard and drop  
everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nohilly, 32, sticks with the steeplechase outdoors because of  
his lack of speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't close in 52 or 53 or 54 (seconds),'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason he's wary of breaking four minutes Saturday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I'm not a true miler, it will be tough to go under four  
minutes,'' he said. ``If I go under four minutes, it will be a 
bonus, and that's what it is -- a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do well on my home track.''  
</P>
<P>
	Outdoors, he has designs on breaking Henry Marsh's 14-year-old  
U.S. steeplechase record of 8:09:18. Nohilly's best is 8:16.90. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can improve my technique, I can cut about eight seconds  
off my time,'' Nohilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to chasing the record, Nohilly will be seeking to  
make the 2000 Olympic team. He missed the 1992 team by .03 seconds 
and the 1996 team by less than a second, finishing fourth each time 
in the Olympic trials, one place from qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been a dream of mine to make the Olympic team,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Death Row Inmate Stabbed to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARCHMAN, Miss. (AP) -- A fellow death row inmate on Monday  
fatally stabbed Donald Leroy Evans, who once confessed to dozens of 
murders and led police in several states on fruitless searches for 
victim's bodies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't mourn him. We simply close his file,'' said Harrison  
County District Attorney Cono Caranna, who prosecuted Evans in the 
1991 rape and strangulation of a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people you'd be able to say something good about them,''  
he said. ``Everything I saw in his life was pure self involvement 
and as close to evil as I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was ``incapable'' of remorse and delighted in leading  
federal authorities on the multistate search for victims, Caranna 
said. ``He was just running a scam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, sentenced to death for killing the girl, was attacked at  
the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman with a makeshift 
knife, known in prison parlance as a ``shank,'' while being led 
back to his cell after a shower, according to Corrections 
Department spokesman Ken Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was stabbed to death by Jimmie Mack, another death row  
inmate. Mack was being taken by corrections officers to the shower 
when the stabbing occurred,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, 41, generated media interest after his arrest in the  
girl's killing by declaring himself a serial killer and white 
supremacist, and by claiming to have information on slayings around 
the country. He later admitted he misled authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galveston, Texas, drifter was sentenced to death in 1993 in  
the strangulation death of Beatrice Louise Routh, who was abducted 
in Gulfport park, taken to Louisiana and killed, then returned to 
Mississippi, where her body was dumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously he had been convicted on a federal kidnapping charge  
and was sentenced to a life term. 
</P>
<P>
	He escaped from Harrison County jail in June 1993, but was  
recaptured about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1995, Evans pleaded guilty in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to  
the 1985 killing of Ira Jean Smith. He received a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections officials would not comment on whether there were  
any racial overtones in the slaying of Evans, who was white. Mack 
is black.

<HEADLINE> Saywer, Gibson Named 'GMA' Hosts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC is bringing the heavyweight anchor team of  
Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson temporarily to ``Good Morning 
America,'' its most dramatic effort yet to turn around a show that 
has floundered in the ratings for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sawyer and Gibson, who left after 11 years as host of ``Good  
Morning America'' only last April, will start on Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's current hosts, Kevin Newman and Lisa McRee, will both  
take on new assignments. Newman will become a reporter at 
``Nightline'' and McRee, who is pregnant, will be a Los 
Angeles-based correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sawyer, who was Charles Kuralt's co-host on the ``CBS  
Morning News'' from 1981-84, will continue as a correspondent on 
the newsmagazine ``20/20.'' But she will cut down on her traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been getting too much sleep anyway,'' she quipped. ``It's  
not good for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise announcement -- Gibson admitted he was  
``flabbergasted'' to be asked back -- comes as the once-dominant 
morning show has slipped perilously close to third place in the 
ratings. McRee and Newman, who both joined within the past two 
years, have done nothing to halt the long-running slide. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, NBC's ``Today'' show has a 5.3 rating and 21  
audience share in the morning competition. ``Good Morning America'' 
has a 3.3 rating and CBS News' ``This Morning'' is at 3.0. Ratings 
for NBC and CBS are unchanged from last year, while ABC has dropped 
17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News President David Westin conceded that network management  
had tried to change the show without a clear vision of where it 
wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Now ABC wants to hearken back to the feel-good 1980s, when  
co-hosts Joan Lunden and David Hartman, and later Gibson, had ABC 
at the top of the ratings. Westin said he wanted the show to 
radiate ``warmth with intelligence and a sense of family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to go back to the future -- return to what made it great  
and at the same time make it a program for 1999 and beyond,'' 
Westin said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how long the Gibson-Sawyer team will stay on. Ms.  
Sawyer said it would likely be a few months, but Gibson said that 
``we'll do it for as long as it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westin would not talk about who would replace them. Jack Ford,  
co-host of the weekend ``Today'' show on NBC, has been mentioned as 
a possible host. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is gambling that Gibson and Sawyer can bring a short-term  
ratings bump that can be built upon when the show moves to a new 
studio in New York's Times Square, perhaps as early as September. 
The risk is that tradition-bound morning viewers, already reeling 
from rapid changes on ``Good Morning America,'' will see this as a 
short-term fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson admitted that he and Ms. Sawyer ``both sort of giggled''  
when the idea was first presented to them. ``All of a sudden we 
realized that they weren't kidding,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two anchors and Westin all said it was important to the  
overall health of ABC News to straighten out ``Good Morning 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their chief competitor said it was a ``bold move.'' Jeffrey  
Zucker, executive producer of ``Today,'' said it should help his 
show because ``it will keep us on our toes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also shuffled the top management of ``Good Morning  
America.'' Shelley Ross, a senior producer with ``20/20,'' is 
replacing Shelley Lewis as executive producer. Phyllis McGrady, 
former executive producer of ``PrimeTime Live,'' was named the ABC 
News executive-in-charge of the show.

<HEADLINE>  Philippine Court Delays Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Three hours before a convicted rapist  
was to be put to death, the Philippine Supreme Court today ordered 
a six-month delay in what would have been the country' first 
execution in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Echegaray, a 38-year-old house painter, had been scheduled  
to die by lethal injection for repeatedly raping his 10-year-old 
stepdaughter. He wept with joy when told of the court's ruling, a 
prison chaplain said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 anti-death penalty activists cheered outside the  
prison where the execution was to have taken place as a nearby 
church bell pealed. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Joseph Estrada expressed dismay at the ruling,  
calling it a ``sad day for law enforcement and the rule of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, several lawmakers expressed doubts whether  
capital punishment would deter crime and sought a congressional 
review of the law that restored the death penalty in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 8-5 ruling, the Supreme Court said ``the merest chance  
that the Congress might reconsider'' the law required that 
Echegaray be granted a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely a victory, a significant first step in  
abolishing the death penalty in this country,'' said Echegaray's 
lawyer, Theodore Te. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada said the court overstepped its role and promised to veto  
any new law repealing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray, who was convicted in 1994, is the first among more  
than 800 death-row inmates to be scheduled for execution. More than 
450 of those on death row were convicted of rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the prison in Muntinlupa, a Manila suburb, set up  
barbed wire roadblocks and deployed extra military and police 
guards to hold back the crowds as the scheduled execution 
approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Death penalty supporters condemned the court's ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray's 15-year-old stepdaughter, who was 10 when the rapes  
occurred, visited Estrada last week and asked him not to pardon her 
stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt nothing but compassion for her,'' Estrada said. ``You  
can just imagine if she were your daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people. In  
1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave 
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as 
murder, kidnapping, rape and drug trafficking. Legislators, alarmed 
by a rise in crime, brought back the penalty in January 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposing the death  
penalty say there is no proof capital punishment deters crime. They 
also say poor people are more likely to be sentenced to death 
because they cannot afford good lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray's stepdaughter said she was disappointed that many  
people, including church officials, sympathized with Echegaray. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't understand what's happening to me now and what I'm  
feeling,'' the sobbing stepdaughter told reporters after learning 
of the delay.

<HEADLINE> US To Allow More Contact With Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While vowing unbending hostility toward the  
Cuban government, President Clinton is planning measures to 
increase contact between Cubans and Americans and to allow a 
significant expansion of cash transfers from private Americans to 
needy Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals also contemplate U.S. food sales to Cuba on a  
limited basis for the first time as well as direct mail service and 
an expansion of direct charter flights. A formal White House 
announcement was expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	After officials disclosed the initiative on Monday, Rep. Ileana  
Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said the measures were part of an 
administration attempt to mask its ``true intention of normalizing 
relations with the Cuban dictator,'' Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	But a senior administration official insisted none of the  
initiatives involve any softening of the three-decade trade embargo 
on Castro's Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Ros-Lehtinen's Cuban-American colleague, Rep. Lincoln  
Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., said he will oppose any food sales to Cuba on 
grounds they are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says any such sales would be limited to  
entities independent of the government and therefore would be 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures build on the Cuba Democracy Act of 1992, which  
tightened the U.S. embargo but also called for increased exchanges 
between Cubans and Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Progress in people-to-people contacts have been hampered by  
political setbacks, including the mass exodus of Cubans toward 
Florida in 1994 and the shooting down by two Cuban MiG jet fighters 
of four unarmed, Miami-based planes north of the island in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba a year ago has made it  
easier for the administration to introduce innovations. Officials 
insist the policy shifts help promote democracy without helping 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, all cash transfers from U.S. residents to needy  
Cubans were barred. In March, Clinton reinstated the remittances, 
allowing Cuban-Americans to send up to $1,200 a year to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to ease that restriction further, permitting  
any U.S. resident to send money to the island up to the $1,200 
annual limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Until 1993, Castro barred Cubans from holding dollars, seeing  
the currency as a reminder of past Yankee abuses. With the Cuban 
economy in free fall, remittances have spared countless Cubans from 
destitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials see dollar holdings as a way to  
liberate ordinary Cubans from dependence on the state for survival. 
The more Cubans with more dollars, officials say, the more they 
will be able to open small business -- another innovation of recent 
years that was once unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact of Clinton's initiative is far from clear. Cuban  
cooperation will be required in some areas, particularly the plan 
for increased exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	One early test will come when a delegation from the Baltimore  
Orioles travels to Havana, perhaps this week, to sound out Cuban 
officials on the possibility of one or two exhibition baseball 
games with a Cuban squad in March. Profits would be earmarked for 
independent charities aimed at assisting Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pleased pro-embargo conservatives by rejecting a  
proposal for creation of a bipartisan commission to review Cuba 
policy. To opponents, the proposal looked like a disguised bid to 
overturn the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision disappointed Sen. John Warner, R-Va., an embargo  
opponent who led the drive for the commission. He believes current 
policy treats Cuba more cruelly than more bona fide threats to 
national security, such as Iraq and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail deliveries between the countries are possible but often  
take months. The proposal for direct service follows a significant 
expansion of U.S.-Cuban telephone communications earlier in the 
decade, made possible by an extensive modernization program. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct charter flights to Cuba were legal until 1996 when the  
four Miami-based planes were shot down. Clinton retaliated by 
banning such flights but reinstated them last March. His new 
proposal contemplates an easing of existing restrictions on such 
flights, possibly including allowing flights from U.S. cities other 
than Miami.

<HEADLINE> Va. Highway Crash Leaves 4 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Billy Freeman was hauling lemons from Los  
Angeles to Boston when a truck following his tractor-trailer 
slammed into his rig, overturning the trailer and spilling its 
cargo of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were coming off a hill and it was slick but we came to a  
stop,'' Freeman said Sunday. ``Then, after that, slam! Bang! I 
thank God I'm here because there were some people who did not make 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were killed Sunday after a series of crashes along  
northbound Interstate 81. At least 23 people, including Freeman, 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	State police attributed the multi-vehicle crashes to the  
slippery weather conditions and to excessive speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a war zone,'' Danny Young, a tow truck driver who  
helped remove mangled cars from the scene, told The Washington 
Post. ``It was terrible. 
</P>
<P>
	The crashes started shortly after the morning rush hour while  
traffic slowed just south of Lexington. The original slowdown was 
for an accident on the bridge crossing the Maury River. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes, eight tractor-trailers and eight cars lost  
control, including a state police cruiser that had stopped for the 
first accident. The highway's northbound lanes were closed for 
almost 12 hours with traffic backed up as far as 20 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a few moments it was scary not knowing if you are going to  
live or die,'' said Douglas Toy, Freeman's driving partner. 
</P>
<P>
	State police were withholding the names of the dead until  
relatives could be notified. State police Sgt. R.D. Ross said they 
included two people from Tennessee and two from Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen of the injured were treated at Stonewall Jackson  
Hospital in Lexington. All but one were released. That victim, a 
boy, was in stable condition, said hospital spokeswoman Beverly 
Fertig. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were taken to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital in  
Roanoke. One was in critical condition and one was in serious 
condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of five victims taken to the University of Virginia Medical  
Center in Charlottesville, a man in his 20s was in critical 
condition and another man was in serious condition. A 9-year-old 
girl and a 7-year-old boy were in fair condition, and their mother 
was stable, said David Haugh, the hospital's night administrator.

<HEADLINE> Actor Iron Eyes Cody Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Iron Eyes Cody, the ``Crying Indian'' whose  
tearful face in 1970s television commercials became a powerful 
symbol of the anti-littering campaign, died Monday. He was in his 
80s or early 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody died of natural causes in his Los Angeles home, police  
spokesman Ed Funes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody, whose acting credits date back to silent movies and  
include dozens of films and television shows, was best known for 
the ads from the group Keep America Beautiful that showed him 
shedding a single tear as he watched people litter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more than advertising,'' said Roger Powers, who was  
president of Keep America Beautiful in 1970, when a California 
advertising agency discovered Cody. ``What we found -- it was a 
stroke of luck -- was a man who lived it and believed in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody filmed three more public service announcements and spent  
the next 25 years making public appearances and visits to schools 
on behalf of the movement, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He galvanized so many people who really questioned whether  
individually they could make a difference,'' Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born in Oklahoma, but the exact date of birth wasn't  
known. Reference books give various dates, from 1904 to 1915. Based 
on his credits, his most likely date of birth was 1907. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody followed his Cherokee Indian father, Thomas Long Plume, as  
a performer in circuses and Wild West shows and made his first film 
appearance as an extra in the 1919 silent ``Back to God's 
Country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody went on to appear in more than 80 films in Indian roles;  
often his character was listed as simply ``Indian,'' ``Indian 
Chief'' or ``Indian Joe.'' In one film, ``Perils of Nyoka'' in 
1942, he had an uncredited role as ``Arab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His other credits included ``Sitting Bull'' in 1954, ``The Great  
Sioux Massacre'' in 1965, ``Nevada Smith'' in 1966, ``A Man Called 
Horse'' in 1970 and ``Ernest Goes to Camp'' in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody also served as a technical adviser on Native American  
matters in films. 
</P>
<P>
	In television, he had guest appearances on ``Bonanza,''  
``Gunsmoke'' and ``Rawhide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody's wife died in 1978. He is survived by a son; three  
grandchildren; and a niece.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Union Makes Last Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The union for locked-out NBA players finally  
gave its new labor proposal to the commissioner Monday, just three 
days before the deadline for reaching a new agreement or canceling 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took it and reviewed it and said they would get back to  
us,'' union director Billy Hunter said after the 45-minute meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA did not immediately comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, attended by commissioner David Stern, deputy  
commissioner Russ Granik, Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing, 
represented the first face-to-face talks between the sides since 
Dec. 27 when they met for five hours near Denver and the league 
made its ``final'' offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union then readied a counterproposal but refused to give it  
to the owners until they agreed to a face-to-face meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	It finally came Monday afternoon at a hotel across the street  
from league headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've given them the proposal, they'll have a conference call  
with their labor committee and we expect to speak to them later in 
the day,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has told all 19 players on its negotiating committee  
to be in New York by Tuesday morning. The deadline is Thursday for 
reaching a new collective bargaining agreement to save the 
remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	If no deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with  
one ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
that day to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Williams of the Knicks, a member of the union's executive  
committee, thinks the deadline might be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a deal was done on the 9th or 10th, I'm sure David wouldn't  
say that just because we didn't do it on 7th the season is over. 
It's a business, and sometimes you have to posture,'' Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players have been asking for a vote on the owners' final  
offer, but the union's negotiating committee -- the only body with 
the power to put a proposal to a vote -- says it will not put 
forward any offer that it does not deem worthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have moved toward each other on virtually all of the  
most hotly contested issues, and the union's new offer included an 
absolute limit on the amount of salary any player can earn. If 
accepted, it would make the NBA the only professional sports league 
to limit the amount of money a top athlete can make. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in the way of a settlement are items of contention  
worth tens of millions of dollars per year. 
</P>
<P>
	If no agreement is reached, the NBA will have gone from being  
the only major U.S. sport to never have lost a game to a work 
stoppage to being the first sport to lose an entire season to a 
labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the first two months of the season have been wiped out.  
It would take three to four weeks after a settlement to begin a 45- 
to 50-game season. 
</P>
<P>
	The key sticking point to a settlement could center on how much  
revenue will be paid to the players during the course of the 
six-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the union wants 55 percent of revenue devoted  
to salaries in the fourth year while owners have offered 53 
percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners 
are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- 
the amount they received last season -- while the league is offering 
54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, signed  
Monday with Kinder Bologna of the Italian League for $3 million. 
The 7-foot-1 center can return to the NBA on Feb. 15 if the lockout 
is lifted and still would receive $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Steven Woods, the agent for Toronto's Kevin Willis,  
refiled an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor 
Relations Board against the union for allegedly breaching its duty 
of fair representation.

<HEADLINE> NBA and Players Union Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBA labor talks resumed today, with the lead  
negotiators from the league and union trying to salvage a season 
that could be wiped out this week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was believed the union would finally turn over its new  
proposal, which has been sitting undelivered since New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, which was confirmed by both sides, was the first in  
nine days. At the last meeting, which was held in Denver, the 
league gave the union its final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The players have been pushing for another meeting since last  
week, but the league had been refusing. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's meeting came on commissioner David Stern's first full  
day back from a two-week stay in Aspen, Colo. He was joined by 
deputy commissioner Russ Granik, union director Billy Hunter and 
union president Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has called all 19 players on its negotiating  
committee, telling them to be in New York by Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline is Thursday for reaching a new collective  
bargaining agreement to save the remainder of the season. If no 
deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with one 
ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
that day to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of the public asking me why we aren't meeting. Ask  
David that,'' Hunter said from his office Sunday. ``He's been out 
in Aspen for two weeks. Where is his sense of urgency?'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had been almost no communication between the sides since  
last Thursday when the union said it would not hand over its latest 
proposal because the league had refused to agree to a bargaining 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The league had maintained that posture since, saying there is no  
need to meet since the owners' final offer had already been 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players have been asking for a vote on the owners' final  
offer, but the union's negotiating committee -- the only body with 
the power to put a proposal to a vote -- says it will not put 
forward any offer that it does not deem worthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way a deal can be made is to get the people in the  
room, and they'll conclude that,'' union attorney Jeffrey Kessler 
said. ``I don't think the owners want to lose the season any more 
than the players do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have moved toward each other on virtually all of the  
most hotly contested issues, but differences worth tens of million 
of dollars a year remain unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
	If no agreement is reached, the NBA will have gone from being  
the only major U.S. sport to never have lost a game to a work 
stoppage to being the first sport to lose an entire season to a 
labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the first two months of the season have been wiped out.  
It would take three to four weeks after a settlement to play a 45- 
to 50-game season. 
</P>
<P>
	The key sticking point to a settlement could center on how much  
revenue will be paid to the players during the course of the 
six-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the union wants 55 percent of revenue devoted  
to salaries in the fourth year while owners have offered 53 
percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners 
are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- 
the amount they received last season while the league is offering 
54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Says He Admires Flutie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Doug Flutie, unhappy that the Miami Dolphins  
celebrated their playoff victory over the Buffalo Bills by stomping 
on Flutie Flakes, will receive a letter from Jimmy Johnson saying 
no disrespect was intended. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson decided to send the letter after learning Flutie was  
upset, Dolphins spokesman Harvey Greene said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration in the Dolphins' locker room followed their  
24-17 playoff victory Saturday over Buffalo. Johnson crushed a box 
of Flutie Flakes, and his players then stomped on the cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie was upset because proceeds from the sale of Flutie Flakes  
help autistic children. Flutie's son, Doug Jr., has autism. 
</P>
<P>
	When told of the celebration, the Bills' quarterback said:  
``That's like stepping on my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's letter says he admires what Flutie has done both on  
and off the field and commends his efforts to fight autism, Greene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy certainly meant no disrespect,'' Greene said. ``It was  
simply from a football perspective and not meant as disrespect for 
anything Doug has done off the field.''

<HEADLINE> Euro Trading Ushers in New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Asian financial markets today welcomed the debut of  
Europe's new common currency, the euro, which some traders see as a 
ready alternative to the U.S. dollar -- long an unrivaled safe haven 
for the world's investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for the euro in early trading pushed its value up to  
$1.1862 and 134.77 Japanese yen, well above expectations. But 
trading was limited and cautious as many investors awaited the 
reaction to the euro on its home turf, Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen a lot of inquiries coming in regard to the euro,  
but not a tremendous amount of activity,'' said Peter Chen, 
director of sales for Southeast Asia and North Asia at Deutsche 
Bank in Singapore. Chen's office set up a one-time, 24-hour 
operation today to deal with the inaugural day of euro trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, bankers and traders were abuzz with preparations to  
handle increased trading in the coming weeks and months. Many 
expect Asian investors to begin shifting a large chunk of their 
savings into bonds and other investments denominated in the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It creates a new asset class,'' said Robert Feldman, an  
economist in the Tokyo office of the investment bank Morgan 
Stanley, noting that the market for euros was expected to be deep 
enough to absorb major trades without causing volatile swings in 
the currency's price. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese investors, who own one of the world's largest pools of  
savings, will likely find the euro an important tool for 
diversifying their holdings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The infant currency was launched at midnight Thursday in Europe,  
following the announcement of fixed conversion rates for the euro 
against its 11 constituent European currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro is designed in part to help the European Union forge a  
common market that is able to stand its ground against the United 
States and Asia. The euro unites the currencies of 11 of the 15 
European Union states -- Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro could prove an attractive alternative to the dollar  
because it represents a huge portion of the world's economy. The 
European Union represents 20 percent of the world's economic output 
and 18 percent of world trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, analysts say the euro is poised to grow in popularity  
because investors can now buy a basket of European securities 
without having to worry about volatility in the prices of 11 
individual currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors will use the euro as a way ``to bundle'' their  
non-dollar investments, said Axel Thill a director in the Tokyo 
office of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia, where trading began before sunrise, traders at  
Westpac Banking Corp.'s office in Sydney gazed intently at their 
computer screens between coffee breaks. At one desk, a European 
Union flag was perched atop a terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Berrell, a Westpac trader, said the few euro deals he knew  
of mainly involved Asian buyers and European sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's value rose to $1.1862 before falling slightly to  
$1.1806 by midday trading in Tokyo -- well above the rate of $1.1668 
set last Thursday by the European Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen, which was initially expected to trade at 132.80 euros,  
rose as high as 134.77 by midday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's advance came as the dollar continued its decline  
against the Japanese currency. The greenback bought 113.28 yen as 
of midday in Tokyo, down 1.92 yen, compared to its level of 113.57 
yen last Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia was the first major financial market to trade the  
euro. However, the currency did trade lightly in Bombay, India, on 
Friday, where markets opened despite the New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks in Asia spent the weekend gearing up to trade in  
euros. Today, most of the newly modified computer systems were 
working just fine, but at least one bank in Sydney reported minor 
problems with its screens as trading opened. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial today, Japan's leading business daily urged  
corporate leaders to ``draw a lesson from the euro by setting 
strategic targets'' to revive the world's second-largest economy, 
noting that a unified currency will make Europe a stronger 
competitor vis-a-vis Asia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	While trading in the euro began widely today, the first business  
day in the new year, euro bills and coins will not be introduced 
until January 2002.

<HEADLINE> Peace Corps Begins Recruiting Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Peace Corps is preparing to recruit more  
volunteers this year than at any time in the past 25 years but 
won't meet President Clinton's goal of 10,000 by the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	With an 8 percent budget increase, the organization intends to  
sign up nearly 4,000 volunteers this year, Peace Corps Director 
Mark Gearan said in an interview Monday. Currently, 6,700 are 
serving two-year stints in 80 countries. With about half those 
ending terms, the year-end total is expected to exceed 7,100. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peace Corps, whose budget is $240 million, expects to have  
the highest number of volunteers since 1974, said Gearan as he 
released the names of colleges and universities with the largest 
number of graduates serving overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Wisconsin topped the list with 116, followed  
by the University of Colorado at Boulder with 91 and the University 
of Washington with 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Among small colleges --those with fewer than 5,000 undergraduates  
-- American University in Washington, D.C., led, with 36 alumni 
serving as volunteers, followed by the University of Chicago, with 
23, and Carleton College of Northfield, Minn., with 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Gearan said 97 percent of Peace Corps volunteers hold at least a  
bachelor's degree, and 15 percent have graduate degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	But accelerated Peace Corps recruiting will look well beyond  
college campuses this year, Gearan said. The average age of Peace 
Corps volunteers is 29, with 7 percent over 50 years old. The Peace 
Corps has no upper age limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of our volunteers come right out of college, but  
increasingly now many take time to work for a bit, gaining some 
experience before serving,'' Gearan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The director said he is confident the Peace Corps can meet its  
immediate recruitment goals because it has had an increase in 
applicants in recent years, with its slogan ``the toughest job 
you'll ever love'' and a new campaign theme: ``How far are you 
willing to go to make a difference?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10,000-volunteer goal, with more budget increases from  
Congress, should be achieved early in the next century, Gearan 
said. Clinton had set the goal in his 1998 State of the Union 
address and asked for a 20 percent Peace Corps budget increase for 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace Corps volunteers receive living expenses, health care  
coverage and a readjustment allowance after their service. They 
work to help fight hunger, bring clean water to communities, teach 
children, help start new small businesses and work to stop the 
spread of AIDS, the Peace Corps said. Since its start in 1961, more 
than 150,000 Americans have served as volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools among the top 10 with current volunteers were the  
University of Illinois, with 75;, the University of Michigan, 71; 
the University of California at Davis, 64; Colorado State 
University, 63; Michigan State, 62; and Cornell, Indiana University 
at Bloomington and the University of Oregon, 58 each.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Beginning Term As Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura's  
four-year term as governor begins today when he takes the oath of 
office, two months after the Reform Party candidate's election 
victory rocked national politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, whose political experience includes a term as Brooklyn  
Park mayor from 1991-95, succeeds GOP Gov. Arne Carlson as the 
state's 37th governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Substad, a minister and political buff from Eagle Lake,  
arrived three hours before the ceremony today to get one of the 
couple of hundred seats available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm completely shocked at the election and anxious to see what  
he's going to do in the next four years,'' said Substad, who 
brought his two small children with him. ``He'll shake things up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Ventura entered the race less than a year ago, the  
bombastic former talk radio host and sometime actor, said he was 
motivated by a quest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find out if the American dream is dead,'' Ventura  
said. ``I want to find out if you have to be a career politician to 
lead and govern the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said, ``Let's put Minnesotans first. There's more of us  
than Democrats or Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesotans heeded his words Nov. 3 and gave him 37 percent of  
the votes in his stunning defeat of Republican Norm Coleman and 
Democrat Hubert Humphrey III. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura and four other new statewide officials were to be sworn  
in today during a ceremony in the Capitol rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
	Also to take the oath were Lt. Gov.-elect Mae Schunk, Attorney  
General-elect Mike Hatch, Secretary of State-elect Mary Kiffmeyer 
and Treasurer-elect Carol Johnson. State Auditor Judi Dutcher is 
the only one who was to take it for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the spotlight is expected to shine brightest on  
Ventura who has been besieged by interview requests since the 
election. Media requests to cover the inauguration came from around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura planned to speak briefly, without notes and from the  
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Seating at the Capitol event was limited to about 200 members of  
the public for the official ceremony, but Ventura pledged to stand 
and shake hands for two hours afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife of 23 years, Terry Ventura, decided to forgo a  
black-tie ball in favor of a ``people's celebration'' bash at the 
Target Center Jan. 16 with live music. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old south Minneapolis native's trip to the  
governor's office has been less than typical. 
</P>
<P>
	Born James George Janos, he graduated from Roosevelt High School  
and joined the elite Navy SEALs underwater demolition team. He 
briefly attended North Hennepin Community College before embarking 
on his professional wrestling career and taking the name Jesse 
``The Body'' Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	After the election, Ventura shrugged off his old nickname and  
said he wanted to be known as ``The Mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the ring in 1986 after a successful career and  
became an actor. His biggest success was a turn in 1987's 
``Predator'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger, in which he uttered the 
memorable line ``I ain't got time to bleed.'' That now is the 
working title of a planned authorized biography. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also made a career as a radio talk show host.  
</P>
<P>
	During the campaign, he often complained that he had been out of  
work since late July when his manager at KFAN-AM forced him to quit 
out of fairness during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Ventura will start drawing his $120,303 governor's salary.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Confirms Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp. and AirTouch Communications  
Inc. confirmed they are holding talks relating to a possible 
business combination. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch, the nation's second-largest cellular phone company,  
said Sunday that ``significant issues still remain unresolved,'' 
and that its board of directors had not approved a transaction. It 
did not elaborate further. 
</P>
<P>
	In statements released late Sunday, both companies said that no  
further comment would be made by either company until an agreement 
had been reached or discussions were terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday cable news channel CNBC, citing sources close to  
the talks, said that Bell Atlantic was negotiating a $45 billion 
takeover of AirTouch. The reported purchase price would make Bell 
Atlantic-AirTouch the fifth-largest merger in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Gerace, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, refused to comment on the  
report, nor would he comment on a possible timetable for a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bell Atlantic this summer agreed to merge with  
GTE Corp. in a $64 billion deal that would allow the companies to 
create a huge provider of all-in-one services, including long 
distance, local calling and wireless services. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC said the Stamford, Conn.-based GTE has already agreed to  
the AirTouch deal, which would be completed before the Bell 
Atlantic-GTE deal closes. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based AirTouch, a spinoff of former Baby Bell  
Pacific Telesis Group, ranks behind only AT&AMP;T Corp. among U.S. 
cellular phone companies. The company has 14 million cellular 
subscribers in the United States, as well as fast-growing 
international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, the nation's biggest local phone company, has 42  
million telephone access lines and 8 million wireless customers 
worldwide.

<HEADLINE>  NASA Spacecraft Soars Toward Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's newest spacecraft hurtled  
toward Mars today with a shovel to dig for ice and a microphone to 
pick up sounds from the planet's South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander soared into an overcast sky aboard a  
Boeing rocket Sunday afternoon, beginning a journey that will span 
11 months and 470 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
	By this afternoon, the Polar Lander was 188,000 miles from  
Earth. It had yet to lock onto stars, however, and was relying 
solely on the sun for orientation. Managers said it was a trivial 
problem that they hoped to overcome in the days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first spacecraft to land near the Martian South  
Pole when it parachutes down in December. By then, it will be late 
spring, a time when the sun never sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Landing near a pole of a planet where you might see some  
frozen ice, that's neat stuff,'' said Edward Weiler, head of NASA's 
space science division. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's three previous Mars landers plopped down in the  
equatorial desert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bunch of rocks, couple hills in the background,'' said Weiler.  
``Now we're landing near a pole. I mean, I don't know what we're 
going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as thrilling will be what the Polar Lander hears.  
</P>
<P>
	The lander is equipped with a tiny microphone, the kind used in  
hearing aids. It was provided by The Planetary Society at no cost 
to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists question whether sound will travel in the thin  
Martian atmosphere and, if it does, whether anything will be heard 
other than the movement of the Polar Lander's robot arm and its 
internal systems. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a possibility the sound of dust or sand blowing against  
the lander might be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think, I hope to be wrong, that we'll actually hear  
the wind blowing through the trees,'' said project manager John 
McNamee. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 objective of the Polar Lander is to find water, the  
same goal of its companion craft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, some 4 
million miles from Earth following its launch three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to follow the water if you're looking for life,''  
Weiler explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander -- 3 1/2 feet tall and 12 feet wide -- is due to  
touch down Dec. 3. Scientists have yet to pick the exact spot, but 
are aiming for a latitude of about 75 degrees south. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the cushioned Pathfinder, which bounced down amid  
boulders on July 4, 1997, the Polar Lander will come down on three 
legs the same way the two Viking landers did in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be ``as sexy as bouncing around on air bags,'' Weiler  
noted, but it should be safer and, what's more, will be 
photographed by an on-board camera. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander's best feature is a 6 1/2-foot robot arm with a  
scoop on the end to scrape beneath the Martian surface. The 
collected dirt will be heated, allowing any water that's present to 
vaporize and be detected by a laser. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also equipped with a pair of cantaloupe-size probes that  
will peel away minutes before touchdown and slam into the Martian 
surface at 400 mph to 500 mph, some 60 miles from the lander. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the lander, the twin probes will hunt for water but at a  
much greater depth: They could penetrate as deep as 3 feet. The 
question is whether they will survive the impact and radio back 
data. It's a high-risk experiment called Deep Space 2 that's part 
of NASA's New Millennium program to test new technologies for 
future missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment cost $29 million. That's on top of $327 million  
for the Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ongoing controversy over whether a Mars meteorite  
contains evidence of ancient life, the Polar Lander carries no 
life-detection instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The only real way to confirm life on Mars, Weiler said, is to  
fetch dirt and rocks. NASA plans to launch a soil-return mission in 
2005; the samples would reach Earth in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	``This mission, unless its microphone hears Elvis or a Martian  
walks by the camera, it's not going to find life on Mars,'' Weiler 
said. ``But it's part of a long-term program.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Urges High Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gray Davis promised to lead California  
into a new era of racial harmony and educational excellence as he 
was sworn in Monday as the state's 37th governor, the first 
Democrat since his old boss, Gov. Jerry Brown, left office in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will revive the sense of unlimited possibility and common  
purpose that once made California the envy of the world,'' he said 
after Chief Justice Ronald George administered the oath. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will govern neither from the right nor the left, but from  
the center, propelled not by ideology, but by common sense that 
seeks better results for all of us,'' Davis said. ``It matters not 
to me whether the idea comes from a Republican or a Democrat. What 
matters is whether that idea is right or wrong -- and whether it 
works!'' 
</P>
<P>
	His inaugural address was repeatedly interrupted by applause as  
he thanked Vice President Al Gore, outgoing GOP Gov. Pete Wilson 
and friends and family members gathered behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we begin a new chapter in the state's history: The Era  
of Higher Expectations,'' he said.

	The line borrowed from Davis' call on the campaign trail for a  
``high-expectation approach'' to education, and was an optimistic 
twist on Brown's warning in the mid-1970s that Californians were 
entering the ``Era of Limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis reaffirmed his commitment to abortion rights and promised  
to give any high school student who graduates in the top 4 percent 
of the class automatic admission to the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had been lieutenant governor, a lawmaker and chief of  
staff to Brown, who marked his political rebirth Monday in Oakland 
as he was sworn in as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to break the mold,'' Brown said after taking the  
oath of office. ``I really see this place as a Renaissance, a 
revitalization of what it means to be in a Democratic society.''

<HEADLINE> Retailers Slash PC Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cheap computers stole sales away from more  
expensive PCs this Christmas, and now retailers are offering big 
discounts to clear out their higher-priced inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	That means consumers can find a wide variety of powerful  
computers with lots of goodies attached for around $1,000, well 
below what they would have paid a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to buy a higher-end system, this is the time to  
buy,'' said Matt Sargent, an analyst at ZD Market Intelligence, a 
research firm based in La Jolla, Calif. ``The stores are 
overstocked and they want to clear their shelves to make room for 
new inventory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a strong year for the computer industry, largely because  
prices dropped to levels affordable enough to appeal to the masses. 
</P>
<P>
	According to new research from ZD Market Intelligence, the  
average retail selling price for a personal desktop computer was 
$983 in November, the first time it dropped below $1,000. A year 
ago, the average price was $1,329. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, market share increased sharply for cheap computers.  
In October, PCs under $600 accounted for 5.5 percent of retail 
sales. By November, they accounted for 16.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing consumers' appetite for lower prices, retailers  
counted on the less-expensive computers to entice shoppers to their 
stores during the holidays. It was hard to miss the barrage of 
advertisements touting computers for as little as $400. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of promotions out there for the low-priced  
computers, but the more expensive ones they didn't promote as much 
and didn't sell as many,'' said David Goldstein, president of 
Channel Marketing Corp. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, retailers hope price cuts on higher-end models move  
products out of stores quickly. Manufacturers are already shipping 
new inventory, and the outdated computers have almost no shelf 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the discounts, consumers can get more computing power  
for less money that ever before. Many of these PCs offer more fast 
processing and extensive memory than the cheaper variety. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the deals Best Buy is offering this week is a a Packard  
Bell 350 megahertz computer, also with monitor and printer, for 
$999.70, down from $1376.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio Shack is marking down its entire line of Compaq computers,  
the only brand that it sells at its 7,000 stores. Among its 
discounts is a 300 megahertz desktop computer, with monitor and 
printer, for $950, down from $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Online retailer Cyberian Outpost has a deal on a Compaq notebook  
computer with 266 megahertz for $1,200, down from $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
	``January is one of the biggest months for new models,''  
Goldstein said. ``They have to make room for the new computers 
immediately.''

<HEADLINE> Relatives Seek News of Cult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- As Israeli officials investigate members of a  
Denver-based doomsday cult, relatives back home are still trying to 
determine if their family members are among those rounded up in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Paris, a firefighter in Garland, Texas, said Monday that  
he had shared the writings of group leader Monte Kim Miller with 
his brother, Greg, who vanished from Denver last fall along with 
his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave no indication of where they were located. You can  
speculate. My suspicions are that's where they are'' in Israel, he 
said. ``We all pray for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen of the 78 Concerned Christians members who disappeared  
last fall were detained after Sunday raids on two homes in the 
suburbs of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli police said the group planned to provoke a bloody  
shootout by opening fire on officers, believing the violence would 
hasten the return of Jesus Christ. Miller was not among those 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities moved to deport six children and five adults Monday.  
Three who were ordered detained -- John Bayles, Eric Malesic and 
Terry Smith -- will be deported pending completion of the police 
investigation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives in the United States searched news reports and worked  
bureaucratic channels for information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to find out if they're going to be deported and  
sent back to the United States,'' said James Van Beek of Eagle, 
whose wife is related to Smith. ``Some of the family would like to 
go ... and welcome them back and let them know they're loved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cult members sold homes, packed up belongings and left without a  
word weeks ago in following Miller, a 44-year-old former Denver 
resident who claimed he would die on the streets of Jerusalem and 
be resurrected in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of cult members hoped the shock of the raids would  
``shake them loose'' from Miller, Denver police officer Mark 
Roggeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Beek, who has eight relatives involved in the cult, hoped  
Roggeman's prediction comes true. ``Maybe they'll understand that 
it's not a good thing that they're involved with,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Clinton Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Within hours after the ceremonial convening of  
the 106th Congress on Wednesday, newly sworn-in members of the 
House will vote on authorizing key lawmakers to present evidence 
against President Clinton in a Senate impeachment trial, officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Hastert, the Illinois Republican on the brink of  
election as House speaker, who said the House will vote Wednesday, 
said he hopes the proposal -- identical to the one that cleared the 
House in December -- will pass. GOP vote counters expressed 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would certainly like to see Henry Hyde be able to present  
the testimony and what he needs to do to put his case forward,'' 
Hastert said in a reference to the Illinois lawmaker who chaired 
the impeachment inquiry in the House. House rules require that the 
new Congress vote on the managers of the trial, who were named by 
the lame duck House in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert made his comments as Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., struggled to line up fellow Republicans behind a 
bipartisan plan for a truncated trial-like proceeding that could be 
wrapped up within days, without testimony from any of the key 
principals in the case. Key conservatives expressed unhappiness 
with the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, the president's lawyers continued to develop  
an elaborate defense that could take weeks or months to present if 
the case goes to a full-blown trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers familiar with the developing defense strategy said  
lawyers are working on trial motions concerning evidence and an 
opening presentation that would sharply attack the House 
conclusions and the evidence from prosecutor Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening presentation ``would be far more extensive and  
sharper in tone and content'' than the one Clinton's lawyers made 
before the House Judiciary Committee in arguing the evidence didn't 
warrant impeachment, one lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved two articles of impeachment on Dec. 19,  
accusing Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice in 
connection with an attempt to conceal his sexual relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 

</P>
<P>
	The requirement for a repeat vote on appointing so-called House  
managers, or prosecutors, in the new Congress means newly elected 
lawmakers will vote on the momentous issue on their first day in 
office. It also gives fresh opportunities to Democrats -- who gained 
seats in the November elections -- to affect the course of an 
impeachment they have sought to thwart. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, listed  
several options, including a new attempt to place the House on 
record in favor of censure, a plan to try and limit the 
jurisdiction of the House's prosecutors and a plan to try to add 
Democrats to the team of prosecutors. While each of these 
suggestions is under discussion, each has pitfalls and Democrats 
may ultimately decide against pursuing any of them, these officials 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The certainty of a House vote on Wednesday stood in marked  
contrast to the unsettled situation in the Senate, where Lott 
struggled to fashion a procedure for a trial that could satisfy 
half his own GOP members and win Democratic support. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stab at bipartisanship, two lawmakers have outlined a  
procedure calling for Hyde to present evidence for one day, the 
White House to have a day for rebuttal, and the Senate to take a 
quick vote to determine whether a full-blown trial should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference in his home state of Washington, Republican  
Sen. Slade Gorton said the plan he and Democratic Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman of Connecticut developed will proceed only if a majority 
of each caucus supports it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats apparently are in favor and his ``best guess'' is that  
a majority of the Senate agrees, but ``Senator Lott will propose 
the plan, I believe, only if a majority of Republicans favor it,'' 
Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had no head count within the GOP caucus or the full  
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott met with aides and outside advisers during the day and  
arranged a session with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
for Tuesday. All senators are expected back in the Capitol on 
Wednesday for the opening of the new Congress, and no formal 
decisions are expected until then on proceedings for the first 
presidential impeachment trial since Andrew Johnson's in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of raw numbers, Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in  
the Senate, far short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict 
Clinton and remove him from office, even if all GOP lawmakers voted 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Democrats are well shy of the simple majority  
needed to adjourn any trial and move promptly to a vote on censure, 
and are unlikely to be able to peel away enough Republican 
defectors to be able to do so, at least in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
	With the White House expecting eventual negotiations over a  
censure, presidential advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Clinton was comfortable making an acknowledgment similar to 
the one White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff made in testimony 
last month. Ruff testified that reasonable people might conclude 
Clinton made false statements under oath but that the president 
believed he was being evasive, but not lying. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it (a censure proposal) goes farther than that, it's a  
tougher sale,'' one outside adviser said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The split within Republican ranks was underscored during the day  
when Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota, a conservative, and Sen. Arlen 
Specter of Pennsylvania, a moderate, both spoke out against the 
suggestion floated by Gorton and Lieberman. Sen. Don Nickles, 
R-Okla., the GOP whip, has privately expressed opposition, 
according to GOP officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Lott, Grams said he was fearful of a proposal to  
``shortcut the procedure. ... I simply believe we must accept our 
responsibility to conduct the impeachment trial, followed by a vote 
to remove or retain the president,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter told reporters, ``I think it is very difficult to  
conduct a trial if you don't have witnesses. It's pretty hard to 
have a trial without witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt of the tremendous public clamor to have this  
matter concluded at an early date. ... It has to be done right.''

<HEADLINE> Toyota Unveils Low-Price Subcompact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Toyota Motor Co. announced its new entry in the  
low-priced subcompact car market Monday, hoping its quirky interior 
touches will help attract young buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Toyota Echo replaces the Tercel at the bottom of  
Toyota's lineup. It also follows the industry trend of making small 
cars seem as nice and large as possible to appeal to buyers who 
want something bigger but can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was designed to be simple, functional and affordable while  
delivering a level of comfort and driveability that is one class up 
from what consumers have come to expect from an entry-level 
sedan,'' Don Esmond, Toyota vice president and general manager, 
said at the Detroit auto show's media preview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Echo will go on sale next fall in two- and four-door models.  
It comes with a 1.5-liter engine that achieved about 45 miles per 
gallon in Toyota tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Its unique touches include an instrument cluster that's mounted  
in the middle of the dashboard, instead of directly in front of the 
driver. Toyota also touts the car's storage areas, including CD 
bins, split glove boxes and large door pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Echo will enter a market that's getting crowded this year.  
Its competition includes the top-selling Honda Civic, a redesigned 
Dodge and Plymouth Neon and the new Ford Focus, which arrives here 
next fall. All promise more interior room. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's entry also comes as demand for subcompacts continues to  
shrink. Small cars were about 14 percent of the market this year, 
down from 24 percent a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Esmond would not say specifically how much the Echo would cost,  
but said it would be substantially below the Toyota Corolla, which 
sells for $12,000 to $14,000.

<HEADLINE> Libbey To Close Canadian Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Libbey Inc. will close a factory in Canada,  
eliminating 560 jobs, and will stop making glass bottles in an 
attempt to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant in Wallaceburg, Ontario makes drinking glasses and  
also is the company's only producer of glass bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toledo-based company, the largest maker of glass tableware  
in North America, will shift production of drinking glasses to 
other plants in the United States and Mexico, a company statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey spokesman Kenneth Wilkes said the glass bottle line,  
which included beer bottles and food jars, was only a small piece 
of the company's business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was draining a lot of resources and didn't offer any  
long-term growth,'' Wilkes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey officials expect to charge about $20 million, or 68 cents  
per share, against earnings after taxes as a result of the 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the charge and an additional $7 million in  
expenses related to the realignment plan, the company expects to 
have a net loss for the fourth quarter of approximately 47 to 52 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Meier, Libbey's chairman and chief executive officer,  
said he expects the restructuring to boost 1999 operating income by 
$4.5 million to $5 million, or 16 to 18 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey's net sales in 1997 totaled $412 million.  
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Libbey was off  
43 3/4 cents a share at $28.50.

<HEADLINE> London Ready For Euro Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The City of London, the world's largest financial  
center, threw itself into trading of the new single European 
currency today, even though Britain has opted to sit out the 
monetary alliance for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Britain is not participating in the euro, which  
replaces the currencies of 11 of the 15 European Union countries, 
London cannot afford to ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of the world's foreign exchange deals are made in  
London, six times more than in Germany's financial capital, 
Frankfurt. London is home base to 500 international banks. 
</P>
<P>
	And any British investment bank that wants to buy and sell  
shares in European companies will have to be able to do it in 
euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Exchange rates for the 11 currencies were not fixed until  
Thursday, so like their counterparts across Europe, staff at banks 
and other financial firms in the City worked throughout the weekend 
to prepare for the launch, converting their positions into euros 
and changing their systems to ensure a smooth run at the start of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England said Sunday night that the conversion  
appeared to have gone smoothly and that banks were ready. 
Individual banks put the final touches on their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists predicted that trading in the euro may mean a bumpy  
ride for the pound. David Kern, group chief economist for NatWest, 
said currency markets were likely to remain volatile with both the 
pound and the U.S. dollar losing ground to the new euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro and national currencies will operate in parallel until  
2002, when single currency notes and coins will go into circulation 
and supplant the familiar francs, lira and guilders. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has said it will wait to  
decide whether joining the single currency is in Britain's economic 
interest and then put the question to Britons in a referendum.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Deny Nissan Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Debt-laden Nissan Motor Corp. is the favorite  
subject of merger rumors at this year's Detroit auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	A board member of BMW AG denied rumors Monday that the German  
automaker is in discussions with Nissan over a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, declined to comment  
on rumors that the world's No. 2 automaker also was in talks with 
Nissan, but he made it clear that Ford was open to expanding its 
global reach. 
</P>
<P>
	In the post-DaimlerChrysler auto industry, the annual North  
American International Auto Show has become a even more of a rumor 
mill than it used to be. That's due to the fact that last year's 
merger of Chrysler Corp. and Germany's Daimler-Benz AG began with 
private discussions during the 1998 Detroit show. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfgang Reitzle, a BMW board member, said in an interview that  
his company was not in partnership talks with Nissan, Volkswagen AG 
or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' he said. ``Nothing. Zero.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle said BMW is in a strong financial position and sees no  
need to become significantly larger. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no need to join forces with others because we have  
the critical mass in all critical areas: R&AMP;D, sales, production and 
so on,'' he said. ``We don't want to be substantially bigger 
because that creates too much complexity in managing the shear 
size.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most industry experts expect further consolidation of the global  
auto industry in the next decade. Zeitzle said BMW is strong enough 
``to stay competitive as its own supercompany in the next 10-20 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jac Nasser, who was at the auto show on his first work day as  
Ford's new president, declined to say which companies Ford might be 
courting. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is the industry is relatively small in a global  
sense, and there are always discussions going on with the different 
participants,'' Nasser said separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford regularly has discussions with other automakers over a  
variety of issues and joint projects. Ford and Nissan, for example, 
jointly produce minivans in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ford also has made it clear that it is willing to consider a  
larger partnership or merger if it makes economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are, but I don't want to overplay that,'' Nasser said. ``We  
see that as an opportunity but not a necessity for us. We're large 
enough that we have economies of scale, we have six brands that we 
believe still have significant global leverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford failed last year in a bid to buy troubled Kia Motors of  
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said Ford has two major assets that make it an attractive  
merger partner: a healthy balance sheet with lots of cash, and 
cultural diversity in its worldwide management ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an advantage for us. Culturally, we would probably be a  
good fit for many different cooperative partners,'' Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has repeatedly denied speculation that it's talking about  
a partnership with Ford or France's Renault SA. Nissan and 
DaimlerChrysler are discussing the sale of Nissan Diesel, a heavy 
truck business, to the German-American automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's second-largest automaker has lost money in six of the  
past seven years, making it ripe for acquisition.

<HEADLINE> Pack Ponders Life Without Holmgren </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers have found  
themselves having to ponder a possible future without Mike Holmgren 
sooner than they thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumped from the playoffs by San Francisco on Sunday, the Packers  
scrambled to catch flights home after an emotional post-mortem 
meeting with Holmgren, who could, like the team's 18 free agents, 
find himself at a new address next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is weird because we really didn't plan to go home just  
yet,'' defensive lineman Bob Kuberski said as players cleaned out 
their lockers following their earliest playoff exit ever under 
Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams reportedly interested in Holmgren to serve as both coach  
and general manager include Baltimore, Cleveland, Philadelphia and 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf, who said his New Year's  
resolution was to stay mum on the matter until Holmgren made up his 
mind, said Monday that the Packers had given Holmgren permission to 
talk with the Ravens, Eagles and Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll give this to you today, but in the future I don't think  
this is my job,'' Wolf said. ``It's Mike Holmgren's thing. It's all 
Mike. The ball's in his court. He has to do what he has to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's agent, Bob LaMonte, didn't return phone calls seeking  
comment on whether Holmgren would meet with any of the three 
suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren could still return to Green Bay and sign an extension  
that would make him the highest-paid coach in the NFL at about $4 
million per season, but he'd still lack the final say on personnel 
matters that he desperately covets. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren delayed his season-ending news conference until  
Tuesday, but he might have tipped his hand about his intentions 
after San Francisco's 30-27 victory, when he said of the Packers: 
``They'll be good for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his weekly television show Monday night, Holmgren said he  
expected to know very soon where he'll be coaching next year: ``I 
would suspect things would happen rather quickly now because 
there's a lot of places that are open and we'll see. If it doesn't 
happen quickly, then it won't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to several players, Holmgren was emotional at his  
end-of-year meeting with the team Monday, leaving many wondering if 
he'd coached his last game for the Packers, who despite Reggie 
White's fabulous farewell season, struggled through an 11-6 year 
and fell from Super Bowl status. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of things we don't know, what the future is  
going to bring to this football team,'' receiver Antonio Freeman 
said. ``This is a family to us. From Reggie to Holmgren to the 
training staff, it's one big family. You hate to lose anybody, 
Coach, Reggie, whoever. It's real life, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said in an ideal world, Holmgren would stay put to help  
revive a team that underachieved in a season marked by injury and 
inconsistency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is real life, unfortunately. This isn't a soap opera,''  
Freeman said. ``The man has a family of his own to take care of. If 
a more prosperous situation presents itself, I'd take it. Sometimes 
opportunities come only once in a lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's Holmgren's quandary -- if he signs a long-term deal to  
stay in Green Bay, it won't contain an escape clause. 
</P>
<P>
	So, would he leave an ideal coaching situation in Green Bay for  
a less-than-appealing dual role elsewhere because he can't wait for 
something better? 
</P>
<P>
	Dorsey Levens said Holmgren didn't hint at what his future held.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was addressed briefly, but it's still left up in the air,''  
Levens said. ``Nobody really knows what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuberski, who would love to join tight end Mark Chmura and right  
tackle Earl Dotson as Packers who signed long-term deals rather 
than test free agency, said nobody would begrudge Holmgren if he 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody realizes that as players can come and go, so  
can coaches,'' Kuberski said. ``If Mike stays, that's great. 
Because he's done a lot for this team and this community and he 
would continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if Holmgren, who is 84-42 in seven seasons in Green Bay,  
goes, the Packers insist they won't return to their woeful ways of 
years past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron Wolf's here,'' Kuberski said with a  
you'd-better-believe-it stare. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf is the architect that put together the nucleus of Brett  
Favre, Robert Brooks, Freeman, Levens and Chmura on offense to 
complement LeRoy Butler on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The core is there,'' Freeman said. ``We just have to hold onto  
as many people as we can this year. I think keeping us all together 
will be critical this offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, many free agents will want to see who's coach in 1999  
before deciding what to do themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	White, who had 16 sacks in his 14th and final season, said the  
Packers will contend year in and year out, with or without 
Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I leave behind a team that has a Brett Favre that can  
do anything he wants to do,'' White said. ``He can lead it anywhere 
he wants it to go. He has Antonio Freeman, who I think before he 
leaves this game is going to be one of the best receivers in this 
league, if he isn't already. Dorsey. He's got a lot of guys that's 
going to come back on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, they're going to have to fill my spot and a few  
other spots on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They might need a new coach, too.

<HEADLINE> Breaks Keep Going Vikings' Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- It's starting to seem that nothing  
can go wrong for the Minnesota Vikings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when they were sitting at home last weekend enjoying their  
first-round playoff bye, the Vikings watched as their road to the 
Super Bowl opened like a stretch of deserted highway. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Arizona upset Dallas on Saturday, giving the Vikings the  
NFC's lowest-seeded team for their first game instead of San 
Francisco or Green Bay. Then, the 49ers stunned the Packers on 
Sunday, eliminating Minnesota's fiercest rival and the possibility 
of having to beat Green Bay a third time. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no question that the Vikings (15-1) are good, but  
they've also been lucky during a season in which nearly every break 
has gone their way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortuitous break? What we did is we went out and won 15 games  
and we got a bye,'' cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock said Monday. 
``Whatever happens on our bye week, we have no control over that. 
Whoever we're going to play next, we're going to have to play the 
best of those teams eventually anyway. We've just got a road that's 
different than others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easier, too. But that's usually the way it is for the team with  
the NFL's best record. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Cardinals (10-7) dominated the Cowboys on the road  
Saturday for their first postseason victory since 1947, they needed 
to win their last three regular-season games in the waning seconds 
just to get into the playoffs. Minnesota is favored by 14 1/2 points 
in Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they have one of the league's best young quarterbacks in  
Jake Plummer, a talented receiving tandem in Rob Moore and Frank 
Sanders, two dangerous backs in Adrian Murrell and Larry Centers 
and a defense that sacked Troy Aikman four times Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings say they figured they'd be playing the Cardnals,  
too. Cornerback Corey Fuller went so far as to call Cowboys 
cornerback Deion Sanders, a fellow Florida State product, to make 
that prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, I told Deion that Arizona was going to beat them,''  
Fuller said. ``I think they wanted it more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, you saw a spark in their eye,'' offensive tackle Todd  
Steussie said. ``Dallas didn't seem to have that. (But) like 
always, it's how we play and how we approach the game. I mean, if 
we play our kind of game I feel like we can beat any team. But if 
we come out flat it could be a long day for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings have given no indication over the last two months  
that they're going to come out flat, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their only loss at Tampa Bay on Nov. 1, Minnesota has  
trailed only twice -- during the first quarter at Baltimore on Dec. 
13 and at halftime at Tennessee on Dec. 26. They have won by an 
average of more than 17 points during their eight-game winning 
streak, including seven straight by at least 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	They did all that despite a steady string of injuries that, at  
one time or another, cost them the services of five starters on 
offense and two key backups -- quarterback Brad Johnson and 
offensive lineman Everett Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Vikings are almost completely healthy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as healthy as I've been in my career, period, at this  
point in the season,'' quarterback Randall Cunningham said, showing 
off a significant decrease in swelling on the back of his broken 
left hand. ``The hand's much better. I mean, even the purple came 
out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What passes for misfortune in Minnesota these days is the winter  
storm over the weekend that snarled air traffic in the Midwest. 
That kept a handful of players, including receiver Cris Carter and 
backup running back Leroy Hoard, from returning in time for Monday 
morning's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	As they have all season long, the Vikings seemed Monday to be  
focusing in on the task at hand -- Sunday's game against Arizona, 
and picking up exactly where they left off two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our mindset, I think we're going out there to destroy  
anybody in front of us,'' said receiver Randy Moss.

<HEADLINE> Death Row Inmate Stabbed to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARCHMAN, Miss. (AP) -- A fellow death row inmate on Monday  
fatally stabbed Donald Leroy Evans, who once confessed to dozens of 
murders and led police in several states on fruitless searches for 
victim's bodies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't mourn him. We simply close his file,'' said Harrison  
County District Attorney Cono Caranna, who prosecuted Evans in the 
1991 rape and strangulation of a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people you'd be able to say something good about them,''  
he said. ``Everything I saw in his life was pure self involvement 
and as close to evil as I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was ``incapable'' of remorse and delighted in leading  
federal authorities on the multistate search for victims, Caranna 
said. ``He was just running a scam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, sentenced to death for killing the girl, was attacked at  
the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman with a makeshift 
knife, known in prison parlance as a ``shank,'' while being led 
back to his cell after a shower, according to Corrections 
Department spokesman Ken Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was stabbed to death by Jimmie Mack, another death row  
inmate. Mack was being taken by corrections officers to the shower 
when the stabbing occurred,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, 41, generated media interest after his arrest in the  
girl's killing by declaring himself a serial killer and white 
supremacist, and by claiming to have information on slayings around 
the country. He later admitted he misled authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galveston, Texas, drifter was sentenced to death in 1993 in  
the strangulation death of Beatrice Louise Routh, who was abducted 
in Gulfport park, taken to Louisiana and killed, then returned to 
Mississippi, where her body was dumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously he had been convicted on a federal kidnapping charge  
and was sentenced to a life term. 
</P>
<P>
	He escaped from Harrison County jail in June 1993, but was  
recaptured about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1995, Evans pleaded guilty in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to  
the 1985 killing of Ira Jean Smith. He received a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections officials would not comment on whether there were  
any racial overtones in the slaying of Evans, who was white. Mack 
is black.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Long-Term Care Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed billions of  
dollars in new help for the long-term disabled and the family 
caregivers who support them, including a $1,000 tax credit for some 
2 million American families struggling to tend to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax credit, meant to compensate caregivers for such expenses  
as adult day care, respite care and reduced work hours, is part of 
a five-year, $6.2 billion package that the president and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled at a White House ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we announce a critical new initiative to give care to  
the caregivers,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Clinton plan becomes reality without Congress, which  
last year rejected the president's attempt at HMO reform through a 
``patient's bill of rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said the president's proposal is meant to help  
those who struggle to balance their own careers and child-rearing 
obligations with the burden of caring for a disabled or infirm 
parent or other relative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that there is not a substitute for families  
being able to care for their loved ones,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But 
we sometimes forget that caregivers also need care. They, too, 
carry enormous burdens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's four-part initiative also proposes that the government  
start offering federal workers and retirees private, long-term care 
insurance, in the hope that other employers would follow suit. 
Officials estimate that 300,000 government employees would 
participate in the model program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will ask Congress for $625 million in grants to state  
and local ``agencies on aging,'' which were created by the Older 
Americans Act of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be used to set up information and referral  
programs, and to provide direct services to the millions of 
children caring for elderly parents at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Services would include the same kinds meant to be compensated  
for by the proposed new tax credit: counseling and training for 
complex care needs, such as feeding tubes; adult day care for 
dependents of working caregivers; and respite care to fill in when 
a caregiver goes on vacation or just needs a break. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistance equally would be available to parents of disabled or  
chronically ill children, and any other person providing family 
care to a person -- of whatever age -- with three or more limitations 
in activities of daily living. 
</P>
<P>
	Another component of Clinton's plan would, at a cost of $10  
million, launch an outreach campaign to make sure all 39 million 
Medicare beneficiaries realize they are not covered for most 
long-term care; know what to look for in supplementary private 
insurance; and are aware they might be eligible for long-term care 
welfare benefits under Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and Means  
subcommittee on health, said today Clinton was taking credit for a 
Republican idea. He said the House, over the Clinton 
administration's objections, passed a similar provision in 1995 as 
part of the GOP's ``Contract with America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since President Clinton vetoed these Republican provisions in  
1995, I'm delighted he has changed his tune and is supporting them 
today,'' Thomas said. ``This GOP initiative the president has 
adopted can make a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore will tout the initiative in a series of  
forums around the nation. But the administration will need to 
persuade a Republican-controlled Congress, with its own ideas for 
tax cuts and health reform, to approve the long-term care programs 
as well as the money to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials insist the program could be created  
without touching a dime of the federal budget surplus, which 
Clinton has pledged to reserve for shoring up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year, $5.5 billion cost of the tax credit would be  
covered by closing ``corporate welfare'' loopholes in the existing 
tax code, a White House official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three prongs are meant to be worked into the fiscal  
2000 budget within existing discretionary spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	According to White House estimates, the $1,000 tax credit, which  
phases out at $110,000 for upper-income couples and at $75,000 for 
unmarried taxpayers, would be available to about 2 million 
Americans. The grant program would be expected to serve some 
250,000 families. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5 million Americans need long-term care due to chronic  
or serious illness, disability or simple old age. That population 
is growing as the baby-boom generation nears retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2030, the number of Americans age 85 and older -- nearly half  
of whom need assistance with daily activities -- will jump from 4 
million to 8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the formal announcement, Clinton's proposal was  
endorsed by the Alzheimer's Association, which said the plan 
``gives powerful recognition to the role that family caregivers 
play in providing long-term care in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family members provide at least 70 percent of the care to  
patients with Alzheimer's, a memory-robbing, fatal disease, said 
Stephen McConnell, the association's senior vice president.

<HEADLINE> Eight Candidates for 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Five African nations were among eight  
countries that applied to host the 2006 World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria and South Africa were the last two countries to sign up  
before a New Year's Eve deadline imposed by FIFA, soccer's world 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	The other hopefuls are Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, Brazil, England  
and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA will send the candidates its list of requirements for  
hosting the 32-nation tournament this month. They will have until 
the end of April to confirm they will submit their candidacy in 
full. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries have until the end of July to submit their full  
bid documents, and FIFA's 24-member executive committee will decide 
on a host in March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA president Sepp Blatter has repeatedly said the soccer  
authority has a responsibility to stage the tournament in Africa, 
which has never hosted the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco lost out to France for the 1998 finals.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite its high crime rate, South Africa is widely considered  
the front-runner. It hosted the 1995 rugby union World Cup, the 
1996 African Nations Cup and last year's track World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Becker, Rios Slam State of Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Boris Becker calls it ``sick.'' Marcelo Rios calls  
it ``boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men's tennis is coming under attack again -- this time on the eve  
of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker, the former three-time Wimbledon champion, called for the  
ATP Tour to stage less tournaments and force the top players to 
play each other more often. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be that Pete Sampras doesn't have to play against a  
top 10 player until August -- that points to a system that's 
literally sick,'' Becker told the Berlin daily, the Tagesspiegel. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, the No. 2-ranked player, said the game should be slowed  
and players allowed to display emotions on court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tennis has gotten boring -- unjustifiably so,'' the Chilean  
said in the German magazine, Der Spiegel. ``Especially the top 
players are constantly watched, constantly punished and therefore 
always more well-behaved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rios echoed the sentiments of former great John McEnroe. The  
American, known for his outbursts on court, has said the game lacks 
personalities because few players risk showing emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's true,'' Rios said. ``It's schizophrenic and the biggest  
problem of the tour is not that personalities are lacking, but 
showing emotions is forbidden. That's why the top players are so 
colorless and boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I throw a racket, I'm mad at myself,'' he said. ``I'm not  
trying to kill anybody. So why do I have to be penalized right 
away?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker has cut back on his playing schedule the past two seasons  
to concentrate on his business interests. 
</P>
<P>
	He attacked the heavy schedule of players that led to an exodus  
of top names withdrawing from the season-ending ATP Championships 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened at the end of last season can't be allowed to  
repeat itself,'' Becker said. ``That was damaging to tennis. All 
the withdrawals make it clear the ATP has to slim down. Less 
tournaments mean higher quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, one of the few return specialists in a sport dominated by  
hard servers, said the game needed to be slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would slow down the balls and the surfaces or brake racket  
development,'' he said. ``Spectators today see a good serve, 
sometimes a return and that's all. They can't enjoy tennis anymore 
because nothing happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ATP has announced plans to streamline the tournament  
schedule while reforming the current computer ranking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios said he favored plans of the ATP Player's Union to market  
the game by casting a three-sided rivalry with him as the bad boy, 
Pete Sampras as the nice guy and Australia's Pat Rafter as the 
favorite of female fans because of his good looks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's OK that way,'' he said. ``It's the truth: We're the best  
and we need this rivalry to make the game interesting again.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers Look for Coordinators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- It's becoming a familiar story: The Pittsburgh  
Steelers' season ends, and coach Bill Cowher begins looking for new 
coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher, who has gone through three defensive and three offensive  
coordinators since 1992, must hire a new assistant coach to run the 
offense following Ray Sherman's resignation and may need a 
defensive coordinator if Jim Haslett leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman quit last week as offensive coordinator after learning  
Cowher planned to fire him. Haslett already has interviewed for the 
Philadelphia Eagles' coaching vacancy and has interviews set with 
three other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher, who returned Monday from a five-day vacation, plans to  
interview former Pitt quarterback Matt Cavanaugh for the offensive 
coordinator's job later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavanaugh was the top candidate to become the University of  
Pittsburgh's coach two years ago, but, after deciding he preferred 
to stay in the NFL, he pulled himself out of the running hours 
before he was expected to be hired. Pitt later chose Walt Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavanaugh was a San Francisco 49ers assistant coach at the time  
but later was hired as the Chicago Bears' offensive coordinator. He 
lost his job last week when Bears coach Dave Wannstedt was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Steelers' 7-9 record this season and Cowher's  
reputation for being tough on his coaches, Cavanaugh said he is a 
big fan of Cowher's and called the Steelers one of the NFL's model 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under consideration for the offensive coordinator's  
position are Steelers tight end coach Mike Mularkey, who was 
interviewed last year before Sherman was hired; and former San 
Diego Chargers coach Kevin Gilbride. 
</P>
<P>
	Haslett, who spent two days in Philadelphia last week after  
former Eagles coach Ray Rhodes was fired, interviewed Monday with 
the Seattle Seahawks and will meet Wednesday with the Baltimore 
Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears also have permission from Steelers president Dan  
Rooney to talk to the 43-year-old Haslett, who is considered one of 
the NFL's top young head coaching prospects despite the Steelers' 
falloff this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Haslett is considered a frontrunner in Philadelphia partly  
because he and Eagles director of football operations Tom Modrak 
formerly worked together in Pittsburgh. The two share the same alma 
mater, Division II Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	If Haslett is hired elsewhere, Cowher already is drawing up a  
list of possible replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Cowher was hired to replace Chuck Noll in 1992, Ron  
Erhardt, Chan Gailey and Sherman have spent time as the offensive 
coordinator and Dom Capers, Dick LeBeau and Haslett have run the 
defense. Gailey now coaches the Dallas Cowboys, while Capers was 
fired last week after four seasons as the Carolina Panthers' coach. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter who replaces Sherman, Cowher doesn't expect an  
offensive slump that saw the Steelers scored only 21 touchdowns in 
16 games extend into next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're as far away as people may think we are.  
There's a fine line in this business ... some people call it the 
edge, and we probably walked on it for most of the season,'' Cowher 
said. ``Then all of a sudden we fell off it, we lost it and we 
couldn't get it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new coordinator likely will have a background in working  
with quarterbacks, since restoring Kordell Stewart's confidence and 
productivity will be one of the Steelers' chief priorities next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has it been a maturing year for him? Yes, but not just for  
him, but for all of us,'' Cowher said. ``We can very much become a 
stronger football team because of it.''

	By this afternoon, the Polar Lander was 188,000 miles from  
Earth. It had yet to lock onto stars, however, and was relying 
solely on the sun for orientation. Managers said it was a trivial 
problem that they hoped to overcome in the days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first spacecraft to land near the Martian South  
Pole when it parachutes down in December. By then, it will be late 
spring, a time when the sun never sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Landing near a pole of a planet where you might see some  
frozen ice, that's neat stuff,'' said Edward Weiler, head of NASA's 
space science division. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's three previous Mars landers plopped down in the  
equatorial desert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bunch of rocks, couple hills in the background,'' said Weiler.  
``Now we're landing near a pole. I mean, I don't know what we're 
going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as thrilling will be what the Polar Lander hears.  
</P>
<P>
	The lander is equipped with a tiny microphone, the kind used in  
hearing aids. It was provided by The Planetary Society at no cost 
to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists question whether sound will travel in the thin  
Martian atmosphere and, if it does, whether anything will be heard 
other than the movement of the Polar Lander's robot arm and its 
internal systems. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a possibility the sound of dust or sand blowing against  
the lander might be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think, I hope to be wrong, that we'll actually hear  
the wind blowing through the trees,'' said project manager John 
McNamee. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 objective of the Polar Lander is to find water, the  
same goal of its companion craft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, some 4 
million miles from Earth following its launch three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to follow the water if you're looking for life,''  
Weiler explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander -- 3 1/2 feet tall and 12 feet wide -- is due to  
touch down Dec. 3. Scientists have yet to pick the exact spot, but 
are aiming for a latitude of about 75 degrees south. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the cushioned Pathfinder, which bounced down amid  
boulders on July 4, 1997, the Polar Lander will come down on three 
legs the same way the two Viking landers did in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be ``as sexy as bouncing around on air bags,'' Weiler  
noted, but it should be safer and, what's more, will be 
photographed by an on-board camera. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander's best feature is a 6 1/2-foot robot arm with a  
scoop on the end to scrape beneath the Martian surface. The 
collected dirt will be heated, allowing any water that's present to 
vaporize and be detected by a laser. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also equipped with a pair of cantaloupe-size probes that  
will peel away minutes before touchdown and slam into the Martian 
surface at 400 mph to 500 mph, some 60 miles from the lander. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the lander, the twin probes will hunt for water but at a  
much greater depth: They could penetrate as deep as 3 feet. The 
question is whether they will survive the impact and radio back 
data. It's a high-risk experiment called Deep Space 2 that's part 
of NASA's New Millennium program to test new technologies for 
future missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment cost $29 million. That's on top of $327 million  
for the Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ongoing controversy over whether a Mars meteorite  
contains evidence of ancient life, the Polar Lander carries no 
life-detection instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The only real way to confirm life on Mars, Weiler said, is to  
fetch dirt and rocks. NASA plans to launch a soil-return mission in 
2005; the samples would reach Earth in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	``This mission, unless its microphone hears Elvis or a Martian  
walks by the camera, it's not going to find life on Mars,'' Weiler 
said. ``But it's part of a long-term program.''

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's newest spacecraft hurtled  
toward Mars today with a shovel to dig for ice and a microphone to 
pick up sounds from the planet's South Pole.

<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander soared into an overcast sky aboard a

<HEADLINE> Treasury Interest Rates Fall / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities fell in Monday's auction to the lowest level in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.50 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.380 percent, down from 4.520 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.420 percent, down from 4.525 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since Dec. 7, when the bills  
sold for 4.320 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest since 
Dec. 14, when the rate was 4.390. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.490 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,889.30, and 4.585 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,776.50. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 4.59 
percent last week from 4.63 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Storm Spreads Misery Across East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The misery created by the huge winter storm stretched into a  
third day today with frustrated air travelers still waiting for 
flights, highways slippery or clogged by snow and thousands of 
customers with no electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of school districts canceled classes today from Iowa to  
Ohio and in parts of New England. Purdue University in West 
Lafayette, Ind., canceled all classes today for the first time 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Police counted scores of accidents on ice-covered roads from  
Maine to South Carolina, and some Indiana roads were simply closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of desolate out there,'' said Jeff Schneider, a road  
commissioner for Hittle Township in central Illinois. ``I don't see 
anybody but me, and I'm wondering why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 49 deaths had been blamed on the huge snow and ice  
storm in the eastern half of the nation since Friday, many due to 
heart attacks brought on by shoveling snow. An additional seven 
deaths were reported in Ontario, where many towns were virtually 
shut down by 16 inches of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the snow belt, temperatures hit 29 below zero today in  
North Dakota and the wind chill at Morris, Minn., was 64 below. 
Three weekend deaths were blamed on the cold in Oklahoma and 
Nebraska. Even Georgia had lows in the teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Old Man Winter can just go away now and give us  
80-degree weather,'' said Karen Erickson, who found her car covered 
by a snowdrift in Fond du Lac, Wis. ``He made his point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, where 12 people died, 21.6 inches of snow fell at  
O'Hare International Airport from Friday through early Sunday, the 
biggest total for a single storm since 23 inches fell during a 
blizzard in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The blowing snow brought air travel to a near standstill  
Saturday as most major carriers canceled the bulk of their flights 
in and out of Midwest hubs. That made Sunday -- already expected to 
be one of the busiest travel days of the year -- frustrating for 
even the most patient travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines canceled 60 percent of its flights out of  
Chicago on Sunday, and American Airlines canceled at least half. By 
this morning, there were only a few cancellations at the airport, 
but there were still many stranded travelers trying to crowd on 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, Northwest Airlines' largest hub, the company managed  
only a handful of flights Sunday. So many travelers were left 
waiting that Northwest told people not already at the airport to 
stay home and try again later. 
</P>
<P>
	And today, Northwest said, none of its flights would land at  
Detroit before noon and continued cancellations and disruptions 
were expected throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of flights also were canceled Sunday at Toronto's  
Pearson International Airport, and Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
International said it could be Wednesday before the backlog is 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Some roads weren't much better. Sections of 14 Indiana highways  
were closed today, although an 81-mile stretch of Interstate 65 in 
northwestern Indiana was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Highways in parts of the East turned into skating rinks. Four  
people were killed and as many as 23 others injured Sunday in a 
16-vehicle accident on icy Interstate 81 in Virginia. Ice was also 
blamed for a 50-car pileup on New York's Grand Central Parkway and 
a 23-vehicle chain-reaction wreck on I-80 in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	And the snowfall wasn't over. An additional foot was forecast  
today in southwestern Michigan. And Buffalo, N.Y., got so much 
lake-effect snow fed by moisture from Lake Erie today that travel 
in the city was banned, and the airport and all public offices were 
closed. Snow fell at a rate of 1 to 2 inches an hour and wind 
gusting to 45 mph caused blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow turn to sleet and rain as the storm moved eastward.  
More than 2.4 inches of rain fell Sunday in New York City's Central 
Park, a record for the date. Bridgeport, Conn., had a record 2 
inches and Plymouth, Mass., picked up about 4.75 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 450,000 customers across the eastern half of the  
country lost power at some point during the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest hit was South Carolina, where almost a quarter of a  
million customers lost power and roughly 100,000 were still in the 
dark this morning. Duke Energy said it could be Tuesday before all 
power is restored.

<HEADLINE> Falcons, 49ers in Classic Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Raised in a home where Muhammad Ali and  
Sugar Ray Leonard were frequent guests, Jamal Anderson always 
assumed the Atlanta Falcons were destined for another game against 
the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, didn't Ali fight Joe Frazier three times? Didn't  
Leonard go three times against Robert Duran? 
</P>
<P>
	Great rivalries require a trilogy, so bring on San Francisco for  
the third time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Niners again,'' Anderson, the Falcons' All-Pro running  
back, said Monday. ``You knew it was going to happen like this. If 
it was meant to be, we knew we would have to go through San 
Francisco. We don't have a problem with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons got a chance to relax over weekend and await their  
opponent in Saturday's divisional playoff game at the Georgia Dome, 
the first postseason contest in Atlanta since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer didn't come until Sunday evening, when Terrell Owens  
grabbed a 25-yard touchdown pass with three seconds remaining, 
giving the 49ers an improbable 30-27 victory over the Green Bay 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of look at it like the great heavyweight fights,'' said  
Anderson, whose father has been head of security for many top 
athletes and entertainers. ``Muhammad had to fight these guys time 
and time again. It's the same thing for us. If we're meant to be 
champs, we've got to take the toughest route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers, who finished two games behind Atlanta (14-2) in the  
NFC West, handed the Falcons one of their losses. In the third game 
of the season, San Francisco built a 31-7 lead by halftime at 3Com 
Park and cruised to a 31-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In the rematch, with the teams tied for the NFC West lead, the  
Falcons responded with a 31-19 victory on their home field, 
snapping a five-game losing streak against the 49ers. Atlanta 
finished the regular season with a nine-game winning streak to 
claim only the second division title in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's destiny that we play the 49ers,'' defensive end Chuck  
Smith said. ``In the first game, they dominated. In the second 
game, we dominated. This is like a grudge match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach of the year Dan Reeves, still recovering from heart bypass  
surgery on Dec. 14, hasn't decided what his role will be for the 
playoff game. He missed Atlanta's final two games of the regular 
season, but has been helping out with game planning over the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves underwent a routine examination Monday morning and  
received a clean bill of health. He drove himself to the Falcons' 
suburban training complex -- he was using a driver last week -- and 
spent more than eight hours working with his assistants on the game 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a great day,'' Reeves said on his WGST radio show. ``My  
energy level is getting better and better. ... Hopefully, I will 
get a good night's rest and be ready to go (Tuesday). I have a 
chance to be on the sidelines Saturday. We'll just have to wait and 
how it goes during practice this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves might have to stay off the sidelines while taking blood  
thinner medication because of the risk of injury. But he is getting 
stronger, working out twice a day for 15 minutes on a treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing coach Reeves, I would speculate that he'll probably be  
in the (press box) booth somewhere,'' Anderson said. ``I don't 
think he'll be on the sideline because of the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Rich Brooks has been the acting head coach  
during Reeves' recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know exactly what Dan will be involved in this week,''  
Brooks said. ``Last week, he just told me to keep doing what I'm 
doing. I guess that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons didn't practice Monday, limiting their work to the  
weight room. A large group planned to attend Monday night's the 
World Championship Wrestling heavyweight title fight involving Bill 
Goldberg, who played with Atlanta from 1992-94. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a sign in the locker room telling the players to bring  
along their practice jerseys to the Georgia Dome, an indication 
they might be getting involved in the ``fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The jersey thing is just in case he needs our help,''  
offensive lineman Adam Schreiber said, grinning slyly. ``You never 
know what might happen.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 149 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were broadly higher at midday on the  
first day of trading in 1999 as investors, celebrating last year's 
gains, poured cash from yearend bonuses and other sources into the 
market . 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
149.33 at 9,330.76, only 43.51 points away from its record closing 
high at 9,374.27 last Nov. 23. The blue-chip index finished 1998 
with a gain of 16.1 percent -- the fourth straight year that it rose 
15 percent or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indexes, in which technology stocks are heavily  
represented, were higher as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bull market continues,'' said Charles H. Blood Jr., senior  
financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks continued last month's blockbuster performance  
after Merrill Lynch raised its forecasts for the prices of nine 
companies. Dow component IBM was up 1 3/8 at 185 3/4, while Dow component 
Hewlett-Packard was up 1 7/16 at 69 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online shares were down 3 3/8 at 151 3/4 in leading volume on  
the New York Stock Exchange. But traders said that was because of a 
last-minute surge to 160 on Thursday. The stock was added Friday 
bto the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors brushed off a new report showing a slowing economy.  
The National Association of Purchasing Management said 
manufacturing activity slowed in December for the seventh straight 
month, declining at a faster rate than economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM's monthly index of business activity fell to 45.1  
percent last month, down from 46.8 percent in November. Any reading 
under 50 percent is a sign of contraction in the industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 258 million shares, 
up sharply from Thursday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. financial markets were closed Friday for the New Year  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 16.81 at 1,246.04, and  
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 37.79 at 
2,230.48. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 6.04 at 601.85, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.39 at 689.38.

<P>
	MAYAGUEZ, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Free agent outfielder Wilfredo  
Cordero was charged with disturbing the peace Monday after an 
altercation with his wife's former husband in a hotel on New Year's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero got into a fight with Felix Perez Torres at the Holiday  
Inn early Friday, police said. He was released without bail and 
told to appear in court March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Torres, charged Monday with assault in connection with the  
fight, was once married to Cordero's wife, Ana Echevarria. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the victim and you can take note of it,'' Cordero,  
sporting a bruised upper lip, said to reporters at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, who was with the Chicago White Sox last season, is  
playing winter league ball with the Mayaguez Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Cordero pleaded guilty to beating and threatening his  
wife. He received a 90-day suspended sentence and ordered to attend 
counseling sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero's attorney, Evelyn Garcia, said she didn't believe  
Friday's altercation would affect Cordero's probation in the 1997 
case.

</P>
<P>
	``I was the victim and you can take note of it,'' Cordero,  
sporting a bruised upper lip, said to reporters at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, who was with the Chicago White Sox last season, is  
playing winter league ball with the Mayaguez Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Cordero pleaded guilty to beating and threatening his  
wife. He received a 90-day suspended sentence and ordered to attend 
counseling sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero's attorney, Evelyn Garcia, said she didn't believe  
Friday's altercation would affect Cordero's probation in the 1997 
case.

<HEADLINE> Holmes, Foreman Fight May Happen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The fight between old-timers George Foreman and  
Larry Holmes might still happen yet. 
</P>
<P>
	But promoter Roger Levitt says it will take place only if  
Foreman agrees to a different form of payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout between the aging former heavyweight champions is  
scheduled for Jan. 23 at the Houston Astrodome. But Foreman's camp 
contends the bout is off because the promoter has not met his 
financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The promoter had a deadline to meet and it was missed,''  
Foreman lawyer Steve Katleman told Houston TV station KRIV. ``An 
extension was granted to provide a letter of credit and we had 
every expectation it would be taken care of. It didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have told Roger Levitt there will be no further extensions.  
The fight is not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said Monday he has secured an insurance bond that will  
guarantee Foreman the remaining $9 million of his $10 million 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes is owed $3.6 million of his $4 million share, and Levitt  
said the fighter will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``If George Foreman wants to fight, then it will happen,'' said  
Russ Sauer, Holmes' lawyer. ``If Mr. Foreman agrees to proceed with 
the financial agreement in place, I don't see any problems working 
out an alternative arrangement for Larry in which he'll be 
guaranteed his money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman was expecting a letter of credit, which also guarantees  
the fighters to receive their entire purse. But two financial 
backers pulled out in recent weeks, putting the bout in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes doesn't appear too concerned by the roadblocks,  
especially since he has waited nearly five years to get Foreman in 
the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind giving him (Levitt) the benefit of the doubt,''  
Holmes said. ``Especially since he has spent a lot of money 
already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt has already given Foreman $1 million and Holmes $400,000  
-- both of which are nonrefundable. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight has been called The ``Battle of the Aged.'' Foreman  
will be 50 by the time of the bout and Holmes is 49. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we're concerned, the fight is still on and was never  
off,'' Levitt said. ``George has now got exactly what he needs. Now 
all he needs to do is get in the ring and fight. ``He has no moral 
or legal way out. We've met the demands of the contract with no 
exclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt is planning a Wednesday news conference in New York to  
present the insurance bond and clear up speculation surrounding the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes last fought in July 1997, when he won a decision over  
Maurice Harris. His career record is 66-6 with 42 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman's record is 76-5 with 68 knockouts, including a loss in  
his last fight to Shannon Briggs in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout will be carried on pay-per-view for $39.95.

<HEADLINE>  Honda Sees Modest Sales for Hybrid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. expects modest sales of its  
gasoline-electric hybrid car after it debuts nationwide in November 
or December, an executive said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Elliott, vice president of American Honda Motor Co., said  
the Japanese automaker expects U.S. sales to be less than 5,000. 
The car also will be sold in Japan and Europe at the same time. No 
price has been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda, which unveiled a prototype of the aerodynamic car at the  
North American International Auto Show's media preview, said it 
will be one of the most efficient gasoline-powered vehicles ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``V V'' uses a lightweight 1-liter, three-cylinder gasoline  
engine assisted by an electric motor and combined with a five-speed 
manual transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	The highly efficient powertrain, combined with the addition of  
lightweight plastic and aluminum body panels, allow the car to get 
an estimated 70 miles a gallon in combined city and highway 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway mileage is as high as 80 mpg, Honda says. That gives the  
subcompact two-seater a range of more than 700 miles a tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle also is cleaner than most conventional cars; it  
meets California's Ultra Low Emission Vehicle standard, Honda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. has been selling its hybrid car, the Prius,  
in Japan since 1997 and plans to begin selling it in the United 
States by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG also  
are working on hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, but don't plan to 
have them ready for sale before 2001.

<HEADLINE> Trucks of Future Look Like Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- It's getting tougher to tell cars from trucks at  
the North American International Auto Show. Manufacturers this year 
are debuting sport utility vehicles with pickup-truck beds while 
other vehicles are part car, part SUV, part van. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boundaries are becoming blurred,'' said J Mays, Ford Motor  
Co.'s design chief. ``It's all a redefinition of what we know as a 
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to carve out new niches in an SUV segment that has grown  
larger than most in the industry ever expected, automakers Monday 
pulled the wraps off what they hope will be the latest showroom 
hits: 
</P>
<P>
	--Nissan Motor Co.'s Xterra, touted by the Japanese automaker as  
a midsize SUV meant to attract active, young outdoor enthusiasts 
ready to use the vehicle's cargo bay for mountain bikes and its 
hatchback compartments for first aid kits or tools. Nissan expects 
the Xterra to go into production in March at its Smyrna, Tenn., 
plant and reach showrooms in May. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ford's Explorer Sport Trac, based on an Explorer chassis and  
mated to a bed adapted from the Ranger pickup truck. Ford's 
targeted consumers: Those considering SUVs, sports coupes or 
compact pickup trucks. Ford expects the Sport Trac to hit showrooms 
early next year but did not immediately specify the vehicle's 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford last week introduced the Lincoln Blackwood, another  
SUV-pickup hybrid, at the Los Angeles auto show. It mates a short, 
aluminum-lined pickup bed to the front end and cab of the company's 
high-profit Lincoln Navigator. A production version could reach 
showrooms within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a new segment,'' Mays said. ``I don't think it's  
a niche.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--BMW's X5, a luxury car-like SUV dubbed by the German automaker  
as a ``sport activity vehicle.'' It's BMW's first sport utility 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking further down the road, Mitsubishi unveiled its ``Mad  
Max,'' a futuristic, boxy concept machine the Japanese automaker 
describes as a ``super sports utility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Nissan will unveil what it calls the ``SUT,'' or  
sport utility truck. Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division will debut a 
crossover SUV hybrid off a Contour platform, and Hyundai will 
introduce a car-based SUV.

<HEADLINE> Two Guards Die in Calif. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMPTON, Calif. (AP) -- Two apartment complex security guards  
were fatally shot and two others were seriously wounded during an 
early morning firefight at their guard booth. 
</P>
<P>
	An assailant attacked early Sunday at the New Wilmington Arms, a  
low-income housing complex in this community about 20 miles south 
of downtown Los Angeles, said police Lt. Danny Sneed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate arrests. Police said the suspect was  
either a frequent visitor or resident of the complex who had 
possibly argued with guards the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the guards were able to return fire, said Terry Jones,  
spokeswoman for the guards' employer, Cleveland-based International 
Total Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodrico Paz, 62, and Remigio Malinao, 49, both of Los Angeles,  
were each fatally shot in the upper body, Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saul Connor Martinez, 59, of Los Angeles, was shot behind the  
ear. He was in serious but stable condition Sunday night at Martin 
Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said he would be brain dead if he survives, according to  
Martinez's son, Alfredo Connor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed of coming to a place and seeing my father like  
this,'' said Connor. ``I didn't even recognize him. Lying there for 
some miserable-paying job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth guard, Rodolso Bombarda, 52, of Carson, suffered  
wounds to his leg and abdomen. He was in fair condition Sunday 
night, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton has been plagued by gang- and drug-related violence. But  
residents of the New Wilmington Arms said they felt safe inside the 
block-long complex until the shootings. The group of two-story 
stucco apartments and trim lawns is home to about 600 people.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Boxer Jerry Quarry Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jerry Quarry fought Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson as a  
hard-punching heavyweight before too many shots to the head blurred 
his mind and twisted his memories, making him a confused, childlike 
man whose family had to dress and feed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry, 53, died Sunday in Templeton, Calif., after being taken  
off life support. He was hospitalized Dec. 28 with pneumonia and 
then suffered cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members directed doctors to remove life support after  
being told that Quarry would be bedridden and have to be fed 
through a tube, according to Claude Sutherland, a longtime family 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won the last fight of his life by going home to God,''  
Quarry's mother, Arwanda, said through Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry earned $2.1 million in purses as a top contender in the  
1960s and '70s, but later lost it all through drug and alcohol use 
and three marriages. By age 38, he had been diagnosed with early 
signs of dementia and lived on Social Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical name for his condition was dementia pugilistica,  
severe brain damage caused by repeated blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	A neuropsychologist who examined him five years ago said that  
boxing had aged Quarry 30 years and that he was at third-stage 
dementia, similar to Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But he couldn't resist the siren song of the ring.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Quarry fought for the last time. Believing he could  
make a comeback as George Foreman had, he took a bout in Colorado, 
a state where no boxing license was required. 
</P>
<P>
	But Quarry was battered for six rounds by a club fighter. He  
earned $1,050 for absorbing the beating. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was missing the accolades,'' Quarry's brother, James, said  
three years ago. ``In making those comebacks, Jerry would walk 
around saying, `I'm going to be a hero again.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his two fights with Ali, who suffers from  
Parkinson's disease, Quarry's career highlights also included two 
fights against Patterson, the former heavyweight champion who now 
has significant memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bouts against Patterson were in Quarry's hometown of Los  
Angeles. The first ended in a draw and he won the second on a 
controversial split decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one helluva fighter,'' said Johnny Ortiz, a former  
co-owner of Main Street Gym in downtown Los Angeles, where Quarry 
worked out. ``He was a big puncher, he had a terrific left hook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry, a 6-foot, 195-pound blond who bled easily when cut,  
earned his biggest payday, $338,000, by fighting Ali when Ali 
returned from his exile in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry was the hardest puncher there was,'' said Joey Orbillo,  
who lost to Quarry in 1966. ``He had a heart bigger than a 
Rottweiler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the Ali fight in Atlanta, the two butted heads and a  
gash opened above Quarry's left eye. Ali peppered the spot with 
jabs, spraying blood, and finished Quarry in three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry futilely pleaded with the referee not to stop it.  
</P>
<P>
	Ali cut Quarry again to win a rematch in seven rounds, and Joe  
Frazier bloodied him badly in the second of their two fights, 
winning in five rounds at Madison Square Garden in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had the misfortune of fighting in the Ali era. If he was  
fighting today, he would have been a champion,'' said Ortiz, who 
recalled that Quarry wrote poetry and enjoyed singing outside the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of sides to Jerry,'' Ortiz said. ``He lived  
for the moment, but he had a really good heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry turned to cocaine and alcohol as his boxing career faded,  
dulling his reflexes and leaving him virtually defenseless in the 
ring. He had a 53-9-4 pro record after fighting more than 200 bouts 
as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd do it all again, same way,'' he told The Associated Press  
in a 1995 interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurological tests revealed brain damage in 1983, before his  
short-term memory loss and motor skills deteriorated so noticeably 
and before his last three fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a lot of punishment. Big punchers take two or three  
shots to land one,'' Ortiz said. ``He should have retired, but he 
didn't. He was broke and he kept coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by three children; four sisters; three brothers,  
including Mike and Robert, who were fighters; and parents, Jack and 
Arwanda Quarry. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral was scheduled for Saturday in Shasta, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Gold Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar was lower against other major  
currencies in European trading today, the first day of trading for 
the euro. Gold was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro got off to a strong start in Europe as dealers followed  
the lead of Far Eastern markets overnight, driving the new 
currency's value up against both the pound and the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The new euro currency was quoted at $1.1815.  
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6595, up from $1.6590. Other  
dollar rates compared with late Thursday: 110.70 Japanese yen, down 
from 113.59; 1.3657 Swiss francs, down from 1.3813; 1.5263 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.5480. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use for cash 
transactions. Based on euro rates, the dollar is worth: 1.6554 
German marks, down from 1.6758; 5.5519 French francs, down from 
5.6243; 1.8652 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8902; 1,638.82 Italian 
lire, down from 1,660.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $286.80 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$287.50 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich the bid price was $287.50, unchanged from Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold rose 50 cents in Hong Kong to close at $288.75.

<HEADLINE> State of Union Address Still On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's invitation to deliver a  
State of the Union address on Jan. 19 stands, House Republican 
leaders decided Monday, despite a looming impeachment trial in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to see him on the 19th,'' said Pete Jeffries, a  
spokesman for Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., the incoming House 
speaker, after key lawmakers held a lengthy meeting that touched on 
several topics. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous senators of both political parties suggested in  
television intereviews Sunday that a State of the Union speech, 
delivered from the rostrum in the House before an audience of 
lawmakers, would be inappropriate given that the articles of 
impeachment are pending in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> In NFL, Meet the New Powerhouses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The teams that have won five of the last six Super Bowls are no  
longer the NFL's ruling class. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Bay Packers, Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers  
are not the elite anymore, even though San Francisco remains alive 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to think this is the same Cowboys as the old  
days and it's not,'' Troy Aikman said after Dallas was thumped by 
the Cardinals, whom they had beaten in 16 of their last 17 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not. We rely on different people now, and for a few of  
the people the door of opportunity is shut. We are looking through 
a different window now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no blame to be affixed, not in an era when the salary  
cap precludes teams from assembling a panoply of stars, such as the 
49ers of the '80s, the Steelers, Cowboys and Dolphins of the '70s 
and the Packers of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers have had a two-decade run, largely because Bill Walsh  
had the foresight to acquire Steve Young, who continued after 1990 
what Joe Montana started in the '80s. But they are $27 million over 
the salary cap and have no strong front-office leader -- Carmen 
Policy has gone to Cleveland, Eddie DeBartolo is in limbo because 
of legal problems and coach Steve Mariucci isn't sure he wants to 
sign a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	So the end is in sight. Young is 37, Jerry Rice is 36 and young  
stars such as Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes could get offers they 
can't refuse and that the 49ers can't match, as Dana Stubblefield 
did after last season. To beat the Packers, they even had to bring 
back Charles Haley, run out of town nearly a decade ago because of 
his quirky off-field behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The core of the Cowboys remains -- Aikman, Michael Irvin, Emmitt  
Smith and Deion Sanders. But all are on the downside of their 
careers and many of the role players so important in three Super 
Bowl triumphs have moved on to bigger bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers will lose Reggie White to retirement, could lose  
Antonio Freeman to free agency unless they make him the franchise 
player and may very well lose Mike Holmgren to another team -- 
perhaps even the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll remain competitive as long as Brett Favre is the  
quarterback -- his regression this year was due primarily to 
injuries in the supporting cast. And Ron Wolf has shown the ability 
to draft standouts even with relatively low picks, as he did this 
year with Vonnie Holliday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mike leaves, it doesn't change the way I play,'' Favre  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But at this point, Green Bay is only the second-best team in its  
division -- Minnesota is clearly on top. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Vikings have assumed the mantle of the NFC's  
dominant team -- it would be an upset if anyone else represents the 
conference in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta has come along wonderfully but still has to prove itself  
in the long run and could lose a couple of assistants, Rich Brooks 
and Art Shell, to head coaching jobs. That can hurt -- as was proved 
in Pittsburgh this season when Chan Gailey left for Dallas and the 
offense fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals think they may be the future -- and they may be,  
with Jake Plummer. But they have a history of misfortune and 
misjudgment and still need help on the offensive line and more 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs and Giants, surprises in 1997, started badly in 1998,  
but finished well, just missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have defenses as good as any in the league, particularly if  
Jason Sehorn of the Giants and Hardy Nickerson of the Bucs come 
back healthy next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But both have question marks at quarterback, making them likely  
playoff teams a rung below Super Bowl level. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone else?  
</P>
<P>
	Look to the AFC.  
</P>
<P>
	As the Jets showed in going from 1-15 to 12-4 under Bill  
Parcells in two seasons, the right coaching and the right 
organization can work miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone just has to clone Parcells.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HERE WE GO AGAIN:* Maybe instant replay should have come back  
for the playoffs: The first round proved that putting the so-called 
top officials in the postseason didn't end the bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The first one naturally went against Buffalo in a season in  
which the zebras have killed the Bills. Replays showed Andre Reed 
across the goal line late in the game in Miami, but he was ruled 
down on the 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, Reed was penalized 15 yards and ejected for jumping up  
and bumping an official and the Bills had to settle for a field 
goal. That was critical because it forced them to try for a 
touchdown after they recovered the onside kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst officiating in 20 years,'' is how Reed described  
this year's events, which included two consecutive bad calls that 
cost them a game in New England and, eventually, a home playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was Sunday's noncall, when the 49ers' Jerry Rice  
clearly lost a fumble during the winning touchdown drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to lose no matter how you do it,'' Green Bay  
general manager Ron Wolf said. ``But when you make a play in a 
championship game and it's not awarded to you, there's something 
wrong with the whole system. It's something that has to be 
addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people want to address it with replay.  
</P>
<P>
	There's another way.  
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs, the crews are ``all-stars'' -- the highest-rated  
officials at each position get playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	But most haven't worked with each other during the year and  
there is usually some miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
	So why not rate crews and let them work playoff games intact?  
</P>
<P>
	The league office said that's been considered but rejected  
because it would leave inexperienced officials -- often rookies -- 
working conference championships and Super Bowls. Officiating 
crews, like teams, are blends of experience and youth. 
</P>
<P>
	True, but rookies play in the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	Uncoordinated officiating was obvious this weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	In the Miami-Buffalo game, referee Mike Carey, who had a very  
smooth season, was working with new teammates and it showed -- 
things were choppy and sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
	So why not take the best crew?

<HEADLINE> Bears List 5 Coaching Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago Bears said Monday they have  
received permission to interview five NFL coordinators for the 
team's vacant heading coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	They five men are Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Jim Haslett,  
Kansas City defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham, Chiefs 
offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, Green Bay offensive coordinator 
Sherman Lewis and Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Pendry. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, former UCLA coach Terry Donahue will interview for  
the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Hatley, the team's personnel director who has been charged  
with dealing with the candidates, will be traveling the remainder 
of the week, conducting the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Bears coach Dave Wannstedt was fired last week after six years  
at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatley said will screen 16 or 17 candidates and submit three  
names to team president Mike McCaskey, who will have the final say. 
There is no timetable for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's going to be Jan. 10 or Feb. 1. We're  
going to go through the process till we find the right guy,'' 
Hatley said.

<HEADLINE> 500-Year-Old Manual Gets US Showing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A unique family manual for making love, war,  
sugar cookies and other imperatives of life is getting its first 
U.S. showing in Washington, illustrated with some of Germany's 
finest art from 500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The medieval version of a one-volume encyclopedia seems to have  
been put together for a castle in a mining area near the Rhine 
River not far from Heidelberg. Suggested as the craftsman of the 
detailed drawings and engravings is an artist named Erhard Reuwich. 
</P>
<P>
	But that is little more than a guess, based on a picture of a  
Turk that Reuwich did in the 1480s that looks a lot like one in the 
book. To be on the safe side, experts identify the artist only as 
``the Housebook Master.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a time when artists worked in guilds, not as  
individuals,'' explained Andrew Robison, in charge of prints at the 
National Gallery of Art. ``They were known by their work, not by 
their names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roughly bound book has been taken apart to make a facsimile  
edition of 750 copies, for sale at $1,980 each. One copy of this 
edition is on show, along with pages from the original and other 
engravings believed to be by the same artist. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gallery has put together an exhibit with examples  
of objects that the book depicts: a painted shield, half a suit of 
armor, an incense burner and a handy gadget called an aquamanile. 
Servants put it on the table for rinsing fingers, at a time when 
most Europeans ate with their hands and forks were a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some artists of the time, the Housebook Master combined a  
whimsical sense of humor with a feeling for personality. In a 
picture of the Holy Family, Joseph hides behind a grassy bench and 
rolls apples around the front of it to amuse the infant Jesus. The 
artist also spent hours on an intricately detailed engraving of a 
dog scratching itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog picture makes a bit of a mystery because it is done in  
dry-point, a technique that allows only a few good copies to be 
made, unlike a normal etching that can produce hundreds of prints 
fit for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafted diagrams show ladders and other devices for scaling a  
castle wall. While clearly designed for the agile infantryman, it 
seems to be what today would be called ``dual use'' equipment, 
because a tower window in the wall frames not a soldier but a 
comely young woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pages include cooking recipes, a process for separating  
silver from copper ore, the mixing of a laxative and a liquid to 
remove stains from clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the book is built around astrology.  
</P>
<P>
	A page devoted to the planet Venus shows the Greek goddess  
namesake on a horse coursing through the heavens. Underneath, a 
young man sits in a bath and a young woman is about to step in, 
wearing little but a seductive smile. On the opposite page a verse 
concludes: 
</P>
<P>
	``Beautiful bodies, parched by love's heat,  
</P>
<P>
	``My children find love's duties sweet.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Love and War: A Manual for Life in the Late Middle Ages'' will  
be at the National Gallery of Art until Jan. 31 and at the Frick 
Collection in New York City from May 9 to July 25.

<HEADLINE> Embattled Mountain Gorillas Survive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Kenneth Cameron got the emergency call after  
only a few months in Rwanda. A young female mountain gorilla had a 
snare around her ankle and was in danger of losing a foot, maybe 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
	What he didn't know when he headed for the Congo forest was that  
she had a protector -- a 400-pound male gorilla who dealt with the 
human interloper by sitting on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came walking over, turned and sat on one leg, reached over  
my head and grabbed some leaves and ate for several minutes while 
he had me pinned,'' Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron, an associate veterinarian at the Cincinnati Zoo, is in  
the midst of a two-year stint with the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary 
Project, which tries to monitor the health of the rare animals. 
Mike Cranfield, head veterinarian of the Baltimore Zoo, is the 
project's director. 
</P>
<P>
	The gorilla project was established by the Denver-based Morris  
Animal Foundation in 1985, the year gorilla expert Dian Fossey was 
killed at her camp in Parc National des Volcans in Rwanda, where 
she studied the animals for 18 years and waged a personal war to 
protect them from poachers. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly a decade, scientists have been stymied in their  
efforts to help mountain gorillas because of ethnic fighting near 
their home -- a densely-forested volcanic mountain range at the 
borders of Rwanda, Uganda and the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Parc National des Volcans, where the gorillas live at elevations  
between 9,000 and 13,000 feet, has become so dangerous that Cameron 
has been unable to visit the project's veterinary center in the 
park in Kinigi since his arrival in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossey's camp, Karisoke, has been stripped of lumber and metal  
sheeting. Several times the project's center has been looted and 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The military recently provided an escort for trackers with the  
Atlanta-based Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, another research group that 
collaborates with the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project, to count 
Fossey's gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Trackers found 63 gorillas in September representing two of  
Fossey's original three groups. The following month they located 
the third group of 16, a bit smaller than when last counted in the 
1980s. Two infants were among the groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is surprising with the turmoil that the gorillas are still  
around and appear to be doing all right,'' said Dieter Steklis, the 
gorilla fund's chief scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranfield, who returned from a two-week visit in early December,  
said he's hopeful the veterinary center can be re-opened in the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rwanda is much more settled and we were able to make it to the  
edge of the park,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of mountain gorillas left is in dispute. None live in  
captivity. About 300 are believed to live in parks in Rwanda, Congo 
and Uganda. A second population of smaller gorillas with broader 
faces in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda could 
double that number depending upon whether they are mountain 
gorillas or a subspecies. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic testing indicates that the two gorilla groups are  
genetically the same, but scientists want more testing to determine 
whether the Bwindi gorillas, which live at lower altitudes, are 
truly mountain gorillas. The two groups are divided by a large 
swath of farmland in a broad valley in the volcanic mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Cameron would expect to provide emergency veterinary  
care for at least two or three injured gorillas a year. But the 
call in October 1997 was a rare opportunity, in large part because 
rebel fighting prevents trackers and park guards from entering the 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating,'' he said. ``We're just not getting the  
calls. No one is there to see and report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel fighters aren't the only ones giving Cameron trouble.  
Sometimes it's the gorillas. After traveling for five hours, he 
found the young female gorilla and a silverback -- the name given to 
dominant males for the grey hairs down their backs. Trackers formed 
a defensive line so Cameron and his assistant could begin their 
work, or so they thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``He unfortunately moved through that defensive line and was  
looking for someone to take out his anger on. Unfortunately it was 
me,'' Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the male gorilla sat on him, Cameron made guttural noises to  
calm him. After about five minutes, the silverback let him crawl 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron found the young female in thick underbrush. He clipped  
dead skin from where the snare had amputated the end of her toe, 
took blood, urine and stool samples, and gave her an antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished just as the silverback broke through the underbrush,  
10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came right down to the wire,'' Cameron said.  
</P>
<P>
	If not for rebel fighting, Cameron said he probably could have  
saved a young male gorilla in Bwindi. The youngster was 
malnourished and weakened by parasites and couldn't keep up when 
his group fled, probably after encountering another gorilla group. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron had to delay his departure for about 12 hours because it  
is not safe to travel at night. The gorilla died several hours 
before Cameron reached him. 
</P>
<P>
	Things went better during Cranfield's visit when the team was  
called to help a young male gorilla in Uganda with a snare on its 
right hand. The group found the injured gorilla in dense bamboo 
among a group of eight gorillas, which included two silverbacks who 
twice charged the intruders. 
</P>
<P>
	The young gorilla was darted and the team got to work, cleaning  
the wound and administering an antibiotic. Even so, the gorilla 
will probably lose two fingers, Cranfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their research, the project team of Cameron, his  
assistant, and two local veterinarians, is gathering data on the 
gorillas' vulnerability to human diseases. Since mountain gorillas 
and humans share about 97 percent of the same DNA, they get the 
same diseases, including polio and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists want to know what diseases the gorillas are being  
exposed to and whether they are developing resistance. The 
information will be used to develop a new protocol for tourist 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Several mountain gorillas died in 1988 and 1990 of respiratory  
problems caused by human measles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like a nasty flu virus can go through that  
population and ravage it,'' Steklis said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cameron returned to Rwanda in late October, he took back a  
portable blood chemical analyzer that will allow veterinarians to 
test for kidney and liver problems, anemia and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, about 100 hair, tissue, blood and feces samples have  
been sent to the University of California-Davis to be analyzed for 
parasites, bacteria, viruses and other infections, as well as clues 
to nutrition and genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	The project also hopes to educate the locals about alternative  
sources of protein besides bush meat, such as cane rats, goats and 
rabbits, that won't require hunting with snares in the parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranfield said being able to help the young gorilla was one of  
the greatest thrills of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are magnificent animals and there are very few of them  
left.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Social Security Employees Stabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ala. (AP) -- An irate man stabbed two Social Security  
workers in their office Monday during a dispute over his missing 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Edward McGee, 31, became angry when told his Social  
Security check had not arrived because the office thought he was in 
jail, witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they would get it all straightened out,'' said  
Daniel Suits, who was in the office at the time. ``He told them 
they were all crazy. He got up and that's when he stabbed the first 
lady. We all ran out the back door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said McGee used a butcher knife pulled from his pants to  
stab Gayle Bowman in the throat. He then stabbed office manager 
William Moore in the forehead and hand, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGee surrendered in the building lobby and was held on two  
counts of assault, Decatur police Lt. John Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bowman underwent surgery and was listed in good condition;  
Moore was released following treatment.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Sets Up Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King has gone online with an  
official World Wide Web site to counter thousands of ``unofficial'' 
sites that sometimes propagate misinformation about him. 
</P>
<P>
	The site (www.stephenking.com) was receiving ``hits'' even  
before its official debut in the middle of last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The two staffers in the horror writer's Bangor office who answer  
about 400 letters a week knew they had to do something after they 
started getting letters containing the phrase ``I saw on your Web 
site...'' 
</P>
<P>
	People were sending books for King to sign, manuscripts for him  
to review and questions for him to answer personally all because 
they'd read on the Internet that he did those things. 
</P>
<P>
	King agreed to his own online presence so fans will be assured  
of getting facts, not rumors, said Marsha DeFilippo, his assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	And some of the rumors are pretty crazy, said William Thornton,  
production director for I-Forge Design Factory, a Web design and 
corporate image-shaping business in Winslow, which developed King's 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a rumor floating around that he's retired,'' said  
Thornton. ``Some of them will say that on Halloween he gives tours 
of his house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of online pages contain pictures, data, music,  
games, puzzles, drawings and writings about King. Hundreds of 
pages, created in countries around the world, are devoted strictly 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sites have names like The Stephen King House O'Love, Hungarian  
Stephen King Headquarters and Wilkomman auf Meiner King Page. 
</P>
<P>
	There are Web pages devoted to the beer King's characters drink;  
people named Stephen King; and what makes the real King tick. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone in Greece publishes a monthly electronic magazine,  
dubbed Insomnia, devoted to King. There are several e-mail lists, 
newsgroups and real-time chat channels focused on King. 
</P>
<P>
	Even his own name has not always been his. The Web address  
``stephenking.com'' was registered by the Book of the Month Club 
until King managed to get it back from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	King himself is not a wired guy. He doesn't spend his free time  
surfing the Web or hanging out in Internet chat rooms. He has never 
published an e-mail address for himself or his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been avoiding it for years, which is why I think we  
haven't had (a site) sooner,'' DeFilippo said.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Closes Just 2.84 Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks erased substantial early gains  
to close Monday's session slightly higher as investors, nervous 
that the economy could not continue to grow at its current pace, 
sold their holdings to book profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology stocks carried their strong run into the  
new year, pushing the Nasdaq composite to its fourth record in five 
trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 16.1 percent last  
year, closed the first trading session of this year up 2.84 at 
9,184.27. The Dow was up as much as 168.64 at 9,350.07 during the 
late morning, threatening to challenge the record closing high at 
9,374.27 last Nov. 23. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily 
weighted in technology stocks, rose 15.35 to 2,208.04. 
</P>
<P>
	But other broad stock indexes fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 4.39 to 1,224.84, the NYSE composite index fell 1.69 to 594.12 
, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 5.38 to 
683.61. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies eased 0.70 to 
421.26. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at a revised 1.07 
billion shares as of 4 p.m., up from Thursday's session. The stock 
market was closed last Friday in observance of the New Year 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers descended at the opening bell in the hope of profiting  
from investors putting yearend bonuses and cash reserves to work in 
the new year. But they retreated in early afternoon following a 
speech by Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Jack Guynn. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the Atlanta Rotary Club, Guynn warned that the  
``institutionalization of unrealistic expectations'' could have a 
negative impact on the U.S. economy. He said the economy's recent 
performance is exceptional, and that ``consumers, businesses, 
investors and policy-makers should not proceed as though'' it could 
keep growing at its current pace. ``Such a delusion could have real 
repercussions for the U.S. economy,'' Guynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum,  
said investors were also worried that Brazil's new government, 
which met for the first time today, will fall short of the 
ambitious economic goals it agreed to in order to receive a $41.5 
billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund and other 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Brazilian government fails to meet the goals, ``that  
immediately brings to mind the specter of the devaluation of the 
Brazilian (currency), which is extremely negative for the 
markets,'' Hyman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip computer stocks were mixed, with Dow components IBM  
losing 1 3/8 to 183, but Hewlett-Packard finishing up 5/8 at 68 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Nasdaq trading, computer stocks were very strong.  
Microsoft Corp. rose 2 3/16 to 140 7/8 in leading Nasdaq volume. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online shares fell 6 1/8 to 149 on big volume on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the stock was correcting for a last minute surge  
Thursday before the stock was added to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation stocks were lower as oil prices gained. The Dow  
Jones transportation index lost 31.66, or 1.01 percent, to 
3,117.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors brushed off a new report showing a slowing economy.  
The National Association of Purchasing Management said 
manufacturing activity slowed in December for the seventh straight 
month, declining at a faster rate than economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM's monthly index of business activity fell to 45.1  
percent last month, down from 46.8 percent in November. Any reading 
under 50 percent is a sign of contraction in the industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, London's FTSE-100 index fell 0.05  
percent, the CAC index in Paris gained 5.20 percent, the DAX in 
Frankfurt rose 5 percent, but the Nikkei index in Tokyo declined 
3.38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Face Battle Against Broncs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- There are all kinds of reasons to give the Miami  
Dolphins no chance in Saturday's playoff game at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins haven't won a postseason game on the road in 25  
years, and are 3-5 in away games this season. They must contend 
with a hostile crowd, high altitude, cold weather and an opponent 
that is well-rested and playoff-tested. They must hope that an 
injury-depleted front four can contain Terrell Davis and harass 
John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	At least the Dolphins won't be overconfident.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to start feeling good about ourselves,''  
All-Pro linebacker Zach Thomas pledged. ``We know that when we're 
playing well, we can beat anybody. We also know that when we're 
not, anybody can beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins' two most recent victories have been their biggest  
in Jimmy Johnson's three years as coach. They beat Denver 31-21 on 
Dec. 21 and Buffalo 24-17 Saturday for their first playoff victory 
in four years. In between came a 38-16 loss at Atlanta that has 
kept Miami's egos in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that after we beat Denver, we went to Atlanta and  
choked,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was 4 months old the last time Miami won a postseason  
road game. The date was Jan. 13, 1974, and the game was the Super 
Bowl. Since then the Dolphins are 0-8 on the road in postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	They're not too good away from home this season, either. In  
1998, the Dolphins outscored opponents 164-82 at home but were 
outscored 183-157 in away games. None of the three teams Miami beat 
on the road had a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all along this is a better team than last year,''  
Johnson said. ``We've gone further in the playoffs than we did last 
year. Now we need to show we can win on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, however, are 8-0 at home this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously playing in Mile High Stadium is going to be a lot  
different than what we faced at Pro Player Stadium,'' Johnson 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's victory over Denver in December is a bit misleading. The  
Broncos took little motivation into the game because they had 
already clinched homefield advantage through the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see a different team than we saw two weeks ago,'' Miami  
defensive end Trace Armstrong said. ``We'll see the defending world 
champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins were a healthier team the last time they faced  
Denver. Defensive tackle Tim Bowens (arm) and end Jason Taylor 
(collarbone) will miss the rest of the postseason with injuries, 
and the availability of receiver O.J. McDuffie (foot) and tight end 
Troy Drayton (ankle) is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team is physically more banged up than at any time in the  
season,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	With a playoff win and a 10-6 regular-season record, the  
Dolphins' best since 1994, they can already hail this season as a 
success. Few picked the Dolphins to reach the Super Bowl, and 
they're 12-point underdogs Saturday, so Miami goes into the game 
with little to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not satisfied,'' cornerback Sam Madison said. ``We  
haven't completed our goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 1999,'' cornerback Terrell Buckley added. ``Our New  
Year's resolution was to go to the Super Bowl.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rooting for Volunteers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his beloved Arkansas Razorbacks out of  
the running, President Clinton was rooting for the Tennessee 
Volunteers to win college football's championship Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton settled in at the White House with friends to watch the  
Fiesta Bowl matchup of Tennessee and Florida State. Vice President 
Al Gore, a native Tennessean, and his wife, Tipper, were attending 
the game in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect him to gather together with some friends to watch the  
crowning of Tennessee as the national football champions,'' White 
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. The semi-serious 
prediction of a Tennessee victory, Lockhart said, was a matter of 
``covering my bases on the Gore front.'' The spokesman said that 
while Clinton also is a Florida State fan, ``his loyalty to the 
Gores will win out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas lost its Citrus Bowl game to Michigan on New Year's  
Day.

<HEADLINE> Travelers Stuck in Storm Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Frustration grew to tears Monday as travelers waited for  
airlines and airports to recover from the crippling weekend 
snowstorm in the Midwest, and a new onslaught of snow shut down the 
snow-smart city of Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	School was out for hundreds of districts from Iowa to New  
Hampshire because of slippery roads and sidewalks, and Purdue 
University in Indiana shut down operations for the first time since 
1984, although classes were on winter break. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 57 deaths were blamed on the storm from Nebraska across  
the Midwest into Canada and New England, and cold air that rolled 
southward behind the storm was blamed for two deaths in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the storm piled near-record amounts of snow on  
the Midwest, shutting down railroads, highways and towns and 
airline flights, tempers frayed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport as 
Northwest Airlines skipped all morning flights because of the ice 
and drifting snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a series of: You go to a gate, you wait in line for  
an hour, you get on standby for a flight, you wait an hour for the 
flight, then get delayed,'' groused Roger von Doenhoss, who had 
been waiting since Saturday for a flight home to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they told us the plane was frozen. So then, the crew  
becomes illegal (over legal duty hours) because it takes too long 
to take off and the flight gets canceled, so you start all over 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Brown of Ann Arbor, Mich., had been trying for two days  
to get his grandson on a flight home to Florida, and spent part of 
the time watching people. 
</P>
<P>
	``One lady had been here two days and couldn't understand why  
she couldn't be first in line for the next departure,'' Brown said. 
``She broke into tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed up and walked around this stupid airport all  
night,'' said Asuka Hirayma, 16, trying to continue her trip from 
Osaka, Japan, to Boston. ``There was nothing to do. It's so boring. 
I hate this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of flights also had been canceled at Toronto's Pearson  
International Airport, and Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
International said it could be Wednesday before the backlog was 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were nearly back to normal Monday at Chicago's O'Hare  
International Airport, where nearly two feet of snow fell. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were long lines as Monday morning business  
travelers mixed with people waiting since their weekend flights 
were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	As far away as Denver, about 800 passengers were waiting for  
connections Monday, said Tom Renville of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The drifting, blowing snow also snarled travel on the ground.  
Sections of four Indiana highways were closed Monday afternoon, 
down from 14 in the morning, but an 81-mile stretch of Interstate 
65 in northwestern Indiana was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 highway refugees forced off I-65 had spent part of  
the weekend at Faith Baptist Church in Lafayette, Ind., many 
sleeping head-to-toe on pews and floors, and they rushed for the 
doors Monday when the highway reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	``The church people and the Red Cross did an awful lot of work.  
They had everything you could want,'' said Kathy Colvin of LaPorte, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana legislative leaders postponed the beginning of their  
1999 session from Tuesday until at least Wednesday because of the 
travel problems. 
</P>
<P>
	While the storm itself was gone, the wind and cold air it left  
behind brought a threat of more snow around parts of the Great 
Lakes, including a foot forecast in western Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo, N.Y., got so much lake-effect snow fed by moisture from  
Lake Erie that nonessential travel in the city was banned Monday, 
and the airport and all public offices were closed. Snow fell at a 
rate of up to 2 inches an hour and wind gusting to 45 mph caused 
blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing is to have thousands of cars on the road,''  
said Mayor Anthony Masiello. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is outrageous. This is just crazy!'' said Rena Crocker as  
she walked along a snow-blanketed Buffalo street with her 
7-year-old son, Julian, who was bundled up all the way to his eyes 
and snow-covered lashes. Low on groceries, the two were headed to a 
friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had such a beautiful winter so far,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Buffalo averages 93.2 inches of snow each winter, it  
didn't start this season until 7.1 inches fell on Christmas Day.

	Storm Still Hindering Travel  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frustrated travelers waited for airlines and  
airports to recover from the winter storm that ravaged the Midwest 
this weekend and left at least 57 dead. Two days after the storm 
piled near-record amounts of snow across the region, numerous 
railroads, highways and airports are still being affected. Hundreds 
of school districts from Iowa to New Hampshire also remain closed 
because of slippery roads and sidewalks.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to allow more contact  
between Americans and Cubans and to substantially increase the 
number of Americans eligible to send money to needy Cubans, 
according to a senior official. Clinton also plans to approve the 
opening of direct mail service to the island and an expansion of 
both direct charter flights to Cuba and the sale of food to 
entities independent of the government. An official announcement is 
expected tomorrow.

	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- After a two-month honeymoon as an  
unlikely political star, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura 
today took the oath of office as Minnesota's 37th governor. In his 
11-minute inaugural speech, Ventura sought to reassure Minnesotans 
that they didn't make a mistake in electing a bald, boisterous 
radio host, former Navy SEAL and actor known as ``The Body.'' ``Now 
we move forward to do Minnesota's business and we will do it to the

Missouri, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, former Tennessee Gov. 
Lamar Alexander, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. are all actively 
exploring bids for the White House in 2000. ``This confirms there 
will be a wide-open race for the Republican nomination,'' said 
Brian Kennedy, an aide to Alexander.

days, newly sworn-in members of the House will vote on authorizing 
key lawmakers to present evidence against President Clinton in a 
Senate impeachment trial, officials said today. The House approved 
two articles of impeachment on Dec. 19. The requirement for a 
repeat vote in the new Congress means newly elected lawmakers will 
vote on the momentous issue on their first day in office.

	New HIV Research Gives Hope

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time, researchers have suppressed  
HIV in infected patients by giving them injections of cells made 
from their own immune systems. The new research, which will be 
published tomorrow in Nature Medicine, reveals that after using the 
latest drugs, many patients show little sign of HIV infection in 
their blood but carry lingering traces of the AIDS virus in lymph 
nodes and other hard-to-reach places.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Iron Eyes Cody, the ``Crying Indian'' whose  
tearful face in 1970s television commercials became a powerful 
symbol of the anti-littering campaign, died today. Cody, whose 
acting credits date back to silent movies, was best known for the 
ads from the group Keep America Beautiful that showed him shedding 
a single tear as he watched people litter. He was in his 80s or 
early 90s and died of natural causes in his Los Angeles home, 
police said.

2.84 at 9,184.27. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange

recommended that the rest of the season be canceled. The 
announcement came just a few hours after union director Billy 
Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing delivered the proposal. 
Thursday is the deadline for reaching a new labor agreement, and 
chances are slim that a deal can be reached in time to hold a 45- 
to 50-game season.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Closes Just 2.84 Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks erased substantial early gains  
to close Monday's session slightly higher as investors, nervous 
that the economy could not continue to grow at its current pace, 
sold their holdings to book profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology stocks carried their strong run into the  
new year, pushing the Nasdaq composite to its fourth record in five 
trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 16.1 percent last  
year, closed the first trading session of this year up 2.84 at 
9,184.27. The Dow was up as much as 168.64 at 9,350.07 during the 
late morning, threatening to challenge the record closing high at 
9,374.27 last Nov. 23. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily 
weighted in technology stocks, rose 15.35 to 2,208.04. 
</P>
<P>
	But other broad stock indexes fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 4.39 to 1,224.84, the NYSE composite index fell 1.69 to 594.12 
, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 5.38 to 
683.61. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies eased 0.70 to 
421.26. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at a revised 1.07 
billion shares as of 4 p.m., up from Thursday's session. The stock 
market was closed last Friday in observance of the New Year 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers descended at the opening bell in the hope of profiting  
from investors putting yearend bonuses and cash reserves to work in 
the new year. But they retreated in early afternoon following a 
speech by Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Jack Guynn. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the Atlanta Rotary Club, Guynn warned that the  
``institutionalization of unrealistic expectations'' could have a 
negative impact on the U.S. economy. He said the economy's recent 
performance is exceptional, and that ``consumers, businesses, 
investors and policy-makers should not proceed as though'' it could 
keep growing at its current pace. ``Such a delusion could have real 
repercussions for the U.S. economy,'' Guynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum,  
said investors were also worried that Brazil's new government, 
which met for the first time today, will fall short of the 
ambitious economic goals it agreed to in order to receive a $41.5 
billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund and other 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Brazilian government fails to meet the goals, ``that  
immediately brings to mind the specter of the devaluation of the 
Brazilian (currency), which is extremely negative for the 
markets,'' Hyman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip computer stocks were mixed, with Dow components IBM  
losing 1 3/8 to 183, but Hewlett-Packard finishing up 5/8 at 68 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Nasdaq trading, computer stocks were very strong.  
Microsoft Corp. rose 2 3/16 to 140 7/8 in leading Nasdaq volume. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online shares fell 6 1/8 to 149 on big volume on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the stock was correcting for a last minute surge  
Thursday before the stock was added to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation stocks were lower as oil prices gained. The Dow  
Jones transportation index lost 31.66, or 1.01 percent, to 
3,117.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors brushed off a new report showing a slowing economy.  
The National Association of Purchasing Management said 
manufacturing activity slowed in December for the seventh straight 
month, declining at a faster rate than economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM's monthly index of business activity fell to 45.1  
percent last month, down from 46.8 percent in November. Any reading 
under 50 percent is a sign of contraction in the industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, London's FTSE-100 index fell 0.05  
percent, the CAC index in Paris gained 5.20 percent, the DAX in 
Frankfurt rose 5 percent, but the Nikkei index in Tokyo declined 
3.38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Strong Debut for European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe's new currency, the euro, made  
a strong debut today, trading at a high of $1.1877 in a sign that 
markets welcomed the single currency as an alternative to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for the euro pushed it up from a designated starting  
point of $1.1668 in earlier Asian trading, and it kept on rising as 
trading moved to Europe, before dipping slightly to $1.1807. 
</P>
<P>
	Political and banking officials in Europe were heartened by the  
smooth entry on international markets of the currency shared by 11 
European Union nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said  
trading represented ``the best possible omen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro has been greeted well,'' he said. ``This isn't just  
an absurd craze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use for cash 
transactions. Based on euro rates, the dollar is worth 1.6598 
German marks, down from 1.6758; 5.5669 French francs, down from 
5.6243, and 1,643.27 Italian lire, down from 1,660.20. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted today at $1.6575, down from $1.6590  
late Thursday. Britain is not taking part in the euro initially. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said the euro offered  
``friendly'' competition for established currencies and would 
strengthen Europe's profile in international financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn focused on the  
unity created by the euro, saying it would help boost growth and 
cut unemployment in Europe. ``When everybody pushes in the same 
direction, everybody goes quicker,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Notwithstanding the positive market and political reactions,  
euro skeptics made their mark, throwing two pies at Dutch Finance 
Minister Gerrit Zalm as he arrived at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro trading opened today in Sydney, Australia, and proceeded  
smoothly, if quietly, throughout Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was officially launched Jan. 1, when authorities fixed  
conversion rates against the 11 participating European currencies. 
While the euro will not be in consumers' pockets until 2002, it now 
can be used for non-cash, credit card or traveler's check 
purchases. Many major firms are converting their transactions to 
euros, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, trading was limited today as many investors awaited  
developments in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen a lot of inquiries coming in regard to the euro,  
but not a tremendous amount of activity,'' said Peter Chen, 
director of sales for Southeast Asia and North Asia at Deutsche 
Bank in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise in Europe, bankers and traders said they were still  
testing the euro's strength. ``So far it seems market participants 
are trying to get a feel of the proper level,'' said Antti Heinonen 
of Finland's Okobank. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the early caution, the euro's start was stronger than  
many traders had anticipated, and London analyst Cameron Crise said 
he wouldn't be surprised to see the new European currency reach 
$1.20 this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest was expected to remain strong given the European  
Union's economic muscle, which rivals that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the No. 1 candidate for a global key currency, vying with  
the dollar,'' said Minoru Kobayashi, manager of foreign bonds 
investment division at Asahi Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt -- the euro's home, with the European Central bank  
headquartered here -- European Union currency commissioner 
Yves-Thibault de Silguy pressed a button with German Stock Exchange 
officials to begin trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Screens lining the exchange's walls rolled back to reveal rows  
of company names with their share values in euros listed next to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten minutes later, one trader said orders were coming in slowly  
but attributed the sluggish pace to the fact that markets were just 
reopening after the holiday break. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key step toward closer European financial integration  
took place today when the rival London and Frankfurt stock 
exchanges began using computers to monitor one another's trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Boerse executive board member, Reto Francioni, said the  
two exchanges would release details of plans to create an 
Anglo-German market in the coming weeks. The market is considered 
by some to be an interim step toward an expected pan-European stock 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement on the pan-European exchange is likely to be  
made in the coming weeks, Deutsche Boerse chairman Werner Seifert 
told the German daily newspaper Handelsblatt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had a better chance to form a pan-European trading  
platform, even a pan-European stock exchange,'' Werner Seifert was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 nations adopting the euro are Austria, Belgium, Germany,  
Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, 
Spain. Sweden, Denmark and Britain opted to stay out for now; 
Greece did not qualify.

<HEADLINE>  Woodson Wins Defensive Rookie Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From Heisman Trophy to Defensive Rookie of the Year. Not a bad  
parlay for Charles Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland Raiders cornerback won a close race with Green Bay  
defensive end Vonnie Holliday in balloting by The Associated Press, 
announced today. Woodson, the fourth overall choice in the 1998 
draft, received 24 votes from the nationwide panel of 47 sports 
writers and broadcasters. Holliday, selected 19th overall, received 
22, and Arizona end Andre Wadsworth, the third pick last April, got 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson, the first primarily defensive player to win the  
Heisman, was a starter from the first day of training camp for the 
Raiders. His tight coverage and sure tackling helped turn around 
Oakland's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd give myself a B-minus,'' Woodson said. ``I played pretty  
good, but I didn't do a lot of the little things I could have done, 
as far as watching more film, doing a lot more studying. I pretty 
much played off athletic ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ability helped Woodson get a team-high five interceptions,  
tied with veteran Eric Allen; he ran one 46 yards for a touchdown. 
He did not return kickoffs or punts, as he did at Michigan, and did 
not take a snap on offense, which irked Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it known I wanted to play offense and it never  
happened,'' he said. ``I like being out there on the field. I don't 
like to come off. When I'm on the sideline, I kind of feel 
helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jon Gruden has promised Woodson will be used offensively  
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can give either phase of your football team a jolt,''  
Gruden said. ``When he gets his hands on the ball, he knows where 
to go and how to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holliday, who played at North Carolina, also became an immediate  
starter with the Packers. Under the tutelage of star end Reggie 
White, Holliday flourished quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	He had eight sacks when he broke his right leg near the ankle on  
Nov. 22 at Minnesota and missed the last five games. That might 
have cost him the rookie award. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd always be out there,'' Holliday said. ``Almost  
to the point where I felt I was invincible, things were going so 
well, and you know I felt I had a great chance to break the rookie 
sacks record and I guess be more of an impact player my rookie 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White has advised Holliday not to get too frustrated over the  
missed time, and to look to the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid's going to be great. I'm glad I came back this year  
and got a chance to work with him,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell him what you think he needs to work on and he  
just does it,'' added All-Pro safety LeRoy Butler. ``Usually 
first-round picks think they know it all, i.e. Terrell Buckley, you 
know? This guy here says, well what do I need to work on?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson is the first Raider to win the award. Last year's winner  
was Baltimore linebacker Peter Boulware.

<HEADLINE> Election for Gingrich Seat Feb. 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Just a day after Newt Gingrich's official  
resignation from Congress, Gov. Zell Miller on Monday scheduled a 
special election Feb. 23 to replace the departed House speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller chose a nonpartisan election, meaning all candidates who  
qualify for the race will appear on the ballot with no party 
designation by their names. If no candidate wins more than 50 
percent of the vote, a runoff between the top two finishers will be 
held March 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Isakson, chairman of the state school board and a former  
Republican candidate for governor, is the favorite to win the Sixth 
District seat, north of Atlanta. At least five others, including 
former House historian Christina Jeffrey, have also announced they 
will run. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jeffrey, a Kennesaw State University political science  
professor, was hired by Gingrich as House historian in 1995, then 
fired by the speaker after a controversy over her 1986 review of a 
Holocaust course that she said should have included the Nazi point 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
	She insisted that her comments were misconstrued.  
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, once the nation's preeminent conservative political  
voice, resigned while facing an effort by House Republicans to oust 
him after party losses in November elections.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Official Quits in Bribe Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The highest ranking official in one of soccer's  
oldest organizations resigned Monday in a bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Wiseman stepped down as chairman of England's Football  
Association at a meeting of the 91-member FA Council in London. He 
had refused to resign earlier despite a unanimous call from the 
group's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``After more than two hours of debate, the chairman of the FA  
Keith Wiseman told the FA Council he did not believe he had 
sufficient support to continue in his position,'' FA executive 
director David Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiseman's resignation was immediate, Davies said. While Wiseman  
apologized, he said he had done ``nothing sinister,'' according to 
Davies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the biggest scandal to hit English soccer's governing body in  
its 135-year history, FA chief executive Graham Kelly quit last 
month after the executive committee heard he and Wiseman sanctioned 
a $5.3 million grant to the Welsh FA without the ruling panel's 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
	In an hour-long address to the committee, Wiseman ``conceded  
he'd made a mistake in his handling of some aspects of his contacts 
with the Welsh Football Association,'' Davies said.

<HEADLINE> Saywer, Gibson Named 'GMA' Hosts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC is bringing the heavyweight anchor team of  
Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson temporarily to ``Good Morning 
America,'' its most dramatic effort yet to turn around a show that 
has floundered in the ratings for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sawyer and Gibson, who left after 11 years as host of ``Good  
Morning America'' only last April, will start on Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's current hosts, Kevin Newman and Lisa McRee, will both  
take on new assignments. Newman will become a reporter at 
``Nightline'' and McRee, who is pregnant, will be a Los 
Angeles-based correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sawyer, who was Charles Kuralt's co-host on the ``CBS  
Morning News'' from 1981-84, will continue as a correspondent on 
the newsmagazine ``20/20.'' But she will cut down on her traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been getting too much sleep anyway,'' she quipped. ``It's  
not good for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise announcement -- Gibson admitted he was  
``flabbergasted'' to be asked back -- comes as the once-dominant 
morning show has slipped perilously close to third place in the 
ratings. McRee and Newman, who both joined within the past two 
years, have done nothing to halt the long-running slide. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, NBC's ``Today'' show has a 5.3 rating and 21  
audience share in the morning competition. ``Good Morning America'' 
has a 3.3 rating and CBS News' ``This Morning'' is at 3.0. Ratings 
for NBC and CBS are unchanged from last year, while ABC has dropped 
17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News President David Westin conceded that network management  
had tried to change the show without a clear vision of where it 
wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Now ABC wants to hearken back to the feel-good 1980s, when  
co-hosts Joan Lunden and David Hartman, and later Gibson, had ABC 
at the top of the ratings. Westin said he wanted the show to 
radiate ``warmth with intelligence and a sense of family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to go back to the future -- return to what made it great  
and at the same time make it a program for 1999 and beyond,'' 
Westin said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how long the Gibson-Sawyer team will stay on. Ms.  
Sawyer said it would likely be a few months, but Gibson said that 
``we'll do it for as long as it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westin would not talk about who would replace them. Jack Ford,  
co-host of the weekend ``Today'' show on NBC, has been mentioned as 
a possible host. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is gambling that Gibson and Sawyer can bring a short-term  
ratings bump that can be built upon when the show moves to a new 
studio in New York's Times Square, perhaps as early as September. 
The risk is that tradition-bound morning viewers, already reeling 
from rapid changes on ``Good Morning America,'' will see this as a 
short-term fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson admitted that he and Ms. Sawyer ``both sort of giggled''  
when the idea was first presented to them. ``All of a sudden we 
realized that they weren't kidding,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two anchors and Westin all said it was important to the  
overall health of ABC News to straighten out ``Good Morning 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their chief competitor said it was a ``bold move.'' Jeffrey  
Zucker, executive producer of ``Today,'' said it should help his 
show because ``it will keep us on our toes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also shuffled the top management of ``Good Morning  
America.'' Shelley Ross, a senior producer with ``20/20,'' is 
replacing Shelley Lewis as executive producer. Phyllis McGrady, 
former executive producer of ``PrimeTime Live,'' was named the ABC 
News executive-in-charge of the show.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Mayor Refuses King Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The mayor of this town with a history  
of Ku Klux Klan activity has refused to make Martin Luther King Day 
a paid holiday for city workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallingford, where 1 percent of the population of 41,000 people  
is black, is the only municipality in the state that does not give 
workers a day off to honor the slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it sends a negative message, and it distinguishes  
Wallingford in a way that it should not be distinguished,'' said 
Roger Vann, president of the Connecticut chapter of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``To have 
Wallingford as the only town not to have a holiday is really 
inexcusable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor William Dickinson said his refusal has nothing to do with  
discrimination against the holiday, which the rest of Connecticut 
celebrates Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions want the day off but refuse to trade one of 12  
previously negotiated holidays to get it, Dickinson said. Adding 
another day off would be a ``government giveaway'' costing 
taxpayers about $30,000, plus lost time and productivity, the mayor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's appropriate that government give away  
benefits,'' Dickinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some workers felt there was more to the snub in a town where  
the KKK has had a presence in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, several KKK members were convicted on federal bomb and  
weapons charges in a case authorities said was linked to Klan 
activity in Wallingford. 
</P>
<P>
	City Hall secretary Karin Buster, 28, one of the town's few  
black workers out of a total of 450, said employees should get the 
day off. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it just says something about Wallingford,'' Buster  
said. ``It's pretty sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dickinson noted that the town honors King every year with a  
ceremony that includes songs and speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Martin Luther King Day is a very important day, and I  
think it's important that we recognize what he stands for. He is an 
American hero,'' Dickinson said.

<HEADLINE> Moss Wins AP Offensive Rookie Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Too bad about that ankle injury that slowed  
down Randy Moss this season. Just imagine what he could have done 
if he had been healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't see all of Randy until next year,'' Minnesota  
Vikings coach Dennis Green said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's enough to put a lump in the throat of even the most  
fearless defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing on a sore right ankle he says hasn't been 100 percent  
since he hurt it in a pickup basketball game last May, Moss led the 
NFL and set a rookie record with 17 touchdown catches. He provided 
the long-range threat that propelled the Vikings (15-1) to the 
league's best record and the most points ever scored in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	That made Moss an easy winner of The Associated Press' NFL  
Offensive Rookie of the Year award announced Sunday. Moss got 44 
votes from a nationwide panel of 47 sports writers and 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning, the top overall pick in  
the 1998 draft, got two votes. The other vote went to Jacksonville 
running back Fred Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss refused to be interviewed after learning he won the award,  
continuing the mercurial relationship he has developed with the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we were expecting great things out of him,'' said  
Vikings receiver Cris Carter, who became an early mentor to Moss 
during grueling workouts in Florida last summer. ``It's hard to 
really tell what he's going to do, but we knew, especially with the 
offense that we have, we knew that he would put up numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certain things he might do on a certain play that  
might surprise us. But the overall output, the productivity, we're 
not surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss is the fourth Minnesota player to win the Offensive Rookie  
of the Year award, the first since receiver Sammy White in 1976. 
But Moss was more than just an outstanding rookie this season. He 
was one of the league's most dominant players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings were lucky to land Moss with the 21st pick in last  
April's draft. Most teams were scared off by his history of trouble 
as a teen-ager, but not the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the season with two long TD catches against Tampa  
Bay, then announced himself as a legitimate star with five catches 
for 190 yards and two TDs in a Monday night win at Green Bay on 
Oct. 5. Moss added consecutive games with three TD catches against 
Dallas and Chicago late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, his 10 TDs of at least 40 yards tied the NFL record set  
by Elroy ``Crazy Legs'' Hirsch in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of the things we've done and the success we've had,  
we've had huge explosiveness,'' offensive coordinator Brian Billick 
said. ``He's brought the offense to a critical mass. He's taken it 
from an offense that is one of the best in the league to 
challenging, maybe, the all-time best, based on points and 
yardage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was about the time he devastated the Packers in that early  
season game that Moss started drawing comparisons to Jerry Rice, 
the greatest receiver ever. Rice had a modest rookie season, with 
four TD catches, but he combined his talents with a relentless 
drive to blossom in the years that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss is more than just a downfield missile. He can beat a  
defender on nearly any route, using his lanky 6-foot-4 frame and 
leaping ability -- he said he was trying to block a shot with his 
head when he hurt his ankle last spring -- to make catches all over 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Vikings say he also has shown the work habits that will  
help him keep improving, especially once he's 100 percent healthy 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's a precision route runner, like Jerry Rice, he'd  
probably be the most unstoppable player of all time. Guaranteed,'' 
said Vikings cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the first trading day  
of the New Year mixed Monday, with share prices slumping in Tokyo 
and Hong Kong, but rising in Seoul and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 426.28  
points, or 3.08 percent, to close at 13,415.89 points, the lowest 
average since Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell on worries over a steep gain in the yen  
against the U.S. dollar. A higher yen tends to make Japanese 
exports more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell against the yen as the euro made a strong debut  
on Asian currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 113.86 yen in late afternoon trading,  
down 1.34 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its New 
York level of 113.57 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro held its own after a slow start, rising as high as  
$1.1886 during the day, well above the fixing rate of $1.16675 set 
Thursday by the European Commission. It traded at $1.1873 late in 
the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong slumped in reaction to a sharp decline  
on the Tokyo market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,  
fell 239.41 points, or 2.4 percent, closing at 9,809.17. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is selling'' on the back of the losses on the Tokyo  
Stock Exchange, said Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd.'s research 
manager, Francis Lun. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian share prices also tumbled after the central bank said  
it was taking control of the country's largest finance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Negara announced it was taking control of MBF Finance Bhd.  
to help put it on firmer financial footing. The Kuala Lumpur Stock 
Exchange's benchmark Composite Index fell 24.48 points, or 4.2 
percent, to 561.65. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares prices closed sharply higher, with the key  
index surging 4.5 percent on expectations of a recovery in the 
country's sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 25.11 points to  
587.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares closed mostly higher following a surprise cut  
in prime lending rate by a leading bank. The Straits Times Index 
rose 7.38 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,400.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Development Bank of Singapore lowered the  
interest rate it charges its best customers from 5.5 percent to 5.0 
percent. The move, which was expected to initiate another round of 
prime rate cuts by Singapore's biggest banks, is the sixth cut 
since September. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed in Taiwan and New Zealand for a holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, with the key  
index rising to its highest close since since April, 1998. The All 
Ordinaries Index rose 19.2 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,832.6.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants US-Based Cult Deported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETAH TIKVAH, Israel (AP) -- Israel today ordered 11 members of a  
Denver-based doomsday cult deported and brought a 12th before a 
magistrate on suspicion he plotted a Temple Mount shootout in hopes 
it would bring Jesus Christ's return. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen members of the Concerned Christians cult -- eight adults  
and six children -- were arrested Sunday in raids on two homes in 
the Jerusalem suburbs of Moza and Mevasseret. Officials said 
investigations were continuing concerning three of the men 
arrested; the 11 ordered deported include six children. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests three days into 1999 raised the curtain on what  
Israeli authorities fear could be months of turbulence leading up 
to the turn of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 4.5 million tourists, including many Christian pilgrims,  
are expected to visit the Holy Land this year and there are 
concerns that among them will be scores of extremists seeking to 
live out apocalyptic fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver cultists were arrested by a newly formed Israeli task  
force consisting of police, agents of the domestic Shin Bet 
security service and the Mossad spy agency. 
</P>
<P>
	A task force spokesman has told an Israeli government committee  
overseeing millennium preparations that some cults based in the 
United States may decide to commit mass suicide on the Mount of 
Olives, which some Christians believe is the designated site for 
Jesus' return at the start of the next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Concerned Christians, a cult which counts only  
several dozen members, began selling their homes in and around 
Denver this fall. Their leader, Monte Kim Miller, believes he will 
die on the streets of Jerusalem in December and be resurrected. 
Miller was not among those detained, and police said he was not in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen cult members arrived in Israel in small groups in  
September and settled in two spacious suburban homes in Moza and 
Mevasseret. They were under police surveillance for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, one cult member was brought before a magistrate in the  
Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikvah for a closed-door hearing, and two 
others were to appear before the judge later in the day. Police 
sought an extension of their detention to keep questioning them. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult member covered his head with a beige shirt as he walked  
past reporters into the courtroom. With one hand he was handcuffed 
to a plainclothes security agent and with the other, he carried a 
plastic bag with an apple and a sandwich. The laces had been 
removed from his sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli police have said the cult members planned to provoke a  
bloody shootout by opening fire on police. Members of the group 
believe that this catastrophic act would hasten the Second Coming, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Ministry, meanwhile, issued deportation orders  
against 11 of the cult members, including six children and several 
women. The ministry did not explain why some cult members were 
ordered deported and others kept in detention. 
</P>
<P>
	A Jerusalem magistrate will have to review the deportation order  
before the 11 can be returned to the United States, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult's Mevasseret home was locked today.  
</P>
<P>
	In the garden, there were four holes, each about 18 inches in  
diameter, which were dug by residents, neighbors said. Police had 
also searched the garden, but it was not clear what they were 
seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bedroom, suitcases were stacked in the corner, perched on a  
dresser and strewn across the floor. A half-full package of diapers 
was twisted in the bed sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has gone in or out since dozens of police and security  
officers swooped down on the two-story house Sunday, arresting five 
adults and three children, said neighbor Aliza Hanouni. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hanouni said she thought something was strange about the  
eight residents of the house. They kept their distance, they were 
home all the time, and they didn't seem to be one family as they 
claimed. But Hanouni said her suspicions were aroused last Friday, 
when she saw cult members dig up their garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned over all the plants, everything,'' Hanouni said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, police lugged cartons of evidence out of the  
house but would not say what they found.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the first trading day  
of the New Year mixed Monday, with share prices slumping in Tokyo 
and Hong Kong, but rising in Seoul and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 426.28  
points, or 3.08 percent, to close at 13,415.89 points, the lowest 
average since Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell on worries over a steep gain in the yen  
against the U.S. dollar. A higher yen tends to make Japanese 
exports more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell against the yen as the euro made a strong debut  
on Asian currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 113.86 yen in late afternoon trading,  
down 1.34 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its New 
York level of 113.57 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro held its own after a slow start, rising as high as  
$1.1886 during the day, well above the fixing rate of $1.16675 set 
Thursday by the European Commission. It traded at $1.1873 late in 
the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong slumped in reaction to a sharp decline  
on the Tokyo market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,  
fell 239.41 points, or 2.4 percent, closing at 9,809.17. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is selling'' on the back of the losses on the Tokyo  
Stock Exchange, said Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd.'s research 
manager, Francis Lun. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian share prices also tumbled after the central bank said  
it was taking control of the country's largest finance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Negara announced it was taking control of MBF Finance Bhd.  
to help put it on firmer financial footing. The Kuala Lumpur Stock 
Exchange's benchmark Composite Index fell 24.48 points, or 4.2 
percent, to 561.65. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares prices closed sharply higher, with the key  
index surging 4.5 percent on expectations of a recovery in the 
country's sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 25.11 points to  
587.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares closed mostly higher following a surprise cut  
in prime lending rate by a leading bank. The Straits Times Index 
rose 7.38 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,400.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Development Bank of Singapore lowered the  
interest rate it charges its best customers from 5.5 percent to 5.0 
percent. The move, which was expected to initiate another round of 
prime rate cuts by Singapore's biggest banks, is the sixth cut 
since September. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed in Taiwan and New Zealand for a holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, with the key  
index rising to its highest close since since April, 1998. The All 
Ordinaries Index rose 19.2 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,832.6. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed in listless trading, with  
demand on selective blue-chip stocks keeping the market's main 
index higher. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected

<HEADLINE> Border Truck Inspections Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and state governments are doing a poor  
job of inspecting trucks at the U.S.-Mexican border, an audit has 
found, and that could affect public safety next year when 
international trucking is slated to expand under the NAFTA 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	One crossing, at El Paso, Texas, receives an average of 1,300  
trucks daily. Federal auditors found that there was only one 
inspector, and he could look at only 10 to 14 trucks a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the auditors found that too few inspections were  
conducted, and those that did occur failed a high number of trucks. 
Trucks that aren't inspected are simply allowed to cross the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 44 percent of the Mexican trucks inspected during the  
1997 fiscal year were put out of service. By comparison, the 
failure rate was 25 percent for U.S. trucks and 17 percent for 
Canadian trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truck accidents, although down in the last year or so, are  
still a major source of fatalities across the United States,'' 
Lawrence Weintrob, assistant inspector general for auditing at the 
Transportation Department, said Monday. ``If we don't ensure that 
the trucks coming up from Mexico meet our standards, the risk 
increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Canada have developed uniform inspection  
and safety standards for trucks and drivers. As a result, Canadian 
truckers enjoy unrestricted access to U.S. roads, subject, like 
U.S. truckers, to inspection by the states. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico does not have a truck inspection program, so Mexican  
truckers are allowed to operate only in commercial zones extending 
from three miles to 20 miles north of the border. They are also 
subject to inspection at 28 border crossings: 16 in Texas, six in 
Arizona, four in California and two in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement,  
commercial trucks should be able to travel through the interiors of 
all three countries by Jan. 1, 2000. A similar provision allowing 
cross-border trucking within the U.S. and Mexican border states was 
to have taken effect in December 1995, but the Transportation 
Department delayed it indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	In its audit, the inspector general's office highlighted the  
inspection program in California, one it said stood in stark 
contrast to the programs run by the Federal Highway Administration 
and the other border states. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona and Texas, for example, have eight full-time and 37  
part-time inspectors combined, while California alone has 45 
full-time and five part-time inspectors. California accounts for 
about 22 percent of the cross-border traffic; Arizona and Texas 
account for about 77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	California has also built two permanent inspection facilities in  
anticipation of the NAFTA traffic. Texas and Arizona have none, and 
New Mexico is building one. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general said the more vigorous inspections have  
improved the quality of trucks entering the United States from 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1997 fiscal year, 28 percent of the trucks attempting to  
enter California from Mexico were put out of service by inspectors. 
By contrast, the rate was 50 percent in Texas, 42 percent in 
Arizona and 37 percent in New Mexico. Exact figures for the 1998 
fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, were not available but the trend 
mirrored the 1997 results, the inspector general reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Federal Highway Administration and its Office of Motor  
Carriers, which supervises truck inspections, refused to comment on 
the audit. A Transportation Department spokesman said the agency 
would have no comment until officials have studied the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general said Mexico is planning to create a truck  
inspection program based on the U.S. and Canadian models. Until 
then, the agency suggests posting two inspectors at each of the 28 
border crossings, possibly supplemented by two additional 
inspectors for every 100,000 border crossings during the 1997 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated cost ranges from $3 million to $7 million.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall as Euro Makes Its Debut / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Monday as investors moved  
toward the new European currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/16  
point, or $8.13 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.15 percent from 5.09 percent at 
Thursday's early close. The bond market was closed Friday in 
observance of New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down 1/16 point, and intermediate maturities fell between 3-32 
point to 3/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.65 
from Thursday to 1,318.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.48 percent as the  
discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.38 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.55 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.40 percent. One-year yields were 4.59 percent as the 
discount rose 0.05 percentage point from Thursday to 4.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, closed at 5.25 percent, compared with Thursday's 4.88 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 124 23/32 from Thursday's 124 28/32. 
The average yield to maturity rose to 5.17 percent from 5.16 
percent.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 1 Missing in Canoe Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- Strong wind flipped an outrigger canoe,  
tossing six members of an experienced paddling team into 50-degree 
Pacific water dressed only in shorts and T-shirts. One man died, 
another was missing and a third was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The six set out from Channel Islands Harbor in a 40-foot  
outrigger early Sunday to row to an oil platform about 10 miles off 
the coast. Only about 1 1/2 miles into the trip, the boat capsized in 
40 mph winds and sank, Coast Guard Lt. Dan Deptula said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was totally a freak accident,'' said crew member Michael  
Davis, one of those who was rescued. ``We were very trained, 
skilled at what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the group was wearing a life jacket, Deptula said.  
</P>
<P>
	The group detached the canoe's outrigger and tried to float to  
shore, but they were thrashed by high waves amd a strong current 
pulled them toward the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
	John Devlin, 50, of Oxnard drowned as a result of extreme  
hypothermia about 90 minutes after the boat capsized. 
</P>
<P>
	After Devlin died, Justin Heard, 28, decided to swim to shore.  
He was rescued by a sailboat about four hours later, the Coast 
Guard said. He was in critical condition with extreme hypothermia 
at St. John's Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Another crewmate, Scott Sullenger, 36, left the group about an  
hour after Heard did, also hoping to swim to shore. He remained 
missing early today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep doing all we can for now, because you can never  
tell,'' Deptula said. ``But it's going to be difficult. The person 
was not wearing a flotation device.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three others who stayed together -- Davis, 30; Ben Tai Tai,  
50; and Tino Rico, 38 -- were rescued by a fishing vessel shortly 
after noon as they drifted about 2 1/2 miles from shore, Deptula said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were treated for hypothermia and released.  
</P>
<P>
	Devlin's body, which the trio had kept with them, was recovered  
when they were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just trying to hold him,'' Davis said. ``Ben Tai Tai  
held him in his arms for about 45 minutes.''

<HEADLINE> Woodson Best NFL Rookie on Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How can Charles Woodson top his selection as Associated Press  
Defensive Rookie of the Year? Well, maybe with some offensive 
awards next season. 
</P>
<P>
	After making five interceptions and playing a key role in  
transforming the Oakland Raiders from the NFL's worst defense in 
1997 to one of its best this season, the cornerback is eager to add 
offense and special teams to his pro resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost from the moment he was drafted fourth overall by the  
Raiders, Woodson made it clear he wanted to see action at wide 
receiver in addition to his defensive responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can give either phase of your football team a jolt,''  
Raiders coach Jon Gruden said. ``When he gets his hands on the 
ball, he knows where to go and how to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Michigan, where he became the first primarily defensive  
player to win the Heisman Trophy, Woodson saw spot duty at receiver 
and also returned punts. The Raiders coaching staff said at first 
they wanted him to focus on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	But by mid-November, the sputtering Oakland offense needed a  
boost and Gruden hinted he'd use Woodson as a secret weapon. 
Woodson worked out with the offense before a game against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	But he did not play on offense against the Seahawks, and after  
the game Woodson said the experiment was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruden then virtually promised to use Woodson on offense in the  
season finale against Kansas City. But when Woodson reacted coolly, 
saying he had heard it all before, Gruden rescinded his offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it known I wanted to play offense and it never  
happened,'' Woodson said. ``I like being out there on the field. I 
don't like to come off. When I'm on the sideline, I kind of feel 
helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson was dangerous enough on defense.  
</P>
<P>
	He tied Eric Allen for the team lead in interceptions and ran  
one of them back 46 yards for a touchdown. His tight coverage and 
solid tackling forced teams often to throw away from him, 
especially after Allen was sidelined with a torn knee ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles Woodson is an excellent football player,'' Gruden  
said. ``He's a guy that can cover people and can tackle. He's an 
all-around football player. He's been exceptional since he's been 
here and what he's done as a rookie is rare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego quarterback Ryan Leaf, who was chosen two picks ahead  
of Woodson in the draft but struggled in his rookie season, said 
the Raiders' cornerback plays with the assurance of a veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``His confidence is riding so high,'' Leaf said. ``He's got that  
swagger with him. If any time he messes up, he bounces back real 
quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson is the first Raider to win the award. Last year's winner  
was Baltimore linebacker Peter Boulware. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd give myself a B-minus,'' Woodson said. ``I played pretty  
good, but I didn't do a lot of the little things I could have done, 
as far as watching more film, doing a lot more studying. I pretty 
much played off athletic ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson won a close race with Green Bay defensive end Vonnie  
Holliday in balloting by The Associated Press for the defensive 
rookie award. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson received 24 votes from the nationwide panel of 47 sports  
writers and broadcasters. Holliday, selected 19th overall in the 
NFL draft, received 22, and Arizona end Andre Wadsworth, the third 
pick last April, got one. 
</P>
<P>
	Holliday, who played at North Carolina, also became an immediate  
starter with the Packers. Under the tutelage of star end Reggie 
White, Holliday flourished quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	He had eight sacks when he broke his right leg near the ankle on  
Nov. 22 at Minnesota and missed the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd always be out there,'' Holliday said. ``Almost  
to the point where I felt I was invincible, things were going so 
well, and you know I felt I had a great chance to break the rookie 
sacks record and I guess be more of an impact player my rookie 
year.''

<HEADLINE> No. 1 NBA Draftee To Play in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in last  
June's NBA draft, intends to sign with a top Italian club but could 
return to the NBA if the lockout ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi will be joining Kinder Bologna immediately after  
arriving in Italy, beating the Monday deadline for the Euro 
League's playoff rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	His NBA rights are held by the Los Angeles Clippers. The  
7-foot-1 Nigerian has a clause in his contract allowing him to come 
back to the NBA on Feb. 15 if the labor dispute is settled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait as a whole bunch of people who already have  
millions in their bank accounts discuss my fate for what I'm 
supposed to do in the future,'' Olowokandi said Monday at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the lockout is taken care of, I'll be on the next  
plane back,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi is believed to be signing for $3 million, with $1  
million payable even if he returns to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Duffy, Olowokandi's agent, said his client made the move  
because of the uncertainty surrounding the NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with the ability to return on Feb. 15, I think we've  
eliminated the risk of him not being able to play in the NBA this 
year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, who grew up in England, played at Pacific University  
and averaged 22.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 2.9 blocks as a senior. 
He has been playing competitively for just three years. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to make his Kinder debut Thursday in a Euro  
League second-round game at Greece's PAOK Salonica. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro League teams are limited to two foreigners per roster.  
Olowokandi and guard Sasha Danilovic, formerly of the Miami Heat, 
hold the two spots for Kinder Bologna.

<HEADLINE> UConn Women Remain No. 1 in AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two more one-sided victories kept Connecticut No. 1 today in The  
Associated Press women's basketball poll, which had newcomers for 
the first time in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State and Boston College broke into the Top 25 after major  
upsets. It was the first ranking in four years for Ohio State, the 
first ever for Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut received 37 of 40 first-place votes from the media  
panel to remain No. 1 for the seventh straight week. 
</P>
<P>
	There also has been little movement recently right behind the  
Huskies (11-0). No. 2 Tennessee and No. 3 Purdue have held those 
positions for five consecutive weeks. The top six stayed the same 
for the third week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut returned to Big East play with two dominating  
performances, beating Villanova 74-43 and West Virginia 116-71, the 
eighth time this season the Huskies have reached 100 points. 
They're averaging 101.5 points and have an average victory margin 
of 39. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn had 997 points in the voting, Tennessee (11-1) had 963 and  
Purdue (9-1) 915. Tennessee, which has won 10 straight since its 
loss to Purdue, received the three other first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia (12-0) remained fourth, Louisiana Tech (10-2) was fifth  
and North Carolina (16-1) sixth. North Carolina won three games in 
the past week to run its winning streak to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech moved up one spot to seventh and was followed by  
Colorado State, Notre Dame and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion jumped three places to lead the second 10 and  
Clemson fell two spots to 12th after suffering its first loss, 
67-66 in overtime to Virginia. Duke climbed four places to 13th and 
was followed by Virginia Tech, Rutgers, Iowa State, Penn State, 
Alabama, Florida and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, Virginia, Ohio State, Memphis and Boston College held  
the final five spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (9-3), which has won eight of its last nine, sprung a  
72-54 upset at Penn State in its Big Ten opener, then won at 
Michigan State before having Sunday's game with Purdue postponed by 
the snowstorm that socked the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes earned their first national ranking since the week  
of Jan. 3, 1995, when they were 22nd -- the only time that season 
they were ranked. The last time Ohio State spent any extensive time 
in the poll was the 1993-94 season, when the Buckeyes were coming 
off their only Final Four appearance and were ranked the first 11 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College (10-1) cracked the Top 25 after not getting a  
single vote last week. The Eagles, off to their best start ever, 
gained attention with a 78-65 victory over then-No. 7 Notre Dame. 
Their only loss was at Miami, Fla., on Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Clara and George Washington, which held the final two  
spots last week, dropped out.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mint Distributes New Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Delaware, the first state to approve the  
Constitution, is the first state commemorated by a new series of 
quarters the U.S. Mint began distributing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The series eventually will feature separate designs on the  
coins' tails side to commemorate each of the 50 states. A profile 
of George Washington remains on the heads side. 
</P>
<P>
	``By late spring and early summer in most parts of the country,  
these coins will start showing up in circulation. That's really 
part of the fun of this: the treasure hunt of looking for each of 
these coins in pocket change,'' mint director Philip Diehl said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's difficult to predict exactly where or when the quarters  
will surface first because the new coins will go into stockpiles at 
regional Federal Reserve banks around the country, and then will be 
distributed as needed, Diehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectors sets won't be available until sometime this summer,  
but in the meantime, the mint will track sightings of the new 
quarters via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The first new quarters to roll off the mint's presses in  
Philadelphia and Denver replace the American eagle on the tails 
side with Revolutionary War figure Caesar Rodney, mounted on a 
galloping horse. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ride nearly as famous in its day as Paul Revere's, Rodney  
raced 80 miles from Dover, the Delaware state capital, to 
Philadelphia in 1776, to cast his vote approving the Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The coins were shipped on Monday to regional banks and  
depositories of the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, 
that have ordered a fresh stock of quarters -- including the Fed 
bank in Philadelphia, which serves Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	The mint will produce between 700 million and 750 million  
Delaware coins over 10 weeks, then switch to a design commemorating 
Pennsylvania. New Jersey, Connecticut and Georgia will follow 
during 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 10 years, every state will get its turn in the  
order in which they approved the Constitution or joined the union, 
finishing with Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii in 
2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware approved the Constitution on Dec. 7, 1787.  
</P>
<P>
	Congress voted last year to diversify quarters, which were last  
changed -- temporarily -- to depict a colonial drummer for the 
nation's 1976 bicentennial. State governors will choose the new 
designs, and in many cases are seeking input from citizens.

<HEADLINE> 2 Arrested in California Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two Chinese immigrants were arrested Monday  
on charges they kidnapped the 17-year-old son of a wealthy 
developer in an attempt to get $1.5 million in ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuan Nan Chen, who was missing for three weeks, was rescued  
Monday at the home of one of his alleged captors at the same time 
his father was paying $500,000 ransom in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen's legs and arms were chained and his eyes and mouth were  
covered with duct tape, but he was physically unharmed, according 
to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Xu Lin Wang, 27, of Temple City and Xue Nan Wang, of New York,  
were apprehended at the home and scheduled to be charged Tuesday 
with hostage taking. The two, who are unrelated, could be sentenced 
to life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen was grabbed Dec. 15 from the garage of his family's San  
Marino home. Two days later, associates of the kidnappers contacted 
Chen's father and demanded a $1.5 million ransom be delivered in 
the Fujian Province in China. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the father, Fu Shun Chen, delivered $500,000 in  
ransom to two men in Fujian. The two were immediately arrested by 
Chinese authorities who had been alerted to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	At about the same time, police swooped in on the Temple City  
home of one of the suspects and found Chen. His whereabouts was 
determined through phone taps and information from a neighbor to 
the home, 12 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Moss Wins AP Offensive Rookie Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Too bad about that ankle injury that slowed  
down Randy Moss this season. Just imagine what he could have done 
if he had been healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't see all of Randy until next year,'' Minnesota  
Vikings coach Dennis Green said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's enough to put a lump in the throat of even the most  
fearless defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing on a sore right ankle he says hasn't been 100 percent  
since he hurt it in a pickup basketball game last May, Moss led the 
NFL and set a rookie record with 17 touchdown catches. He provided 
the long-range threat that propelled the Vikings (15-1) to the 
league's best record and the most points ever scored in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	That made Moss an easy winner of The Associated Press' NFL  
Offensive Rookie of the Year award announced Sunday. Moss got 44 
votes from a nationwide panel of 47 sports writers and 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning, the top overall pick in  
the 1998 draft, got two votes. The other vote went to Jacksonville 
running back Fred Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss refused to be interviewed after learning he won the award,  
continuing the mercurial relationship he has developed with the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we were expecting great things out of him,'' said  
Vikings receiver Cris Carter, who became an early mentor to Moss 
during grueling workouts in Florida last summer. ``It's hard to 
really tell what he's going to do, but we knew, especially with the 
offense that we have, we knew that he would put up numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certain things he might do on a certain play that  
might surprise us. But the overall output, the productivity, we're 
not surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss is the fourth Minnesota player to win the Offensive Rookie  
of the Year award, the first since receiver Sammy White in 1976. 
But Moss was more than just an outstanding rookie this season. He 
was one of the league's most dominant players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings were lucky to land Moss with the 21st pick in last  
April's draft. Most teams were scared off by his history of trouble 
as a teen-ager, but not the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the season with two long TD catches against Tampa  
Bay, then announced himself as a legitimate star with five catches 
for 190 yards and two TDs in a Monday night win at Green Bay on 
Oct. 5. Moss added consecutive games with three TD catches against 
Dallas and Chicago late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, his 10 TDs of at least 40 yards tied the NFL record set  
by Elroy ``Crazy Legs'' Hirsch in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of the things we've done and the success we've had,  
we've had huge explosiveness,'' offensive coordinator Brian Billick 
said. ``He's brought the offense to a critical mass. He's taken it 
from an offense that is one of the best in the league to 
challenging, maybe, the all-time best, based on points and 
yardage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was about the time he devastated the Packers in that early  
season game that Moss started drawing comparisons to Jerry Rice, 
the greatest receiver ever. Rice had a modest rookie season, with 
four TD catches, but he combined his talents with a relentless 
drive to blossom in the years that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss is more than just a downfield missile. He can beat a  
defender on nearly any route, using his lanky 6-foot-4 frame and 
leaping ability -- he said he was trying to block a shot with his 
head when he hurt his ankle last spring -- to make catches all over 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Vikings say he also has shown the work habits that will  
help him keep improving, especially once he's 100 percent healthy 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's a precision route runner, like Jerry Rice, he'd  
probably be the most unstoppable player of all time. Guaranteed,'' 
said Vikings cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman and her son pleaded innocent Monday to  
an 84-count indictment accusing them of killing a millionaire widow 
and trying to steal her luxurious Manhattan townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Sante Kimes, 64, and her son, Kenneth, 23, are charged with  
second-degree murder, conspiracy, robbery, forgery and other 
charges in the disappearance and presumed death of 82-year-old 
Irene Silverman.

	If convicted of all charges, the Kimeses could be sentenced to  
life in prison. They have been jailed without bail on a credit card

<P>
	The pair also are suspected in the 1996 disappearance of a  
Bahrain banker in the Bahamas, the death of a Los Angeles

<HEADLINE>  Strong Debut for European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe's currency got off to a strong  
start Monday, rising against the dollar on world currency markets. 
But analysts said it will take time to determine whether the 
currency will challenge the dollar's international dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Some suggested that if the euro is too strong, it could hurt  
both the U.S. and European economies. 
</P>
<P>
	With the euro trading above expectations, European officials  
were delighted at the successful launch of their ambitious economic 
and monetary union, tightly linking 11 nations and their 292 
million residents. 
</P>
<P>
	After starting off at $1.1668 early in the trading day, the euro  
hit a high of $1.1886 in Tokyo, and slipped slightly to $1.1820 in 
late European trading. In New York, the euro cost $1.1806 in late 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	French central banker Jean-Claude Trichet welcomed the euro's  
strength as ``the best possible omen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was launched Jan. 1, a day after conversion rates  
against the 11 participating currencies were fixed. While euro 
coins and bank notes will not be in consumers' pockets until 2002, 
the currency can be bought and sold electronically around the 
world. It also can be used for credit card or traveler check 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign exchange experts said it may take some time for the euro  
to find a consistent range against the dollar. ``People are going 
to assess the market for the next two weeks to find a trend they 
can ride for the next three months,'' said Gerry Celaya, senior 
analyst at American Express Bank in London. 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. government officials have welcomed the euro, some  
private economists are cautious about its long-term effects 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the euro is going to be a rival to the dollar,''  
said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy 
Institute, a Washington-based public policy research institute. 
``That will impose some discipline on the U.S. economy, which we 
have not been used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists fear that if the U.S. dollar loses some of its  
appeal as the world's reserve currency to the euro, the U.S. 
government will have to offer higher interest rates on its bonds in 
order to attract foreign investors. That would raise borrowing 
rates across this country for companies and individuals, 
jeopardizing economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, some caution that a too-robust course for the euro  
could hurt the 11 nations adopting it by making exports to the rest 
of the world more expensive for buyers. That's particularly 
troubling because many nations, especially in Asia are struggling 
with weak economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank economist Michael Lewis warned of possible job  
cuts throughout Europe. ``I think the strong euro would be a 
nightmare because it means they will have problems exporting to the 
rest of the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, many European politicians remained optimistic about  
the currency launch. Speaking at a government ceremony celebrating 
the birth of the euro, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres 
focused on prospects for closer political integration in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that in the first (25 years) of the next  
century we will have a political Europe worthy of the economic 
Europe we have achieved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His upbeat assessment was shared by political leaders and  
banking officials across the continent. German Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder said the euro offered ``friendly'' competition for 
established currencies and would strengthen Europe's profile in 
international financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations adopting the euro are Austria, Belgium, Germany,  
Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, 
Spain. Sweden, Denmark and Britain opted to stay out for now; 
Greece did not meet the economic criteria for entry.

	``I believe the euro is going to be a rival to the dollar,''  
said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy 
Institute, a Washington-based public policy research institute. 
``That will impose some discipline on the U.S. economy, which we 
have not been used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists fear that if the U.S. dollar loses some of its  
appeal as the world's reserve currency to the euro, the U.S. 
government will have to offer higher interest rates on its bonds in 
order to attract foreign investors. That would raise borrowing 
rates across this country for companies and individuals, 
jeopardizing economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, some caution that a too-robust course for the euro  
could hurt the 11 nations adopting it by making exports to the rest 
of the world more expensive for buyers. That's particularly 
troubling because many nations, especially in Asia are struggling 
with weak economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank economist Michael Lewis warned of possible job  
cuts throughout Europe. ``I think the strong euro would be a 
nightmare because it means they will have problems exporting to the 
rest of the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, many European politicians remained optimistic about  
the currency launch. Speaking at a government ceremony celebrating 
the birth of the euro, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres 
focused on prospects for closer political integration in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that in the first (25 years) of the next  
century we will have a political Europe worthy of the economic 
Europe we have achieved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His upbeat assessment was shared by political leaders and  
banking officials across the continent. German Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder said the euro offered ``friendly'' competition for 
established currencies and would strengthen Europe's profile in 
international financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations adopting the euro are Austria, Belgium, Germany,  
Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, 
Spain. Sweden, Denmark and Britain opted to stay out for now; 
Greece did not meet the economic criteria for entry.

<HEADLINE> In NFL, Meet the New Powerhouses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The teams that have won five of the last six Super Bowls are no  
longer the NFL's ruling class. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Bay Packers, Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers  
are not the elite anymore, even though San Francisco remains alive 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to think this is the same Cowboys as the old  
days and it's not,'' Troy Aikman said after Dallas was thumped by 
the Cardinals, whom they had beaten in 16 of their last 17 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not. We rely on different people now, and for a few of  
the people the door of opportunity is shut. We are looking through 
a different window now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no blame to be affixed, not in an era when the salary  
cap precludes teams from assembling a panoply of stars, such as the 
49ers of the '80s, the Steelers, Cowboys and Dolphins of the '70s 
and the Packers of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers have had a two-decade run, largely because Bill Walsh  
had the foresight to acquire Steve Young, who continued after 1990 
what Joe Montana started in the '80s. But they are $27 million over 
the salary cap and have no strong front-office leader -- Carmen 
Policy has gone to Cleveland, Eddie DeBartolo is in limbo because 
of legal problems and coach Steve Mariucci isn't sure he wants to 
sign a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	So the end is in sight. Young is 37, Jerry Rice is 36 and young  
stars such as Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes could get offers they 
can't refuse and that the 49ers can't match, as Dana Stubblefield 
did after last season. To beat the Packers, they even had to bring 
back Charles Haley, run out of town nearly a decade ago because of 
his quirky off-field behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The core of the Cowboys remains -- Aikman, Michael Irvin, Emmitt  
Smith and Deion Sanders. But all are on the downside of their 
careers and many of the role players so important in three Super 
Bowl triumphs have moved on to bigger bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers will lose Reggie White to retirement, could lose  
Antonio Freeman to free agency unless they make him the franchise 
player and may very well lose Mike Holmgren to another team -- 
perhaps even the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll remain competitive as long as Brett Favre is the  
quarterback -- his regression this year was due primarily to 
injuries in the supporting cast. And Ron Wolf has shown the ability 
to draft standouts even with relatively low picks, as he did this 
year with Vonnie Holliday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mike leaves, it doesn't change the way I play,'' Favre  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But at this point, Green Bay is only the second-best team in its  
division -- Minnesota is clearly on top. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Vikings have assumed the mantle of the NFC's  
dominant team -- it would be an upset if anyone else represents the 
conference in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta has come along wonderfully but still has to prove itself  
in the long run and could lose a couple of assistants, Rich Brooks 
and Art Shell, to head coaching jobs. That can hurt -- as was proved 
in Pittsburgh this season when Chan Gailey left for Dallas and the 
offense fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals think they may be the future -- and they may be,  
with Jake Plummer. But they have a history of misfortune and 
misjudgment and still need help on the offensive line and more 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs and Giants, surprises in 1997, started badly in 1998,  
but finished well, just missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have defenses as good as any in the league, particularly if  
Jason Sehorn of the Giants and Hardy Nickerson of the Bucs come 
back healthy next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But both have question marks at quarterback, making them likely  
playoff teams a rung below Super Bowl level. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone else?  
</P>
<P>
	Look to the AFC.  
</P>
<P>
	As the Jets showed in going from 1-15 to 12-4 under Bill  
Parcells in two seasons, the right coaching and the right 
organization can work miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone just has to clone Parcells.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HERE WE GO AGAIN:* Maybe instant replay should have come back  
for the playoffs: The first round proved that putting the so-called 
top officials in the postseason didn't end the bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The first one naturally went against Buffalo in a season in  
which the zebras have killed the Bills. Replays showed Andre Reed 
across the goal line late in the game in Miami, but he was ruled 
down on the 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, Reed was penalized 15 yards and ejected for jumping up  
and bumping an official and the Bills had to settle for a field 
goal. That was critical because it forced them to try for a 
touchdown after they recovered the onside kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst officiating in 20 years,'' is how Reed described  
this year's events, which included two consecutive bad calls that 
cost them a game in New England and, eventually, a home playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was Sunday's noncall, when the 49ers' Jerry Rice  
clearly lost a fumble during the winning touchdown drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to lose no matter how you do it,'' Green Bay  
general manager Ron Wolf said. ``But when you make a play in a 
championship game and it's not awarded to you, there's something 
wrong with the whole system. It's something that has to be 
addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people want to address it with replay.  
</P>
<P>
	There's another way.  
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs, the crews are ``all-stars'' -- the highest-rated  
officials at each position get playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	But most haven't worked with each other during the year and  
there is usually some miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
	So why not rate crews and let them work playoff games intact?  
</P>
<P>
	The league office said that's been considered but rejected  
because it would leave inexperienced officials -- often rookies -- 
working conference championships and Super Bowls. Officiating 
crews, like teams, are blends of experience and youth. 
</P>
<P>
	True, but rookies play in the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	Uncoordinated officiating was obvious this weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	In the Miami-Buffalo game, referee Mike Carey, who had a very  
smooth season, was working with new teammates and it showed -- 
things were choppy and sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
	So why not take the best crew?

<HEADLINE>  Travelers Stuck in Storm Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Frustration grew to tears Monday as travelers waited for  
airlines and airports to recover from the crippling weekend 
snowstorm in the Midwest, and a new onslaught of snow shut down the 
snow-smart city of Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	School was out for hundreds of districts from Iowa to New  
Hampshire because of slippery roads and sidewalks, and Purdue 
University in Indiana shut down operations for the first time since 
1984, although classes were on winter break. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 59 deaths were blamed on the storm from Nebraska across  
the Midwest into Canada and New England, and cold air that rolled 
southward behind the storm was blamed for two deaths in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the storm piled near-record amounts of snow on  
the Midwest, shutting down railroads, highways and towns and 
airline flights, tempers frayed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport as 
Northwest Airlines skipped all morning flights because of the ice 
and drifting snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a series of: You go to a gate, you wait in line for  
an hour, you get on standby for a flight, you wait an hour for the 
flight, then get delayed,'' groused Roger von Doenhoss, who had 
been waiting since Saturday for a flight home to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they told us the plane was frozen. So then, the crew  
becomes illegal (over legal duty hours) because it takes too long 
to take off and the flight gets canceled, so you start all over 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Brown of Ann Arbor, Mich., had been trying for two days  
to get his grandson on a flight home to Florida, and spent part of 
the time watching people. 
</P>
<P>
	``One lady had been here two days and couldn't understand why  
she couldn't be first in line for the next departure,'' Brown said. 
``She broke into tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed up and walked around this stupid airport all  
night,'' said Asuka Hirayma, 16, trying to continue her trip from 
Osaka, Japan, to Boston. ``There was nothing to do. It's so boring. 
I hate this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of flights also had been canceled at Toronto's Pearson  
International Airport, and Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
International said it could be Wednesday before the backlog was 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were nearly back to normal Monday at Chicago's O'Hare  
International Airport, where nearly two feet of snow fell. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were long lines as Monday morning business  
travelers mixed with people waiting since their weekend flights 
were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	As far away as Denver, about 800 passengers were waiting for  
connections Monday, said Tom Renville of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The drifting, blowing snow also snarled travel on the ground.  
Sections of four Indiana highways were closed Monday afternoon, 
down from 14 in the morning, but an 81-mile stretch of Interstate 
65 in northwestern Indiana was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 highway refugees forced off I-65 had spent part of  
the weekend at Faith Baptist Church in Lafayette, Ind., many 
sleeping head-to-toe on pews and floors, and they rushed for the 
doors Monday when the highway reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	``The church people and the Red Cross did an awful lot of work.  
They had everything you could want,'' said Kathy Colvin of LaPorte, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana legislative leaders postponed the beginning of their  
1999 session from Tuesday until at least Wednesday because of the 
travel problems. 
</P>
<P>
	While the storm itself was gone, the wind and cold air it left  
behind brought a threat of more snow around parts of the Great 
Lakes, including a foot forecast in western Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo, N.Y., got so much lake-effect snow fed by moisture from  
Lake Erie that nonessential travel in the city was banned Monday, 
and the airport and all public offices were closed. Snow fell at a 
rate of up to 2 inches an hour and wind gusting to 45 mph caused 
blizzard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing is to have thousands of cars on the road,''  
said Mayor Anthony Masiello. 
</P>
<P>
	By 9 p.m., nearly 13 inches of snow had fallen, and another  
less-severe band of snow was expected to move through late Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is outrageous. This is just crazy!'' said Rena Crocker as  
she walked along a snow-blanketed Buffalo street with her 
7-year-old son, Julian, who was bundled up all the way to his eyes 
and snow-covered lashes. Low on groceries, the two were headed to a 
friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had such a beautiful winter so far,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Buffalo averages 93.2 inches of snow each winter, it  
didn't start this season until 7.1 inches fell on Christmas Day.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Idea Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using stock market investments to boost the  
supply of money for Social Security is a complex and controversial 
idea that will not easily become a reality, even though President 
Clinton gave lawmakers the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't as simple a question as it appears at first  
blush,'' said Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., chairman of a House 
subcommittee overseeing Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans long have favored plans that would try to  
fatten the retirement program by investing its money on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting with lawmakers on Dec. 9, Clinton endorsed private  
investment, in general, as one way to help prevent a cash shortfall 
expected after more than 75 million baby boomers retire and begin 
collecting benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and the  
American Association of Retired Persons -- the nation's largest 
organization of older adults -- also are offering conditional 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is simple: Using the stock market to try for higher  
investment returns is more appealing than the alternatives -- deep 
retirement benefit cuts or sharp tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all counting on these better returns,'' said AARP  
lobbying chief John Rother. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consensus ends there.  
</P>
<P>
	Disagreements still to be resolved include even the most basic  
question: Who would do the investing -- individual Americans in 
personal accounts or the government by investing people's Social 
Security contributions in bulk? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has taken no position on this, although some top  
advisers, including Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, have voiced 
worries about both choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republican lawmakers -- along with Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan -- are against bulk investments that would mean 
government ownership of corporate stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the federal government running America's  
corporations, that's socialism, and we sure don't want politics 
getting involved in the investments,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	A powerful lobbying coalition of business and conservative  
groups, from the National Association of Manufacturers to the 
Center for New Black Leadership, also is opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats argue it would be possible to set up a board of  
trustees to insulate Social Security's investment decisions from 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative -- a new system of individual retirement savings  
accounts -- long has been favored by many Republicans and more 
recently won support from some key Democrats. Some government 
benefits likely still would be guaranteed as a safety net, and 
supporters say the power of Wall Street would leave most people 
better off. 
</P>
<P>
	But the shift would be tricky. The first problem is where money  
for the accounts would come from initially -- not to mention how 
much it would cost just to set up and maintain accounts for 148 
million American workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many supporters suggest filling the accounts by diverting some  
of the Social Security taxes that workers now pay. But all those 
taxes -- and more -- will be needed in coming decades to pay benefits 
promised to aging baby boomers. Also, baby boomers do not have 
enough working years left to get much out of new private accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Most ideas to generate money to cover transition costs,  
including raising the retirement age or a tax increase for the 
wealthy, already are drawing fire. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, consensus is growing for using budget  
surpluses, administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the surplus and the possibility of higher returns, we  
increase the chance of having a Social Security reform package that 
keeps a strong standard of living for America's senior citizens and 
could be politically palatable enough to pass,'' said Clinton's top 
economic adviser, Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one can predict how much money the nation will have to  
spare in coming years, and already there is a clamor to spend any 
surpluses for other purposes -- from tax cuts to education or 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to talk about how much of the surplus  
could be used for Social Security without starving other 
priorities,'' said Roger Hickey of the Institute for America's 
Future, coordinating a grass-roots campaign against private 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	That opposition includes the AFL-CIO and civil rights groups  
such as the NAACP. They argue the accounts would leave individuals 
-- especially low-wage workers -- at the mercy of the stock market . 
</P>
<P>
	Rother said the AARP would be willing to support personal  
accounts only if the current system's retirement income guarantees 
also are maintained somehow. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and prominent economists are working on a variety of  
ideas to resolve such concerns. Democrats and Republicans have 
agreed to write a summary of the options that could be used as the 
basis for future negotiations. Many are cautiously optimistic that 
compromise can be reached despite the complexities. 
</P>
<P>
	Making changes to Social Security, sending checks to 44 million  
Americans as the nation's biggest benefit program, always has been 
politically perilous, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we move too quickly or these things aren't fully fleshed  
out, that could create a huge backlash,'' said Rep. Bob Matsui, 
D-Calif., a member of Shaw's subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> Cosby Convict Wants Case Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The man convicted of killing Bill Cosby's son  
asked the trial judge to reopen the case, arguing he was the victim 
of forged evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Six jailhouse letters in which Mikail Markhasev incriminates  
himself were actually written by a convicted forger, David Gomez, 
according to Markhasev's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	In his motion for a new trial, lawyer Henry Hall said Gomez  
testified in an unrelated murder trial that he forged the Markhasev 
letters so he could sell them to the National Enquirer for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Markhasev letters, I did those ... I'm a dirty bird,''  
Gomez testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall did not return phone calls Monday, but during Markhasev's  
trial he accused Gomez of faking evidence against Markhasev to gain 
favor with prison authorities. Gomez is serving a lengthy prison 
term for several felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Markhasev was sentenced in August to life in prison without  
parole for killing 27-year-old Ennis Cosby in January 1997 while he 
was changing a flat tire on a dark road. The district attorney's 
office said Monday it stands by the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez was never called as a witness at the trial, and a  
handwriting expert testified that at least several of the letters 
were written in a hand similar to Markhasev's. 
</P>
<P>
	One letter describes a plan to go to Bel-Air and rob ``a  
connection'' -- apparently a drug dealer -- But the target was not 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to rob a connection and obviously found something  
else,'' states the letter, which closes with a picture of a happy 
face and is signed ``Peewee,'' Markhasev's gang nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	The only eyewitness in the case was unable to identify Markhasev  
as the assailant and initially picked someone else from a police 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a man who collected a $100,000 reward from the National  
Enquirer said he heard Markhasev confide to another pal that he had 
shot a black man.

<HEADLINE> Mom of Suspect in Gay Slaying Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The mother of one of the men suspected of  
killing gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard was found 
dead on a road outside town and authorities were treating the case 
as a possible homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Cindy Thompson Dixon, 40, of Laramie was found near  
a road about five miles north of Laramie on Sunday, Albany County 
Coroner Julie Heggie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon was the mother of Russell Henderson, 21, who is currently  
in jail awaiting trial in the beating death of Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman's death appeared suspicious and investigators were  
approaching the case as a homicide, Sheriff's Lt. Bob Volen told 
the Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Jim Pond said the body was found Sunday morning, ``lying  
just off the road.'' She had not been reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary results from an autopsy revealed the cause of death  
as hypothermia, Pond said. The coroner said a final ruling would 
not be made until toxicology tests were completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dixon's husband, Charles E. Dixon, was scheduled to make a  
court appearance today on a charge of battery on a household 
member. No details were available late Monday from the court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Henderson and  
Aaron McKinney, 21. The two are charged with first-degree murder, 
kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are accused of beating and robbing Shepard on Oct. 7 and  
tying him to a split-rail fence outside Laramie. Shepard, 21, 
suffered 18 blows to the head and died five days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony at a November hearing indicated he may have been  
targeted because he was gay. The attack brought condemnation from 
President Clinton and calls for tougher hate-crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and McKinney are scheduled to go on trial later this  
year.

<HEADLINE> Divining Football's No. 1 Not Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tired of the annual arguments about who's No. 1, the Bowl  
Championship Series promised to solve the problem with a national 
championship game matching No. 1 vs. No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The first test came Monday night at the Fiesta Bowl between No.  
1 Tennessee and No. 2 Florida State: one winner, one trophy, one 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't always been that simple.  
</P>
<P>
	Since 1968, when the final poll was first taken after the bowl  
games, the writers and coaches have differed on the best team in 
the country six times. The most recent split came a year ago, when 
Michigan (12-0-0) won the writers' poll and Nebraska (13-0-0) won 
the coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
	That was in sharp contrast to the six unanimous national  
champions -- Army in 1945, Nebraska in 1971, Southern California in 
1972, Miami in 1987, Alabama in 1992 and Nebraska in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people thought the coaches' vote last year was a going away  
present from his colleagues for Nebraska coach Tom Osborne, who had 
announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The same suspicion hung over the 1991 vote when Miami and  
Washington split No. 1, both finishing 12-0-0. The writers voted 
the Hurricanes No. 1 and the coaches preferred Washington, perhaps 
as a tribute to their old pal, Huskies coach Don James. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the second straight split championship. In 1990,  
Georgia Tech (11-0-1) ruled the coaches' poll while Colorado 
(11-1-1) took the writers' vote. That could have changed, except 
for an official's flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado went into the Orange Bowl as No. 1 and defeated Notre  
Dame 10-9 while No. 2 Georgia Tech was beating Nebraska 45-21 in 
the Citrus Bowl. But what if Colorado had lost? What if Rocket 
Ismail's 91-yard punt return for an apparent touchdown with 35 
seconds left had not been nullified by a clipping penalty? What 
would have happened then? 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the ultimate single play for the national championship  
occurred at the 1984 Orange Bowl when No. 5 Miami overtook No. 1 
Nebraska 31-30. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was decided when Osborne chose not to kick the extra  
point after his team scored a touchdown with 48 seconds left, going 
instead for the victory. When the 2-point pass play failed, the 
Hurricanes had their first national championship and the 
Cornhuskers were No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama played a central role in two of the other splits,  
winning the writers' poll at 11-1-0 in 1978 when the coaches went 
for Southern California (12-1-0), and prevailing in the coaches' 
poll in 1973 at 11-1-0 when the writers preferred undefeated Notre 
Dame (11-0-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama's 1978 title came after it arrived at the Sugar Bowl  
ranked No. 2 and defeated No. 1 Penn State 14-7, sealing the 
victory with a gallant goal-line stand in the final minutes. Two 
decades later, the defeat still sticks in coach Joe Paterno's craw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't have my football team ready,'' Paterno said.  
``That was one of the most disturbing defeats I've ever had. When I 
walked away from that game, I was very upset because I felt I had 
let the football team down. I thought we were better than 
Alabama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowl games offer teams lower in the polls a chance to move up.  
The opportunity is never greater than when No. 1 plays No. 2. 
Before Monday night's Fiesta Bowl, there were nine showdowns 
between No. 1 and No. 2 teams in bowls and the lower-ranked team 
won five of those. 
</P>
<P>
	The last No. 1 team to tumble because of a bowl was Florida  
State. The Seminoles were 11-0 and sitting pretty when a series of 
circumstances sent them into the 1997 Sugar Bowl against No. 3 
Florida, a team they had defeated 24-21 earlier in the season. This 
time, the Gators won 52-20 and moved from No. 3 to national 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were through with them,'' Florida State coach  
Bobby Bowden said. ``Then Ohio State got beat by Michigan and then 
Arizona State got beat by Ohio State and all of a sudden Florida 
was playing us and they just beat the heck out of us. So it worked 
out good for them that year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It worked out better for Florida State in the 1994 Orange Bowl  
when the Seminoles, ranked No. 1, beat No. 2 Nebraska 18-16. 
Florida State went ahead on Scott Bentley's 22-yard field goal with 
21 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had to clear the field of celebrating fans for a  
45-yard field goal attempt by Nebraska's Byron Bennett with one 
second left. Only when it missed did the Seminoles have their 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska got even, winning the next two national championships  
and, with last year's split, three out of four. This time, the No. 
1 trophy will have a different destination.

<HEADLINE> Pats' Carroll Says He'll Stay Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Despite a season full of humiliating  
losses and an early exit from the playoffs, Pete Carroll said 
Monday there is no doubt he will remain coach of the New England 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going onward and we're together in what we're doing  
here,'' he said the morning after the 25-10 AFC wild-card playoff 
loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was no need to address reports that his job  
depended upon how the Patriots performed on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Krafts have made it very clear to me and very clear in the  
statement (Patriots owner Robert Kraft) made yesterday about where 
we're going and how we're going to go about doing it,'' said 
Carroll, who has three years left on a five-year contract. ``It's 
done, the issue is done. (Kraft) already told you, he said 
yesterday, all this conversation is hogwash. We don't even need to 
talk about it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots said there would be no comment from the Krafts on  
the issue. But Carroll will head to the Senior Bowl in Mobile, 
Ala., on Jan. 23 to evaluate college seniors for the draft, 
according to team spokesman Stacey James. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Patriots players on Monday spoke of their desire for  
Carroll to remain as coach, despite rumblings that many New England 
players had stated otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots defensive lineman Chad Eaton said, ``Pete Carroll is  
going to be head coach'' and reports that he might be dismissed 
have become ``exhausting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, Pete's taken us to the playoffs two years in a  
row and that's nothing to take lightly,'' Patriots quarterback Drew 
Bledsoe said. ``I don't think anyone would've anticipated how 
difficult of a situation it would be for him to step into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation Carroll walked into was taking over a Super Bowl  
team, and, perhaps more difficult, trying to replace Bill Parcells, 
who left to become coach of the New York Jets in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first year as coach, Carroll led the Patriots to a 10-6  
record and the AFC East title. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, after losing many key players to injuries -- including  
Bledsoe, who fractured his right index finger during the winning 
drive in the 26-23 victory over the Miami on Nov. 23 -- Carroll 
again brought the Patriots (9-7) to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some big victories -- consecutive comebacks against  
Miami and Buffalo while Bledsoe played despite the injury. And 
there were lopsided losses -- 41-10 to Atlanta, 31-10 to the Jets 
and 25-10 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players expressed frustration with the course the team has  
taken since Parcells left. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of hurts a little bit,'' strong safety Lawyer Milloy  
said. ``It's a very humbling situation, as far as getting into the 
Super Bowl my rookie season, now struggling to get into the 
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Chris Slade said the team has had three successful  
years that many players would appreciate. He said players should 
look at themselves and not blame Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have to look in the mirror,'' Slade said. ``There were  
a lot of times as players where we needed to get the job done and 
we didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said the focus is now on offseason training, which he  
hopes will prevent the large number of injuries the Patriots had 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has got to be one that brings these players back into the  
best shape of these players' lives in all areas,'' Carroll said. 
``And if they don't do that, then they have sold out their lives 
and their teammates.''

<HEADLINE> Money Vaults Fiesta Bowl Into Elite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Like the Phoenix area itself, the Fiesta  
Bowl has grown fast and far beyond expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Rose Bowl is the granddaddy of them all, the Fiesta Bowl  
is the handsome grandson in the expensive sports car. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven years after its birth as a modest postseason home  
for an Arizona State program that was having a hard time getting 
invited elsewhere, the Fiesta Bowl was the glittery scene for the 
first unified national championship game, Monday night's showdown 
between No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2 Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not the first time the Fiesta has bestowed the crown. The  
Fiesta decided the national championship in 1987 (Penn State 14, 
Miami 10), 1989 (Notre Dame 34, West Virginia 21) and 1996 
(Nebraska 62, Florida 24). 
</P>
<P>
	Even in a region where big ideas are as common as golf courses,  
strip malls and subdivisions, the Fiesta Bowl's leap to prominence 
has been remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate millions have combined thousands of influential  
volunteers to make the Fiesta at least the equal of the older Rose, 
Sugar and Orange bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fiesta outbid the other three to win the right to Monday  
night's first national title game in the new Bowl Championship 
Series. Tennessee and Florida State each will receive about $13 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people may think we're arrogant, but we're really not. We  
just think we know how to do it,'' said Fiesta Bowl president 
Herman Frazier, associate athletic director at Arizona State and 
1976 Olympic gold medalist sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a Phoenix-area bowl game dates to the late 1960s,  
when Arizona State's teams under Frank Kush were racking up 
impressive records and sending a lot of players to the pros. But as 
a member of the Western Athletic Conference, the Sun Devils usually 
were overlooked come bowl time. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven local businessmen, led by Don Meyers, applied to the NCAA  
for a new bowl in 1968. Three years later, a hearing was finally 
held. 
</P>
<P>
	An old college buddy of Meyers was an assistant U.S. attorney,  
and he arranged for Attorney General John Mitchell to deliver the 
closing remarks of Arizona's application. 
</P>
<P>
	``He literally told the NCAA if you don't give these guys  
certification, we're going to investigate whether you guys are 
violating antitrust laws,'' Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona got its bowl game.  
</P>
<P>
	Another local attorney, Gary Keltner, won four lifetime  
50-yard-line tickets to the game as the prize for winning a contest 
to name the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being in the Southwest with our Spanish heritage, it just  
seemed to me that Fiesta captured what everybody had in mind,'' 
said Keltner, who still lives in nearby Paradise Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 28, 1971, Arizona State beat Florida State 45-38 in the  
first Fiesta Bowl. Kush's Sun Devils played in five of the first 
seven Fiestas. In 1975, as a hint of things to come, unbeaten 
Arizona State defeated once-beaten Nebraska 17-14 and finished 
second in the national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, the Fiesta Bowl sought a shift to New Year's Day. The  
NCAA said no, and an appeal was filed with the NCAA executive 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Meyers, the Orange, Rose, Cotton and Sugar bowls  
all hired attorneys to oppose the Fiesta's New Year plans. But at 
the last moment, the opposition was withdrawn and the shift was 
approved unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
	At least until this year, the most significant Fiesta Bowl was  
on Jan. 2, 1987, when No. 1 Miami played No. 2 Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our first national championship game,'' Meyers said,  
``and we had Penn State, the pure-as-driven-snow team, playing 
against the bandits of Miami and Jimmy Johnson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game was moved to prime time on Friday night, bumping  
``Miami Vice'' from the NBC schedule. According to Fiesta records, 
52 million households tuned in to watch Miami's Vinny Testaverde 
throw five interceptions and Penn State claimed its second national 
title in five years. With a 25.1 share, it remains the most watched 
college football game ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the Fiesta's biggest legacy, though, involves orange  
juice, chips and cash. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Sunkist signed a multimillion-dollar sponsorship  
agreement to make it the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl. Like it or not, the 
era of corporate sponsorship for major sports events had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunkist scaled back its support after a big freeze ravaged  
orange crops in 1990. But in 1995, Frito-Lay Inc. signed an even 
more lucrative deal that made the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl the 
highest-paying bowl. The 1996 game between No. 1 Nebraska and No. 2 
Florida, which drew a record crowd of 79,864, paid each school 
$13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,600 reporters, sportscasters and photographers covered  
this year's game, an event that will pump at least $100 million 
into the local economy, Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which leaves those who came up with the idea three  
decades ago shaking their heads in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would grow,'' Meyers said, ``but I don't think  
anyone thought it could reach this kind of stature.''

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Activity Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Manufacturing activity slowed in December for  
the seventh straight month, dropping to its lowest level in almost 
eight years as global economic problems continued to hinder 
exports. But investors ignored the sharper-than-expected cooling of 
the industrial economy as stocks began 1999 with sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was up 145.99, or by 1.6  
percent, at 9,327.42 by early afternoon, moving within 50 points of 
the record high 9,374.27 reached Nov. 23. Broader stock indexes, 
also led a continued charge by technology stocks, were in record 
territory in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported today  
its monthly index of business activity fell to 45.1 percent last 
month -- its lowest level since May 1991. Economists had predicted 
the index would rise slightly from its November level of 46.8 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Any reading under 50 percent is a sign of contraction in the  
industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The private group's report is compiled from a survey of  
corporate purchasing executives nationwide. It is widely followed 
by economists because it is usually the first indicator of how the 
economy performed in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to lingering economic troubles abroad, American  
manufacturers were hurt by slowing domestic demand, as seen in the 
largely disappointing Christmas shopping season, said David Resler, 
chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be a matter of concern for the overall economy,''  
Resler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wall Street was extending gains from an impressive  
fourth-quarter surge that reversed a summer swoon. The Dow, 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list and Nasdaq composite index all 
ended 1998 with an unprecedented fourth straight year of 
double-digit gains, helped by falling interest rates and low 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street also was watching the strong launch of the euro, the  
single currency for 11 European nations. While the toppling of 
financial barriers is expected to make Europe a tougher competitor 
to the United States, it also is expected to make it easier for 
U.S. companies to do business in Europe and less costly for U.S. 
traders to invest in European businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers' report gave further support to  
expectations that the U.S. economy will continue to grow in 1999, 
but at a slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``New orders continue (to be) weak as we proceed into 1999 and  
prompt concerns about the manufacturing sector as we move into the 
first quarter,'' said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the NAPM's survey 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports continued to decline in December, although at a slower  
pace, as purchasing executives expressed concern about the steel 
industry in particular, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices dropped at a faster rate, a trend that plagued the  
manufacturing sector through all of 1998. Production also declined 
at a faster clip. 
</P>
<P>
	With struggling manufacturers being forced to cut jobs to save  
money, manufacturing employment dropped at a faster rate last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the decline in manufacturing, the economy recorded its  
92nd consecutive month of growth in December, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the economy's expansion continues past this year, it would  
become the longest in U.S. history. The current period of growth 
began in March 1991.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Long-Term Care Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed billions of  
dollars in new help for the long-term disabled and the family 
caregivers who support them, including a $1,000 tax credit for some 
2 million American families struggling to tend to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax credit, meant to compensate caregivers for such expenses  
as adult day care, respite care and reduced work hours, is part of 
a five-year, $6.2 billion package that the president and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled at a White House ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we announce a critical new initiative to give care to  
the caregivers,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Clinton plan becomes reality without Congress, which  
last year rejected the president's attempt at HMO reform through a 
``patient's bill of rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said the president's proposal is meant to help  
those who struggle to balance their own careers and child-rearing 
obligations with the burden of caring for a disabled or infirm 
parent or other relative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that there is not a substitute for families  
being able to care for their loved ones,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But 
we sometimes forget that caregivers also need care. They, too, 
carry enormous burdens.'' Mrs. Clinton often appears with the 
president at White House events involving issues of special 
interest to her, such as the presentation of the Eleanor Roosevelt 
Award for Human Rights last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's four-part initiative also proposes that the government  
start offering federal workers and retirees private, long-term care 
insurance, in the hope that other employers would follow suit. 
Officials estimate that 300,000 government employees would 
participate in the model program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will ask Congress for $625 million in grants to state  
and local ``agencies on aging,'' which were created by the Older 
Americans Act of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be used to set up information and referral  
programs, and to provide direct services to the millions of 
children caring for elderly parents at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Services would include the same kinds meant to be compensated  
for by the proposed new tax credit: counseling and training for 
complex care needs, such as feeding tubes; adult day care for 
dependents of working caregivers; and respite care to fill in when 
a caregiver goes on vacation or just needs a break. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistance equally would be available to parents of disabled or  
chronically ill children, and any other person providing family 
care to a person -- of whatever age -- with three or more limitations 
in activities of daily living. 
</P>
<P>
	Another component of Clinton's plan would, at a cost of $10  
million, launch an outreach campaign to make sure all 39 million 
Medicare beneficiaries realize they are not covered for most 
long-term care; know what to look for in supplementary private 
insurance; and are aware they might be eligible for long-term care 
welfare benefits under Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and Means  
subcommittee on health, said today Clinton was taking credit for a 
Republican idea. He said the House, over the Clinton 
administration's objections, passed a similar provision in 1995 as 
part of the GOP's ``Contract with America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since President Clinton vetoed these Republican provisions in  
1995, I'm delighted he has changed his tune and is supporting them 
today,'' Thomas said. ``This GOP initiative the president has 
adopted can make a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore will tout the initiative in a series of  
forums around the nation. But the administration will need to 
persuade a Republican-controlled Congress, with its own ideas for 
tax cuts and health reform, to approve the long-term care programs 
as well as the money to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials insist the program could be created  
without touching a dime of the federal budget surplus, which 
Clinton has pledged to reserve for shoring up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year, $5.5 billion cost of the tax credit would be  
covered by closing ``corporate welfare'' loopholes in the existing 
tax code, a White House official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three prongs are meant to be worked into the fiscal  
2000 budget within existing discretionary spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	According to White House estimates, the $1,000 tax credit, which  
phases out at $110,000 for upper-income couples and at $75,000 for 
unmarried taxpayers, would be available to about 2 million 
Americans. The grant program would be expected to serve some 
250,000 families. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5 million Americans need long-term care due to chronic  
or serious illness, disability or simple old age. That population 
is growing as the baby-boom generation nears retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2030, the number of Americans age 85 and older -- nearly half  
of whom need assistance with daily activities -- will jump from 4 
million to 8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the formal announcement, Clinton's proposal was  
endorsed by the Alzheimer's Association, which said the plan 
``gives powerful recognition to the role that family caregivers 
play in providing long-term care in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family members provide at least 70 percent of the care to  
patients with Alzheimer's, a memory-robbing, fatal disease, said 
Stephen McConnell, the association's senior vice president.

<HEADLINE> Phone Deal Seen Good for Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumers could see lower cellular phone bills  
if Bell Atlantic is successful in its bid for AirTouch 
Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a deal would create more competition in the $30 billion  
U.S. cellular phone industry by giving Bell Atlantic better footing 
to compete with AT&AMP;T's flat-rate cellular phone plan. MCI Worldcom, 
Bell South and other companies also would be under more pressure to 
expand into the fast-growing cellular market, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be great news for consumers,'' said Jeffrey Kagan,  
an independent telecommunications analyst in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bell Atlantic and AirTouch have confirmed they are  
negotiating, a deal could still fall apart. News reports and 
analysts have pegged the pricetag at around $45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As technology for cellular phones has improved, and the need for  
them has increased, the number of users in the United States has 
soared to 61 million, up from just 14 million in 1993, according to 
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Cell phones, however, are still a pricey luxury for many  
consumers, and the new one-rate plans are aimed at high-end 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest long-distance company,  
launched a plan that allows customers to call anywhere in the 
United States for $89.99 for 600 minutes of use. This allows 
consumers to avoid extra ``roaming'' charges when they travel 
outside their local area. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Bell Atlantic offered a competing plan at $159  
a month for 1,600 minutes. Bell Atlantic, which has a strong 
network from Maine to South Carolina, has to charge more because it 
relies on costly agreements with other phone companies to complete 
calls outside its areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both plans, however, are still out of reach for many cellular  
phone users, who spend $46 a month, on average, plus long-distance 
charges, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, phone companies ``are going where the money is,''  
Kagan said. ``Competitive pressures from Bell Atlantic will bring 
that down market to the average consumer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic's acquisition of AirTouch would link Bell  
Atlantic's east-coast network with AirTouch's west-coast network, 
allowing the companies to expand their service and cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hand-in-glove fit,'' said Jeffrey Hines, a telecom  
analyst with BT Alex Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which is awaiting governmental approval of its  
$65 billion purchase of GTE Corp., will likely have to sell off any 
assets that overlap with AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hines estimated that if Bell Atlantic's combination with both  
GTE and AirTouch go through, the combined company would have to 
sell off 15 percent of its U.S. assets to reduce its market power 
in areas like San Francisco, San Diego and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not the Bell Atlantic talks with AirTouch fall  
through, the cellular phone industry is going to continue to 
consolidate as companies try to piece together nationwide networks. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI Worldcom, which has been sitting on the cellular sidelines,  
is one company that Wall Street expects to get in the game. Nextel 
Communications, one of the largest independent wireless phone 
companies, is the most likely target. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most obvious way to do that would be to link up with  
Nextel,'' Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors pushed up Nextel's stock almost 10 percent, or $2.25,  
to $25.87 1/2 a share Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where MCI 
Worldcom's stock fell $1.87 1/2 to $69.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, Bell Atlantic fell 3.8 percent,  
or by $2.06 1/4, to $51.93 3/4 and AirTouch was off 5.8 percent, or by 
$4.18 3/4, at $68.25 a share.

<HEADLINE>  Panthers Name Seifert As New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Two years after leaving the NFL with the  
best winning percentage of any coach in league history, George 
Seifert returned today to lead the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has captured the ultimate goal in the National Football  
League by winning the Super Bowl twice as head coach, and brings a 
most unique and special background to the Panthers' organization,'' 
said Carolina owner Jerry Richardson, who introduced Seifert at an 
afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the team nor Seifert would divulge terms of his deal,  
but sources said it was a five-year contract that will pay him an 
average of more than $2.4 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, who also will have a leading role in player personnel  
moves, replaces Dom Capers, who was fired eight days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, who won 75.5 percent of his games (108-35) with San  
Francisco from 1989-96, will try to resurrect a team that rose 
quickly to NFL prominence before plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina went 12-4 and won the NFC West title in 1996, both  
unprecedented feats for a second-year NFL expansion team. But the 
Panthers followed that success by losing 21 of 32, including a 4-12 
record this past season when they were hampered by numerous 
personnel problems and their most injury-plagued year yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The plunge led to last Monday's dismissal of Capers, who  
compiled a 30-34 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of Capers' ouster, Seifert arrived in Charlotte. He  
stayed overnight Monday and met with team owner Jerry Richardson on 
Tuesday before flying back to California. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other teams with coaching vacancies also expressed  
interest in Seifert, and the Panthers also were considering Green 
Bay's Mike Holmgren. But with Holmgren thought to be leaning toward 
either staying with the Packers or going to the 49ers, Carolina 
made a strong push for Seifert, who went 12-4 in his final season 
in San Francisco but was swept by the upstart Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers arrived in Carolina with a reputation for confounding  
opponents with a little-used 3-4 defensive alignment, but by the 
time he was fired, the Panthers' defense had slipped to the bottom 
of the NFL rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert is likely to change Carolina to a 4-3 defense, the set  
used by most teams in the league and one that could signal the end 
of the 14-year career of outside linebacker Kevin Greene. Relegated 
mainly to a pass-rushing role in recent years, Greene was 
ineffective in the latter stages of the 1998 season and hinted 
before the Panthers' final game that it might be his last as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert will find part of his new staff already waiting for him  
in Carolina. Richardson said last week he wants to retain three of 
Capers' assistants -- offensive coordinator Gil Haskell, tight ends 
coach Don Breaux and wide receivers coach Richard Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	Several newspapers have reported that Ray Rhodes, fired last  
Monday as Philadelphia's coach, could become Seifert's defensive 
coordinator if he is unable to find another head coaching job.

<HEADLINE> Live Bulls Let Loose on Wall St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The running of the bulls? Sauntering, perhaps.  
Meandering, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	As blase New Yorkers stole sidelong glances, 10 star-crossed  
bulls took Wall Street -- well, not exactly by storm. If the beasts' 
listless performance Monday was any indication of what's in store 
this year, investors might want to bail out now. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8 a.m. race, sponsored as a promotional stunt by Bestfoods,  
an Englewood, N.J., food company, was held outside the New York 
Stock Exchange building in frigid weather. The bulls -- the 
traditional symbols of optimism and higher stock prices on Wall 
Street -- attracted a smattering of bleary-eyed Wall Streeters, who 
paused for a few minutes before rushing off to chase bulls of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this performance means anything, we could be in a lot of  
trouble,'' cracked financial analyst Josh Rappaport, 33, of 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those,'' added Jonathan Francis, 34, of Manhattan, ``are the  
most lackluster bulls I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the bulls, owned by a company called Animal Actors in  
Glen Gardner, N.J., were in no hurry to pass through the concrete 
canyons. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulls were kept away from pedestrians by a railing set up  
along Wall and Broad streets. Both streets were closed to traffic 
during the race, which took several minutes to finish. 
</P>
<P>
	During last year's inaugural running of the bulls, the company  
claims, the animals predicted the market's merger mania (when one 
bull ``vigorously'' pursued another) as well as the market's tumble 
and subsequent recovery (one bull skidded and fell, threatening the 
rest of the herd before all eventually righted themselves). 
</P>
<P>
	So what did Monday's race foretell?  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, bull No. 5 won and No. 6 took second, so divide the five  
into six,'' deduced television personality and writer Ben Stein. 
``Which means there will be a 12 percent gain in the Dow in 1999 
and only a standard 30 percent deviation in that prediction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, who knows?

<HEADLINE> Ford Workers May Occupy Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Workers at the Brazilian subsidiary of  
Ford Motor Company are threatening to occupy the factory, hoping to 
force the company to reconsider the dismissal of close to 3,000 
employees, union leaders said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Luiz Marinho, president of the Metalworkers Union in Sao  
Bernardo do Campo, the Sao Paulo industrial suburb where Ford's 
plant is located, said the dismissed workers are expected to enter 
the factory peacefully on Tuesday and begin working on the assembly 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Marinho said the union wants the company to rehire the workers,  
and rely on a shorter work week or wage cuts to trim costs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 10, workers at the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen  
approved the company's proposal to slash wages and reduce the work 
week. Without those measures, about 8,000 of Volkswagen's 26,000 
workers were expected to lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's auto industry has seen sales plummet since late 1997,  
when the effects of the first Asian crisis reached the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to protect the economy from currency speculators,  
the government nearly doubled interest rates to 43 percent a year 
and decreed a hefty increase in an excise tax on industrial 
production, including cars. 
</P>
<P>
	In a market where nearly 70 percent of auto sales are made on  
credit, the measures had an immediate impact as sales plunged some 
30 percent.

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Relative tranquility returned to much of the nation early today  
as the storm that pummeled the Midwest and Northeast bullied its 
way off the coast. More snow, however, was likely over the Great 
Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure was building over the central portion of the  
nation, keeping most areas of the East dry. Seasonable temperatures 
and sunshine were likely along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of deaths were reported over the weekend as the massive  
New Year's storm thumped the Midwest and spread along the Atlantic 
seaboard. In Illinois, where 12 people died, more than 21 inches of 
snow fell at O'Hare International Airport, the biggest total for a 
single storm since the blizzard of 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The eastern Great Lakes were again expected to have snow showers  
and flurries throughout the day today, with another few inches of 
snow due by evening in the Lake Michigan and Superior snowbelts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Plains were predicted to be partly cloudy and dry although a  
warm front could produce some light snow along the northern Plains. 
Indiana and Ohio were both expected to be bitterly cold, while 
light snow was likely over Montana and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Cold rain was forecast across southern and central Florida.  
Unsettled and unusually cold air was seeping into the Deep South, 
especially over Texas. Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia were all 
expected to be frigid. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly cloudy skies were forecast in the Pacific Northwest and a  
few snow showers were possible in the Cascades. Further south, 
partly sunny skies were expected for the rest of the Rockies, 
Southwest and the West coast. A few areas of morning fog could be 
found along the coast of California. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest temperature in the continental United States on  
Sunday was 82 degrees in the two California communities of Santee 
and Long Beach. The low was minus-20 at Jordan, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today were forecast to remain in the single digits along  
the northern Plains and Great Lakes; the teens and 20s in the Ohio 
and Tennessee valleys and the central Plains; the 20s and 30s in 
the Northeast, Southeast, northern Oklahoma and northern Rockies; 
the 40s and 50s in the central Rockies, northern California and 
Pacific Northwest; and the 50s and 60s in Desert Southwest, 
southern Florida, Texas coast and southern California.

<HEADLINE> Jets Unlike Their '86 Playoff Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The last time the New York Jets were the  
hosts of an NFL playoff game, they were an injury-ravaged team 
coming off a severe late-season swoon with uncertainty at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets who play Jacksonville at the Meadowlands on Sunday are  
the healthiest team in the postseason, won their final six games, 
and have the AFC's most efficient quarterback, Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we proved a lot during the season,'' said fullback  
Keith Byars, one of the few injured Jets, who is expected back from 
a broken arm. ``We've got confidence from the way we played. But we 
know we have to turn that confidence into production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, the Jets also had supreme confidence as they built a  
10-1 record with a nine-game winning streak. Their offense was just 
as prolific as the current one that finished fourth in the overall 
rankings and scored 416 points. The opportunistic defense, 
constructed much differently from the Bill Parcells-Bill Belichick 
unit that uses schemes and varying personnel, also was dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the days of the New York Sack Exchange, the most  
feared pass rush in the AFC. Lance Mehl was one of the game's best 
linebackers. When they had the ball, the Jets relied on the running 
of Freeman McNeil, the outstanding receiving trio of Wesley Walker, 
Al Toon and tight end Mickey Shuler, and the arm of Ken O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the team that this season earned the Jets' first  
division title since the merger in 1970, that club faltered down 
the stretch. Mehl and defensive linemen Joe Klecko, Mark Gastineau 
and Marty Lyons all got hurt. So did most of the offensive linemen. 
O'Brien, never steady in the pocket when things broke down, fell 
apart under constant pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Joe Walton and his staff couldn't stop a slide that  
dropped the depleted Jets from the top of the division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great year going,'' Lyons recalled, ``and then we  
were playing with only half of our starters, and that's a tough way 
to win football games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the '86 Jets squeezed into the playoffs, thanks to their  
hot start. And they beat Kansas City in a wild-card game at Giants 
Stadium before succumbing in overtime -- thanks to Gastineau's 
foolish roughing-the-passer penalty in the dying moments of 
regulation with New York ahead -- at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	That's ancient history for today's players, none of whom were  
with those Jets. Byars and Pepper Johnson were the only ones in the 
league and both with other teams. And it isn't something Parcells 
thinks about. He was busy coaching the Giants to the Super Bowl 
title that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells had New England in the Super Bowl two years ago when  
the Jets were 1-15 and the worst team in the league for the second 
straight year, lacking discipline and a consistent work ethic. Many 
of coach Rich Kotite's players took the easy route. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the '96 Jets had in common with the team of a decade  
earlier was some talent on which Parcells could build. Receivers 
Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet, linebacker Mo Lewis, cornerback 
Aaron Glenn, safety Victor Green, tackle Jumbo Elliott, guard Matt 
O'Dwyer and tight end Kyle Brady gave him a nucleus and a dozen 
years after their last contending team, the Jets went 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't study the team intensely, but I had an idea of what  
some of these guys were,'' Parcells said. ``I played this team a 
lot when I was in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't envision anything, and we knew it would be hard. You  
just come in and try to do what you think needs to be done. It 
never goes smoothly or the way you might envision, and it never 
involves the same people you think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that 1986 team didn't go into the playoffs with the  
same people it expected to have. This club has just about everybody 
available.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Confirms Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp. and AirTouch Communications  
Inc. confirmed they are holding talks relating to a possible 
business combination. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch, the nation's second-largest cellular phone company,  
said Sunday that ``significant issues still remain unresolved,'' 
and that its board of directors had not approved a transaction. It 
did not elaborate further. 
</P>
<P>
	In statements released late Sunday, both companies said that no  
further comment would be made by either company until an agreement 
had been reached or discussions were terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday cable news channel CNBC, citing sources close to  
the talks, said that Bell Atlantic was negotiating a $45 billion 
takeover of AirTouch. The reported purchase price would make Bell 
Atlantic-AirTouch the fifth-largest merger in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Gerace, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, refused to comment on the  
report, nor would he comment on a possible timetable for a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bell Atlantic this summer agreed to merge with  
GTE Corp. in a $64 billion deal that would allow the companies to 
create a huge provider of all-in-one services, including long 
distance, local calling and wireless services. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC said the Stamford, Conn.-based GTE has already agreed to  
the AirTouch deal, which would be completed before the Bell 
Atlantic-GTE deal closes. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based AirTouch, a spinoff of former Baby Bell  
Pacific Telesis Group, ranks behind only AT&AMP;T Corp. among U.S. 
cellular phone companies. The company has 14 million cellular 
subscribers in the United States, as well as fast-growing 
international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, the nation's biggest local phone company, has 42  
million telephone access lines and 8 million wireless customers 
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Inaugurates Woman Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gov. Jane Hull and four other women were sworn  
into statewide office Monday, making Arizona the first state to 
have an all-female elected line of succession. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull, the first woman to serve as speaker of the Arizona  
House and to be elected an Arizona governor, credited the elective 
first to women working their way up the political ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see a group of women who have all been in government, are  
all experienced, who all ran very positive campaigns. We don't 
think it's as different as people seem to think all over the 
country,'' Mrs. Hull, a Republican, said after her inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were sworn in by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day  
O'Connor, an Arizonan who was the first woman appointed to the 
nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Mrs. Hull, the other women sworn in were Secretary of  
State Betsey Bayless, Attorney General Janet Napolitano, Treasurer 
Carol Springer and Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham 
Keegan. 
</P>
<P>
	All are Republicans except Napolitano, who is a Democrat.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull, Bayless and Keegan won re-election bids; Springer and  
Napolitano replaced male incumbents who did not seek re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, then Secretary of State Jane Hull was named governor  
when Gov. Fife Symington resigned amid allegations of loan fraud. 
He was convicted and is free pending his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In her inaugural speech, Mrs. Hull said her administration would  
focus on education, families, children and lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	She also called for a halt to negative campaigning, saying it  
deters people from running for office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solution is not in another law,'' she said. ``We have laws  
on the books, but rather it is us. We the people have got to say 
no, no more negative campaigning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona long has had one of the highest percentages in the  
nation of women in state legislatures, according to numbers 
compiled by the Center for the American Woman and Politics at 
Rutgers University. The percentage this year is 36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Mrs. Hull, women may be better suited to politics.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most women don't care for lots of confrontation, lots of  
screaming, lots of yelling,'' she said.

and harshly criticized it for failing to pay, commissioned the poll 
to try to help fine-tune the message the United Nations sends 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The dues issue has become the worst strain on U.S.-U.N.  
relations in years. Washington barely avoided losing its vote in 
the General Assembly because of it last year and faces the same 
embarrassing threat later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the poll, 62 percent of voters think the United  
States should pay the back dues, echoing similar results from 
surveys by other firms. Sixty-two percent of Democrats and 60 
percent of Republicans favor payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have demanded U.N. reforms as a condition of  
payment. President Clinton last year vetoed legislation to pay most 
of the debt because of Republican-sponsored anti-abortion 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted for free by Zogby International, found that  
70 percent of American voters had a favorable opinion of the United 
Nations, while 27 percent had an unfavorable opinion and 3 percent 
weren't sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, 57 percent believe the United Nations ``is effective in  
keeping the peace, promoting human rights and helping developing 
countries climb out of poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted Dec. 10-13 among 1,003 likely American  
voters. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Bin Laden Messages Mixed on Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The exiled Saudi millionaire accused by U.S.  
officials of masterminding two embassy bombings is sending mixed 
messages about his role, telling one U.S. magazine he did not order 
the attacks and another that he ``instigated'' them. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews published in the Jan. 11 issues of Newsweek and  
Time, Osama bin Laden is consistent on two other subjects -- 
defending the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and 
denying that he is ill, as some U.S. reports have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The interviews, released over the weekend, were conducted on  
successive days last month by Pakistani reporters who had received 
clandestine invitations to bin Laden's mountain base in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has offered $5 million for bin Laden's  
capture, citing his alleged role in the Aug. 7 terrorist bombings 
of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, 
including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden has previously denied involvement in the bombings, and  
repeated that denial in the Newsweek interview, conducted Dec. 22. 
``I did not order them but was very glad for what happened to the 
Americans there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Dec. 23, he told Time's reporter that he had  
``instigated'' the attacks -- the closest he has come to admitting 
personal involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the instigation for jihad (holy war) against the Jews and  
the Americans... is considered a crime, then let history be a 
witness that I am a criminal,'' bin Laden said. ``Our job is to 
instigate, and by the grace of God, we did that, and certain people 
responded to this instigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek quoted bin Laden as saying the bombings were ``Islamic  
revenge on American spies in East Africa,'' carried out by 
``oppressed Muslims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States retaliated 13 days later with cruise missile  
raids on bin Laden's mountain encampment in northern Afghanistan, 
and a plant in Khartoum, Sudan, that was suspected of making nerve 
gas components for bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men arrested later in East Africa and now in custody in the  
United States had nothing to do with the bombings, bin Laden said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Time that he knew one of them, Wadih El-Hage, but had  
not seen or heard from him in several years, and told Newsweek that 
the other, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-`Owhali, had been tortured into 
confessing and implicating bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I do know is that those who risked their lives to earn  
the pleasure of God are real men,'' Time quoted him as saying. 
``They managed to rid the Islamic nation of disgrace. We hold them 
in the highest esteem... 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray to God to end the plight (of the arrested men) and we  
are confident they will be exonerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to reports that he is in ill health, bin Laden told  
Newsweek, ``The Americans are committing another lie. I'm healthier 
now than at any time before.'' Time said bin Laden seemed ``eager 
to deny reports that he had cancer,'' but used no direct quotes. It 
noted that he walked with a stick because of a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden told both interviewers he saw nothing wrong with  
acquiring chemical and nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acquiring weapons for the defense of Muslims is a religious  
duty.... And if I seek to acquire these weapons, I am carrying out 
a duty,'' he said to Time. ``It would be a sin for Muslims not to 
try to possess the weapons that would prevent the infidels from 
inflicting harm on Muslims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Newsweek interview, he called it ``very strange'' that  
America and Israel could have such weapons, ``but if a Muslim state 
like Pakistan tries to defend itself... everything should be done 
to prevent it from doing so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports described bin Laden as holding an AK-47 rifle  
during the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Time quoted aides as saying bin Laden relied solely on radio and  
newspapers for outside contact, and avoids using a portable 
satellite phone because the Americans might use the signal to 
target his location.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Drops, Tokyo Stocks Plunge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar dropped against the yen Monday as the  
euro made a strong debut on Asian currency markets. Japanese share 
prices plunged on worries about the stronger yen in the first 
trading session of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.86 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
1.34 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its New York 
level of 113.57 yen late Thursday. It ranged during the day from 
112.74 yen to 113.98 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Thursday and Friday for  
the New Year's holidays. On Monday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed 
at the end of morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell amid active futures-led selling on worries  
over a steep gain in the yen against the dollar, which tends to 
hurt major Japanese exporters. A higher yen tends to make Japanese 
exports more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 426.28 points,  
or 3.08 percent, to close at 13,415.89 points, the lowest average 
since Oct. 16. On Wednesday, the average closed down 1.84 points, 
or 0.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar sank in early trading  
on worries about the state of U.S. and Latin American financial 
markets but regained some strength later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, on the other hand, held its own after a slow start,  
rising as high as $1.1886 during the day, well above the fixing 
rate of $1.16675 set Thursday by the European Commission. It traded 
at $1.1873 late in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro cost 134.94 late afternoon in Tokyo, up from its  
initial fixing of 132.80 yen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro, after all, has big potential. It's the No. 1  
candidate for a global key currency, vying with the dollar,'' said 
Minoru Kobayashi of Asahi Life Insurance. ``It's a buy at least for 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all  
issues listed on the first section fell 22.07 points, or 2.03 
percent, to close at 1,064.92. The TOPIX finished down 1.84 points, 
or 0.17 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are worried about a continued decline of the dollar  
and uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, 
general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	About 118.39 million shares changed hands on the first section,  
up from 127.09 million Wednesday. Declining issues outnumbering 
advances 940 to 180, and 125 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.990 percent from Wednesday's finish of 2.010 
percent, driving its price up to 98.48 yen from 98.33 yen.

<HEADLINE> Championships Anger Buckeye Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Its 11-1 season complete, Ohio State  
waited to learn how much one misstep would cost. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, it cost plenty.  
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to top-ranked Tennessee;s 23-16 victory over No. 2  
Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night, there was no 
chance that Ohio State could grab even a share of the national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	State coach John Cooper admitted as much.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, what can I say? Tennessee won. It looks like they'll be  
No. 1,'' Cooper said. ``They'll be No. 1. I don't know who's No. 2. 
If you follow the logic, since this will be Florida State's second 
loss, you would think that they will drop to No. 5 or No. 6.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper was angered earlier Monday about the coronation of the  
Fiesta Bowl winner as part of the Bowl Championship Series 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's the case, it sounds like they might as well not even  
watch the game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes battled through weather and stranded travelers to  
get home from their 24-14 Sugar Bowl victory over Texas A&AMP;M and 
find prime viewing spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said he knew for sure that he would put Ohio State No. 2  
on his final coaches' poll ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you follow the same logic that's been followed all year  
long, we can't be any worse than No. 2,'' he said. ``I mean, you 
lose late in the year, you drop down, don't you? We lost after 
Florida State lost, so that's the logic everybody uses: if you lose 
a game, you can't lose late in the year. So I don't see us being 
any worse than No. 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given a different scenario in the Fiesta Bowl, namely a close  
but sloppy Florida State victory, Cooper said he felt his team 
might have staked a claim to being labeled the best team in the 
nation when it rolled to a 21-7 lead in the first half of Friday's 
Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we played a heck of a ballgame. I thought we pretty  
much dominated that team, to be honest with you,'' he said. ``In 
the first half we missed a couple more scoring opportunities. In 
the second half, their defense played a little better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes were outscored 7-3 in the last three quarters,  
coming up short on the landslide performance they most likely 
needed to leave a lasting impression with poll voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said even if the Buckeyes had sneaked into the Fiesta  
Bowl and beaten Tennessee, he still would favor playing one more 
game to decide the national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been for a playoff ever since I've been a head football  
coach,'' he said. ``I'm not just saying that just because it 
affects us in this situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are many who say that the vagueness of the current  
situation is actually an endearing trait, that the 
discussion-argument over who is truly the best team in the country 
adds spice to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cooper thinks that's faulty thinking.  
</P>
<P>
	``After tonight, college football is over,'' he said. ``The pros  
will go right on through the Super Bowl. I think we're leaving a 
lot on the table by not having a one-game playoff after it's 
over.''

<HEADLINE>  Gunmen Kill 16 in Pakistan Mosque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Automatic gunfire tore through a  
mosque in eastern Pakistan during morning prayers Monday, killing 
16 people and wounding at least 25. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 Shiite worshippers were preparing for their  
traditional day-long fast in the holy month of Ramadan when 
unidentified men on motorcycles opened fire. Some of the wounded 
crawled to the prayer leader's microphone to call for help on the 
mosque's loudspeakers, a victim said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard the firing and then I heard people on the loudspeaker  
saying 'Help me!' They were the wounded,'' said Ahsan Karim Shah, 
owner of a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said as many as 13 of the wounded were in critical  
condition. The attack took place in the village of Quereshi More, 
180 miles south of Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's  
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, however, said they feared it was part of the relentless  
violence between rival Shiite and Sunni Muslim sects that has 
killed hundreds of people in Pakistan, mostly in Punjab. 
</P>
<P>
	The attackers sprayed the mosque with bullets as they sped past  
on motorcycles, eyewitnesses said. There were apparently as many as 
four motorcycles, with two men on each motorcycle, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all were praying when bullets started hitting us from the  
back,'' Tareen Bux said later at Nishter Hospital. ``I was hit by 
bullets and then I fell unconscious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said neighbors rushed to the mosque, helping small  
children and elderly men, cradling the dead and comforting the 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blood was splattered all over the floor of the mosque,'' said  
a shaken Ehsan Karim, who runs a nearby restaurant. ``The wounded 
and the dead -- all seemed to be piled on each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People struggled to transport the injured to the hospital, which  
is 12 miles away. Hundreds of Shiite and Sunni Muslims lined up to 
donate blood for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents cursed the assassins as they wailed for the dead.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why are Muslims killing Muslims? Why are even our mosques not  
safe?'' one veiled woman shouted in the corridor of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came one day after an unsuccessful assassination  
attempt against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at a bridge near his 
home in a town outside Lahore. The blast killed four people and 
ripped apart the bridge Sharif was supposed to have crossed, but he 
and his family were still at home because of a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Police blamed the ethnic Muttahida Qami Movement for the attack  
on the bridge. There was no evidence that the mosque killings were 
connected to assassination plot. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year, scores of people have been massacred in  
Pakistan in attacks between rival Shiite and Sunni sects. 
</P>
<P>
	The main combatants have been members of the Sunni Muslim  
militant group Sipah-e-Sahabah or Guardians of the Friends of the 
Prophet, and the Shiite Muslim organization known as the 
Tehrik-e-Jaffria or Group for Shiite Muslim Law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shiite group said they had sought protection from the  
government but were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had asked the government to provide protection because we  
felt threatened, but they did nothing,'' spokesman Taqi Hussein 
Shah said. 
</P>
<P>
	The provincial Punjab government has arrested many of the senior  
leaders of both groups in an attempt to stop the bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Pakistan's 140 million people are Sunni Muslims, who get  
along with their Shiite brethren. However, militant groups from 
both sects have sprung up and they routinely attack each other.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Sworn In As Minn. Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Jesse Ventura was sworn in today as Minnesota's  
new governor, completing the stunning transformation from former 
pro wrestling bad guy that began with his upset victory in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura took the oath of office at a star-studded ceremony  
attended by at least three former governors and one Hollywood 
heavyweight, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ventura's co-star in 
several movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura succeeds Republican Gov. Arne Carlson, who did not seek  
re-election after two terms. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the first Reform Party candidate to win statewide office  
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	When he entered the race less than a year ago, Ventura was a  
boisterous talk radio host and sometime actor whose only political 
experience was as a suburban mayor from 1991-95. He said then he 
was motivated by a quest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find out if the American dream is dead,'' Ventura  
said. ``I want to find out if you have to be a career politician to 
lead and govern the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said, ``Let's put Minnesotans first. There's more of us  
than Democrats or Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesotans heeded his words and gave him 37 percent in his  
stunning defeat of Republican Norm Coleman and 
Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate Hubert Humphrey III. 
</P>
<P>
	Also taking the oath in the Capitol rotunda were Lt. Gov. Mae  
Schunk, Attorney General Mike Hatch, Secretary of State Mary 
Kiffmeyer, Treasurer Carol Johnson and state Auditor Judi Dutcher. 
This is Dutcher's second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Seating at the Capitol event was limited to about 200 members of  
the public for the official ceremony, but Ventura pledged to stand 
and shake hands for two hours afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife of 23 years, Terry Ventura, have forgone a  
black-tie ball in favor of a ``people's celebration'' bash at the 
Target Center on Jan. 16 with live music. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old south Minneapolis native's trip to the  
governor's office has been an interesting one. 
</P>
<P>
	Born James George Janos, he graduated from Roosevelt High School  
and joined the elite Navy SEALs underwater demolition team. He 
briefly attended North Hennepin Community College before embarking 
on his professional wrestling career and taking the name Jesse 
``The Body'' Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	After the election Ventura shrugged off his old nickname, saying  
he wanted to be known as ``The Mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the ring in 1986 after a successful career and  
became an actor. His biggest success was a turn in ``Predator'' 
with Schwarzenegger, in which he uttered the memorable line, ``I 
ain't got time to bleed.'' The line now is the working title of a 
planned authorized biography. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also made a career as a radio talk show host.  
</P>
<P>
	During the campaign, he often complained that he had been out of  
work since late July when his manager at KFAN-AM forced him to quit 
out of fairness during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Ventura will start drawing his $120,303 governor's salary.

<HEADLINE> Georgia's Star Bailey Going to NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- All-American Champ Bailey, who starred at  
receiver and cornerback for the Georgia Bulldogs, filed paperwork 
Monday with the NFL to enter the draft a year early. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was expected. Coach Jim Donnan said prior to the  
Peach Bowl that he thought Bailey was playing his final game for 
the Bulldogs, who closed the season with a 35-33 victory over 
Virginia on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 186-pound junior turned in a typical performance  
in his final game for Georgia, taking part in 113 plays on offense, 
defense and special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke Wilder, the school's compliance officer, filed the  
necessary papers on Bailey's behalf. The deadline for underclassmen 
to enter the NFL draft is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, who finished seventh in Heisman Trophy balloting and won  
the Bronko Nagurski Award as the nation's top defensive player, 
took part in more than 100 plays in six of the last seven games 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the team with 1,138 all-purpose yards and ranked second  
with 47 pass receptions, accounting for 744 yards and five 
touchdowns. In the secondary, teams rarely threw in Bailey's 
direction but he still managed three interceptions and 10 passes 
broken up, earning first-team All-America honors at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I want to do is thank the Georgia fans for  
their great support during my three years and let them know I will 
always be a Bulldog,'' Bailey said. ``I also want to thank coach 
Donnan, who helped me be the best player I can be. He was very 
supportive of my decision and told me he wanted what was best for 
me and my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is the first underclassman to leave Georgia early for the NFL  
since Garrison Heart and Andre Hastings entered the draft in 1993. 
Bailey is expected to be one of the top 10 selections, though NFL 
scouts are divided over his best position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some like him better on offense and as a kick returner,''  
Donnan said. ``I would say that more than likely he'll play corner 
at the next level. Guys like him are like dinosaurs. You can't find 
guys that can cover like him. Look at all the people he's covered 
over the last two years, and he's blanketed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey is one of three brothers who have played for the  
Bulldogs. Ronald, also a cornerback, was at Georgia from 1994-97, 
while Boss just completed his freshman season at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Champ Bailey already has hired Atlanta lawyer Jack Reale as his  
agent. Reale also represents Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary, 
Detroit Lions coach Bobby Ross and Carolina Panthers kicker John 
Kasay, who formerly played for the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said he will remain in school this semester to continue  
pursuing a degree in psychology and compete for Georgia during the 
indoor track season.

<HEADLINE> FedEx Pilots To Vote on Work Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The pilots union at Federal Express Corp.  
mailed ballots to its members Monday for voting on a work contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballots must be returned by Feb. 3 to be counted by  
independent auditors on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors for the Fedex Pilots Association, an  
independent union, has recommended acceptance of the contract, 
which company and union negotiators agreed upon Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the pilots, I would say, the overall impression of the  
tentative agreement has been favorable,'' said union spokesman Bob 
Clement. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, the contract would be a first for Federal Express  
and the FPA, which has represented the company's 3,500 flight crew 
members since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots threatened a Christmas holiday strike in October  
after contract talks broke off. The talks resumed after the pilots 
backed away from that threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative contract calls for a 17 percent pay raise over  
five years and would give the union more say over flight-crew work 
rules and schedules. It also would increase retirement pay for the 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots are the only domestic employees of Federal Express  
represented by a union. They have been haggling with the company 
over a work contract since 1993, when they were represented by the 
Air Line Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the pilots have rejected two tentative contracts  
sent to them by their union leaders.

<HEADLINE> Woman Pushed Under NYC Subway Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man with apparent mental problems shoved a  
32-year-old woman to her death under a subway train as it pulled 
into a midtown Manhattan station, police said. He then leaned 
patiently against a wall and waited to be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendra Webdale, a record company receptionist who lived in  
Manhattan, was killed about 5:15 p.m. Sunday at the 23rd Street and 
Broadway station. She was decapitated and her body was dragged 
under the northbound train. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Ramirez, 19, said he was leaning toward the tracks  
looking for the train when ``I saw these hands in a beige coat push 
this woman. Then I saw her flying through the air. She said 
nothing. She didn't have time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A train operator then hollered for someone to hold the suspect,  
Andrew Goldstein, 29, of Queens. People waiting on the platform 
grabbed him, witnesses said. He remained silent and sat down after 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein, who was charged with second-degree murder, was  
carrying medical papers indicating he was under psychiatric care at 
an outpatient clinic, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the two exchanged a few words before Goldstein  
pushed her from behind, but police said there was no indication 
that the two knew each other. The killing appeared to have been 
unplanned. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in four years that a subway rider had been  
killed after being pushed off a platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Service on the N and R train lines was rerouted for several  
hours.

<HEADLINE> Wharton Aids Black Business Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Some of the nation's leading business  
schools are helping finance instructors from Howard University, 
Tuskegee Institute and other historically black colleges expand and 
improve their finance curriculums. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-day seminar at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton  
School this week will give instructors access to the faculty of one 
of the nation's top business schools and arm them with the latest 
teaching techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	The seminar should also allow the instructors to make valuable  
contacts, said Francis J. Aguilar, a Harvard business school 
professor and executive director of the Management Education 
Alliance, which is sponsoring the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks and Hispanics have long been underrepresented in  
management and finance, and they are not being adequately prepared 
by business schools at many historically black colleges -- or, for 
that matter, at many second- and third-tier business schools, 
Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tears my heart when I go in and see a really poorly  
thought-out class and I'm looking at these young black kids who 
have outdone themselves just to get to university,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority business students face unique challenges, said Dr.  
Kasim Alli, a seminar participant and chairman of the finance 
department at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunities available to students (at historically black  
colleges) over time have not been the same. They don't have the 
family connections, the networking connection that other students 
might have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Giles, a 20-year-old international business major at  
Howard University in Washington, D.C, said most of her classmates 
want to work on Wall Street -- and feel they have a legitimate shot 
at getting there. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't a great many Howard alumni on Wall Street, but  
the ones who are there have very strong ties to Howard and they 
work very seriously at pulling new people from Howard,'' said 
Giles, who started her own company last year, the Principal 
Investment Group, which provides venture capital to small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 instructors from 11 colleges are expected to attend  
the workshop, which begins Wednesday. It will include a field trip 
to New York City, seminars in financial education and talks by 
representatives from Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., First Union Corp., CIGNA 
Corp. and other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenda Glover, dean of the business school at Jackson State  
University in Mississippi, said her instructors hope to use current 
developments in finance to enhance the curriculum at Jackson State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity for the historically black colleges and  
universities to get involved at a much higher level,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady's Mom Gives Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton stays mum with her mom  
on the subject of her marriage, Vanity Fair reports in an article 
featuring rare public comment from the first lady's mother. Dorothy 
Rodham says she and her daughter don't discuss ``deeply personal 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writer Gail Sheehy quotes Mrs. Rodham as saying her daughter is  
a ``very sensitive person'' but not one given to excessive emotion. 
``She doesn't go into one of these horribly overwrought kinds of 
tizzies,'' she said. ``That's one thing I never did, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine explores the Clintons' marriage in its February  
issue, reaching newsstands in New York on Wednesday and nationally 
Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rodham said her daughter is not the type to call her for  
unconditional love and support in a trying time. ``Hillary is 
really so mature,'' she said. ``She always has been. ... She's 
always thought things out for herself. Then if she needs more help 
or direction, she'll discuss things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But generally, she said, ``I don't talk to Hillary about  
anything deeply personal concerning her marriage. We don't sit down 
and have those mother-daughter discussions about how she relates to 
her husband, her daughter, or anything else as far as her personal 
life is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't talk about deeply personal things.''  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rodham lives in a Little Rock, Ark., condominium and  
typically avoids interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she raised her children to keep their equilibrium,  
often using a carpenter's level to make her point. She would say: 
``Imagine having this carpenter's level inside you. You try to keep 
that bubble in the center. Sometimes it will go way up here and you 
have to bring it back.''

<HEADLINE> Election Date Set for Gingrich Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Gov. Zell Miller has scheduled a special election  
for next month to replace departed House Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller scheduled the Feb. 23 election Monday, a day after  
Gingrich officially resigned from Congress. Once the nation's 
preeminent conservative political voice, he stepped down while 
facing an effort by House Republicans to oust him after party 
losses in November elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller chose a nonpartisan election, meaning candidates will  
appear on the ballot with no party designation by their names. If 
no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, a runoff 
between the top two finishers will be held March 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Isakson, chairman of the state school board and a former  
Republican candidate for governor, is the favorite to win the Sixth 
District seat, north of Atlanta. At least five others, including 
former House historian Christina Jeffrey, have also announced they 
will run. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jeffrey, a Kennesaw State University political science  
professor, was hired by Gingrich as House historian in 1995, then 
fired by the speaker after a controversy over her 1986 review of a 
Holocaust course that she said should have included the Nazi point 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
	She insisted that her comments were misconstrued.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Deny Nissan Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Debt-laden Nissan Motor Corp. is the favorite  
subject of merger rumors at this year's Detroit auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	A board member of BMW AG denied rumors Monday that the German  
automaker is in discussions with Nissan over a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, declined to comment  
on rumors that the world's No. 2 automaker also was in talks with 
Nissan, but he made it clear that Ford was open to expanding its 
global reach. 
</P>
<P>
	In the post-DaimlerChrysler auto industry, the annual North  
American International Auto Show has become a even more of a rumor 
mill than it used to be. That's due to the fact that last year's 
merger of Chrysler Corp. and Germany's Daimler-Benz AG began with 
private discussions during the 1998 Detroit show. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfgang Reitzle, a BMW board member, said in an interview that  
his company was not in partnership talks with Nissan, Volkswagen AG 
or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' he said. ``Nothing. Zero.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle said BMW is in a strong financial position and sees no  
need to become significantly larger. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no need to join forces with others because we have  
the critical mass in all critical areas: R&AMP;D, sales, production and 
so on,'' he said. ``We don't want to be substantially bigger 
because that creates too much complexity in managing the shear 
size.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most industry experts expect further consolidation of the global  
auto industry in the next decade. Zeitzle said BMW is strong enough 
``to stay competitive as its own supercompany in the next 10-20 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jac Nasser, who was at the auto show on his first work day as  
Ford's new president, declined to say which companies Ford might be 
courting. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is the industry is relatively small in a global  
sense, and there are always discussions going on with the different 
participants,'' Nasser said separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford regularly has discussions with other automakers over a  
variety of issues and joint projects. Ford and Nissan, for example, 
jointly produce minivans in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ford also has made it clear that it is willing to consider a  
larger partnership or merger if it makes economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are, but I don't want to overplay that,'' Nasser said. ``We  
see that as an opportunity but not a necessity for us. We're large 
enough that we have economies of scale, we have six brands that we 
believe still have significant global leverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford failed last year in a bid to buy troubled Kia Motors of  
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said Ford has two major assets that make it an attractive  
merger partner: a healthy balance sheet with lots of cash, and 
cultural diversity in its worldwide management ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an advantage for us. Culturally, we would probably be a  
good fit for many different cooperative partners,'' Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has repeatedly denied speculation that it's talking about  
a partnership with Ford or France's Renault SA. Nissan and 
DaimlerChrysler are discussing the sale of Nissan Diesel, a heavy 
truck business, to the German-American automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's second-largest automaker has lost money in six of the  
past seven years, making it ripe for acquisition.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Official Recalls Holocaust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- In August 1942, he tried to alert the West about  
the Nazi plan to annihilate Europe's Jews. No one responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than half a century later, Gerhart Riegner says the  
world is still unwilling to accept reports of brutality and mass 
killings. And worse, he says, the world is still reluctant to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``News of the extermination of Jews was so awful that people  
didn't believe it. Even people who did know were very reluctant to 
do anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same today,'' Riegner said, in reference to recent  
horrors like the 1994 genocide in Rwanda in which an estimated half 
million people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Riegner, 87, spoke to a small group of journalists recently  
about his newly published memoirs, which he wrote to show how 
difficult it was to get the public to accept the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	The 680-page book, ``Ne Jamais Desperer,'' (Never Give Up Hope),  
describes his life as a World Jewish Congress official, including 
the dispatch of the now-famous ``Riegner cable,'' which contained 
his early account of the systematic killing that became known as 
the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	He maintains that many of the 6 million Jews killed in Nazi  
concentration camps could have been saved if the United States and 
Britain had acted when he sounded the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there had been earlier reports of deportations and  
slayings of Jews, Riegner's telegram was the first authoritative 
word that the Nazis actually had a coordinated extermination plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never did I feel so strongly the sense of abandonment,  
powerlessness and loneliness as when I sent messages of disaster 
and horror to the free world and no one believed me,'' Riegner 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Born into an intellectual Jewish family in Germany, Riegner's  
first experience of anti-Semitism came at age 5, when another 
schoolboy called him a ``dirty little Jew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, in 1933, Nazi thugs stood outside his parent's  
Berlin house yelling ``Jews out! Jews out!'' while Riegner sat in 
the bath, frozen in terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Riegner, a trained lawyer, moved to Geneva and  
staffed the office of the newly founded World Jewish Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in neutral Switzerland during the war, with a ``rucksack  
filled with basics ready to flee into the mountains'' in case of 
German attack, a false Bolivian passport and an emergency visa for 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on July 29, 1942, Riegner received reliable intelligence  
from a top German industrialist about Hitler's plan to deport an 
estimated 4 million Jews to the East to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 8, 1942, Riegner gave the cable to U.S. representatives  
in Switzerland, with details of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Vice Consul Howard Elting immediately relayed the cable to  
Washington. But the State Department said it would not transmit 
telegrams from private sources and so refused Riegner's request to 
forward the news to World Jewish Congress President Stephen Wise -- 
a personal friend of then-President Franklin Roosevelt. Because of 
wartime restrictions, Riegner had no direct contact with the Jewish 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department checked with the Vatican and Red Cross, who  
conceded they were aware of deportations and maltreatment of Jews 
but not of a plan to annihilate them. 
</P>
<P>
	In his book, Riegner criticizes the silence of the Red Cross in  
the face of atrocities. While he praised the courage of Roman 
Catholic bishops and priests in some countries, he denounced the 
failure of the Vatican and the Catholic church in Germany to take a 
decisive stand against the persecution of the Jews throughout the 
Nazi era. 
</P>
<P>
	By the fall of 1942, graphic witness accounts from a variety of  
sources and British intelligence helped convince even the skeptics 
in the State Department about the horrible truth. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was only in January 1944 that Roosevelt created the War  
Refugee Board to try to save Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since my first telegram, 18 months had passed during which  
time the inexorable massacre continued and millions of Jews were 
sacrificed,'' Riegner wrote.

<HEADLINE> Congo Refugees Flood Across Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) -- Thousands of refugees  
from neighboring Congo have been flooding across the border into 
the Central African Republic to escape fighting in the region, 
immigration authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The influx comes amid warnings of rebel advances in northern  
Congo, close to the border with the Central African Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the refugees in the capital, Bangui, have been  
temporarily housed at police stations in the city, a U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congo's President Laurent Kabila has been battling a rebel  
movement since August. The rebels, with support from ethnic Tutsis 
and Rwanda and Uganda, had marched to the eastern outskirts of 
Congo's capital early on in their campaign, but were pushed back by 
Kabila's allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent fighting in Congo has been reported just across the  
border from the Central African Republic in the town of Zongo, a 
few miles south of Bangui. On Saturday, rebels said they had 
captured Zongo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congo, a government army spokesman on Monday announced plans  
to send more allied troops to the northern border region. Guy 
Kasongo denied reports that Zongo was in rebel control.

<HEADLINE> Black Farmers May Settle Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black farmers are close to an agreement with  
the Agriculture Department that could pay them $300 million or more 
to settle discrimination claims, a spokesman for farmers in the 
lawsuit said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- claiming years of discrimination through denial of  
farm loans, crop subsidies and other benefits -- was filed in 1997, 
shortly after the Agriculture Department admitted its own process 
of resolving discrimination complaints had been in disarray and had 
caused a huge backlog. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sincere willingness to get this done,'' Sam Taylor  
told The Associated Press. He said the deal was expected to be 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, farmers taking part in the lawsuit would  
get $50,000 tax-free payments from the government and any debts to 
the government would be erased, Taylor said. The average farmer's 
debt is between $75,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending upon how many farmers qualify, the settlement could  
cost the government as much as $375 million. The plaintiffs say 
they already have 1,000 names in the lawsuit and estimate that as 
many as 2,000 more farmers could join the settlement. The 
government has used lower estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	While not confirming an agreement, Tom Amontree, spokesman for  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, said, ``The president and 
secretary put a lot of time on this issue and it looks like all 
that hard work is paying off. We hope to have a settlement soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys on both sides are pushing to finalize the deal before  
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, who oversees the case, goes on a 
two-week vacation Wednesday, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 1. It covers claims  
from 1997 back to 1983, the year the Reagan administration 
disbanded the department's office of civil rights. The office was 
restored in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement being finalized has three options for farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	The majority of farmers are expected to take the first option  
which includes the $50,000 payment, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We surmise at least 85 to 95 percent of all claimants'' will  
take the first option because it has a lower standard of proof, 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second category is for farmers who have a better-documented  
case of discrimination and much higher damages, Taylor said. Those 
farmers would agree to have their cases settled by an independent 
arbitrator to be appointed by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The final category would be an ``opt out'' category for a small  
group of farmers who are party to the lawsuit but may be near 
independent settlements with the Agriculture Department. Officials 
have been unable to settle those cases while the lawsuit was 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending deal is significantly higher than the  
$15,000-per-farmer offer the agency made this summer, plaintiffs 
said. But it still is less than the $3 billion the farmers 
initially sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman gave the plaintiffs a significant victory in October  
when he agreed to certify them as a class. That same month, the 
department's inspector general complained that the agency's civil 
rights office remained in disarray with a significant backlog. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing in November, Friedman chastised attorneys over  
their inability to reach a settlement and questioned why the 
government, which had admitted discrimination, was unable to reach 
a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the secretary of agriculture is saying these things in good  
faith ... then why can't it get done? It has bothered me 
throughout,'' Friedman said at that time.

<HEADLINE> SunAmerica Finishes MBL Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Nearly $6 billion worth of life insurance  
and annuity businesses from the former Mutual Benefit Life 
Insurance Co. are now in the hands of SunAmerica Inc., a unit of 
American International Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	SunAmerica said Monday it has completed its $128 million cash  
acquisition of MBL Life Assurance Corp., the state-run successor to 
Mutual Benefit, a failed insurer based in Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale signals the impending end to New Jersey's seven-year  
supervision of Mutual Benefit's business. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual Benefit was the 18th-largest insurer in the United States  
when it collapsed in 1991. The 153-year-old company blamed failing 
real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The completion of our acquisition of the MBL Life businesses  
concludes the most successful life insurer rehabilitation in U.S. 
history,'' said SunAmerica chairman and chief executive officer Eli 
Broad. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale will enable the company to distribute about $818  
million to eligible policyholders and to general unsecured 
creditors of Mutual Benefit Life. Policyholders will be notified 
over the next three months of the amount of money they will 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale pleased Moody's Investors Service, which raised the  
financial strength ratings of SunAmerica's life insurance companies 
to Aaa, the best mark, from A2. It also upgraded SunAmerica's 
senior debt rating to Aaa from Baa1.

<HEADLINE> Stocks in 1999? Nobody Knows / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It seems everyone is telling us what happened in  
the old year and what to expect in the new, but the truth is that 
nobody fully understands what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
	How can they, when the stock with the biggest gain last year  
(Amazon.com Inc.) never earned a dime in its life, and when a 
roundtrip European holiday can cost less than the bill for a 
half-dozen designer ties at a classy shop? 
</P>
<P>
	When two Nobel laureates in economics, specialists on  
investments, belonged to a group (Long-Term Capital Management LP) 
whose investment losses late last year threatened the financial 
community with chaos? 
</P>
<P>
	When people pay megabucks for a watch instead of looking at the  
clock in the bank window, and sports magnates pay $10 million to 
the hired help and then beg municipalities to build them a playing 
field? 
</P>
<P>
	And when many of the world's biggest and best companies seek  
security in mergers while knowing that corporate marriages often 
fail; and when the best economic minds discover the enemy isn't 
inflation but deflation? 
</P>
<P>
	You can go on like this through a long list of impenetrable  
mysteries and never even touch on politics, which creates and 
perpetuates the most mind-boggling and strangest mysteries of all. 
</P>
<P>
	This urge to foretell reaches a crescendo near the end and  
beginning of each year, and it matters not a whit if a forecaster 
misses the mark by a mile, he or she is called an expert and asked 
to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems not to matter either that in stock market forecasting,  
for example, the consensus forecast is often closest to the correct 
figure, which means that almost all the contestants were wrong to 
some degree. 
</P>
<P>
	At its most harmless, forecasting is but another game we play.  
But it also can be serious business. If, perhaps by chance, a 
forecaster hits the mark, it becomes part of his resume, and you'll 
be reminded of it forever. 
</P>
<P>
	The lucky individual might even leverage into a higher-paying  
position because of the new reputation, one that might bring honor, 
customers and prestige to his new employer, and lots of interviews 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	The wiliest of forecasters, if they can, speak largely in great  
generalities that can be variously interpreted. And of course they 
rely on contingencies, such as ``if on the other hand,'' to avoid 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	You might never hear of the smartest forecasters, many in  
competitive industries where insight into the future might be 
measured in dollars and conceivably in survival. They are the 
unsung heroes -- or goats. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether you hear of them or not, or whether they are more  
often right than wrong, forecasters make up a very necessary 
fraternity in a multibillion-dollar business, that business being 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Business lives more in the future than in the present or past.  
In a sense, you might even say the present belongs to the past, 
since all the decisions were made back then, leaving only the 
execution for the present. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, game or business, it will never stop. Plans are being  
made right now for the biggest parties ever at the coming 
millennium, despite forecasts of computer failures that will abort 
the best laid plans.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Leader Unveils New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- President B.J. Habibie Tuesday  
unveiled a new state budget for Indonesia that indicates a decrease 
in government spending but still requires huge injections of 
foreign assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new fiscal plan, government spending will drop 17  
percent to $27.8 billion. Much of the money will go to subsidies on 
fuel, electricity, rice and medicine as well as programs to help 
the huge numbers of poor in the Southeast Asian nation of 210 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is aware that Indonesia's economy has not yet  
recovered,'' Habibie said in a nationally televised speech. ``It is 
still far from a normal condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has fashioned a  
multibillion-dollar bailout plan for Indonesia, which was pummeled 
by the currency turmoil that hit Asia in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of Indonesians lost their jobs and slipped into poverty  
and inflation soared nearly 80 percent last year. The economic 
turmoil reversed years of steady growth and set off riots that 
helped oust President Suharto in May after 32 years of 
authoritarian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The country is still burdened with high interests rates,  
sluggish exports and a corporate foreign debt of $80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing rows of legislators at Parliament, Habibie also  
warned that frequent riots and protests in recent months were 
endangering political reforms in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is even close to anarchy, not democracy,'' he said  
solemnly. ``It is the deterioration of the people's sovereignty and 
a violation of the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 14 people died in anti-military riots this past weekend  
in Aceh province and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, 
where separatist guerrillas operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic and religious tensions have also led to violence and  
Habibie is expected to face a resurgence of student protests after 
the Islamic holy month of Ramadan ends Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The same students who contributed to Suharto's downfall accuse  
his successor and former protege, Habibie, of moving too slowly on 
reforms. They also want Suharto to be put on trial on corruption 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie said the government had prepared election laws and would  
hold national elections on June 7 as planned, despite fears of 
clashes between rival political forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's political uncertainty has kept many foreign  
investors on the sidelines, but the worst of the crisis that shrank 
the economy by 14 percent in 1998 appears to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie said there will be zero growth while inflation is  
expected to be 17 percent in the fiscal year that ends March 31, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia had to revise last year's budget three times because  
of the recession and the volatility of the rupiah. 
</P>
<P>
	The new budget was based on an exchange rate of 7,500 rupiah to  
the dollar. The rupiah, which sank as low as 17,000 a year ago, was 
trading at 7,850 on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Proposal Concerns Catholic Colleges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Some of the nation's 236 Catholic universities and  
colleges fear a proposal to give the Vatican tighter control over 
their operations would erode academic standards and their national 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the change to church control were proposed in  
November at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The bishops 
gave schools until May to comment before a final vote later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would require presidents of Catholic colleges to take  
an oath of fidelity to the church and force theologians to get 
permission to teach from local bishops. The universities also would 
be urged to recruit ``faithful Catholics'' for their faculties and 
boards of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an attempt to clarify the meaning of Catholic, when you  
use that as an adjective before your institution,'' the Rev. 
Terrence Toland said Monday. Toland headed the committee that 
drafted the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including some college presidents, say the proposal  
could hurt faculty recruitment, prompt lawsuits over hiring and 
free-speech issues, and threaten federal funding for student loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of thing that will just scare the pants off  
faculty in any Catholic university because it just sounds like the 
church officials are going to come in and police the university 
without any respect for academic freedom,'' said Thomas J. Reese, 
editor of America, a weekly Jesuit magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the Vatican released a document containing guidelines  
for maintaining the religious identities of Catholic universities. 
U.S. bishops agreed on details for implementation in late 1996, but 
the Vatican rejected them, demanding tighter language to guarantee 
the bishops' control. 
</P>
<P>
	The bishops say the stricter proposal isn't final, but it is  
raising serious concerns. Some fear the plan also could cost 
schools in government aid. 
</P>
<P>
	If a Catholic school is controlled by a bishop -- rather than by  
a board of lay trustees -- it would be classified as a religious 
institution, making it ineligible for millions of dollars worth of 
government funding, including financial aid packages for students. 
</P>
<P>
	The universities say the dispute isn't about maintaining their  
Catholic identities and their ties with the church, two objectives 
they share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want these places to be as effectively Catholic as the  
bishops do,'' said Charles Currie, president of the 28-member 
Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. ``We simply want 
to do it in a way which we think is appropriate within American 
higher education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University officials said Monday they are hopeful the draft  
proposal will be substantially changed by the time the bishops vote 
on it at their annual meeting in November 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But, if the current version were to pass, Reese predicted, some  
institutions might become nonsectarian. Even more likely, bishops 
might be taken to court by academics suing over tenure and hiring 
decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If bishops stick their noses into this business,'' Reese said,  
``they're going to get into trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Split Over More World Cups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The biggest names in soccer are split over a  
surprise proposal to stage the World Cup every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	While UEFA, the sport's European federation, is against the  
idea, superstar Ronaldo of Brazil likes it. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as they have been many times on the field and at the  
boardroom table, former stars Franz Beckenbauer and Bobby Charlton 
are on opposite sides once again. 
</P>
<P>
	Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, soccer's international  
body, wants the World Cup played every two years instead of four 
starting in 2008, with a special tournament in 2004 to commemorate 
the federation's 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	That game would clash with the European Championships, and UEFA  
president Lennart Johansson -- defeated by Blatter for the FIFA 
presidency last June -- said that was ``totally unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronaldo, whose last World Cup appearance was a disastrous one in  
a 3-0 loss to France in the final in July, is anxious to make up 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be best to do it right away, in two years. That way  
we could forget France 98,'' the Inter Milan striker said. ``The 
World Cup is the best soccer competition and players concentrate 
more than on other occasions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next World Cup is scheduled for 2002 in Japan and South  
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckenbauer, the president of German club Bayern Munich, and  
Italian national coach Dino Zoff also favor Blatter's idea, while 
Charlton, a former England star, says it would be a ``sad'' move 
and Juventus coach Marcello Lippi voices reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	The main fallout from Blatter's proposal, made in an interview  
with a Swiss newspaper, could be a major club-vs.-country power 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	UEFA's decision to beef up its Champions Cup to head off the  
establishment of a breakaway European Super League has placed more 
emphasis on club soccer. Blatter's counterattack would help 
national teams by bringing the World Cup around more often. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal could also have an impact on the Olympics. FIFA and  
the International Olympic Committee are at odds over the format of 
the Olympic soccer tournament, which, with a few exceptions, is 
limited to players 23 years and younger. 
</P>
<P>
	If the World Cup is held every two years, soccer might drop out  
of the Olympics altogether. FIFA already is under the threat of 
expulsion from the games because of its refusal to adopt the IOC's 
doping rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckenbauer and Charlton have been opponents on the field in two  
World Cups and now lead rival bids for the World Cup in 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good idea, certainly worth discussing,'' Beckenbauer  
said of Blatter's plan. ``The national teams have reduced their own 
worth through the impossible qualification method. That means an 
inflation of games against second- and third-class opponents. And 
no one wants to see them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fan wants to see the top games, Germany against Brazil or  
Italy against France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton believes the World Cup would be devalued if it's played  
more often. 
</P>
<P>
	``My own personal feeling is that every four years is often  
enough because it's something to look forward to,'' the former 
Manchester United star said. ``You have to wait for it and it 
increases the whole value of it. I just hope it's not based on 
finance. My own feeling is that it wouldn't have the same 
attraction, and that would be very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zoff, captain of Italy's last World Cup winner in 1982, said  
FIFA could find room in the calendar for a competition every two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be fine with me,'' the former Juventus goalkeeper  
said. ``The problems will be resolved and the space will be 
found.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lippi, widely considered to be a national coach of the future,  
wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blatter's proposal is interesting, but which competition would  
be sacrificed to make the World Cup every two years?'' he said. 
``What would be the fate of the Olympics and the European 
Championships? Put as it is, the doubling of the World Cup would do 
nothing but crowd even more a (calendar) that is already very 
intense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter's proposal also is likely to bring opposition from  
within FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel D'Hooghe, chairman of the federation's medical committee,  
has campaigned to limit the number of games to avoid stress and 
injuries. He opposed adding more Euro and World Club championship 
games and believed a World Cup every two years would make things 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really make that much sense. Besides we will  
devalue our own prime product,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> `Patch Adams' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Robin Williams film ``Patch Adams'' led a  
North American box office that lost substantial business because of 
blizzards in the Midwest, final figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though critically panned, ``Patch Adams'' grossed $19.1 million  
to maintain the top spot for a second weekend and give struggling 
Universal Studios a major holiday boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the snowbound box office was down about 5 percent from  
the same weekend last year. Attendance dropped from Friday to 
Saturday; usually there's an increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a number of 1998 movies continued to do strong business  
in wide release, while such Oscar entries as ``Shakespeare in 
Love,'' ``Affliction,'' ``Waking Ned Devine'' and ``The Thin Red 
Line'' attracted large crowds on fewer screens. 
</P>
<P>
	The major studios didn't release any new films last weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	The dying mother drama ``Stepmom,'' with Susan Sarandon and  
Julia Roberts, finished second with $14.6 million, ahead of the 
romantic comedy ``You've Got Mail'' with $14.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Prince of Egypt'' was fourth with $11.2 million while  
another animated feature, ``A Bug's Life,'' was fifth with $8.8 
million, losing only 16 percent of its audience in the seventh 
week. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> QB Tee Martin Leads Vols To Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Peyton Manning set all the records. Tee  
Martin got a national title by completing a perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who spent the previous two seasons in the shadow of top  
NFL draft pick Manning, was the star Monday night as No. 1 
Tennessee defeated Florida State 23-16 in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great, it feels great,'' Martin said in the middle of  
a wild celebration at midfield. ``We had to prove to everybody we 
were the No. 1 team in the nation. All the adversity we faced -- all 
the guys that went to the NFL last year, all the shoes we had to 
fill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a chip on our shoulders,'' Martin said of the Vols'  
underdog status for the game despite being the nation's top-ranked 
team. ``We won all our games, we were 12-0, and we still didn't get 
our respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who was 11-of-18 for 278 yards, had touchdown passes of  
79 yards to Peerless Price and 4 yards to Shawn Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played an outstanding game,'' Tennessee coach Phillip  
Fulmer said. ``He knows how to manage a game. He gives you a threat 
as a runner, he's very difficult to defend. As the season has gone 
along, he's gotten better and better. I would not trade Tee Martin 
for anyone in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin had thrown just 16 passes in his first two seasons at  
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like we didn't exist at the university for a couple of  
years,'' the junior said last week, recalling how tough it was to 
be in Manning's shadow for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But patience is something Martin learned during a tough  
childhood in which he changed addresses 22 times and lost a dozen 
friends to violence or illness. His Volunteers teammates marvel at 
how he always remains calm under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell by each guy's personality what his childhood was  
like,'' Tennessee linebacker Al Wilson said. ``I've never seen Tee 
Martin nervous, and I think that's one of his biggest attributes. 
He's always relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was shuttled between his mother, grandmother and  
great-grandmother as a child, learning to adapt quickly to changing 
situations. The loss of so many friends caused him to develop a 
cool detachment that keeps him calm on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an attitude served him well Monday night against the best  
pass defense in the country this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His first scoring pass, in the second period to Bryson, was set  
up by a 76-yard bomb to Price. His second TD toss, in the fourth 
quarter, was another long heave to Price. 
</P>
<P>
	And Martin, despite taking a hit in the third quarter that still  
left him woozy after the game, stayed calm in the closing minutes 
as Tennessee struggled to hold on to a 23-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	On a fourth-and-1 play deep in Florida State territory, he  
completed a swing pass to Bryson to keep the drive alive and run 
more time off the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised to get a pass called when it was fourth and  
that close,'' he said. ``He was so wide open, I just had to make 
sure I didn't overthrow him or underthrow him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who completed an NCAA-record 24 consecutive passes in a  
two-game span this season against Alabama and South Carolina, has 
accounted for 28 touchdowns this season -- 21 through the air and 
seven on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	And he has done it all with barely a touch of nervousness.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't get butterflies,'' he said. ``I'm just ready to  
play on game day. I know how to adjust my attitude before a game.''

<HEADLINE> Championships Anger Buckeye Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Its 11-1 season complete, Ohio State  
waited to learn how much one misstep will cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fiesta Bowl showdown between No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2  
Florida State will decide the national champion in the ESPN/USA 
Today coaches poll. The Associated Press will announce its champion 
after the game and its 70 voters may select any team they want. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State coach John Cooper was angry Monday about the  
coronation of the Fiesta Bowl winner as part of the Bowl 
Championship Series arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's the case, it sounds like they might as well not even  
watch the game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes battled through weather and stranded travelers to  
get home from their 24-14 Sugar Bowl victory over Texas A&AMP;M and 
find prime viewing spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said he knew for sure that he would put Ohio State No. 2  
on his final ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you follow the same logic that's been followed all year  
long, we can't be any worse than No. 2,'' he said. ``I mean, you 
lose late in the year, you drop down, don't you? We lost after 
Florida State lost, so that's the logic everybody uses: if you lose 
a game, you can't lose late in the year. So I don't see us being 
any worse than No. 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said he felt his team staked a claim to being labeled the  
best team in the nation when it rolled to a 21-7 lead in the first 
half of Friday's Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we played a heck of a ballgame. I thought we pretty  
much dominated that team, to be honest with you,'' he said. ``In 
the first half we missed a couple more scoring opportunities. In 
the second half, their defense played a little better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes were outscored 7-3 in the last three quarters,  
coming up short on the landslide performance they most likely 
needed to leave a lasting impression with poll voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said there is only one way to settle who is truly No. 1 --  
a one-game playoff after the bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's an argument over who's No. 1 in the country after  
tonight, it ought to be settled on the field,'' he said. ``Two 
years ago, it would have been us and Florida. Last year it would 
have been Michigan and Nebraska. If Tennessee wins tonight, maybe 
it's a clear-cut champion. But if Florida State wins tonight, 
there's going to be a lot of people saying, `How come Ohio State 
doesn't have a shot at it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona (12-1), Wisconsin (11-1) and Tulane (12-0) all could  
argue that they have as much right to be in a college version of 
the Super Bowl as Ohio State. And what about Florida (10-2), whose 
only losses came to the Fiesta Bowl opponents that almost everybody 
considers the top two teams left standing? 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said even if the Buckeyes had sneaked into the Fiesta  
Bowl and beat Tennessee, he still would favor playing one more game 
to decide the national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been for a playoff ever since I've been a head football  
coach,'' he said. ``I'm not just saying that just because it 
affects us in this situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are many who say that the vagueness of the current  
situation is actually an endearing trait, that the 
discussion/argument over who is truly the best team in the country 
adds spice to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cooper thinks that's faulty thinking.  
</P>
<P>
	``After tonight, college football is over,'' he said. ``The pros  
will go right on through the Super Bowl. I think we're leaving a 
lot on the table by not having a one-game playoff after it's 
over.''

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry Seen Slowing in '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A slightly slower economy and less money for  
incentives will likely send vehicle sales lower in 1999, economists 
for three of the largest automakers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing in their forecasts, however, pointed to a recession or  
deep dip in the number of customers looking to buy a new car or 
truck, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the economic health of the consumer, it's very  
good,'' said Martin Zimmerman, executive director of corporate 
economics for Ford Motor Co. ``Confidence is high, and even though 
it's down slightly in the past few months, it's still strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmerman, G. Mustafa Mohatarem of General Motors Corp. and W.  
Van Bussmann of DaimlerChrysler AG estimated that automakers sold 
about 15.5 million cars and light trucks last year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's higher than earlier estimates, and the three economists  
offered two reasons: Interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve kept 
car loans cheap, and an incentive war in the second half speeded up 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Bussmann said incentives on new vehicles were averaging $1,020  
for the first half of 1998. But in the second half, General Motors 
increased its incentives to lure buyers back after two crippling 
strikes. Other automakers followed to some degree, raising the 
average incentive by $466. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incentive levels probably won't continue to rise, unless  
people get crazy,'' Bussmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three economists expect next year's light vehicle sales to  
total between 14.7 million and 15.2 million, assuming nothing 
serious rattles the U.S. economy. If the predictions come true, it 
could be the fifth consecutive year of sales over 15 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be an average year following a very good year,''  
Bussman said.

<HEADLINE> Walgreen 1Q Sales Rise 19.5 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Walgreen Co., the nation's largest drug  
store chain, reported record sales and earnings Monday, attributing 
the gains to strong pharmacy sales and controls on operating 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the three months that ended Nov. 30 were $104  
million, or 21 cents per share, up 19.5 percent from $87 million, 
or 18 cents a share, during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the period, its fiscal first quarter, totaled $4  
billion, a 15 percent increase from $3.4 billion in the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., said same-store sales were  
up 10.4 percent in the quarter. Prescriptions, which accounted for 
52.6 percent of company sales in the quarter, were up 22.8 percent 
overall, and 18.9 percent higher on a same-store basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
strength. They exclude the results of newer stores, where sales 
tend to be unusually high. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Executive Officer Daniel Jorndt said in addition to robust  
pharmacy sales, general and administrative costs dropped and the 
company kept payroll and advertising costs under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreen opened 97 drugstores in the quarter, with the pace  
expected to continue through the year, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company operated 2,626 stores in 36 states and Puerto Rico  
last year, compared to 2,403 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street was unmoved by the strong report. Shares of Walgreen  
fell $1.68 3/4 to close at $56.87 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Few Precedents for Senate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate trial of President Clinton, with the  
chief justice presiding, would bring about a rare convergence of 
the top tiers of the three branches of government -- a proceeding 
envisioned by the Founding Fathers but never before used for an 
elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after 55 Republican and 45 Democratic senators arrive on  
Capitol Hill this week for the start of the new Congress, they are 
expected to take an oath as jurors in the nation's second 
impeachment trial of a president. 
</P>
<P>
	The first, in 1868, was for Andrew Johnson, the vice president  
who succeeded Abraham Lincoln after Lincoln's assassination. The 
impeachment arose primarily from political divisions over 
Reconstruction after the Civil War. Senators took 74 days to acquit 
Johnson by a one-vote margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast forward to Dec. 19, when a rancorous House vote resulted in  
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice against the nation's 
42nd president. The impeachment articles, similar to an indictment, 
related to Clinton's efforts to conceal his affair with former 
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes the trial -- and new territory for the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	With a two-thirds vote for conviction appearing unlikely,  
leaders could broker a compromise to bring a quick end to a trial 
and allow senators to consider an alternative punishment, such as 
censure. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., last week proposed holding  
an early vote -- perhaps next week -- that would require a two-thirds 
majority to proceed with a full trial, opening the door to censure 
if the vote failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some conservatives oppose such a plan, which is generally  
endorsed by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also has said he believes a trial could be held without  
witnesses. House managers -- members of the House acting as 
prosecutors -- say they want to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few precedents to follow. The House has voted articles  
of impeachment in only 15 cases -- against Johnson, the only 
president; a Supreme Court justice; a secretary of war; a senator 
and 11 federal judges. The Senate has convicted seven officials, 
all judges. Six other officials were acquitted and two resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	President Nixon resigned in 1974 before an impeachment vote in  
the House on proposed charges of obstruction of justice, abuse of 
his presidential powers and contempt of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	What would a Senate impeachment trial be like? The Constitution  
and internal Senate rules govern the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist would preside over a  
presidential trial. Managers from the House would present the case 
before the senators. In Clinton's case, the House has approved 13 
managers, all Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, led by 
Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Senate organizes to consider the articles, it issues a  
writ of summons to the president, setting a date for him to appear 
and answer the charges. But instead of appearing in person, the 
president can be represented by his legal team -- for this 
appearance and throughout the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Senate may issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents  
or appoint a committee to receive evidence and take testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, at any point, a majority of senators could vote to end the  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators would hear one opening statement from the House  
managers and one from the president's counsel. Each statement is 
limited to one hour. Each side may call witnesses to question under 
oath. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist has authority to rule on all questions of evidence.  
But he can put any such question to a vote before the Senate. Or 
any senator can ask for a formal vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate conducts the trial in open session, according to its  
rules. Senators also may hold their deliberations in a public 
session. But the internal rules allow the Senate to close its doors 
during deliberations, allotting each senator 15 minutes of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Transcripts are kept of all impeachment trial activities, even  
secret deliberations. At the end, senators may vote to release 
transcripts of any confidential sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators vote in open session on each article. The chief justice  
calls the names of each senator alphabetically. Each senator stands 
to respond ``guilty'' or ``not guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A conviction requires a two-thirds majority of the senators  
present. If convicted on any article, the president is removed from 
office immediately.

<HEADLINE> Fitness Gurus Still Crave Junk Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When you're Richard Simmons, satisfying your  
junk food craving can require going undercover. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terrible because where can Richard Simmons go to get  
pizza?'' the fitness guru said in Monday's USA Today. ``There's a 
Domino's about four blocks from my house, so I lower my voice and 
say, `Hi, this is Mr. Reveles, and I'd like to get a pizza.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Television fitness expert Denise Austin and aerobics video star  
Donna Richardson also came clean about their junk food habits. The 
two admitted they crave Krispy Kreme doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just melt in your mouth,'' Austin said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I eat well 80 percent of the time and eat junk the other 20  
percent of the time,'' she said. ``I work out, and that keeps my 
metabolism up. ... I don't do 20 more minutes of exercise because I 
ate one doughnut.''

<HEADLINE>  NBA Owners Reject Players' Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBA owners turned down the union's latest offer  
Monday. The players vote next. 
</P>
<P>
	In a day of fast-moving developments in the NBA lockout, the  
stage was set for a dramatic countdown to Thursday's deadline for 
scrapping the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' commissioner David Stern  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't rule it out, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Nine owners on the labor relations committee unanimously  
rejected the union's proposal and recommended scrapping the rest of 
the 1998-99 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting open to all 400 players will be held Wednesday in New  
York, and a vote will be taken on the owners' final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's 19-player negotiating committee will recommend that  
the offer be rejected ``to assure that the owners understand the 
level of player resolve and the degree of opposition to the NBA's 
onerous demands,'' union director Billy Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	News of an upcoming player vote came as a surprise, since the  
union had insisted it would not present any proposal for a vote 
unless its negotiating committee recommended it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they elect to go against the recommendation, then we'll  
have to live with that,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern had been calling for a player vote for more than a week.  
</P>
<P>
	``The majority has a right to control the destiny of an  
organization, and that's between them and their leadership,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing delivered the proposal  
to Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik at a hotel across the 
street from NBA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Stern: ``I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours.  
Instead, I saw one that went backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Granik: ``Based upon how far apart we are, there's a lot  
more needed to be done than simply tweaking the offers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Granik also said the owners' negotiating committee  
would meet in New York, perhaps Wednesday night. But it is 
uncertain if there will be a meeting with the players' committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait and see what they're going to do,'' Ewing said.  
``It's all a waiting game right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If no deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors -- with  
one ownership representative from each of the 29 teams -- could vote 
Thursday to scrap the rest of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned and see on Thursday how close we are,'' Stern said.  
``In order to see who's more accurate in his depiction of where we 
are, we're going to have to lose a season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA, which was supposed to begin its season Nov. 3, had  
never lost a game to labor strife until this season. So far, the 
first two months of the season have been wiped out. It would take 
three to four weeks after a settlement to begin a season of 45 to 
50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' Stern said, opening the  
door for the first time to using replacement players in the 
1999-2000 season. ``It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on, 
but obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we'll rebuild the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said if a new league was formed, it would probably take  
the top 100 players and leave the rest -- the middle-class that the 
union has said it is fighting for -- out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	The union presented its offer at an hour-long meeting that  
represented the first face-to-face talks between the sides since 
Dec. 27. That's when they met for five hours near Denver and the 
league made its ``final'' offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has told all 19 players on its negotiating committee  
to be in New York by Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Williams of the Knicks, a member of the union's executive  
committee, thinks the deadline might be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a deal was done on the 9th or 10th, I'm sure David wouldn't  
say that just because we didn't do it on 7th the season is over. 
It's a business, and sometimes you have to posture,'' Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's new offer included a limit on how much any player  
can earn. If accepted, the NBA would be the only professional 
sports league to limit the amount of money a top athlete is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The key sticking point could center on how much revenue will be  
paid to the players during the six-year deal. The sides also differ 
on the length and terms of a new rookie salary scale and the dollar 
value of two salary cap exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the union wants 55 percent of revenue devoted  
to salaries in the fourth year, while owners have offered 53 
percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners 
are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- 
the amount they received last season -- while the league is offering 
54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft,  
signed with Kinder Bologna of the Italian League for $3 million. 
The 7-foot-1 center can return to the NBA on Feb. 15 if the lockout 
is lifted and still would receive $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Woods, the agent for Toronto's Kevin Willis, refiled an  
unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations 
Board against the union for allegedly breaching its duty of fair 
representation.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Owners Reject Players' Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBA owners turned down the union's latest offer  
Monday. The players vote next. 
</P>
<P>
	In a day of fast-moving developments in the NBA lockout, the  
stage was set for a dramatic countdown to Thursday's deadline for 
scrapping the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate making a deal,'' commissioner David Stern  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't rule it out, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Nine owners on the labor relations committee unanimously  
rejected the union's proposal and recommended scrapping the rest of 
the 1998-99 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting open to all 400 players will be held Wednesday in New  
York, and a vote will be taken on the owners' final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's 19-player negotiating committee will recommend that  
the offer be rejected ``to assure that the owners understand the 
level of player resolve and the degree of opposition to the NBA's 
onerous demands,'' union director Billy Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	News of an upcoming player vote came as a surprise, since the  
union had insisted it would not present any proposal for a vote 
unless its negotiating committee recommended it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they elect to go against the recommendation, then we'll  
have to live with that,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern had been calling for a player vote for more than a week.  
</P>
<P>
	``The majority has a right to control the destiny of an  
organization, and that's between them and their leadership,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing delivered the proposal  
to Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik at a hotel across the 
street from NBA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Stern: ``I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours.  
Instead, I saw one that went backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Granik: ``Based upon how far apart we are, there's a lot  
more needed to be done than simply tweaking the offers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Granik also said the owners' negotiating committee

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Coach Meets Upset Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas coach Chan Gailey still hasn't seen  
the tapes of the Arizona NFC wild-card ambush. He's been busy 
interviewing players trying to figure out what went wrong in the 
shocking 20-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met with each player for 10 or 15 minutes,'' Gailey said  
Monday. ``I got the sense of a big disappointment and they were 
still hurting. But there was guarded enthusiasm and anticipation 
for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFC East division champion produced a 10-6 record in  
Gailey's first season as coach, but lost to an Arizona team it had 
beaten twice in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said he awoke Sunday morning after the loss feeling as  
down as a coach can be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a sickening feeling and it sticks with you awhile,''  
Gailey said. ``You can't believe the season is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said in the next couple of months he will break down the  
Dallas offense and try to determine what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every problem we have is correctable,'' Gailey said. ``I'm  
very encouraged about next year and what I think we can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most discouraging part of the loss was the breakdown of the  
Dallas offense. Gailey, a former offensive coordinator from 
Pittsburgh, was hired for his ball-moving expertise after owner 
Jerry Jones gave Barry Switzer the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to evaluate the offense in the offseason and find  
out what happened exactly,'' Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Troy Aikman threw three interceptions and was sacked  
four times. Dallas abandoned the run in the second half after 
Emmitt Smith rushed for 74 yards in the first half as the Cowboys 
trailed 10-0. Dallas ran the ball only four times in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our execution was not there,'' Gailey said. ``We had some  
tough injuries to (wide receiver) Ernie Mills and (running back) 
Chris Warren but that's part of life and you have to adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said he talked to cornerback Deion Sanders, who  
criticized his team and said ``big-time players should step up in 
big-time games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Deion was just disappointed the team didn't win,'' Gailey  
said. ``Any time you don't win it hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said the players should be better adapted to his system  
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'll feel more at ease with our situation and have a  
much better idea of our needs,'' Gailey said. ``Everything should 
work a lot smoother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones gave Gailey a big vote of confidence, saying ``He will be  
one of the outstanding coaches in the NFL. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Gailey should ``have a longtime future'' with the  
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones admitted he was ``very surprised and disappointed'' by the  
shocking loss to the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no balance, no points on the board,'' Jones said.  
``That was a surprise. We should have been better at moving the 
ball. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones shrugged off claims the Cowboys are getting old, saying,  
``There are 12 teams in the NFL older than we are. I feel very good 
about the team we can put together for next year. ... We have a 
plan in place. We can't stand pat. We must improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys will only have about $6 million or so to play with  
under the new salary cap. They have 13 free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones wouldn't discuss personnel moves. The Cowboys have to come  
with five names for the new Cleveland franchise to pick over on 
Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of time to think about all of this,'' said  
fullback Daryl Johnston. ``With the extra time to work on the 
nuances of the offense, hopefully we can only get better next 
year.''

<HEADLINE> Some Satellite TVs Loose CBS, Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court in Miami has issued an order  
that would cut off certain satellite TV customers across the 
country from receiving CBS and Fox programs via satellite by April 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	The permanent injunction obtained by the networks would affect  
satellite customers who signed up to receive CBS and Fox signals 
before March 11, 1997, said Dennis Wharton, spokesman for the 
National Association of Broadcasters, which hailed the Dec. 30 
order in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Lenore Nesbitt of the U.S. Southern District Court of  
Florida has already issued a preliminary injunction to disconnect 
satellite customers nationwide from CBS and Fox signals by Feb. 28. 
But that order, which affects up to 1 million viewers, covered 
customers who signed up for the service between March 11, 1997, and 
July 10, 1998. The Feb. 28 deadline for this injunction still 
applies, Wharton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wharton estimated that the new injunction would affect an  
additional ``tens of thousands'' of satellite customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the first injunction, the new one is against PrimeTime 24,  
a leading distributor of programming to major satellite providers 
such as DirecTV and EchoStar, for violating copyright law. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress hopes to pass legislation this year that would make it  
easier for satellite customers to legally obtain network programs 
on their satellite systems.

<HEADLINE> Woodson Wins Defensive Rookie Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From Heisman Trophy to Defensive Rookie of the Year. Not a bad  
parlay for Charles Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland Raiders cornerback won a close race with Green Bay  
defensive end Vonnie Holliday in balloting by The Associated Press, 
announced today. Woodson, the fourth overall choice in the 1998 
draft, received 24 votes from the nationwide panel of 47 sports 
writers and broadcasters. Holliday, selected 19th overall, received 
22, and Arizona end Andre Wadsworth, the third pick last April, got 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson, the first primarily defensive player to win the  
Heisman, was a starter from the first day of training camp for the 
Raiders. His tight coverage and sure tackling helped turn around 
Oakland's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd give myself a B-minus,'' Woodson said. ``I played pretty  
good, but I didn't do a lot of the little things I could have done, 
as far as watching more film, doing a lot more studying. I pretty 
much played off athletic ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ability helped Woodson get a team-high five interceptions,  
tied with veteran Eric Allen; he ran one 46 yards for a touchdown. 
He did not return kickoffs or punts, as he did at Michigan, and did 
not take a snap on offense, which irked Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it known I wanted to play offense and it never  
happened,'' he said. ``I like being out there on the field. I don't 
like to come off. When I'm on the sideline, I kind of feel 
helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jon Gruden has promised Woodson will be used offensively  
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can give either phase of your football team a jolt,''  
Gruden said. ``When he gets his hands on the ball, he knows where 
to go and how to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holliday, who played at North Carolina, also became an immediate  
starter with the Packers. Under the tutelage of star end Reggie 
White, Holliday flourished quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	He had eight sacks when he broke his right leg near the ankle on  
Nov. 22 at Minnesota and missed the last five games. That might 
have cost him the rookie award. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd always be out there,'' Holliday said. ``Almost  
to the point where I felt I was invincible, things were going so 
well, and you know I felt I had a great chance to break the rookie 
sacks record and I guess be more of an impact player my rookie 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White has advised Holliday not to get too frustrated over the  
missed time, and to look to the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid's going to be great. I'm glad I came back this year  
and got a chance to work with him,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell him what you think he needs to work on and he  
just does it,'' added All-Pro safety LeRoy Butler. ``Usually 
first-round picks think they know it all, i.e. Terrell Buckley, you 
know? This guy here says, well what do I need to work on?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson is the first Raider to win the award. Last year's winner  
was Baltimore linebacker Peter Boulware.

<HEADLINE> Woman Nearly Drowns in NY Apartment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Flooding caused by torrential rain rose so fast  
that Donna Harvey couldn't get out of her basement apartment, and 
she almost ran out of air. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harvey awakened around noon Sunday and found her bed was  
sitting in a pool of water. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time she got to the door, the water had risen to within 6  
inches of the ceiling, the Daily News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	She screamed for help but the pressure of all that water made it  
impossible for neighbors to open her door. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was keeping my head above water by holding onto the top of  
the door frame,'' Ms. Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters who had been responding to flood emergencies  
throughout the Springfield Gardens neighborhood of Queens rescued 
Ms. Harvey by smashing her door down with axes and crowbars. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was right there and she was up to her neck in water,''  
said Fire Department spokesman Brian Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall Sunday totaled 2.42 inches, a record for the date. The  
rain, part of the same storm that buried the Midwest in snow, also 
forced police to temporarily close sections of major highways 
around the New York area.

<HEADLINE>  Ventura Sworn In As Minn. Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Former professional wrestler Jesse  
Ventura took the oath of office Monday as Minnesota's 37th governor 
after a two-month honeymoon as the country's most unlikely 
political star. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 11-minute inaugural speech, Ventura sought to reassure  
Minnesotans that they didn't make a mistake in electing a bald, 
boisterous radio host, former Navy SEAL and actor known as ``The 
Body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we move forward to do Minnesota's business and we will do  
it to the best of our ability,'' Ventura said to about 800 people 
watching in the Capitol rotunda. He then added the Navy cheer 
``Hooyah!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executives also were sworn in Monday in Arizona,  
California, Idaho, Nevada, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of them had generated as much attention or amazement as  
Ventura, the Reform Party candidate who got 37 percent of the vote 
in November, good enough to stun two political veterans, Republican 
Norm Coleman and Democrat Hubert Humphrey III. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did through the campaign, Ventura spoke mostly without  
notes -- from the ``heart and soul,'' as he described it, with 
people standing three and four deep on two balconies overlooking 
the rotunda floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not changing,'' Ventura said.  
</P>
<P>
	He doled out thank-yous and talked about his hopes but did not  
touch on any plans he might have for tax relief, a central theme of 
his campaign. He did reach out to the young, disenchanted voters 
who provided much of his support at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must put down the partisan party politics and look at the  
bigger picture,'' he said. ``We must not fail because if we do, we 
can lose this generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, 47, replaced Republican Gov. Arne Carlson, a 30-year  
public servant who was state auditor before becoming governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura became the 37th person to hold the office of governor.  
Rudy Perpich was elected governor to non-consecutive terms in the 
late 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's only political experience was as mayor of the  
Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park from 1991-95. 
</P>
<P>
	His most notable acting role was in ``Predator'' (1987), in  
which his character declares: ``I ain't got time to bleed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Predator'' co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger sat with Ventura's  
family at the inaugural. Although Schwarzenegger is a Republican, 
he had nothing but praise for his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very disciplined man, and if there's one thing politics  
needs right now it's a lot of discipline,'' Schwarzenegger said. 
</P>
<P>
	As if to drive that home, Ventura made several references to his  
four years in the Navy in the 1970s. He wore a gold Navy trident in 
his lapel and read from a letter sent to him by Master Chief Terry 
Moy, who oversaw his training in Coronado, Calif., and stood behind 
the podium Monday in Navy dress blues. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter urged Ventura to draw on the strength he found in the  
brutal SEAL training to get him through the rough parts of his 
four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was sworn in, Ventura hugged his wife, Terry, and their  
two children, Jade, 15, and Tyrel, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	He scheduled an invitation-only reception at the governor's  
mansion, but he planned to be back in the office Tuesday to work on 
the state's two-year, $23 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided to forgo a black-tie ball in favor of a ``people's  
celebration'' bash at the Target Center on Jan. 16 with live music. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Tee, 52, a communications worker from St. Paul, said she  
votes infrequently but got excited by Ventura's plain-spoken 
approach to politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he can do what he says, get people involved,'' she  
said. ``I think people will storm the Legislature if he doesn't get 
what he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 Ventura critics used the day to send a message to the  
new governor. The Taxpayers League of Minnesota held a rally on the 
Capitol steps to press for return of a $1.5 billion projected 
budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Taxpayers League and others are here to remind the  
governor of the promises he made during the campaign to return 
$1,000 to taxpayers,'' said David Strom, the organization's 
director.

<HEADLINE> Owens Makes an NFL Top Clutch Catch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- With defenders swarming around him,  
Terrell Owens rose up and made one of the NFL's great catches. Only 
then could he let go. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens lay for a moment in the end zone as the crowd's crescendo  
washed over him, and then he cried for joy, embracing the ball and 
his teammates and hugging his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco 49ers' third-year receiver was overcome by the  
drama of his game-deciding catch and the redemption it provided him 
and his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had already thought, `How was I going to live with myself,  
knowing that I let this team down,' '' said Owens, who fumbled and 
dropped four passes before catching Steve Young's 25-yard throw 
with three seconds left, giving San Francisco a 30-27 NFC wild-card 
victory over Green Bay on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I visualize big plays all the time and this was a vision  
that finally came true,'' Owens said. ``I knew I had to make 
something happen for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reception ended San Francisco's three-year run of playoff  
defeats to Green Bay. And because of its impact and decisive 
nature, it immediately drew comparisons to some of the NFL's fabled 
catches: Franco Harris' ``Immaculate Reception'' for the Pittsburgh 
Steelers, Clarence Davis' ``Sea of Hands'' catch for the Oakland 
Raiders and the 49ers' previous entry, Dwight Clark's ``The 
Catch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He made the play to win the game,'' San Francisco coach Steve  
Mariucci said of Owens. ``Steve threw it in there, and we protected 
and all of that, but boy, he made a great play. It's one of the big 
catches in this organization's history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Packers felt the impact as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``The way this one ended was startling,'' Green Bay coach Mike  
Holmgren said. ``When the ball goes down the middle like that, you 
don't think the ball's going to be caught, ever. I think it was a 
marvelous catch. It was the perfect throw and he (Owens) made the 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were several plays leading up to the Catch II, the first  
coming from the Packers. On a play improvised in the huddle, Brett 
Favre hit Antonio Freeman with a 15-yard touchdown pass to put 
Green Bay in front 27-23 with 1:56 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	After R.W. McQuarters returned the kickoff to the San Francisco  
24, the 49ers had to travel 76 yards and had 1:50 to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Young had two straight completions to J.J. Stokes for 26 yards  
and fullback Marc Edwards, breaking LeRoy Butler's tackle behind 
the line of scrimmage, added a 3-yard catch for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
	After a timeout, Young threw incomplete and then Jerry Rice  
caught his only pass of the game, a 6-yarder that triggered 
controversy when it appeared he fumbled and the Packers recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials ruled he was down and the 49ers retained possession,  
still 41 yards away with 46 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Kirby then caught a 9-yard pass for a first down and  
Garrison Hearst added a 7-yard catch to the Green Bay 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers called a timeout.  
</P>
<P>
	Young's next pass, intended for Stokes, was broken up and nearly  
intercepted by Craig Newsome. 
</P>
<P>
	Given life again, the 49ers sent Owens down the middle on a post  
pattern. Young threw a bullet, threading the ball among three 
defenders and Owens jumped at the goal line to latch onto it. 
</P>
<P>
	The instant Owens caught the ball, Darren Sharper and Pat  
Terrell decked him even as linebacker Brian Williams coiled to add 
another shot. But there was no dislodging the ball, no taking away 
the catch and no end zone dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, after that kind of catch, you don't need to dance,''  
Stokes said. ``He just laid there. I don't know, I think he was 
paralyzed with happiness.''

<HEADLINE> Arbitration Fattens Player Wallets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who  
has thrown millions of dollars at free agents in his time, once 
blamed baseball's soaring salaries on arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Vaughn, Mike Piazza and Bernie Williams signed record  
contracts in the past two months, cashing in during their first 
forays into the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams, who agreed to a $87.5 million, seven-year contract  
with the New York Yankees, was already the highest-paid player 
($8.3 million) on a team with the third-highest payroll in the 
history of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, who re-signed with the Mets for $91 million over seven  
years, just completed a $15 million, two-year deal. And Vaughn got 
$80 million for six years from Anaheim to leave Boston, which paid 
him a mere $6.65 million last season. 
</P>
<P>
	What process fattened these players' wallets?  
</P>
<P>
	Arbitration, which starts again next month with filings from  
Jan. 5-15 and the exchange of figures on Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also the reason why Nomar Garciaparra, a player with  
little more than two years in the majors, signed a contract that 
could be worth as much as $44.25 million over seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 31, 1974, Catfish Hunter left behind the Oakland  
Athletics and his paltry six-figure salary and signed a $3.75 
million, five-year contract with the Yankees. He was the first free 
agent, escaping Charlie Finley's gulag for Steinbrenner's riches 
following an arbitrator's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	But the advent of salary arbitration earlier that year started  
baseball's revolution. Players with at least two years of major 
league service (the process is now limited primarily to those with 
at least three years but less than six) could argue their cases 
before an independent arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	In 406 cases decided over the past quarter century, just five  
players have had their pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arbitration system is ludicrous,'' Arizona Diamondbacks  
owner Jerry Colangelo said last winter. ``The sooner it can go, the 
better. What it does is divide -- management, ownership, player 
agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo got around arbitration in his first tangle with it  
when catcher Jorge Fabregas was eligible. Fabregas, who hit just 
.258 with seven home runs in 1997 when he made $275,000, lost his 
hearing and was still awarded $875,000 instead of his requested 
$1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Colangelo, looking to foster goodwill with his newly  
acquired player, gave Fabregas a $2.9 million, two-year contract -- 
then dealt him to the Mets on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbitration was put in place to protect players who fall short  
of the six years of major league service needed for free agency. It 
eliminates the possibility of a team clamping on a young player's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a substitute for the free market so the player can have  
his salary determined by market forces rather than the unilateral 
decision of a team,'' said Frank Coonelly, a labor lawyer for the 
commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams often avoid the sometimes damaging effects of a hearing by  
settling with the player. In hearings, representatives of teams 
tell the panel (75 percent of cases will be scheduled before 
three-person panels this winter rather than individual arbitrators) 
the player is not worth what he's asking for. Not exactly a 
confidence builder. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' return to the Yankees was a surprise, considering the  
contentious nature of negotiations to that point. The AL batting 
champ was said to have harbored ill feelings for the Yankees from 
an arbitration hearing following the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter, when Williams rejected New York's $37.5 million,  
five-year offer, he asked for record $9 million salary in 
arbitration. New York countered at $7.5 million, which would still 
have been a raise of $2.2 million. The sides settled at $8.25 
million, with Yankees GM Brian Cashman arguing a settlement would 
make negotiations less combative following the '98 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams have countered by signing young players -- some with just  
one year in the majors -- to longterm deals. Boston gave Garciaparra 
an unprecedented deal: $23.5 million over five years with two team 
options that could make it worth $44.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle already wants to negotiate an extension with Alex  
Rodriguez, eligible for free agency after the 2000 season, and the 
Yankees are thinking about making a multiyear offer to Derek Jeter, 
eligible for free agency after the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who could be free agent at age 25, would be leaving  
the Mariners at the same time as Ken Griffey Jr. Rodriguez, because 
of his age, could set a salary record, predicts his agent, Scott 
Boras. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the prospect of arbitration is causing trades. Philadelphia  
sent hard-throwing righty Jerry Spradlin, who could have been the 
Phillies' future closer, to Cleveland in part because the Phillies 
knew Spradlin was ready for a large salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego sent Joey Hamilton to Toronto -- but only after the  
Blue Jays inquired whether the pitcher would accept a $17 million, 
three-year deal to avoid arbitration.

<HEADLINE>  Ventura Sworn In As Minn. Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Former professional wrestler Jesse  
Ventura took the oath of office Monday as Minnesota's 37th governor 
after a two-month honeymoon as the country's most unlikely 
political star. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 11-minute inaugural speech, Ventura sought to reassure  
Minnesotans that they didn't make a mistake in electing a bald, 
boisterous radio host, former Navy SEAL and actor known as ``The 
Body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we move forward to do Minnesota's business and we will do  
it to the best of our ability,'' Ventura said to about 800 people 
watching in the Capitol rotunda. He then added the Navy cheer 
``Hooyah!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executives also were sworn in Monday in Arizona,  
California, Idaho, Nevada, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of them had generated as much attention or amazement as  
Ventura, the Reform Party candidate who got 37 percent of the vote 
in November, good enough to stun two political veterans, Republican 
Norm Coleman and Democrat Hubert Humphrey III. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did through the campaign, Ventura spoke mostly without  
notes -- from the ``heart and soul,'' as he described it, with 
people standing three and four deep on two balconies overlooking 
the rotunda floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not changing,'' Ventura said.  
</P>
<P>
	He doled out thank-yous and talked about his hopes but did not  
touch on any plans he might have for tax relief, a central theme of 
his campaign. He did reach out to the young, disenchanted voters 
who provided much of his support at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must put down the partisan party politics and look at the  
bigger picture,'' he said. ``We must not fail because if we do, we 
can lose this generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, 47, replaced Republican Gov. Arne Carlson, a 30-year  
public servant who was state auditor before becoming governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura became the 37th person to hold the office of governor.  
Rudy Perpich was elected governor to non-consecutive terms in the 
late 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's only political experience was as mayor of the  
Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park from 1991-95. 
</P>
<P>
	His most notable acting role was in ``Predator'' (1987), in  
which his character declares: ``I ain't got time to bleed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Predator'' co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger sat with Ventura's  
family at the inaugural. Although Schwarzenegger is a Republican, 
he had nothing but praise for his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very disciplined man, and if there's one thing politics  
needs right now it's a lot of discipline,'' Schwarzenegger said. 
</P>
<P>
	As if to drive that home, Ventura made several references to his  
four years in the Navy in the 1970s. He wore a gold Navy trident in 
his lapel and read from a letter sent to him by Master Chief Terry 
Moy, who oversaw his training in Coronado, Calif., and stood behind 
the podium Monday in Navy dress blues. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter urged Ventura to draw on the strength he found in the  
brutal SEAL training to get him through the rough parts of his 
four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was sworn in, Ventura hugged his wife, Terry, and their  
two children, Jade, 15, and Tyrel, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	He scheduled an invitation-only reception at the governor's  
mansion, but he planned to be back in the office Tuesday to work on 
the state's two-year, $23 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided to forgo a black-tie ball in favor of a ``people's  
celebration'' bash at the Target Center on Jan. 16 with live music. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Tee, 52, a communications worker from St. Paul, said she  
votes infrequently but got excited by Ventura's plain-spoken 
approach to politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he can do what he says, get people involved,'' she  
said. ``I think people will storm the Legislature if he doesn't get 
what he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 Ventura critics used the day to send a message to the  
new governor. The Taxpayers League of Minnesota held a rally on the 
Capitol steps to press for return of a $1.5 billion projected 
budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Taxpayers League and others are here to remind the  
governor of the promises he made during the campaign to return 
$1,000 to taxpayers,'' said David Strom, the organization's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said he plans to push for return of about $1 billion  
of the surplus, but wants to use at least some of the remainder for 
health initiatives.
