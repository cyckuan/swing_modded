<HEADLINE> Clinton Touting Education Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Touting a proposal to help modernize  
classrooms, President Clinton today kicks off a ``Rebuilding 
America's Schools'' campaign with middle-school students in Des 
Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	The event at Amos Hiatt Middle School was a precursor to two  
fund-raisers in the Des Moines area for a key impeachment ally, 
Sen. Tom Harkin. Clinton also planned a closed-door session with 
farmers to talk about the economic difficulties they're facing. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of Clinton's education event was a proposal,  
part of his fiscal 2000 budget, to give tax breaks to investors 
when they buy municipal bonds backing school construction and 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The item, which would provide $8.95 billion in federal tax  
breaks over 10 years, could support up to $22 billion in school 
modernization, according to administration estimates. The tax break 
would make the low-rate bonds more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar proposal failed to win congressional passage last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and building trades union members in Houston, New  
Orleans, New York City and Philadelphia were holding rallies to 
coincide with Clinton's speech in Des Moines.

<HEADLINE> Ford Recalls 200,000 Europe Focuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is recalling almost 200,000 Focus  
models in Europe to repair an alternator defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced the recall today after learning that water  
could leak into the car's alternator and cause dashboard lights to 
flicker and dim. Ford said the defect was not a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall affects Focus models manufactured from September  
until March 5 of this year. The cars were built at plants in 
Saarlouis, Germany and Valencia, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has asked dealers to contact buyers to have the alternator  
cap replaced, in a repair taking 30 minutes. Almost a third of the 
198,000 cars affected were sold in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The defective caps were produced by an outside supplier, said  
Mark Harrison, a spokesman for Ford Motor Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated cost of the recall was not known, he added.  
</P>
<P>
	The subcompact is scheduled to go on sale in the United States  
in the fall. Production begins at Ford's Wayne, Mich., assembly 
plant Monday.

<HEADLINE> Officer Refuses Duty With Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINOT, N.D. (AP) -- An Air Force officer has launched himself  
into trouble by refusing to work with women in an underground 
missile silo because he says the close quarters can tempt a man to 
sin. 
</P>
<P>
	First Lt. Ryan Berry, 26, says it's a matter of his strong Roman  
Catholic beliefs. But he has been disciplined by his higher-ups and 
has found little sympathy at Minot Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Many women said they were insulted by the request and find the  
notion of romance in a Minuteman nuclear missile silo preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're so busy and dirty that the last thing you want to do is  
take off your clothes and have sex,'' said Alison Ruttenberg, a 
former Air Force legal officer who in 1979 became one of the first 
women to work in a missile silo. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry says he doesn't object to women in the military, but he  
doesn't want to work with them in an area about the size of a 
school bus, where the work day is usually 24 hours. Berry is 
married, with a baby daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry has never done silo duty with a woman, because his  
superiors originally agreed to let him work only with men. But they 
changed their minds after crew members complained that Berry was 
receiving special treatment and disrupting staff scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
	In an April job performance review, Col. Ronald Haeckel, Berry's  
commander, said his refusal to work with women was unacceptable and 
``adversely impacted good order, discipline and morale.'' Berry was 
decertified from working with nuclear missiles. He now works 
elsewhere in Minot's missile wing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has declined comment, citing privacy issues.  
</P>
<P>
	Berry has also refused to comment, citing the advice of his  
lawyer. The lawyer, Henry L. Hamilton, pointed out that Haeckel and 
other officers have given Berry glowing marks for his overall job 
performance, describing him as the ``go-to guy'' and an officer who 
had ``boundless potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haeckel's Air Force superiors will determine whether the review  
will stand. Berry can appeal their determination. If it stands, 
Hamilton said, it will essentially end Berry's military career and 
Berry will be ``forever stigmatized as someone who is a dud or a 
deadbeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another clear signal that if you're someone with  
conservative, traditional, religious values, whether they're 
Catholic or Protestant, that the armed forces are not for you,'' 
Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some at Minot Air Force Base disagree, questioning why a man  
with strong morals would even be tempted by working alongside 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just must mean his convictions aren't as strong as they  
should be,'' said Staff Sgt. Kevin Bachman. 
</P>
<P>
	Mistie Cushman, whose husband is a missile technician, said:  
``If he's mature, he should be able to control himself no matter 
what job he's in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The missile silos are about 80 feet underground and have one bed  
and a toilet. A partition separates the work area from the sleeping 
quarters and the bathroom. When one officer sleeps, the other 
remains on duty. Shifts normally last 24 hours, but they have been 
known to go longer when North Dakota's harsh winters make it 
difficult to get officers to the silos. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 women and 170 men work in the silos. They inspect and  
test the missiles and perform maintenance. They are also free to 
relax and read a book if everything is OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's stand has drawn more attention to the base where Kelly  
Flinn, the nation's first woman B-52 pilot, was stationed before 
resigning in 1997 rather than face a court-martial on charges of 
adultery, lying and disobeying an order. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry has the support of Archbishop Edwin F. O'Brien, whose  
diocese is the armed services. O'Brien has said Berry's moral stand 
is a worthy response to the Air Force's motto, ``Integrity First.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Susan Barnes, director of an advocacy group for military  
women, said Berry's position is ``absolutely sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Air Force people have been getting by in confined places for  
many, many years,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Waitress Says Rodman Harrassed Her </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A Las Vegas Hilton cocktail waitress has filed  
a federal lawsuit against her employer and basketball star Dennis 
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Chapa, 59, claims Rodman pinched and grabbed her breasts  
while he was seated at a gambling table in June 1998. She is the 
fourth woman to accuse Rodman of such an action at the resort last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hilton tolerates Rodman's behavior because Hilton desires  
Rodman's business,'' her lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit filed Thursday, Chapa, who is represented by  
attorney David Pancoast, accuses the resort of ``creating an 
environment of professional segregation, psychological harassment, 
sexual harassment and intimidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also accuses it of retaliating against women who complain  
about sexual harassment. Hilton spokesman Alan Hopper declined to 
comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's publicist, Matt Lebov, did not return a phone call  
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Court Throws Out Bedroom Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The state's highest court threw out the  
drunken driving conviction of a man who was given a sobriety test 
and arrested in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Michael Norris'  
constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure 
outweighed the state's interest in pursuing people suspected of 
driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Norris reportedly was spotted driving  
erratically by another driver, who followed him home and called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the tip, an officer then went to Norris' home and was  
let in by his 77-year-old mother-in-law, who was visiting. The 
officer went to Norris' bedroom, questioned him, administered a 
field sobriety test and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
	After a judge denied Norris' motion to suppress evidence, Norris  
entered a conditional guilty plea in which he retained the right to 
appeal. He was sentenced to a day in county jail and fined $350. 
</P>
<P>
	On appeal, Norris contended that police had no authority to  
enter his home to make a warrantless arrest for a minor offense. 
</P>
<P>
	He also argued that no valid consent was given to allow police  
to enter his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court said ``a warantless home arrest cannot be upheld  
simply because evidence of the offender's blood-alcohol level might 
have dissipated while the police obtained a warrant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court also rejected prosecutors' argument that the officer's  
entry was consensual. It noted that the officer did not dispute the 
mother-in-law's assertion that she never consented for him to come 
any farther into the house than inside the front door.

	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Gene Hart, the Philadelphia hockey announcer  
known for decades as the ``Voice of the Flyers,'' died Wednesday. 
He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was the play-by-play man for the Flyers on radio and

	PLEASANT HILL, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Heaston, who coached  
California's men's water polo team to three straight national 
titles over the past decade, died Thursday of brain cancer. He was 
51. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 10 years as head coach, Cal finished in third place  
or better in the NCAA tournament seven times, winning the

1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Heaston was Pac-10 Conference coach of the year four times, most  
recently in 1995, and was NCAA coach of the year in 1990 and 1992. 
His record at California was 224-56. 
</P>
<P>
	Heaston, who took over the team in 1989, was an assistant from  
1982-1988. He was assistant coach on the silver medal team at the

chorus line of Mae West's nightclub act who became her companion 
and love of her life for 26 years, died Wednesday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Novak was born Chester Ribonsky and wrestled under the moniker  
Charles Krauser before changing his name to Novak. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an intensely private man who stood on the sidelines,  
content to let the public believe he was the bodyguard of Miss 
West, who was nearly 30 years older. 
</P>
<P>
	Novak once found himself in the headlines, however, when he was  
punched by Hungarian-born Mr. Universe Mickey Hargitay, who had 
become romantically involved with actress Jayne Mansfield. Miss 
Mansfield had criticized Miss West. 
</P>

	Though their relationship was at times stormy, Novak was a  
constantly devoted mate to West in the final years before her death 
in 1980 at 87.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Ernst Wynder, who co-wrote a landmark 1950  
study linking cigarettes and cancer, died Wednesday of thyroid 
cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	As a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis, he  
worked to document the link between smoking and cancer, which had 
been clinically observed but never proven. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1950 article in the Journal of American Medicine,  
co-authored with Dr. Evarts Graham, studied 680 cancer cases linked 
to smoking. The American Medical Association later termed the 
report ``landmark research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, Wynder showed that the tar found in tobacco caused  
precancerous growths in rabbits and mice. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynder later studied the effect of industrial products and  
nutrition on cancer. In 1969, he founded the American Health 
Foundation and its Valhalla research center, which issued yearly 
report cards on the health of the nation's children. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, he started Preventive Medicine, a journal on cancer  
research.

<HEADLINE> 2 Penguins File for Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Penguins forwards Alexei Kovalev  
and Martin Straka have filed for arbitration, meaning they won't be 
holdouts when training camp opens in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If they can't agree to a contract with the Penguins for next  
season, an independent arbitrator will set their salary by 
mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	However, nearly all arbitration-eligible NHL players settle  
before their cases are heard by an arbitrator. Both sides usually 
prefer to avoid hearings in which teams must make negative comments 
about their own players. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes it, but that's why the vast majority of players  
who file for arbitration never make it all the way to a hearing,'' 
said Scott Greenspun, Kovalev's agent. ``We just felt it would be 
in Alexei's best interest to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No agents have begun serious talks yet with Penguins general  
manager Craig Patrick because the team's finances are being sorted 
out in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's 1999-2000 budget cannot be set until new owner Mario  
Lemieux gains control of the team, which may happen as early as 
July 26 if there are no last-minute snags in finalizing his 
investors' group. 
</P>
<P>
	Straka was one of the NHL's best bargains last season, producing  
83 points for a $500,000 salary. Kovalev made $1.5 million for his 
53-point season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have 10 restricted free agents: Kovalev, Straka,  
forwards Matthew Barnaby, Jan Hrdina, Robert Lang and Kip Miller 
and defensemen Sven Butenschon, Darius Kasparaitis, Ian Moran and 
Jiri Slegr.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Are Higher / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Friday, as investors concluded  
that the latest data on benign inflation reduces the likelihood 
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the government's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond  
rose 13/32 percent, or $4.06 1/4 per $1,000 in face value, as its 
yield fell to 5.88 percent from Thursday's 5.91 percent. Bond 
prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department on Thursday reported that consumer prices  
held steady in June for the second straight month -- the best 
showing since 1986. The report gives further evidence that the U.S. 
economy is not overheating, which would reduce the need for the Fed 
to slow it down with an interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred Broaddus, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank,  
said Friday: ``I am comforted by the two consecutive favorable CPI 
reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation erodes the value of fixed-rate securities, such as  
Treasurys. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader Treasury market, prices of short-term securities  
rose 3/32 point to 5/32 point and intermediate securities rose 7/32 
point to 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.66 percent while  
the discount fell 0.04 pecentage point from Thursday to 4.54 
percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.64 percent, as the discount 
fell 0.03 percentage point to 4.47 percent. One-year yields fell to 
4.93 percent as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.70 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.93 3/4 percent from 5.19 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 119 13/32. The average 
yield to maturity was 5.50 percent, unchanged from Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Could Deter Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Terry Holland says the uncertainty of NCAA  
sanctions is the one factor that could keep him from becoming the 
next men's basketball coach at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``That probably would be the only thing,'' Holland told the  
Saint Paul Pioneer Press after returning to Charlottesville, Va., 
to contemplate his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland, Virginia's athletic director, is mulling an offer to  
replace Clem Haskins, who accepted a $1.5 million buyout last month 
in the midst of a massive academic fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland said he'll inform Minnesota athletic director Mark  
Dienhart of his decision this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland and his wife, Ann, went house hunting in Minneapolis  
during their midweek visit, where he was offered a seven-year 
package reportedly worth $1 million annually, half of it from 
endorsement contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential pitfall is not knowing how hard the NCAA will come  
down on the basketball program this fall. That uncertainty could 
prevent Holland from assembling a first-rate coaching staff that 
would ease his return to the sidelines after a nine-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	At 57, Holland also doesn't want to take a coaching job only to  
have to wait several seasons before being able to return the 
program to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Schemmel, senior associate men's athletic director at  
Minnesota, said the school appreciates Holland's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the uncertainty in many ways is tougher than actually  
having sanctions in place,'' Schemmel said. ``You don't know what's 
coming. So, we certainly understand that hesitation on his part. 
It's a concern for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schemmel said he believes the Gophers have a 50-50 chance of  
landing Holland, who didn't return phone calls to his office from 
The Associated Press on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said Schemmel, who planned  
further talks with Holland throughout the weekend. ``Obviously, 
we're very impressed with Terry and his integrity and energy. He 
wanted to do some things on the other end, look at other pieces of 
the puzzle in Virginia, if he wanted to make this move. We remain 
cautiously optimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland, who took Virginia to nine NCAA tournaments, including  
Final Fours in 1981 and '84, has been chairman of the NCAA men's 
basketball committee in recent years. But he said he couldn't 
predict what kind of sanctions the Minnesota program might expect 
to receive if found guilty of what school president Mark Yudof has 
described as numerous instances of academic fraud under Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers are at the scholarship limit for the next school  
year. While that means the new coach won't have to worry about 
recruiting right away, it also means penalties such as lost 
scholarships will be drawn out beyond 1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with not having any scholarships available is that  
you can't go ahead and take your penalty and get it out of the way 
rather than being forced to down the road,'' Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland, who had a 418-216 coaching record in five seasons at  
Davidson and 16 at Virginia, said he's serious about getting back 
into coaching. But he could have named himself coach at Virginia 
last year, when he hired Pete Gillen instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can safely say that I'm hard at work putting a staff  
together, which is very important to me, and that I'm serious about 
it,'' Holland told the Pioneer Press. ``Assuming all the pieces 
fit, I'm working in that direction. It does appear to be a perfect 
fit. In other words, what you have is a chance to turn a disaster 
into an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if there is somebody who is a better fit, I certainly  
wouldn't want to stay in the way of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some have speculated that Holland could be brought in with the  
agreement that he'd slide over to an administrative role in a 
couple of years. But Holland insisted the offer is solely for 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	If Holland declines the offer, the Gophers, who have been  
spurned by Utah's Rick Majerus and Minnesota Timberwolves coach 
Flip Saunders, would likely turn to either Gonzaga coach Dan 
Monson, Wake Forest coach Dave Odom or Evansville coach Jim Crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be in this business and not have a Plan B and a Plan  
C,'' Schemmel said. ``If Terry says no, we immediately go to Plan 
B.''

<HEADLINE> Cal State Northridge Coach Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cal State Northridge coach Ron Ponciano was  
fired Friday amid an internal university inquiry into alleged rules 
violations in the football program. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the independent inquiry continues, interim university  
president Louanne Kennedy said the results so far show ``serious 
and substantial'' violations of NCAA and university rules that 
compelled the school to take action. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are continuing to sort through some of the  
allegations, the picture of non-compliance that has already emerged 
is clear, serious and substantial,'' Kennedy said. ``Thus it was 
necessary to make a change now for the coming season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university sent Ponciano a letter firing him from the job  
he's held since February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ponciano, 40, said Friday that he had refused an earlier offer  
to voluntarily leave the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``After hearing how ridiculous the accusations were I flat out  
refused to resign,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Matadors were 7-4 last season, tying for second in the Big  
Sky Conference with a 5-3 record. Previously, Ponciano was 
defensive coordinator during the 1995 and 1996 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ponciano will receive the standard 90 days severance pay, the  
university said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry was spurred by an anonymous letter received May 19  
that listed 20 allegations. The inquiry, begun May 24, is being 
headed by Northridge's internal auditor and its faculty athletic 
representative. The NCAA also has been consulted, university 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The author of the anonymous letter had ulterior motives, said  
Ponciano, who is considering a lawsuit against the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I feel very confident about the whole thing,'' he  
said. ``But I'm sick about the (upcoming) season and sick for the 
kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ponciano said he knows two of the allegations centered on  
secondary recruitment violations that would not be cause for 
dismissal. He said proof existed that the other allegations never 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``I obviously have a lot at stake here,'' Ponciano said. ``And  
it's just not true. It's a pretty crazy idea.''. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials met Friday with the football coaching staff  
and players to explain the firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are determined to resolve all of the allegations raised in  
the letter,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy announced assistant Terrance Johnson will be the team's  
administrator in charge until a coach is hired. Northridge opens 
the season at home Sept. 4 against Western Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an institution, Cal State Northridge is committed to a  
strong athletic program that plays by the rules and wins,'' 
athletic director Dick Dull said. ``We'll be looking for a football 
coach who can do both.''

<HEADLINE> Future of Milwaukee Stadium Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wendy Selig-Prieb hoped her first season as  
president of the Milwaukee Brewers would be marked by wins and a 
successful move to Miller Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the deaths of three stadium workers in a massive  
construction accident have cast a pall on the season and put the 
immediate future of the Brewers in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been through anything like this in my life,''  
Selig-Prieb said. ``The only thing we know for sure is that Miller 
Park will be built, it will have a retractable roof and it will be 
second to none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller Park was the dream of baseball commissioner Bud Selig,  
Selig-Prieb's father and the Brewers' former majority owner. He 
visited the building site almost daily, and on Thursday at the 
opening of Seattle's Safeco Field, he wept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind telling anybody it is about as painful an  
experience as I have ever gone through in my life. Very sad. Very 
emotional,'' he said in his speech before the first game in the 
Mariners' new field. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I'm very glad to be here tonight for a lot of reasons,  
you will understand my heart is still in Milwaukee,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody knew those workers, it was my father,'' Selig-Prieb  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The retractable-roof stadium was only months from completion  
before a giant crane collapsed while lifting a piece of the roof 
Wednesday, crushing another crane and landing heavily on the 
first-base side of the stadium structure. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite several hundred tons of smashed, mangled evidence to  
the contrary, the team insists its plans to open next April in 
Miller Park have not yet been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers' baseball palace looked more like a war zone  
Thursday as team officials joined investigators in a tour of the 
site. Later in the day, however, officials said the damage did not 
appear to be as extensive as previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea as to whether there will be a delay or not,''  
vice president of corporate affairs Laurel Prieb said. ``We could 
just as likely be opening on time as not opening on time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prieb said the team is playing ``a very secondary role in what  
is going on'' in the investigation of the causes and consequences 
of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the main concerns in finishing the project on  
time are finding suitable replacements for the crane and for the 
roof pieces, which are made with a type of steel manufactured only 
in Luxembourg. Those decisions won't be made for several days, 
stadium board officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee canceled Thursday's game against the Kansas City  
Royals and announced the teams would play a doubleheader today. 
Both teams held closed workouts under sunny skies at County Stadium 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers also plan to wear a memorial patch featuring the  
logo of the iron workers' local union. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said the County Stadium bleachers -- the section of the  
old park closest to the accident -- will be closed until the 
investigation is completed. Fans with tickets for the bleachers 
will be given different seats for their game or another. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a family in the Brewers organization and in the  
Milwaukee community,'' Brewers outfielder Jeromy Burnitz said. 
``The workers at Miller Park are a part of our family, and this 
loss has affected us all very deeply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials stressed that despite the catastrophe that occurred  
only feet away, County Stadium is completely safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is still a dangerous area for when they start picking  
things up, but it won't affect the activity in the other 
ballpark,'' Fire Chief Larry Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, the team has planned its marketing and  
publicity agendas around Miller Park's existence. The team's slogan 
for the current season is ``Bringing Down the House,'' and County 
Stadium was scheduled for demolition this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the team faces the prospect of remaining in County Stadium  
in 2000 and even beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Any delay in opening the park would deprive the Brewers of  
millions of dollars in revenue. Prieb refused to say whether any 
lost funds would seriously hurt the Brewers' finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for the Brewers, the Miller Park project is  
thoroughly insured, members of the stadium's board of directors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project has $325 million in property insurance and $70  
million in liability insurance, with a minuscule deductible of 
$25,000, board member Bill Duckett said. The policy also contains a 
rider covering actual lost income sustained by the Brewers if the 
stadium doesn't open on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance also helps protect the public from footing the  
bill for any additional work. Residents in five counties 
surrounding the stadium have paid a one-tenth of 1 percent stadium 
sales tax to help fund the project since 1996. A recent audit 
concluded the tax must remain in effect until 2014. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers haven't ventured a guess on a cleanup schedule, but  
a local demolition contractor said the process could be completed 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on a real compressed schedule (of two eight-hour  
shifts, seven days a week), the demolition team could remove the 
debris and do the demolition work in 30 days,'' said David M. 
Ahern, president of Barrett of Wisconsin Inc.

<HEADLINE> CDC Seeks To Lower Hantavirus Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Headed for your summer cabin in the woods?  
Better check for mice -- scientists say this could be a bad year for 
a rare but often fatal viral infection spread by rural rodents. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors already are recording slightly higher than usual  
hantavirus infections in some Western states, including Arizona, 
Colorado and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers are warning visitors to national parks not to feed or  
handle rodents, after a 7-year-old boy played with a possibly 
infected deer mouse he caught on California's remote Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	And experts say anyone in rural areas -- but particularly in  
parts of the West where hantavirus is most prevalent -- should take 
certain precautions. Hantavirus-carrying mice can slip into a 
house, barn or vacation cabin through a crack just a quarter-inch 
wide, so knowing how to safely deal with rodents is important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome'' is a severe respiratory  
infection spread by rodent urine, feces or saliva. You don't 
actually have to touch a rodent. People typically become sick about 
two weeks after breathing virus particles stirred up in a 
rodent-infested space, such as when sweeping a mouse nest out of a 
barn or cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it takes is one infected rodent,'' warned Dr. James Mills  
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled a Wisconsin man who volunteered to clean a mouse  
nest out of a relative's car, but used a high-pressure air hose 
that blasted enough hantavirus into the air to make him sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Hantavirus infection kills 43 percent of its victims -- but  
fortunately it's fairly rare. Only 217 U.S. cases have been 
confirmed since the first U.S. hantavirus strain was discovered in 
1993, during a mysterious outbreak in the ``Four Corners'' region 
of the Southwest that killed at least 26 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of hantavirus seems to fluctuate with climate. The CDC  
says parts of country are poised for a bad year, so it is urging 
rural residents and vacationers to take some simple precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of May, the CDC listed 18 confirmed or suspected  
cases of hantavirus in nine states. Eight patients were from 
Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico -- high for a region that has 
averaged just two hantavirus cases by May of each year since 1995. 
Additional infections have since been reported, but Mills could not 
provide details. 
</P>
<P>
	Hantavirus isn't carried by big-city rodents, but by four  
species of mice and rats that live in rural areas around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	But the West has the most hantavirus, and CDC last year  
discovered a bumper crop of deer mice there, thanks to a warm 
winter and high rainfall from the climate phenomenon El Nino. But 
most of those new mice were uninfected babies. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, rodent populations aren't quite as high -- but a lot  
of older mice still alive from last year's baby boom have now 
caught hantavirus and become a threat. About 40 percent of mice in 
parts of New Mexico and Colorado are infected, far more than the 
typical 10-15 percent mouse infection rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service is warning tourists not to handle or  
feed wild rodents, warnings that intensified after the parents, and 
a congressman, of the boy exposed at the Channel Islands 
complained. The boy did not get sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't disturb rodent burrows or droppings, or camp near rodent  
dens or woodpiles or garbage areas that might conceal nests, the 
park service said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the CDC says the real risk usually comes indoors, when  
people find the weekend cabin they rented was a mouse's winter home 
or clean out a barn or other infested area. CDC's advice: 
</P>
<P>
	--Air out unused cabins before occupying them.  
</P>
<P>
	--Before cleaning infested buildings, spray nests, droppings and  
other signs of rodents with a disinfectant or bleach solution, 
which can kill hantavirus. Avoid stirring up dust until the area is 
wet. Then sweep up while wearing rubber gloves and discard the mess 
in sealed bags. 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether at home or camping, keep food and garbage sealed to  
avoid attracting rodents. Also, seal cracks in dwellings, keep 
brush away from foundations and elevate hay, woodpiles and garbage 
cans to deter rodent nesting. 
</P>
<P>
	For more information, call 1-877-232-3322 or look up hantavirus  
at http://www.cdc.gov on the Internet.

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Almost 7 inches of rain doused parts of Arizona,  
causing major flooding and forcing authorities to rescue hikers, 
horses and squealing pigs from the rising waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catalina Mountains in southern Arizona were hit hard  
Thursday as thick clouds swept in from Tucson and dumped nearly 7 
inches of rain overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, a 7-foot wall of water rushed through Sabino  
Canyon, a popular camping spot in the Catalinas, snapping small 
trees in half. Several hikers hid inside public toilets and were 
later stranded as the water spilled over the trails. 
</P>
<P>
	A rescue helicopter eventually plucked the hikers from the tops  
of the restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuscon, George Good and his rescue crew pulled two women from  
a barn roof, and rescued eight horses. They later moved three gray 
pigs to safety in wheelbarrows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those weren't trained pigs, they just didn't jump in there,''  
Good said. ``We had to pull up on their tails to keep their feet 
from digging down in the mud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were several other rescues as creeks and rivers swelled,  
trapping some people. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Canyon National Park rangers airlifted 26 soggy campers  
out of a campground as nearly three-quarters of an inch of new rain 
fell. Park crews already had begun clearing what was left of hiking 
trails in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's messy,'' said Michael Polletta, a park ranger. ``It's  
really not like anything I've experienced before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have closed the 9-mile-long Bright Angel Trail that  
leads from the southern rim to the canyon's bottom and part of the 
North Kaibab trail while crews repair the damage. Some of the 
canyon's campgrounds were closed, said Sandra Perl, a spokeswoman 
for Grand Canyon National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is expected to get a break from the monsoon weather in  
the next couple of days, with mostly sunny weather and highs in the 
low 100s.

<HEADLINE> Badlands Hanover Hopes To Be Lucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- If Badlands Hanover finally gets a  
break, the $1 million Meadowlands Pace could be his. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-old son of Western Hanover has had nothing but bad  
luck in finishing second in all three starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week in the eliminations for Saturday night's race at the  
Meadowlands Racetrack, Badlands Hanover took a couple of bad steps 
in the stretch and still came within a half length of winner 
Grinfromeartoear. 
</P>
<P>
	The week before, the colt caught a shoe in an open event and  
lost by a neck. In his other start in the Historic Jersey Cup on 
June 26, he tired late and was beaten by a head. 
</P>
<P>
	``The horse is right there at the wire and he always tries,''  
trainer Joe Holloway said. ``We know that is going to be. And we 
just have to hope for a halfway decent trip from where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Badlands Hanover's luck wasn't good in the draw for the biggest  
pace of the year for 3-year-olds on Tuesday, drawing post No. 9 for 
driver Ron Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	The only colt that drew worse was The Panderosa, the John  
Campbell-driven colt who is the stronger half of the favored entry 
that includes Stutzpan. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite having the two favorites draw bad posts, Holloway said  
they are still the horses to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still in my eyes, it is The Panderosa,'' Holloway said. ``It  
is not going to be easy for him either from the 10 hole, but both 
of our horses have tactical speed, if need be. And others have to 
be looking for us. Maybe the post won't be that bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce said it's difficult to figure out a strategy.  
</P>
<P>
	In the eliminations, there was a strong head wind on the  
backstretch and that helped the closers in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Badlands Hanover raced uncovered on the backstretch for a while  
and did well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for those little steps he threw, he probably was  
going to get to Grinfromeartoear,'' Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pierce wasn't certain how the race will unfold, Campbell  
plans on gunning The Panderosa right to the front. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panderosa raced on the lead in the third and final  
elimination and was just nipped at the wire by the late charging 
Blissfull Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce drove Blissfull Hall in the elimination, covering the  
final quarter in 25.2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think he was quite as sharp as he had been in the  
(North America Cup) final,'' Campbell said of The Panderosa. ``I 
think he will be sharper but he is going to have to be. And all 
that versatility, whatever, has got to really come into play and he 
is going to have to race better in order to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the field for the Meadowlands Pace from the rail out with  
colt, driver and odds: 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall, Daniel Dube, 8-1; Grimfromeartoear, Jack  
Moiseyev, 5-1; Goliath Bayama, Sylvain Filion, 12-1; Sign of 
Success, David Miller, 10-1; Mystical Shark, Luc Ouellette, 6-1; 
Art's Conquest, Mike Lachance, 10-1; Washington VC, George Brennan,

<HEADLINE> United States 94, Canada 60 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A half-hour after the game, the  
blood was still flowing from Peter Guarasci's forehead after he was 
elbowed by Tom Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	`I'm still (upset),'' the Canadian forward said, although his  
anger was tempered by Gugliotta's apology and his team's relatively 
acceptable performance in a 94-60 loss to the United States on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton scored 20 points, Tim Duncan 18 and Kevin Garnett  
had several crowd-pleasing plays while adding 15. Jason Kidd handed 
out 11 assists for the Americans, who jumped to an early 20-point 
lead and coasted. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the closest games the United States has played  
with a roster of NBA players, although close is a relative term 
when the Americans are using professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing to be ashamed of,'' Canada's Steve Nash said. ``Teams  
can get beat by 50 very easily. We played hard and kept them under 
100 points, which was kind of a nice goal for us. It was somewhat 
productive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had their first international incident of this  
tournament late in the first half when Gugliotta and Guarasci 
engaged in some pushing and shoving after Gugliotta's elbow opened 
a cut on Guarasci's forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to swipe the ball from behind,'' Gugliotta said. ``I  
got a lot of ball, but my elbow got his forehead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cut bled heavily, and the visibly angered Guarasci had to  
immediately leave the game. He returned in the second half with six 
stitches in his forehead, later blowing an uncontested dunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a bit of a cheap shot because I had him  
beat,'' said Guarasci, who plays professionally in Italy. ``He 
tried to make a play on the ball, and then I tried to get to the 
bench and he was in my way and we bumped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, sporting two black eyes and a nasty cut on his broken  
nose, apologized after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it hurt, but it wasn't anything I did on purpose,''  
Gugliotta said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't hold grudges. He's a great player, I have nothing but  
good things to say about all of those guys,'' Guarasci said, 
unaware that drops of fresh blood were dripping down the side of 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome of this game was never in doubt, but Canada, after  
falling behind 24-4 in the first 6 1/2 minutes, nearly got its deficit 
back to single digits before watching the United States pull away 
early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans were held under 100 points for only the sixth time  
in 32 games with NBA players, and the final total of 94 was the 
Americans' second-lowest in that span. 
</P>
<P>
	It took just three seconds for the United States to record its  
first dunk, a jam by Duncan off a quick pass from Allan Houston an 
eyeblink after Garnett won the opening tap. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3-pointer, a three-point play and a fast-break layup -- all by  
Payton -- made it 12-3, and a pretty alley-oop pass from Payton to 
Garnett completed a 12-0 run that made it 24-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's next four baskets were 3-pointers, and the deficit was  
down to 36-23 with 6:07 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton had a fast-break layup to begin a 22-7 run spanning the  
first 9 1/2 minutes of the second half as the United States took a 
66-36 lead, and the only suspense after that was whether U.S. coach 
Larry Brown would leave rookies Elton Brand and Wally Szczerbiak on 
the bench for the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand finally checked in with 5:52 left, and his bucket with  
1:38 left gave the United States 88 points -- ensuring it would 
eclipse its 87-point outing against Angola in 1996 that was the 
lowest-scoring game the Americans (2-0) ever played with an NBA 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak played the final three minutes, scoring four points.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts not to play, but the rookies realize we're on this  
team to root and cheer on the proven NBA veterans,'' Szczerbiak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' other NBA rookie, Richard Hamilton, missed his  
second straight game due to a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Newton had 10 points to lead Canada (2-1).  
</P>
<P>
	Nash, Canada's only NBA veteran, shot 2-for-7 and had five  
points, six turnovers and one assist. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Argentina (1-1) defeated Cuba 81-76, virtually  
assuring that Cuba (0-3) will be eliminated from Group A. The 
Cubans still must face the United States on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Group B games, Puerto Rico (2-0) defeated Brazil (1-2) 96-88,  
and Venezuela (2-1) beat Panama (0-2) 76-72. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team plays Argentina today at 5:30 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Gulstream's Track Announcer Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Tom Durkin, the longtime voice of horse  
racing's Breeders' Cup, resigned Friday after six seasons as 
Gulfstream Park's track announcer. 
</P>
<P>
	Durkin cited personal and business reasons for not returning to  
Florida's annual winter meet. He also is the track announcer for 
the New York Racing Association, which operates Belmont, Aqueduct 
and Saratoga, and does extensive television work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving Gulfstream will allow me more time to focus attention  
on my two most important professional priorities, New York racing 
and the Breeders' Cup,'' Durkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will also facilitate my participation in NBC's expanded  
racing coverage, as well as work at ESPN. Equally important, the 
lighter work load will allow me more time at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Durkin will make his final Gulfstream calls when this year's  
Breeders' Cup is run at the track on Nov. 7. He has called every 
Breeders' Cup race since the event's inception in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Donn, Gulfstream president, said he accepted the  
resignation ``with regret but with a complete understanding of the 
motives that prompted his decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Gulfstream meet will run from Jan. 3 through March 16.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Sign Charlie Garner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers bought some  
insurance for running back Garrison Hearst by signing free-agent 
tailback Charlie Garner to a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, who gave the 49ers a legitimate running game last season  
before his ankle was broken in a second-round playoff game, may be 
have a problem in which impaired circulation cause permanent damag 
to the injured bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner's contract will pay him $1.44 million, with a $40,000  
signing bonus. He'll get $400,000 in 1999, $600,000 in 2000, and a 
bonus of $400,000 if he remains on the active roster through the 
2000 season, the San Francisco Chronicle reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back and return specialist Chuck Levy was cut to make  
room for Garner, 27, who rushed for 381 yards and four touchdowns 
on 96 carries last season for the Philadelphia Eagles He also 
caught 19 passes for 110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers also are still considering troubled running back  
Lawrence Phillips, who played in Europe last season after 
off-the-field problems cost him jobs with the Rams and Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst's prognosis may be a little better than originally  
thought. Two doctors who examined Hearst said it's possible the 
circulation problem could be solved with minor surgery and he could 
be playing again by the second month of the season.

<HEADLINE> TV Appearance Leads to Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The local evening news unexpectedly turned into  
``America's Most Wanted'' when a police officer recognized a 
mayoral candidate as a suspect wanted for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Joyner, 57, was arrested Thursday on a warrant charging  
her with one count of misdemeanor burglary. She had been at WNUV-TV 
for a live segment, during which she spoke at length about her 
ideas on crime-fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer who issued the warrant last year happened to be  
watching the news, police spokeswoman Angelique Cook-Hayes said. 
Police were waiting for Ms. Joyner when she left the Baltimore 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras captured her leaving the station in handcuffs.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you all just making this up to make a big story?'' she  
asked a camera operator as officers led her into a squad car. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Joyner is one of the lesser-known candidates in a field of  
25 running for mayor of Baltimore, a Republican candidate in an 
overwhelmingly Democratic city. 
</P>
<P>
	During her TV appearance, Ms. Joyner spoke at length about  
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we need to retrain our police officers,'' she  
said. ``Our officers need to steer clear of the abrasiveness they 
project. Instead of abrasiveness, what about courtesy? What about 
manners?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The TV station is trying to bring all mayoral candidates onto  
its ``Newsmakers'' segment as a public service, executive producer 
John Crosset said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The newsmaker was making news in a way she didn't  
anticipate,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Workers Charged With Tainting Juice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Workers at a Port Canaveral warehouse  
refilled leaking juice storage drums with contaminated juices to 
conceal inventory damage, a federal indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of gallons of fruit juice sold nationwide from 1981 to  
1995 may have been contaminated, federal authorities said Thursday 
after a grand jury issued the two-count indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mid-Florida Freezer Warehouses allegedly acted to avoid paying  
for damaged inventory. The indictment says the company kept a 
secret inventory of contaminated juice, used the juice to ``top 
off'' damaged drums, repaired the drums and shipped them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public health was put at risk for the sake of the  
dollar,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia Collazo said. ``It's 
quite significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Allen, a manager at Mid-Florida Freezer, said Thursday the  
allegations were fabricated by a disgruntled employee. ``We feel 
they are entirely false and we have done nothing wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment does not indicate if prosecutors believe the  
illegal practice has continued since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and its president, Patrick T. Lee, were charged with  
conspiracy and making false statements to the U.S. Customs Service. 
If convicted, Lee faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison 
and a $500,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Collazo said authorities do not know where the juice ended up  
because the company did not keep records of refilled drums. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the juice was shipped to Coca-Cola for its Minute Maid  
products, she said. Juice also went to Orange-co in Bartow, one of 
Florida's largest citrus companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Bozman, a spokeswoman for Minute Maid in Houston, said the  
company is confident that no impure juice found its way into Minute 
Maid products. 
</P>
<P>
	Minute Maid provides its suppliers in Argentina and Brazil with  
seals to affix to the drums. If a seal has been tampered with, the 
company rejects the shipment, Bozman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also samples juice for taste, color and nutrition,  
and officials randomly test juices in grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's concerning us,'' Bozman said. ``It's important for us to  
reassure people we have these procedures in place.''

<HEADLINE> White House Plays Down Bomb Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said they  
didn't believe China's rare public confirmation of its nuclear 
weapons capabilities had anything to do with increasing tensions 
between China and Taiwan. But some lawmakers feared Beijing was 
``saber rattling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see the connection on Taiwan,'' State Department  
spokesman James Rubin said Thursday after an official in Beijing 
announced what U.S. intelligence officials long have known, that 
China has the neutron bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Taipei drew a threat of attack from China this week when it  
hinted that the island was ready to move toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's been as dramatic as other rhetorical  
episodes in the past, but it is significant,'' Rubin added. ``We 
don't think it's beneficial for these kind of statements to be made 
or the reactions to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China is known to have exploded a neutron bomb in 1988. But in  
an extraordinary admission Thursday, Zhao Qizheng, the chief 
Chinese government spokesman, said in Beijing that Chinese 
scientists had developed neutron bombs and miniaturized atomic 
warheads in the 1970s and '80s, without stealing U.S. secrets. He 
also gave details of Chinese programs to develop anti-submarine 
microwave technology, missile design techniques and technology to 
launch multiple satellites from a single rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, key lawmakers were concerned about China's  
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a spokeswoman, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of  
the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, ``The timing of China's 
announcement could be perceived as saber rattling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., senior Democrat on the committee,  
called China's announcement ``quite serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an escalation of the proliferation problem,'' Kerrey  
said. ``They were starting to move in the right direction. It means 
they are now moving in the wrong direction. This is not in the 
world's best interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And House International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin  
Gilman, R-N.Y., said the Chinese announcement was ``sort of a 
clouded threat to Taiwan at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did they suddenly make this announcement when this has  
been an understood fact for a number of years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman said it sends a ``clear signal to the administration''  
and ``they should recognize that this engagement with China is not 
doing what it should be doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In light of heightened tensions with China, administration  
officials did take care to note that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is 
vastly superior to China's. 
</P>
<P>
	``China, we know, has less than two dozen long-range nuclear  
weapons. The United States has over 6,000,'' White House press 
secretary Joe Lockhart said. ``We have no doubt that our nuclear 
deterrent is strong enough to protect our national interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement about the neutron bomb came in reaction to a  
congressional investigation led by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., 
into allegations the Chinese stole sensitive nuclear secrets from 
U.S. research labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said the announcement suggested nothing that would take away  
from the findings that China ``acquired weapons information through 
espionage, including specifically information about the neutron 
bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the ritual denial of espionage, but apart from that it  
is the first public acknowledgment that indeed they possess a 
neutron bomb which they had not yet deployed,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said that from a security  
standpoint, whether China developed its own neutron bomb instead of 
stealing the technology from U.S. labs was a minor issue. He said 
the United States was more concerned about other nations gaining 
nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't find it to be a particularly fruitful discussion as to  
whether they claim to have this capability internally or have 
acquired it elsewhere,'' Cohen said. ``The fact that's of concern 
to all of us is that there seems to be a proliferation of nuclear 
technology to a number of countries.''	   Neutron bombs are meant to produce a smaller blast than 
conventional nuclear weapons but more intense radiation, limiting 
physical damage while killing large numbers of people.

<HEADLINE> Reporter in Chiquita Case: Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A former Cincinnati Enquirer reporter who  
stole Chiquita executives' voice mail for an investigative series 
on the banana company was sentenced Friday to five years of 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gallagher, 41, could have gotten 2 1/2 years behind bars.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here because I did something wrong. I'm here to take  
responsibility for what I did,'' he told Common Pleas Judge Richard 
Niehaus, who also ordered him to perform 200 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the newspaper fired Gallagher, renounced his stories  
about business practices at Chiquita Brands International Inc., 
apologized to the fruit company on the front page and paid it more 
than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher pleaded guilty in September to illegally gaining  
access to Chiquita's voice mail system. 
</P>
<P>
	He also cooperated in the prosecution of former Chiquita lawyer  
George Ventura, who was identified in court as a source for the 
articles. Ventura said he was promised anonymity by the Enquirer 
and was betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Ventura pleaded no contest to supplying the secret  
codes Gallagher used to get into the voice-mailboxes. He was 
sentenced to two years of probation and 40 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiquita also sued Gallagher in federal court a year ago,  
accusing him of defaming the company and breaking into its voice 
mail. Chiquita said Friday it has settled the lawsuit. It refused 
to disclose the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer's 18-page report on Chiquita, published in May  
1998, accused the company of unsavory business practices in Central 
America. Chiquita said the reporting gave a slanted, unfair 
portrayal.

<HEADLINE> Attendance Up in Columbine Churches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- For years, Peter Gregory went to church  
sporadically and without much enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Since late April, he's been going nearly every Sunday. He puts  
his heart and soul into it, volunteering in the kitchen before 
services and offering to do computer work. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory's habits -- along with those of his wife, Kathleen -- were  
changed by the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School, where 
two seniors killed 12 students and a teacher before killing 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was so unexplainable, so incomprehensible -- you couldn't  
get your arms around it,'' Mrs. Gregory said. ``When you have those 
times in your life you need an anchor, and the church is that 
anchor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance has been up among adults and teen youth groups at  
many churches in the southwest Denver suburbs around Columbine in 
the three months since the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still like Easter Sunday every week for a lot of  
churches, particularly in the Littleton area,'' said the Rev. Lucia 
Guzman, executive director of the Colorado Council of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Services certainly doubled in attendance,'' said Ms. Guzman,  
whose estimate is echoed by officials at many churches. ``What this 
tragedy brought was a need for ritual, but the kind of ritual that 
churches can provide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the days after the shootings, residents flocked to churches  
to grieve for the victims and sought solace in a world turned 
upside-down. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastors at some churches said attendance subsided to normal or  
near-normal levels as the weeks passed and summer set in. But 
others see new worshipers every Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is definitely a weekly increase of new people coming,''  
said Chuck Moore, a spokesman for West Bowles Community Church. 
``Whether these people are around two weeks later, whether more end 
up taking their faith seriously and attending regularly, is not yet 
clear.''

<P>
	West Bowles is where funeral services were held for Columbine  
victim Cassie Bernall. The 17-year-old was shot to death after one 
of the gunmen asked her if she believed in God, and she said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her affirmation of her religious beliefs has elevated her to  
almost a martyr-like status with some. There are Internet sites 
dedicated to her life and death. She also has been credited with 
boosting spirituality among youths in the Denver area and 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the gunmen were teen-agers, church officials said much  
of the increased activity among churchgoers has involved children 
and teens. More parents are enrolling their children in youth 
programs, they said, and more adults are volunteering to spend time 
with youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gregory volunteered under church auspices at a hospital  
where some of the wounded victims have been sent for 
rehabilitation, and she signed up to teach Bible school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said that I would never work with kids, because I'm a  
mom with two kids, so that's my life all the time,'' she said. 
``Now, I want to be with the kids, I want to hang out with them. I 
want to be there, and I want my ears to be open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Steve Poos-Benson of Columbine United Church believes  
much of the increased interest is a result of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to tell someone that they need to connect with God  
when life is pretty rosy -- when they've got it all together, 
they've got a job that makes six figures, they've got kids that are 
happy, they've got a nice little neighborhood, they take nice 
vacations and their Broncos win the Super Bowl,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the shootings forced people to look into their souls and  
many didn't like what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also thinks the upsurge in church attendance will wane as  
the shootings slip into memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Many students, he said, will become confident the massacre was  
an aberration and not a sign that something is wrong with the 
community and within. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a few people's lives are changed to the point where they  
start coming to church on a regular basis, trying to develop a 
sense of who they are and of their relationship with God, then I'm 
pretty satisfied,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> HMO Medicare Pullouts Threaten Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some large health plans are leaving the  
Medicare market and the government says about 327,000 elderly 
Medicare recipients could lose their HMO coverage next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The official tally from the Health and Human Services Department  
was collected from HMOs who had to report by July 1 on their 
business intentions for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has authorized other plans to enter the Medicare  
market and subscribers losing coverage could join them or other 
plans, or opt to return to the traditional Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigna HealthCare, Pacificare Health Systems, United HealthCare,  
Humana and other large health insurance providers had already 
announced they were pulling out of Medicare coverage in selected 
markets. HMOs dropping members will have to provide service through 
the end of the year and must notify affected beneficiaries by mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the American Association of Health Plans  
estimated about 250,000 people would be affected by the HMO 
pullouts. Millions of additional seniors could face higher rates 
for fewer benefits, the trade group predicted, based on figures 
from a survey it commissioned. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6.2 million of the 39 million Medicare enrollees now get  
health insurance coverage through HMOs. Many seniors sign up with 
HMOs as an alternative to Medicare's traditional fee-for-service 
coverage because the HMOs, in addition to providing Medicare 
benefits, usually offer prescription drug coverage, fewer 
co-payments and other additional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed that some managed care plans participating  
in Medicare are making decisions that will limit the choices 
available to Medicare beneficiaries,'' said Michael Hash, 
Medicare's deputy administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Hash said the government has authorized 39 new plans to enter  
the program or expand their service areas, including four plans 
approved Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Members will be notified of precise benefit changes and premium  
increases in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Judge Reduces Drug Doctor's Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- Murder charges against a physician  
accused of giving patients large doses of painkillers that resulted 
in five overdose deaths have been reduced to involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Murder charges also were reduced to involuntary manslaughter  
Thursday against pharmacist Stephen Miller, who filled Dr. Frank 
Fisher's prescriptions. Charges against Miller's wife and pharmacy 
co-owner, Madeline, were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, a Harvard Medical School graduate, is an advocate of the  
aggressive use of narcotics to control pain, and reportedly had 
treated as many as 3,000 patients from Redding and surrounding 
Northern California communities. Most of his patients had 
prescriptions filled by the Millers because other pharmacists 
refused to fill such large orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 50 Fisher supporters attended the hearing when Judge  
William Gallagher ruled there was insufficient evidence to support 
murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters included Robert Stevens, whose wife, Tamara, 38, was  
one of the five people Fisher was originally accused of murdering. 
</P>
<P>
	``He changed her life dramatically for the better. They were  
prosecuting him for something he didn't do,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher and the Millers still face fraud charges in connection  
with more than $2 million in insurance billings. The Millers are 
accused of filling most of Fisher's prescriptions for oxycodone, a 
morphine-like painkiller, in exchange for kickbacks from the 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Fisher provided prescriptions to addicts, or  
that his patients became addicts. But Fisher's attorney, Patrick 
Hallinan, predicted that his practices would be vindicated at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Fisher is committed to what he believes in. We're going to  
defend that before a Superior Court in the manslaughter trial,'' 
Hallinan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In reducing the charges, Gallagher said the ``overwhelmingly  
high level of oxycodone'' in the victims raised the possibility the 
cases may have involved suicide or faulty autopsy results.

	Opposition Wins Indonesia Majority  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A loose group of opposition parties  
won a majority in Indonesia's first free parliamentary elections in 
44 years, election officials said today, announcing long-delayed 
unofficial results more than a month after the vote. The final 
tally will not be available until next week, but the outcome 
confirmed Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's 
founding president, as the front-runner in November's presidential 
election. Led by Megawati, the Indonesian Democratic Party for 
Struggle (PDI) won 34 percent of the vote. The ruling Golkar Party 
placed second with 22 percent, according to unofficial results. Two 
other parties loosely allied with Megawati won 12 percent and 7 
percent of the vote.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Touting a proposal to help modernize  
classrooms, President Clinton today kicks off a ``Rebuilding 
America's Schools'' campaign with middle-school students in Des 
Moines. The event at Amos Hiatt Middle School is a precursor to two 
fund-raisers in the Des Moines area for a key impeachment ally, 
Sen. Tom Harkin. Clinton also plans a closed-door session with 
farmers to talk about the economic difficulties they're facing. The 
centerpiece of Clinton's education event was a proposal, part of 
his fiscal 2000 budget, to give tax breaks to investors when they 
buy municipal bonds backing school construction and rehabilitation.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats who lost a Senate battle yesterday  
over giving patients new rights against health maintenance 
organizations uttered a few choice words to victorious Republicans: 
``We'll be back.'' With an eye on next year's elections and polls 
showing the public's desire for such rights, Democrats pledged to 
keep hammering away at the popular issue. President Clinton said 
the bill was weak and criticized its exclusion of more than 110 
million Americans with private health insurance. ``If Congress 
insists on passing such an empty promise to the American people, I 
will not sign the bill,'' he said in a written statement after the 
vote.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- Almost 7 inches of rain doused parts of Arizona  
yesterday, causing major flooding and forcing authorities to rescue 
hikers, horses and squealing pigs from the rising waters. The 
Catalina Mountains in southern Arizona were hit hard as thick 
clouds swept in from Tucson and dumped nearly 7 inches of rain 
overnight. Grand Canyon National Park rangers airlifted 26 soggy 
campers out of a campground as nearly three-quarters of an inch of 
new rain fell. The state is expected to get a break from the

deaths of three Chinese journalists in the May 7 bombing, injuries 
to 20 Chinese diplomats and damage to the embassy building. The 
U.S. side also asked Beijing for compensation for damage to 
American diplomatic offices in China in violent protests after the

Open. He is 1-over for the tournament, a shot behind Rodney 
Pampling, who has a later tee time. Two-time champion Greg Norman, 
3-under for the day and 2-over for the tournament, also moved into 
contention as overnight rain softened the greens. The conditions 
didn't help David Duval, though, who was 1-under for the day before 
collapsing over the last four holes to finish with a 75 for a two 
day total of 154.

<HEADLINE> Harkes Returns to U.S. Soccer Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Former captain John Harkes is back on the U.S.  
national soccer team, eager to help coach Bruce Arena rebuild after 
the 1998 World Cup disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkes was unceremoniously dumped less than two months before  
the World Cup by Steve Sampson, who resigned following the United 
States' last-place performance in the 32-nation field. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena decided Friday to bring back Harkes in place of defender  
David Regis for the FIFA Confederations Cup later this month. Regis 
aggravated an injury to his left knee in Tuesday's 2-1 exhibition 
victory over Derby County at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkes, in San Diego for Saturday's Major League Soccer All-Star  
game, said he didn't expect to be reunited with Arena this soon and 
didn't know whether he'll be starting or on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for me to start over with the national team and  
obviously put behind the miserable situation that happened last 
year,'' Harkes said. ``But not just for myself. I think the team 
this year under Bruce has already put that behind them with their 
performance. I think we're reconstructing the national team and to 
be part of that again is a great thrill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arena coached Harkes with D.C. United of the MLS and the  
University of Virginia. He also wrote the forward for Harkes' new 
book,''Captain for Life and Other Temporary Assignments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In it, Harkes gives his side of his disagreements with Sampson,  
who thought the player wasn't in shape and had a bad attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Writing the book was very therapeutic to me, to put out an  
objective view on what really happened behind the scenes,'' Harkes 
said. ``I think the public needs to know. Also I think to help 
educate ourselves and not let that happen again, because the 
players had the ability to do well in the World Cup. Unfortunately, 
that was taken away from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkes was a starter at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups. He said he  
has no bitterness, but made it clear the events of 1998 will always 
stay with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a player to work that hard within his career and his life,  
to dedicate himself to his sport, to go to the World Cup, to be 
captain of a team, it was just inexcusable what he did,'' Harkes 
said. ``I'll never forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkes has six goals in 86 international appearances. He was  
traded from D.C. United to New England prior to the current MLS 
season and was picked to start his third straight All-Star game.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Gray Wolves Being Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A pack of Mexican gray wolves that  
repeatedly harassed or attacked cattle in eastern Arizona is being 
relocated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officials have tracked the pack -- an adult male and  
female, a female yearling and an unknown number of pups -- for two 
weeks, following complaints from ranchers in the Apache National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult male and the yearling were recently captured and  
officials hope to catch the adult female and her pups and relocate 
the pack to an area free of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials heading the federal reintroduction program hope to  
intercede before the pups get used to livestock as a food source, 
instead of deer, elk and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried an experiment in that location and it didn't work  
and they're responding,'' said C.B. Lane, director of natural 
resources for the Arizona Cattlemen's Association, which opposes 
the reintroduction program. ``It gives us a good feeling that the 
government does understand that there's more to life than just 
where the wildlife are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, federal wildlife officials said they have confirmed  
two attacks on calves, including a death Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dyson, a spokesman for the Apache-Sitgreaves National  
Forest, said there is speculation that pups may have seen, if not 
participated, in the calf killing. Federal officials said there 
have been other instances where wolves chased cattle but were 
driven off by people. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican gray wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and  
northern Mexico but were shot, poisoned and trapped to near 
extinction by the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern  
Arizona's wilderness as part of the reintroduction program. Five 
captive-born wolves released last year were killed and others were 
re-captured.

<HEADLINE> Probation Sentence in TWA 800 Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- A couple was sentenced Friday to  
probation for conspiring to steal bits of seat material from the 
reconstructed remains of TWA Flight 800. 
</P>
<P>
	James Sanders, 53, a self-styled investigative reporter, and his  
wife Elizabeth, 52, had faced up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel much better now,'' Mrs. Sanders said outside the  
courtroom, a day before the third anniversary of the explosion that 
killed 230 people aboard the Paris-bound flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, author of the 1997 book ``The Downing of TWA Flight  
800,'' was given three years probation and 50 hours of community 
service. His wife, a former TWA employee, received one year 
probation and 25 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were convicted in April of stealing evidence from a  
civil aircraft crash site or wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor argued that Sanders conspired with his wife and a  
former TWA pilot, Terrell Stacey, to take seat fabric in December 
1996. Stacey pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Bruce Maffeo tried to blame the government for  
the Sanders' actions. He said the couple had a First Amendment 
right to take the swatches and stolen crash-related documents to 
expose a government cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three years ago tomorrow this tragedy occurred,'' Maffeo said  
before sentencing, ``and the government has yet to come up with a 
conclusive cause to this crash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his book, Sanders claimed that the U.S. Navy mistakenly shot  
down the jetliner. He believed the swatches were stained with 
missile fuel residue. The FBI said the stains were from glue. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe a fuel-air explosion in the plane's empty  
center fuel tank caused the catastrophe.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Offers To Share WTO Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Thailand said Friday it was willing to share World  
Trade Organization leadership by splitting the six-year term with 
New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The concession could end a bitter leadership struggle that has  
undermined the organization's authority as a trade policeman during 
the high-profile transatlantic disputes over bananas and 
hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan told a news conference that  
Thailand would be happy for its candidate, Deputy Prime Minister 
Supachai Panitchpakdi, to wait three years for the job as 
director-general, provided he had a completely free hand after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	That would clear the way for New Zealand's Mike Moore to move  
into WTO headquarters immediately and fill the vacuum left at the 
end of April by Italy's Renato Ruggiero. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the WTO Friday to the Thai  
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The first three years is seen by some as the plum term because  
the director-general will set the agenda for trade liberalization 
talks to be launched in November in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	But a key plan to lower more trade barriers will likely be  
finalized in the second term. Taking the second slot would also 
allow Supachai to finish his term in the current Thai Cabinet 
before the country's November 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai would take over in 2002, if the agreement is approved.  
</P>
<P>
	The bitter leadership contest began last year, souring relations  
between Supachai's Asian supporters and Moore's backers in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia proposed the share plan after it became clear that  
neither man could defeat the other. The organization makes 
decisions by consensus, rather than vote, but neither man's 
supporters would withdraw their candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief general council session Thursday, diplomats were  
upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The atmosphere here now is completely different to what it was  
before,'' said Bangladeshi Ambassador Iftekhar Chowdhury. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, some voiced concern about the power-sharing deal.  
Morocco -- whose own candidate dropped out of the race earlier this 
year -- said each man should serve just two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thai foreign minister stressed his country would not accept  
anything less than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the United States and Canada will seek final approval  
from the World Trade Organization later this month for sanctions 
against the European Union over imports of hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 26 meeting is likely to give both countries immediate  
approval to impose 100 percent tariffs on a range of imports from 
the EU, effectively pricing the items out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has not yet decided precisely which goods will be  
affected, but its preliminary list included canned meats, Roquefort 
cheese, truffles, paprika, chewing gum, chocolate, mineral water 
and motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian preliminary list included beef, cucumbers,  
gingerbread, gin, vodka and soup. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the EU ban on hormone-treated beef has been ruled  
illegal, Brussels has refused to lift it, saying some of the 
hormones could cause cancer.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jerry Hall isn't looking for love now that her  
marriage to Mick Jagger is over. But she says finding someone to

boyfriend,'' Hall, 43, said in the August issue of Harper's Bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
	She said reports that she and millionaire property developer Guy  
Dellal are about to tie the knot are not true. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want companionship again, cuddling,'' she said. ``Everybody  
wants a friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who lives in England with her four children, and Jagger  
agreed to split this month, and she received an undisclosed 
settlement. Tabloid estimates have ranged from $11 million to $15.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall had only kind words for her ex.  
</P>
<P>
	``You could say we're getting along better than we ever have.  
Even though we aren't together,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Bans Marathoner Pippig </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARMSTADT, Germany (AP) -- The German Athletics Federation  
confirmed on Friday a two-year ban of marathon runner Uta Pippig, 
saying there was no doubt she had used performance enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time Boston Marathon winner, who lives most of the  
year in Boulder, Col. tested positive there in April 1998 for 
abnormally high levels of testosterone, a male sex hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippig, 33, was banned for two years, but appealed to the German  
federation claiming the testosterone abnormalities were caused by a 
medicine for a viral infection. German drug experts have ruled out 
any such connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens Prokop, the federation's legal expert, said evidence  
from two separate samples of tests from Pippig were identical, 
leaving no doubt of a doping violation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban is retroactive to April 23, 1998 and runs through April  
22, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippig, who has insisted she is innocent, could still ask for  
independent arbitration in Germany, or appeal to the international 
sports court in Lausanne, Switzerland. She has said that regardless 
of what the legal panel decided, she would never again take part in 
an Olympics or a World Championship competition for the German 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippig won the Boston Marathon from 1994-96, and the New York  
City Marathon in 1993. She also won the Berlin Marathon three 
times.

<HEADLINE> Shareholders Reject Woolworth Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo SPD102    	
</P>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Venator Group Inc.'s management,  
struggling to transform the former Woolworth Corp. into a sporting 
goods titan, received a vote of confidence Friday from stock owners 
in a contentious feud with the company's largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator shareholders turned down an insurgent slate of  
candidates for the board from Greenway Partners, which owns more 
than 14 percent of Venator's stock. Also voted down was a Greenway 
bid to return the Woolworth name in place of Venator, which is 
Latin for hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as it relished the shareholder support, management  
conceded it does not yet know when it will snap out of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Farah, the chairman and chief executive of Venator, said  
Greenway's ``Bring Back Woolworth'' challenge was distracting. 
</P>
<P>
	He reported more than 70 percent of the shareholder votes at the  
annual meeting were cast in favor of the four nominees endorsed by 
Venator for the 11-member board, rejecting the candidates backed by 
Greenway. Nearly 70 percent voted to keep the Venator name, which 
replaced Woolworth a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a landslide victory and a clear endorsement''  
of the company's new direction, Farah told about 200 people 
attending the shareholders' meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, Venator stock edged higher, climbing 12 1/2 cents  
to close at $11.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. But 
shares still are substantially below the $28 of two years ago and 
sales and profits are down. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenway, a New York-based investment firm, had been aggressive  
about publicizing its dissatisfaction with Venator's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has attempted to bolster its profits by reducing  
costs and closing more than 4,000 stores -- including the entire 
chain of Woolworth dime stores and all of its Kinney Shoe stores. 
</P>
<P>
	It is now mostly a sporting goods chain, with stores including  
Foot Locker and Champs Sports. It also runs Northern clothing 
stores, the San Francisco Music Box and Afterthoughts, which sells 
accessories. The meeting was held at its Champs headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is looking forward to a better future, although  
executives can't predict when the sporting goods market will pick 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	For this year, ``we see spurts of good business and then it  
backs off,'' Farah said. ``I think 2000 is going to be good. The 
Olympic years are generally strong years (and) the NBA is playing a 
full season. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenway's one successful effort was adoption of a nonbinding  
resolution recommending that the company either eliminate a 
``poison-pill,'' a by-law provision which makes hostile takeovers 
prohibitively expensive, or put the question of scrapping the 
takeover defense to a shareholder vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did very well on the poison pill. They don't want to see a  
pill in,'' said Alfred Kingsley, senior managing director at 
Greenway. 
</P>
<P>
	Farah said he expected Venator's shareholders, mostly large  
institutions, to vote against any kind of poison pill, and would 
consider their recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were good listeners last year and modified it,'' he said.  
``We will listen again.''

<HEADLINE> No US Charges Vs. Reuters Analytics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have decided against filing  
any charges after completing an investigation into whether a 
Reuters subsidiary had improperly obtained information from 
Bloomberg, a major rival in the financial news business, Reuters 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal grand jury investigation was disclosed in early  
1998. Reuters said the investigators focused on the relationship 
between Reuters Analytics Inc. with a New York consultant who 
subscribed to Bloomberg and provided information from Bloomberg to 
Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters' top executive Peter Job said the British company was  
``gratified'' that no charges would be filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	But Bloomberg said in a statement that ``based on information  
available to us we believe that Reuters, in an effort to design a 
competing product, obtained improper access to the Bloomberg System 
and to Bloomberg's proprietary information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomberg also said that the decision by the U.S. attorney's  
office to close the investigation ``should not be viewed as an 
endorsement of that behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After news of the investigation became public, Reuters said it  
had placed three employees of the Stamford, Conn.-based subsidiary 
on paid leave. One of the employees has since left the company; the 
others remain on paid leave, Reuters said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Member of U.S. House Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- Rep. George E. Brown Jr., the  
oldest member of the House of Representatives who championed 
technological issues ranging from the space race to the Internet, 
has died. The California Democrat was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, the senior Democrat on the House Science Committee, died  
Thursday night after a lengthy hospital stay. He had developed an 
infection following heart surgery three months ago, his wife, Marta 
Macias Brown, said in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	News of his death saddened many and shook his constituents in  
the 42nd District, which includes the city of San Bernardino and 
other towns lying east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Brown's support for science was drawn from his deep  
belief that science and technology could help achieve a peaceful 
world and a just society,'' President Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate on the House floor stopped Friday afternoon so members  
could observe a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles,  
with a degree in industrial physics and became a civil engineer. He 
served in the Army from 1944 to 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	He was first elected to the House in 1962, representing the 29th  
Congressional District of Los Angeles County for eight years and 
making a name for himself as a foe of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, he gave up the seat to run for the Senate, but was  
defeated in a primary by Sen. John Tunney. Two years later, he won 
the seat in the 42nd District. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in his career, Brown used his post on the Science  
Committee to support space exploration, both manned and unmanned, 
earning him the title ``Mr. Science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also championed the establishment of the Environmental  
Protection Agency in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, three children, three stepchildren  
and numerous grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Montgomerie: I'm Out of It  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Colin Montgomerie won't win his  
first major at this year's British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Scot -- Europe's No. 1-ranked player the last six  
years -- shot a 5-over 76 in Friday's second round, failing to 
capitalize on lighter winds than Thursday when he opened with a 74. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid this is gone now,'' said Montgomerie, one of the  
top players never to have won a major. ``I'm out of the tournament 
now and I look forward to the U.S. PGA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie, who has missed the cut in five of the last seven  
British Opens, should make it this time. But it was his bad temper 
that got the best of him during the round, and he declined to show 
up for an interview afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-putt bogey on No. 1 set the tone. Two holes, later a fan  
with a camera was told by the Scot to put it away. On the fourth he 
berated an entire camera crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need a break, we need a break -- go away and have a  
coffee,'' he said. ``We're under enough pressure without you lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further bogeys at Nos. 7 and 8 landed him with a 3-over 39 at  
the turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie did birdie the 10th and 14th, but he also bogeyed  
the 11th and then had three more in a row from the 15th, his mood 
getting worse all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't capitalize on my draw,'' he added. ``I was struggling  
-- I didn't play well and got no luck.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Unhappy Despite Record Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Law firms booming with business are paying  
increasingly higher starting salaries, but paychecks in the six 
figures still can't halt a flight of experienced lawyers for even 
more lucrative corporate work, according to a new survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Entry-level pay at large law firms has jumped from about $85,000  
annually in 1996 to as much as $109,000 this year, said Hussam 
Hamadeh, co-author of the ``VaultReports.com Guide to America's Top 
50 Law Firms,'' a survey using lawyers' rankings on prestige and 
quality of life issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is published by New York-based VaultReports.com, a  
legal career Internet site founded in 1996. The survey is based on 
responses from 1,711 lawyers at 47 U.S. law firms and their offices 
in overseas cities. 
</P>
<P>
	For lawyers who complain of grueling hours, a limited social  
life and little family time, weekly paychecks of more than $2,000 
is insufficient. Some law firms are devising strategies to keep 
lawyers from seeking better pay at startup companies that offer 
stock options and bigger pay packages. Turnover at top firms is 
about 24 percent nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very surprising that attorneys seem dissatisfied,  
despite a dramatic increase in pay in the last couple of years,'' 
Hamadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong economy and corporate mergers and acquisitions are  
showering business on law firms, the report says. ``It's a 
double-edged sword. Associates are working harder than ever,'' he 
said, referring to younger lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore in New York was ranked most prestigious,  
which Robert Joffe, the firm's presiding partner, defined as 
quality and reputation. ``It's always nice to be rated No. 1,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, an unidentified lawyer at Cravath complained in the  
survey that an annual salary of $201,000 for a work week averaging 
90 hours is ``pathetically low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joffe said the firm's salaries are competitive, though ``we do  
lose people every now and then to investment banking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's long hours, intense pressure,'' he said of work at  
Cravath. ``It's not for everybody. It's not a 9-to-5 job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce McLean, chairman of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld in  
Washington, said the firm reduced turnover from about 22 percent to 
17 percent in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Akin, Gump, which the survey ranked 37th in prestige,  
established a new counsel position between associate and partner 
that gives qualified lawyers more responsibility, he said. The firm 
pays a $60,000 ``retention bonus'' to lawyers who become counsel 
six-and-a-half years after their hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though we have short-term pain when our clients take our  
lawyers, overall, we all need to recognize this is the market,'' 
McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Obbie, the executive editor at American Lawyer magazine in  
New York, said ``stock option fever'' is to blame for many lawyers 
who leave for Internet startup companies. ``It's lawyers wondering 
how they can make even more money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical attorney's salary is between $40,000 and $60,000,  
Obbie said. ``It's only at the narrow top of the pyramid at elite 
law firms where they make really big bucks'' of $1 million or more, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also rapped law firms for poaching lawyers from  
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, it said Dewey Ballantine, a law firm in New York,  
Washington and Los Angeles, lured attorneys in a ``poaching spree 
of soap-operatic proportion'' as it established a real estate 
presence in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Walker was among five partners who joined Dewey Ballantine  
in Los Angeles from Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &AMP; Walker earlier this 
year. ``I don't know if that was soap operatic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The movement among law firms is probably getting more intense  
right now,'' Walker added. ``A lot is money-driven.''

<HEADLINE> Australians Happy As Sampras Sits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- For the past few months, Australian  
Davis Cup captain John Newcombe heard all about how Pete Sampras 
would not play singles for the U.S. team. And Newcombe believed 
exactly none of it. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a dinner on Wednesday night, the night before the  
pairings would be drawn from the silver cup itself, something 
happened -- just a feeling, Newcombe said -- that made him think 
Americans were serious about using Sampras, the No. 3 singles 
player in the world, only in the doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two days ago, we all thought that Pete would definitely  
play,'' Newcombe said Thursday after Gullikson slotted Sampras for 
doubles in their quarterfinal tie at the Longwood Cricket Club. ``I 
sort of got the feeling last night that he wasn't going to, so we 
weren't surprised today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surprised? No.  
</P>
<P>
	Delighted? Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Joe Namath sitting out Super Bowl III, Michael Jordan  
sitting out the NBA Finals, or Cal Ripken just plain sitting out -- 
that's how surprising the American lineup is. Sampras might be the 
best singles player ever, and he won't be playing at his strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he is one of the best singles players around at the  
moment, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he is going to be a 
great doubles player,'' said Mark Woodforde, who will pair with 
Sandon Stolle to play Sampras and Alex O'Brien on Saturday. ``... I 
just can't see how he can just walk out there and believe he can 
play good doubles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's draw set the pairings and the order of the matches,  
which cannot be changed except in case of injury. Todd Martin was 
to open today against up-and-coming but relatively untested 
18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt, followed by Jim Courier vs. two-time 
U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday will be the doubles match. On Sunday, Martin will play  
Rafter before Courier takes on Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the first matches, the draw came out very well  
for us,'' Newcombe said. ``It is a must-win situation for them in 
that first match which puts a tremendous amount of pressure on 
Todd. Also, knowing that he is playing, and Pete is not playing ... 
there will be some anxious moments for them in that first match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe also noted that Gullikson left himself open to  
second-guessing. ``I wouldn't want to be in Gully's shoes if we 
win, either,'' the Australian captain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras joined the team after it beat Great Britain in the last  
round and said that, out of respect for those who had been playing 
all along, he would not take one of the singles spots. But Martin 
said he wanted the United States to field its best team, and he 
offered to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gullikson maintained that he would not upset the team's  
chemistry. To the Australians, this was merely gamesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe's intuition aside, no one except the U.S. team itself  
knew for sure who would be playing until noon on Thursday, when the 
referee drew a tennis ball from the fancy silver bowl, pulled a 
slip of paper out of the ball and read the name: Todd Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant that Sampras did not accept Martin's offer. There was  
no visible celebration from the Australians, but the news couldn't 
have been better. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I wanted to do was kind of come along and jump  
on the bandwagon. And that's why I have said for the past couple of 
months that I was just going to play doubles,'' Sampras said. ``Jim 
and Todd deserve to play singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have shown ... their commitment and I haven't been in the  
same boat. I just didn't think it was right for me to kind of come 
on the team and play singles. I never felt comfortable. Two months 
ago, I didn't feel comfortable; I don't feel comfortable now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice enough for Jim and Todd to let me be a part of the  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson said the decision was made by a team consensus.  
</P>
<P>
	``He (Sampras) strongly felt that Jim and Todd deserved the  
singles spots. Not only for what they did against Great Britain but 
the commitment they have shown over the past several years to the 
Davis Cup,'' Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel good about it. I feel good about it. The players  
feel good about it. If other people don't feel good about it, that 
is their problem.''

<HEADLINE> Book Editor Missing During Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHFORD, Wash. (AP) -- A book editor visiting Washington state  
from New York vanished last week during a hike on Mount Rainier. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter and three teams with search dogs roamed the  
mountain Thursday looking for Joe Wood but found nothing, Mount 
Rainier National Park spokeswoman Maria Gillette said. The search 
was to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, 34, was reported missing Tuesday by a friend, New York  
Times reporter Somini Sengupta. Both attended last week's Unity '99 
conference in Seattle for minority journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, a former editor at The Village Voice newspaper who has  
edited books at the New Press since 1996, left Sengupta an e-mail 
message July 8 that said he planned to spend the afternoon hiking. 
</P>
<P>
	His rental car was found Wednesday night at a parking lot in the  
national park. Another hiker said he saw Wood hiking the afternoon 
of July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears he was not on the main trail, but he was on a trail  
following other hikers' footprints,'' Gillette said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo's 'President' Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's moderate ethnic Albanian  
leader and Serbia's opposition leaders are bracing for separate 
power struggles as the spotlight in Yugoslavia turns from the 
battlefield to the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo moderate, Ibrahim Rugova, was twice elected  
``president'' of the Serbian province by its ethnic Albanian 
majority in voting ignored by Belgrade and unrecognized by much of 
the world. He was the West's main contact for much of the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters lined the hilly two-lane highway that twists 40 miles  
from the Macedonian border north to Pristina to welcome Rugova home 
from self-imposed exile Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rugova has lost much of his support. He has been hurt by  
Serbian TV footage of his meetings with President Slobodan 
Milosevic during the NATO bombing campaign, and by his subsequent 
decision to leave Kosovo for Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rugova has said he met with Milosevic under duress, and even  
detractors accept that he fled the province because he feared for 
his safety. 
</P>
<P>
	However, his KLA rivals, particularly Kosovo Liberation Army  
chief Hashim Thaci, staked claims to the leadership of Kosovo's 
Albanians during Rugova's absence. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA now calls itself the dominant force in the province,  
saying it controls most local administrative areas except for three 
run by Serbs in areas where they are the majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both Rugova and the KLA have pledged to cooperate,  
there were hints Thursday of a possible struggle for control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are skeptical, but we hope he will cooperate,'' said Rame  
Buja, a former Rugova aide who is now part of the KLA leadership. 
He criticized Rugova, though, for meeting with Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``His going to Belgrade when all the massacres were happening  
was very shameful,'' Buja told The Associated Press, dismissing 
Rugova's claims that his family had been held hostage by the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about our families whom we lost during the war?'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turmoil of a different kind is gripping the rest of Serbia,  
where opposition leaders continue staging protests against 
Milosevic but are hampered by divisions that prevent them from 
mounting a more effective unified front. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 protesters responded Thursday to a call by the  
opposition Alliance for Change for an anti-Milosevic rally in the 
central Serbian town of Kragujevac. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two weeks, thousands have called for the  
president's ouster, signaling growing discontent with the hard-line 
policies that led to the NATO air campaign and to the virtual loss 
of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opposition remains fragmented by deep distrust among  
leaders, left over from the wrangling of late 1996 and early 1997 
that destroyed a unified mass movement to unseat Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with a Berlin radio station, one of those  
leaders, Zoran Djindjic, urged a rival, former Yugoslav Vice 
Premier Vuk Draskovic, to renew their past alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic must resign by September,'' said Djindjic, the top  
Alliance for Change figure, warning of ``social tensions and 
humanitarian catastrophe'' as impoverished Serbs try to survive the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at the Kragujevac rally, fellow protest leaders Vuk  
Obradovic and Velimir Ilic also appealed to Draskovic -- who 
announced he was planning separate demonstrations -- to join forces 
with them instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, pro-democracy activists in Belgrade were severely  
beaten while petitioning for Milosevic's ouster, an opposition 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragan Kopcalic of the Democratic Party accused the ruling  
neo-communist coalition of sending ``criminals'' to beat up six 
opposition activists. Three were hospitalized, one with serious 
injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alliance for Change, which includes the Democratic Party,  
has organized the anti-Milosevic petitions all over Serbia. Some 
20,000 residents have signed the petition in Belgrade since Monday, 
organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Recker Undergoes Further Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Former Indiana basketball star Recker undergoes additional surgery    	
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former Indiana basketball star Luke Recker  
was released from Methodist Hospital on Friday after undergoing 
orthopedic surgery on his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker suffered a fracture dislocation of one of the small bones  
at the base of his left thumb, said Dr. Arthur C. Rettig, who 
performed the surgery at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery took about an hour. Recker's recovery time should be  
approximately 3-5 months at which time he should be released for 
full activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Hoosier was released from Mercy Hospital in Durango,  
Colo., on Thursday and flew to Indianapolis by private aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was one of several Recker received late Saturday  
night when the vehicle he was in was involved in a three-car crash. 
Doctors at Mercy did not immediately discover the fracture after he 
was admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``A review of his original X-rays following continued swelling  
on his left wrist led doctors to determine he does have a 
fracture,'' Mercy spokesman Joe Wade Plunk said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, who transferred to Arizona after last season, severely  
lacerated his left ear in the accident, which killed the driver of 
the car Recker was in. Recker's girlfriend, Kelly Craig, 19, and 
her brother, Jason Craig, 17, both of Jasper, Ind., were 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunk said Recker seemed in good spirits during a visit  
Wednesday, but ``his main concern is his girlfriend, who is in the 
hospital in Farmington, N.M. He more or less feels helpless to help 
her, and now he's going back to Indianapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Craig, who suffered a spinal fracture and partial  
paralysis, was in serious condition at San Juan Regional Medical 
Center in Farmington, and Jason Craig was in critical condition 
with a head injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just so scared -- scared for my girlfriend and  
her brother,'' Recker told The Durango Herald on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I get healthy and Kelly and Jason are healthy, I'll be  
anxious to get back on the court,'' he said. ``But right now, it's 
not the most important thing to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker and four friends were hurt in the accident near Durango.  
Recker was a passenger in a vehicle driven by John Hollberg, 23, of 
Senoia, Ga., who was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old Recker was not planning to play basketball at  
Arizona next season. NCAA rules require that he sit out the 
upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the pickup truck, 21-year-old Bob Hardwick, was  
being held on $50,000 bond for investigation of vehicular homicide, 
reckless driving, driving under the influence, careless driving 
resulting in bodily injury and vehicular assault.

<HEADLINE> 4 Mariners, 3 Dodgers Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dodgers bullpen coach Rick Dempsey was suspended  
for 17 days while Todd Hundley and Jay Buhner were among six 
players penalized Friday following a bench-clearing brawl between 
Los Angeles and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Paniagua and Damaso Marte, David Segui and Buhner were  
suspended from the Mariners. Jamie Arnold, Hundley and Dempsey were 
suspended from the Dodgers. All seven also were fined. 
</P>
<P>
	All four of the Mariners players plan to appeal their  
suspensions, vice president Lee Pelekoudas said. Hundley, fined 
$2,500, said he intends to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to appeal this all the way,'' said Buhner, who played  
in his first game since May 18 in the Safeco Field opener Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like being docked four days because I was  
standing up for a teammate is worthy of it,'' he said. ``That's why 
I'm going to appeal it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-minute fight broke out last Sunday at Dodger Stadium after  
Seattle's Frankie Rodriguez threw a pitch at Mark Grudzielanek's 
head. The brawl led to seven ejections. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it was an interleague game, AL president Gene Budig and  
NL president Len Coleman jointly announced the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey, suspended from Saturday until Aug. 3 for running in  
from the bullpen and fined $1,000, wants to talk to Coleman on 
Saturday before deciding whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise me because every altercation I've ever  
been involved in during 30-some odd years in this game, it seems 
like I've always gotten the highest fine and longest suspension 
every time out,'' Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason for me to be suspended any more than any  
player -- certainly not more than any of the guys who were throwing 
punches in the melee,'' he said. ``They sent me no letter saying 
that I'm supposed to be a peacemaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paniagua's five-game suspension was to start Friday night  
against San Diego. The reliever was penalized for fighting, 
attempting to kick another player and using an obscene gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold also was suspended for five games. The reliever's penalty  
was to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner's four-game penalty was to start July 24. The outfielder  
was on the disabled list when he took part in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley's three-game suspension was to start Saturday against  
Anaheim. The catcher was cited for fighting, being out of control 
and using obscene gestures in view of fans and television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I will say is that I was not instigating the  
fight. I'm not an advocate of violence at all. I was just 
protecting my teammates and a couple of them that got 
sucker-punched in the pile,'' Hundley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding Dempsey's long penalty, Hundley said, ``I've been in  
worse fights than that, but those types of suspensions haven't 
occurred. So I guess they're really trying to crack down and make 
an example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marte, another reliever, was given a three-game suspension that  
was to start Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Segui got a one-game suspension, which the first baseman was to  
serve July 28. He was fined $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner, Arnold, Paniagua and Marte each were fined $1,000.

<HEADLINE> ValuJet Suspects Surrender to FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three men indicted in the 1996 ValuJet crash have  
been released on bond, vowing to defeat charges that they allowed 
mislabeled oxygen canisters to be loaded on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say the canisters, mislabeled as empty, started a  
fire in the cargo hold that led to the deadly crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never thought those used generators would get on an  
airplane. They should not have gotten on an airplane. They took 
steps to keep them off airplanes,'' said Jane Moscowitz, the lawyer 
for SabreTech Inc. mechanics Eugene Florence and Mauro Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
	They and Daniel Gonzalez, SabreTech's former vice president of  
maintenance, appeared in federal court Thursday and were released 
on $50,000 bond. They are charged with conspiracy and making false 
statements in connection with the May 11, 1996, crash in the 
Everglades that killed 110 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, SabreTech has been charged with murder and  
manslaughter for illegally packaging the oxygen canisters, which 
also were missing the required yellow safety caps. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the men could be sentenced to up to 55 years in prison  
and fined $2.7 million if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	This is believed to be the first time that criminal charges have  
been filed against maintenance workers over a U.S. plane crash.

<HEADLINE> Cheever Struggles in Qualifyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) -- Eddie Cheever has struggled in qualifying  
all year. Things only got worse Friday night at Atlanta Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Indianapolis 500 champion managed just 210.674 mph on  
his two-lap run, which means he will start a season-worst 21st 
Saturday night in the Indy Racing League's Kobalt Mechanics Tools 
500 
</P>
<P>
	Only four other drivers who got on the track produced slower  
speeds than Cheever, who is still fourth in the IRL point standings 
despite lackluster qualifying performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boring and slow, which is not good for qualifying,'' Cheever  
said after his run. ``We were great in traffic (during practice). 
Once again, we will start from the back of the field, and we will 
have to work our way to the front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever's car is the only one in the field powered by an  
Infiniti engine. The others use the Oldsmobile Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been able to do 215s consistently (in practice), but  
when we are by ourselves, we're absolutely stuck,'' Cheever said. 
``We thought we'd be doing a 213, so we're definitely surprised 
with 210s. It is so easy to go flat here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever qualifying fifth at Texas, but hasn't started higher  
than 11th in the other events. But he won at Disney World and 
finished fourth in the last race at Pikes Peak, moving within 
striking distance of season points leader Scott Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've started from the back before and had great results,''  
Cheever said. ``It'll just be a long, hard race. I'll keep passing 
cars until there are no other cars to pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *SCHMIDT'S SIDEBURNS:* Sam Schmidt raced with a crew cut in  
1998. Now, some fans are mistaking him for Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Schmidt, who replaced Arie Luyendyk at Treadway  
Racing, has allowed his brown hair to grow throughout the season. 
It's long and wavy on top, accompanied by sideburns that stretch 
nearly to the corners of his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I had the flat top,'' Schmidt said. ``But I've just  
got a funky-shaped head. It's an ugly-looking melon, so I decided 
enough of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sideburns had reached the bottom of his ears when he went to  
Disney World for the first race of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were calling me Elvis,'' he said with a laugh, ``so I  
decided to let them grow a little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, who has a master's degree in business administration,  
recognized the need to draw attention to the fledgling IRL and its 
drivers by whatever means possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Halfway through the year, I realized it was an association  
thing,'' he said. ``They were selling a cartoon T-shirt at Indy 
with the sideburns. At autograph sessions, 10 or 15 people always 
tell me, `Love the sideburns.' Whether it's good or bad, we need to 
get people talking about things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long hair and sideburns didn't slow Schmidt on the track. He  
qualified third Friday night at 214.737 mph -- the best run of his 
IRL career. 
</P>
<P>
	His previous best came just three weeks ago, when he had the  
fourth-best time for the Radisson 200 at Fountain, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KITE'S HOMECOMING:* Jimmy Kite, who was raised in nearby  
Stockbridge, will start 11th in his first Indy-car race at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Kite averaged 212.799 mph on the 1.54-mile oval,  
where he has been a spectator the past decade. He'll have one of 
the best seats in the house Saturday night, taking the green flag 
on the inside of the sixth row for McCormack Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched so many races here,'' Kite said. ``It's a neat  
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He knew his car was unlikely to challenge for the pole, going  
nearly 2 1/2 mph slower than top qualifier Billy Boat. But Kite is 
confident of a strong performance in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can run the same car all race long tomorrow night,'' he  
said. ``How many guys up front will be that consistent?'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FORMULA 2000:* Steve Rikert of Rhinebeck, N.Y., led from start  
to finish in a Formula 2000 qualifying race, which means he will 
start from the pole Saturday in a preliminary to the IRL event. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the field was tightly bunched throughout the 24-lap  
qualifier, Rikert never felt seriously threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	``The race went real smoothly for me,'' he said. ``I wanted to  
be up front and I basically dictated the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT FILLERS:* A crowd estimated at less than 2,000 turned out  
on a clear, warm night -- hardly a good omen when advance ticket 
sales for Saturday night have been lackluster. ... Boat will start 
from the top spot for the eighth time in his IRL career. ... Mark 
Dismore, who qualified fourth, is making his 12th straight start in 
the top 10 -- an IRL record. ... This is the closest starting field 
in IRL history, with only 0.620 seconds separating Boat from the 
final qualifier, Raul Boesel. ... Tyce Carlson and Donnie Beechler 
didn't make a qualifying run and will start 26th and 27th, 
respectively. ... The eighth row is all Lazier. Buddy qualified 
15th and brother Jacques 16th.

<HEADLINE> Australians Happy As Sampras Sits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- For the past few months, Australian  
Davis Cup captain John Newcombe heard all about how Pete Sampras 
would not play singles for the U.S. team. And Newcombe believed 
exactly none of it. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a dinner on Wednesday night, the night before the  
pairings would be drawn from the silver cup itself, something 
happened -- just a feeling, Newcombe said -- that made him think 
Americans were serious about using Sampras, the No. 3 singles 
player in the world, only in the doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two days ago, we all thought that Pete would definitely  
play,'' Newcombe said Thursday after Gullikson slotted Sampras for 
doubles in their quarterfinal tie at the Longwood Cricket Club. ``I 
sort of got the feeling last night that he wasn't going to, so we 
weren't surprised today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surprised? No.  
</P>
<P>
	Delighted? Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Joe Namath sitting out Super Bowl III, Michael Jordan  
sitting out the NBA Finals, or Cal Ripken just plain sitting out -- 
that's how surprising the American lineup is. Sampras might be the 
best singles player ever, and he won't be playing at his strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he is one of the best singles players around at the  
moment, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he is going to be a 
great doubles player,'' said Mark Woodforde, who will pair with 
Sandon Stolle to play Sampras and Alex O'Brien on Saturday. ``... I 
just can't see how he can just walk out there and believe he can 
play good doubles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's draw set the pairings and the order of the matches,  
which cannot be changed except in case of injury. Todd Martin was 
to open today against up-and-coming but relatively untested 
18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt, followed by Jim Courier vs. two-time 
U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday will be the doubles match. On Sunday, Martin will play  
Rafter before Courier takes on Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the first matches, the draw came out very well  
for us,'' Newcombe said. ``It is a must-win situation for them in 
that first match which puts a tremendous amount of pressure on 
Todd. Also, knowing that he is playing, and Pete is not playing ... 
there will be some anxious moments for them in that first match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe also noted that Gullikson left himself open to  
second-guessing. ``I wouldn't want to be in Gully's shoes if we 
win, either,'' the Australian captain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras joined the team after it beat Great Britain in the last  
round and said that, out of respect for those who had been playing 
all along, he would not take one of the singles spots. But Martin 
said he wanted the United States to field its best team, and he 
offered to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gullikson maintained that he would not upset the team's  
chemistry. To the Australians, this was merely gamesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe's intuition aside, no one except the U.S. team itself  
knew for sure who would be playing until noon on Thursday, when the 
referee drew a tennis ball from the fancy silver bowl, pulled a 
slip of paper out of the ball and read the name: Todd Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant that Sampras did not accept Martin's offer. There was  
no visible celebration from the Australians, but the news couldn't 
have been better. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I wanted to do was kind of come along and jump  
on the bandwagon. And that's why I have said for the past couple of 
months that I was just going to play doubles,'' Sampras said. ``Jim 
and Todd deserve to play singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have shown ... their commitment and I haven't been in the  
same boat. I just didn't think it was right for me to kind of come 
on the team and play singles. I never felt comfortable. Two months 
ago, I didn't feel comfortable; I don't feel comfortable now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice enough for Jim and Todd to let me be a part of the  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson said the decision was made by a team consensus.  
</P>
<P>
	``He (Sampras) strongly felt that Jim and Todd deserved the  
singles spots. Not only for what they did against Great Britain but 
the commitment they have shown over the past several years to the 
Davis Cup,'' Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel good about it. I feel good about it. The players  
feel good about it. If other people don't feel good about it, that 
is their problem.''

<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The United States won't channel aid to  
the Colombian government's 35-year fight against leftist rebels, 
the U.S. ambassador said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. aid to Colombia is currently about $236 million per year,  
including helicopters and training, most of which goes to the 
national police for anti-narcotics operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassador Curtis Kamman, however, recognized that the line  
dividing anti-narcotics and anti-insurgent operations is often 
blurred. The rebels increasingly fund their campaigns by taxing the 
drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian armed forces chief has denied that U.S.  
intelligence was used to battle a weekend rebel offensive which 
left over 200 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting with U.S. congressmen on Thursday, Colombian  
defense minister Luis Fernando Ramirez requested an extra $500 
million in aid over the next two years, including aircraft and 
radar technology, El Espectador newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia requested a credit line of  
about $3 billion from the International Monetary Fund, the finance 
minister said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was intended ``to make everyone understand that  
Colombia will maintain a solid exchange policy...behind which there 
is a serious fiscal and macroeconomic policy,'' Juan Camilo 
Restrepo told a local radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF credit request is Colombia's first since 1973.  
</P>
<P>
	Colombia never made use of the previous line of credit, and  
minister Restrepo stressed that the request -- announced by the 
central bank on Thursday -- was unlikely to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're traveling a rocky road, it's better to take a  
spare tire with you,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian peso has dropped by about 15 percent against the  
dollar since January, while the economy shrank by 5.9 percent 
compared to same period last year.

	Microsoft Valued Above $500B  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. became the first company to be  
worth more than half a trillion dollars today as the software 
company's stock price surged following a report that it might 
create a separate stock for its Internet properties. Microsoft's 
stock ended up 5 1/16 at 99 7/16 a share on the Nasdaq. With more 
than 5.1 billion shares outstanding, that gave Microsoft a total 
market capitalization of about $505 billion. Microsoft's market 
value far outpaces the No. 2 company, General Electric, which was 
worth about $384 billion based on today's stock prices.

	Microsoft Wins Conn. Antitrust Case  
</P>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A federal court jury today found that  
Microsoft Corp. did not violate antitrust laws in its dealings with 
a small software company. Antitrust experts said Microsoft's 
victory was clearly important but was expected to have little 
impact in the much larger antitrust case in Washington, D.C., 
brought by the Justice Department and 19 states. Although it 
cleared Microsoft innocent of violating the antitrust laws, the 
Connecticut jury did find that Microsoft committed a deceptive act 
that violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. It 
awarded plaintiff Bristol Technology Inc. just $1 in that claim.

	Industrial Output Rises in June  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Output at the nation's factories, mines and  
utilities rose 0.2 percent in June, finishing the best quarter for 
manufacturing in more than a year. The figure announced by the 
Federal Reserve today matched the gain in output in May, and was in 
line with analysts' expectations. The June performance left 
industrial output rising at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the 
second quarter, the best showing since a 6.6 percent rate of 
increase in the final three months of 1997. The growth rate in the 
April-June quarter this year was triple the 1.3 percent growth rate 
of the first quarter.

	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A sag in sales of large engines and large  
machines trimmed second-quarter earnings for Caterpillar Inc. by 37 
percent compared to last year, the heavy-equipment manufacturer 
reported today. Because of a 9 percent drop in the sales volume of 
large engines and machines, Caterpillar also revised its profit 
outlook for the year, lowering its anticipated profit per share to 
a quarter of what it was in 1998. Caterpillar reported earnings of 
78 cents per share for the second quarter, 42 cents less than last 
year. Shares of Caterpillar ended at 38 15/16, down 9/16.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Leaders of the union representing American  
Airlines pilots will consider a proposal from a federal mediator to 
settle a dispute that led pilots to stage a sickout earlier this 
year. The sickout caused the cancellation of more than 6,000 
flights and led to a $45.5 million fine against the union. A 
spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association denied that the pilots 
and American's parent company, AMR Corp., have reached an agreement 
over absorbing Reno Air pilots into the American system. ``What we 
have is a mediator's proposal that we've agreed to take to our 
board,'' Gregg Overman, spokesman for the union, said today.

disappointed'' with the results ``in light of an increasingly

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly and Co. plans to spend $1 billion  
on expansion in Indiana that will create up to 7,500 new jobs over 
the next decade. The expansion, announced today, includes 
improvements at the pharmaceutical company's headquarters in 
downtown Indianapolis and other facilities across the state. The 
jobs plans would increase Lilly's current Indianapolis employment 
of about 9,000 people by 83 percent. The city of Indianapolis and 
the state of Indiana also agreed to provide over the next decade 
incentives worth up to $214 million. Many of the new jobs are 
expected to be high-paying positions, such as scientific and 
computer specialist jobs. Lilly shares were unchanged at 76 7/8.

	GM: Considers Owning All of Saab  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will decide soon on a  
possible buyout of the remaining half of Saab Automobile AB, the 
president of GM-Europe says. GM acquired half of Saab from the 
Swedish holding company Investor AB for $600 million in 1989 and 
has an option to buy the remaining half for the six months starting 
July 31. The Swedish automaker's chief executive announced in March 
that talks would begin this month on whether GM will exercise its 
takeover option. Taking complete control over the struggling 
automaker is seen as a way to give GM a stronger position in the 
global luxury car market.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said  
today after a visit to Cuba that the emergence of a small private 
sector on the island offers ``a small but hopeful opening'' that 
the chamber wants to help develop. Thomas J. Donohue, chamber 
president and chief executive officer, said at a news conference 
and in a written statement that while there is no evidence of a 
change in Cuba's ideology, it is significant that certain 
entrepreneurial activities are now permitted as part of a reform 
process. He said the chamber will be working with Cubans over the 
next few weeks to flesh out the details on building relationships 
with both independent companies and public corporations.

<HEADLINE> New York Times Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. has reported an 11  
percent rise in second-quarter income, due largely to higher 
advertising revenue and lower newsprint prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Thursday it earned $83.5 million, or 47  
cents per share, in its second quarter. The results did not include 
a $4 million pre-tax charge for expenses related to staff 
reductions at The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period a year ago, the company earned $75 million,  
or 38 cents a share. Excluding the effect of a one-time expense 
related to debt reduction, the year-ago profits were $78.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter rose 4 percent to $779.4 million from  
$749.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising revenues in the New York Times' newspaper business,  
which makes up 91 percent of the company's revenues, rose 6.6 
during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains were strongest at The New York Times, where ad  
revenues increased 8.8 percent. Ad revenues at the Globe also rose, 
posting a gain of 1.8 percent following two quarters of declines.

<HEADLINE> Gore Praises Alan Greenspan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While President Clinton has not yet tipped his  
hand about reappointing Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, 
Vice President Al Gore has sent a strong signal that he would favor 
such an action, calling Greenspan's performance ``A-plus-plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's current four-year term as head of the central bank  
ends on June 20, 2000, and there has been widespread speculation 
that President Clinton will end up asking him to stay on for a 
fourth term rather than try to win confirmation of someone else by 
the Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about that possibility Thursday, Gore said that he and  
Clinton had a policy of avoiding public discussions of personnel 
matters until it was time to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Democratic presidential hopeful added, ``I'll send you  
the clearest signal I think is appropriate to send. ... I 
personally believe that no one could have possibly done a better 
job. I think he has done an outstanding job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Greenspan's ``overall record is one of really an  
outstanding A-plus-plus performance. And so you can interpret that 
I hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That strong endorsement of Greenspan, a Republican, from the  
Democratic front-runner follows similar comments from the camp of 
the GOP presidential front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Lindsey, an economic adviser to Bush who served as a  
Fed board member with Greenspan, has said that Clinton should not 
wait until Greenspan's term is over but rather announce immediately 
his decision to reappointment him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan has come to be seen as the economy's indispensable  
man and the prospect that he might depart when his term expires 
next June is creating uncertainty about the future course of 
monetary policy,'' Lindsey wrote in an opinion piece for The Wall 
Street Journal on July 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taken together, this is a potent recipe for economic trouble --  
the most effective remedy for which is for President Clinton to 
reappoint Mr. Greenspan at once for another term,'' Lindsey wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said this month that he has yet to have a discussion  
with Greenspan about the Fed job, but there is a widespread view in 
Congress that Greenspan is likely to be asked to stay on by Clinton 
because of Clinton's approval of Greenspan's handling of the 
economy and the difficulty of gaining approval for anyone else in 
Clinton's last year in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, 73, a prominent Republican economist, was first  
appointed Fed chairman in 1987 by Ronald Reagan. He is serving his 
third four-year term, having been reappointed by Presidents Bush 
and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for Greenspan is not universal among presidential  
candidates currently in the field. Republican presidential 
candidate Steve Forbes criticized Greenspan last month after the 
Fed nudged up a key interest rate by a quarter-point. Forbes 
complained that Fed policies over the past 18 months have been too 
restrictive and have contributed to the steep plunge in farm 
commodity prices.

<HEADLINE> NASA Female Commander Counts Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's first female shuttle  
commander arrived today for the countdown to her launch as space 
buffs gathered to celebrate the 30th anniversary of man's first 
mission to land on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Col. Eileen Collins waved and smiled broadly as she  
brought her T-38 jet to a halt. She and her crew were greeted by 
NASA officials as well as a crowd of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to see such interest in our flight,'' the  
42-year-old Collins said. ``I've heard this said before many times, 
and it really means something to me now: This crew is ready to fly, 
and we are just so excited about taking up the Chandra X-ray 
Observatory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, the shuttle crew arrived on the 30th anniversary  
of the day Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael 
Collins blasted off for the moon. Liftoff is scheduled for Tuesday, 
the 30th anniversary of their historic landing. That's also a 
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The five shuttle astronauts made no mention of the anniversary,  
being celebrated at Kennedy Space Center throughout the day. 
Instead, they talked a lot about the Chandra Observatory, stored 
aboard Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.5 billion Chandra is the biggest and most powerful X-ray  
telescope ever built. Collins and her crew will drop the telescope 
into orbit seven hours after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope was supposed to be launched last summer, but was  
delayed by a variety of problems, including concern over its 
attached motor, needed to boost it into the right orbit. NASA 
cleared the motor for flight just last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar motor malfunctioned in April on a military satellite  
and left it stranded in a useless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia was the only space shuttle big enough to haul up  
Chandra, at 50,000 pounds NASA's largest payload ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``What most people say when they talk about Columbia, they talk  
about it being the oldest and the heaviest orbiter in the fleet,'' 
said Steven Hawley, 47, an astronaut for 21 years who will help 
deploy the telescope. ``And I discovered as I get a little older 
and heavier myself, I kind of relate to that, so I feel good about 
our association with Columbia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The countdown for Tuesday's 12:36 a.m. launch begins tonight.

<HEADLINE> United States 94, Canada 60 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Blood was spilled, tempers flared  
and Canada played well enough to hold the United States under 100 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the closer games the United States has played with a  
roster of NBA players, the Americans defeated Canada 94-60 Thursday 
in the first round of their Olympic qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, a close game is a relative term when the Americans  
are using NBA players, and the outcome of this game was never in 
doubt. But Canada, after falling behind 24-4 in the first 6 1/2 
minutes, nearly got its deficit back to single digits before 
watching the United States pull away early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton led the Americans in scoring for the second straight  
game with 20 points, Tim Duncan added 18, Kevin Garnett had 15 and 
Jason Kidd handed out 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans were held under 100 points for only the sixth time  
in 32 games with NBA players, and the final total of 94 was the 
Americans' second-lowest in that span. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had their first international incident of this  
tournament late in the first half when Tom Gugliotta and Canadian 
center Peter Guarasci engaged in some pushing and shoving after a 
foul by Gugliotta opened a gaping cut on Guarasci's forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	The cut bled heavily, and the visibly angered Guarasci had to  
immediately leave the game. He returned in the second half with 
several stitches in his forehead, later blowing an uncontested 
dunk. 
</P>
<P>
	It took just three seconds for the United States to record its  
first dunk, a jam by Duncan off a quick pass from Allan Houston an 
eyeblink after Garnett won the opening tap. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3-pointer, a three-point play and a fast-break layup by Payton  
made it 12-3, and a pretty alley-oop pass from Payton to Garnett 
completed a 12-0 run that made it 24-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's next four baskets were 3-pointers, and the deficit was  
down to 36-23 with 6:07 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	But Payton had a fast-break layup to begin a 22-7 run spanning  
the first 9 1/2 minutes of the second half as the United States took a 
66-36 lead, and the only suspense after that was whether U.S. coach 
Larry Brown would leave rookies Elton Brand and Wally Szcerbiak on 
the bench for the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand finally checked in with 5:52 left, and his bucket with  
1:38 left gave the United States 88 points -- ensuring it would 
eclipse its 87-point outing against Angola in 1996 that was the 
lowest-scoring game the Americans (2-0) have ever played with an 
NBA roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak played the final three minutes, scoring four points.  
The American' other NBA rookie, Richard Hamilton, missed his second 
straight game due to a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Newton had 10 points to lead Canada (2-1).  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Nash of the Dallas Mavericks, Canada's only NBA veteran,  
shot 2-for-7 and had five points, six turnovers and one assist. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier game, Argentina (1-1) defeated Cuba 81-76,  
virtually assuring that Cuba (0-3) will be eliminated from Group A. 
</P>
<P>
	In late games, it was Brazil (1-1) vs. Puerto Rico (1-0) and  
Panama (0-1) vs. Venezuela (1-1).

<HEADLINE>  India Claims Victory in Kashmir War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- India claimed its two-month war against  
Islamic fighters in Kashmir was nearly over today after its 
military reported hundreds of guerrillas returning to 
Pakistani-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian air force jets flew over the Himalayas to monitor the  
withdrawal. Thousands of Indian soldiers advanced at daybreak to 
reoccupy mountain peaks the Islamic fighters had captured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over -- they have withdrawn in most areas and are  
withdrawing in the ones left,'' a senior military intelligence 
officer told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. ``We are not expecting any surprises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another officer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
it would take two or three days to verify that all the guerrillas 
had left Indian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	A military spokesman in New Delhi said the deadline for the  
evacuation was extended at Pakistan's request by 24 hours until 
dawn Saturday to allow stragglers time to cross the cease-fire 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, one soldier was killed in the Batalik area east of  
Kargil on Thursday night by sniper fire from Pakistani territory, 
said officers at brigade headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,200 combatants have been reported killed in the  
past nine weeks of fighting, the worst conflict involving India and 
Pakistan since their 1971 war. 
</P>
<P>
	India has insisted that many Pakistani soldiers were fighting  
alongside Islamic guerrillas. Pakistan says its troops were not 
involved and the fighters in Kashmir were local Muslim insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian army engineers moved with the troops today to search for  
land mines they believe were strewn across the mountains by the 
retreating fighters. Six Indian soldiers were wounded by land 
mines, four of them in a single explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Brajesh Mishra, security adviser to Indian Prime Minister Atal  
Bihari Vajpayee, said Thursday the fighters could be given one or 
two more days to complete the withdrawal if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that we shall resume our military operations,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Indian officers on the front said the fighters had vacated their  
fortified stone bunkers and cleared the heights in the battle 
regions of Batalik, Kaksar and Dras. The pullout was nearly 
complete in the Mushkoh Valley, where some of the bloodiest battles 
were fought, the intelligence officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	India had agreed to halt airstrikes and heavy ground attacks to  
allow the opposition forces to retreat across the so-called Line of 
Control, the 1972 cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between the 
two nuclear-armed neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the disengagement agreement, Indian troops will advance to  
within half a mile of the cease-fire line. The Indian military says 
the guerrillas are supposed to retreat at least half a mile from 
the line into Pakistani territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides would then discuss further measures to avoid  
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian army was making plans to permanently occupy the  
heights that until now they have abandoned during the winter, when 
up to 10 feet of snow blankets the mountains and icy winds push the 
temperatures down to 75 below zero in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	With the halt in fighting, Indian intelligence officials will  
likely face questions regarding their failure to detect the rival 
forces' infiltration, which apparently had been under way for 
months before the fighters were discovered in early May. The 
opposition Congress Party, gearing up for elections, has accused 
the Indian government of negligence in failing to safeguard the 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three wars that India and Pakistan have fought since  
their independence from Britain in 1947 have been over Kashmir. 
Both countries claim the Himalayan territory in its entirety.

evacuation was extended at Pakistan's request by 24 hours until 
dawn Saturday to allow stragglers time to cross the cease-fire 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, one soldier was killed in the Batalik area east of  
Kargil on Thursday night by sniper fire from Pakistani territory, 
said officers at brigade headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,200 combatants have been reported killed in the  
past nine weeks of fighting, the worst conflict involving India and 
Pakistan since their 1971 war. 
</P>
<P>
	India has insisted that many Pakistani soldiers were fighting  
alongside Islamic guerrillas. Pakistan says its troops were not 
involved and the fighters in Kashmir were local Muslim insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian army engineers moved with the troops today to search for  
land mines they believe were strewn across the mountains by the 
retreating fighters. Six Indian soldiers were wounded by land 
mines, four of them in a single explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Brajesh Mishra, security adviser to Indian Prime Minister Atal  
Bihari Vajpayee, said Thursday the fighters could be given one or 
two more days to complete the withdrawal if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that we shall resume our military operations,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Indian officers on the front said the fighters had vacated their  
fortified stone bunkers and cleared the heights in the battle 
regions of Batalik, Kaksar and Dras. The pullout was nearly 
complete in the Mushkoh Valley, where some of the bloodiest battles 
were fought, the intelligence officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	India had agreed to halt airstrikes and heavy ground attacks to  
allow the opposition forces to retreat across the so-called Line of 
Control, the 1972 cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between the 
two nuclear-armed neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the disengagement agreement, Indian troops will advance to  
within half a mile of the cease-fire line. The Indian military says 
the guerrillas are supposed to retreat at least half a mile from 
the line into Pakistani territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides would then discuss further measures to avoid  
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian army was making plans to permanently occupy the  
heights that until now they have abandoned during the winter, when 
up to 10 feet of snow blankets the mountains and icy winds push the 
temperatures down to 75 below zero in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	With the halt in fighting, Indian intelligence officials will  
likely face questions regarding their failure to detect the rival 
forces' infiltration, which apparently had been under way for 
months before the fighters were discovered in early May. The 
opposition Congress Party, gearing up for elections, has accused 
the Indian government of negligence in failing to safeguard the 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three wars that India and Pakistan have fought since  
their independence from Britain in 1947 have been over Kashmir. 
Both countries claim the Himalayan territory in its entirety.

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Weigh Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The union representing American Airlines pilots is  
considering a proposal that could settle the dispute that led 
pilots to stage a sickout earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The sickout caused the cancellation of more than 6,700 flights  
and led to a $45.5 million fine against the union, which the union 
is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	American has already approved the proposal for absorbing pilots  
from Reno Air into the American system and boosting their pay, a 
spokeswoman said. American's parent, AMR Corp., bought Reno Air in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association indicated there is  
disagreement among union negotiators over the proposal, worked out 
with the help of a federal mediator, which will be voted on by the 
union's board of directors in the next two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have is a mediator's proposal that we've agreed to  
take to our board,'' union spokesman Gregg Overman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overman said negotiators took no formal position on the  
proposal, but that some supported it and others opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Another union official, president Rich LaVoy, earlier appeared  
to endorse the proposal, telling the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 
``We've put an awful lot of work into this, and we hope it will be 
substantial enough to get through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American and its pilots are fighting over how Reno Air's 300  
pilots should be absorbed into American and its 9,500-member 
pilots' union. American pilots earn an average salary of $136,000, 
and 8th-year captains earn $104,000 compared to $54,000 for the 
same pilot at Reno, said American spokesman Andrea Rader. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wanted the pay of Reno pilots brought up to American  
standards retroactive to December, but the airline said their pay 
should only be improved as they complete retraining and are placed 
in American's schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute reached a crescendo in February, when hundreds of  
American pilots staged a 10-day sickout, inconveniencing hundreds 
of thousands of passengers. The airline said the cancellations cost 
it more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge declared the sickout illegal and fined the union $45.5  
million for ignoring his order to tell pilots to return to work. 
Earlier this week, the union filed a notice that it intends to 
appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources who would only talk on condition of anonymity told The  
Associated Press that the proposal now on the table would bring 
Reno pilots up to the level of American pilots with pay raises 
retroactive to March 1 and June 1 and a final raise on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Another, separate, point of contention remains over the issue of  
seniority, which affects pilots' assignments and work schedules. 
While Reno pilots would get hefty pay raises, they remain unhappy 
that American's pilots want them to go to the bottom of American's 
seniority ladder. The two unions have said they will negotiate the 
seniority issue separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts noted that the deal must still be ratified by the  
union, but they expressed cautious optimism the two sides might 
improve their contentious relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly hope it represents better relations between  
American and the pilots,'' said Raymond E. Neidl, an analyst with 
ING Baring Furman Selz in New York. ``Certainly, it's in the 
interest of both parties to reach some agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly would like to see us reach agreement without all  
the acrimony,'' said Ms. Rader. ``It's difficult to say what it 
would mean relationship-wise if it isn't approved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Overman said union members are still angry over the huge  
fine imposed after the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took years to create this situation,'' the union spokesman  
said, ``and it'll probably take just as long to change it.''

<HEADLINE> Ben Stiller's Superpower: Temper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ben Stiller plays a less-than-super superhero in  
his latest movie, ``Mystery Men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Mr. Furious, Stiller claims temper as a superpower.  
</P>
<P>
	``I scream and summon my anger a lot,'' he said in the August  
issue of Paper magazine. ``I try to ride a motorcycle, but I'm not 
really good at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, in theaters this month, also stars Geoffrey Rush,  
Janeane Garofalo and William H. Macy. It's based on the Dark Horse 
comic books. 
</P>
<P>
	The important thing to Stiller is that his latest role is  
different from his last, that of a geeky kid-turned-geeky adult in 
``There's Something About Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to do what you've done before -- at least not  
right away,'' he said with a smile.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Religion Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is trying to tip the balance toward  
the right of Muslim firefighters to grow a beard, Jewish 
schoolchildren to wear a yarmulke and others to go door-to-door to 
try to win converts to their faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The Religious Liberty Protection Act, which would make it  
tougher to legislate restrictions on religious practices, sailed 
through the House on a 306-118 vote Thursday and headed for Senate 
consideration. The Clinton administration is behind the bill as are 
religious and civil rights groups ranging from the conservative 
Campus Crusade for Christ to the liberal People for the American 
Way. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is a response to two Supreme Court rulings that  
supporters of religious freedom say made such freedoms vulnerable 
to the most minor laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, state and local governments can impose  
substantial burdens on religious practices only if they can prove 
there is a compelling public interest in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters, led by Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., pointed to  
numerous cases in which laws needlessly interfered with religious 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	They cited city ordinances that restrict when people can go  
door-to-door to try to win converts, the suspension of Muslim 
firefighters and police because their faith requires them to grow 
beards, Jewish schoolchildren being told they couldn't wear 
yarmulkes because of school anti-hat policies and religious student 
groups being penalized for requiring their leaders to share a 
particular religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, said Canady, is ``designed to ensure that the free  
exercise of religion is not trampled on by the insensitive and 
heedless actions of the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill reminds states to treat religion with benevolent  
neutrality, not malevolent hostility,'' said Janet Parshall of the 
conservative Family Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
	But many Democrats and some civil rights groups also expressed  
concern that the bill would make it easier for a landlord or 
employer to use a religious argument as grounds to discriminate 
against minorities, gays or the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not right to abrogate the civil rights of many Americans  
in order to protect the religious liberty of other Americans, and 
it is not necessary,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who 
offered an amendment that would have taken the religious defense 
away from larger-scale landlords and employers. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment was defeated 234-190, but Nadler said the 190  
votes would give momentum to the issue when the Senate takes up its 
version of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in its statement of support for the bill,  
said it looked forward to working with Congress on any remaining 
concerns, including clarification of civil rights protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill culminates a decade-long dispute with the courts over  
how far the government can go to protect religion. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that religious practices did  
not have special rights in the enforcement of laws and regulations. 
Congress responded in 1993 by passing a measure stating that 
governments must have a compelling reason to bar religious 
practices, but in 1997 the Supreme Court struck down that law, 
saying Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed Thursday attempts to meet constitutional  
standards by limiting its scope to federally funded state and local 
programs and issues involving interstate commerce. It also applies 
to land use regulations that discriminate against houses of 
worship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said it believed the new bill did meet  
constitutional standards, but some conservatives said Congress was 
again overstepping its constitutional bounds and imposing federal 
controls over what should be state and local concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation does not need an unconstitutional federal standard  
of religious freedom,'' said Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas.

<HEADLINE> Montgomerie: I'm Out of It  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Colin Montgomerie won't win his  
first major at this year's British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Scot -- Europe's No. 1-ranked player the last six  
years -- shot a 5-over 76 in Friday's second round, failing to 
capitalize on lighter winds than Thursday when he opened with a 74. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid this is gone now,'' said Montgomerie, one of the  
top players never to have won a major. ``I'm out of the tournament 
now and I look forward to the U.S. PGA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie, who has missed the cut in five of the last seven  
British Opens, should make it this time. But it was his bad temper 
that got the best of him during the round, and he declined to show 
up for an interview afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-putt bogey on No. 1 set the tone. Two holes, later a fan  
with a camera was told by the Scot to put it away. On the fourth he 
berated an entire camera crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need a break, we need a break -- go away and have a  
coffee,'' he said. ``We're under enough pressure without you lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further bogeys at Nos. 7 and 8 landed him with a 3-over 39 at  
the turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie did birdie the 10th and 14th, but he also bogeyed  
the 11th and then had three more in a row from the 15th, his mood 
getting worse all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't capitalize on my draw,'' he added. ``I was struggling  
-- I didn't play well and got no luck.''

<HEADLINE>  D-Backs Find Way To Lose for Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Big Unit has a big problem: No  
matter how well Randy Johnson pitches, the Arizona Diamondbacks 
find a way to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondback had blown four straight gems by Johnson, getting  
shut out each time. Then on Thursday night, they wasted another 
scoreless performance. 
</P>
<P>
	New closer Matt Mantei gave up three runs in the bottom of the  
ninth after having two outs and the bases empty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough loss for the team,'' Johnson said after the 3-2  
loss to the Texas Rangers. ``I don't use the word frustrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks are paying Johnson $52.4 million over four  
years. He's supposed to be the ace, someone who makes teammates 
confident and opponents nervous simply by taking the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	But Arizona has lost his last six starts, although only the  
first one was his fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we're snakebitten or something,'' catcher Damian  
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since giving up seven runs in a 10-4 loss to Atlanta on June 20,  
Johnson has allowed five earned runs over 40 innings. His ERA has 
gone from 3.36 to 2.80, but his record has gone from 9-3 to 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Blame Diamondbacks hitters for the four straight losses. They  
were no-hit, one-hit, two-hit and three-hit, in that order, making 
him only the 10th player since 1900 to lose four straight without a 
single run of support. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona hadn't scored in 34 innings with Johnson pitching until  
Matt Williams singled in a run with two out in the first inning 
Thursday night. That allowed Johnson to take the mound in the 
bottom of the inning, pitching with a lead for the first time since 
being ahead of the Braves 2-1 in the third inning June 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt good,'' Johnson said. ``I think it broke the ice for  
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Johnson didn't have the blazing fastball or huge  
breaking pitch that helped him strike out 54 in his previous 32 
innings, he still made all the pitches that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas had seven runners over the first seven innings, but all  
reached with two outs. When the Rangers loaded the bases on a 
single and two walks in the fourth, Johnson got Jon Shave to look 
at strike three. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McLemore broke Johnson's spell by leading off the eighth  
with a single, but he never reached second. Roberto Kelly flied 
out, then Johnson struck out Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with the way I pitched,'' Johnson said.  
``Hitting your spots is what pitching is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Rangers came up for the bottom of the ninth, the  
6-foot-10 left-hander was gone, replaced by Mantei, who was 
acquired from Florida last week to polish off games such as this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't my call,'' Johnson said. ``I'd like to finish what I  
start, but it's not up to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was up to Arizona manager Buck Showalter. And he didn't think  
twice about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tough decision,'' Showalter said, ``was leaving Randy out  
there in the eighth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei, who got a save Sunday in his Arizona debut, got the  
first two outs on a strikeout and a comebacker, then tied a major 
league record by walking three pinch-hitters. It was the eighth 
time three pinch-hitters had walked in an inning, but only the 
second time they've gone in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei (1-3) then went to 2-2 on McLemore when he drove the ball  
into the right-center field gap, clearing the bases and continuing 
Johnson's jinx. 
</P>
<P>
	Things won't get any easier for Johnson in his next three  
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he pitches in Seattle for the first time since being  
traded by the Mariners last summer. His next two starts are to be 
against Los Angeles and Kevin Brown.

<HEADLINE> Miller Park Probe Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Miller Park stood silent Friday as  
investigators finished work at the construction site where three 
iron workers were killed when a giant crane collapsed while lifting 
a section of the retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncompleted roof toppled into Miller Park on Wednesday along  
with the 567-foot crane called ``Big Blue,'' which took a second 
crane inside the park down with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the giant crane was snarled around one of two metal  
baskets, one of which carried the three workers killed when the 
crane came crashing down: William DeGrave, 39, of Kimberly; Jerome 
Starr, 52, of Milwaukee; and Jeff Wischer, 40, of Waukesha. 
</P>
<P>
	From its base outside the stadium's right field wall, ``Big  
Blue'' snaked along the ground, up and over the facade and into the 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in what would be center field, the view along the  
first-base line included pieces of the roof spilling into the field 
area from the top, a pile of twisted metal -- blue, red and gray -- 
burying what would be the Milwaukee Brewers' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballpark's other half seemed unaffected by the accident,  
save for pieces of the ``Big Blue'' that littered the stadium 
floor.

has denied the retired pathologist a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the 71-year-old was convicted of second-degree murder  
for the injection death of Lou Gehrig's patient Thomas Youk. He 
represented himself during trial but had legal advisors providing 
advice during the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian sought a new trial on the grounds that one of his  
legal advisers, David Gorosh, provided inadequate assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court finds that the allegations complained of do not  
support reversal of the conviction, or demonstrate that the verdict 
resulted in a miscarriage of justice,'' Judge Jessica Cooper ruled 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	She added that Kevorkian had every opportunity to change his  
mind and be represented by counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer Morganroth, Kevorkian's attorney, said he will appeal.

<HEADLINE> Gene May Play Role in Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Researchers have identified a mutant gene  
that may be responsible for some cases of sciatica, a sometimes 
severe and chronic type of back pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding could help doctors identify other people at risk.  
</P>
<P>
	Back pain has long been one of the most poorly understood  
disorders, though it affects most adults at some point in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Sciatica is most often caused by a slipped or ruptured disk,  
which occurs when the soft material in the center of a disk 
protrudes from its cartilage container and pinches the sciatic 
nerve in the spine. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists still believe that obesity, smoking and occupational  
factors put people at higher risk for sciatica, but this gene may 
be another factor in about 5 percent of sufferers, said biochemist 
Dr. Leena Ala-Kokko of MCP Hahnemann University in Philadelphia, 
who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing that you carry this mutation, I would advise these  
people to avoid these other possible risk factors,'' Ala-Kokko 
said. ``In finding this gene, we may have put the missing piece in 
the puzzle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research was published in Friday's issue of the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Another far more common gene defect has also been found that may  
be responsible for a higher percentage of sciatica sufferers, 
Ala-Kokko said, though that research has yet to be published. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutated gene alters part of an important structural protein  
inside the disk called collagen IX, preventing it from forming into 
the correct shape. This makes the disk material too soft and less 
capable of absorbing the shocks placed on the spine during 
movement, researchers said. Over time, it begin pressing against 
the nerve. 
</P>
<P>
	``If genetic factors are found to underlie some substantial  
fraction of cases of sciatica, clearly that would be important,'' 
said Dr. Richard Deyo, a University of Washington professor of 
medicine specializing in managing back problems. ``It would change 
the way we think about the disease and think about risk factors and 
occupational causes. And hopefully someday help treat it or prevent 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted with scientists at the University of Oulu  
in Finland, analyzed the DNA of 180 Finnish patients with sciatica. 
Nine patients were found to have the mutation, and none of 230 
patients in a control group without back pain had it. 
</P>
<P>
	Follow-up with four families of the nine patients with the  
defect revealed a total of 23 relatives with the mutation, all of 
whom suffered disk problems.

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar Earnings Drop 37 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. reported a 37 percent drop  
in second-quarter earnings due to slumping sales of large engines 
and machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy equipment maker, in announcing its results Friday,  
also revised downward its profit outlook for the year. This was the 
third disappointing quarter in a row for Caterpillar, which has 
struggled with falling sales in emerging markets such as Russia, 
and in commodities-based industries such as mining that have been 
hurt by low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar reported earnings of $283 million, or 78 cents per  
share, down from $446 million, or $1.20 per share, in the same 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Results fell short of the 82 cents per share consensus  
expectation of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales and revenues of $5.1 billion for the quarter were down  
from $5.6 billion in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A key problem for Caterpillar in the second quarter was the  
prolonged weakness of demand for large engines and machines from 
the oil, gas and mining industries, chairman and CEO Glen Barton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinery sales dropped by 12 percent, or by $453 million, while  
engine sales fell by 5 percent, or $83 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Although smaller truck engines sales were high, the slimmer  
profit margin for those engines was not enough to overcome the low 
sales volume of the big machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The slower sales of big machines and engines is a trend that is  
expected to hurt the company's overall profit for 1999, Barton 
said. He said the company now anticipates 1999 profit per share to 
be 20 percent to 25 percent less than in 1998, when the company 
earned $1.51 billion, or $4.11 per share, for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we expect that the second half of the year will be  
stronger than the first, it does not appear demand for larger 
machines will be as strong as we had earlier anticipated,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, Caterpillar had earnings of $488  
million, or $1.35 per share, down from $876 million, or $2.36 per 
share, in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell to just under $9 billion from $10.4 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar Inc. shares fell 56 1/4 cents to $58.93 3/4 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> No Homers in Safeco Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Safeco Field was safe from the long ball, at  
least on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	The homer-happy Seattle Mariners lead the major leagues with 151  
home runs but didn't produce any in the first game at their new 
$517 million home. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the fireworks on Thursday night were launched from the  
roof of the nearby Kingdome, whose comfy comfines and still air had 
been a hitter's dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I saw tonight, I would say it might be more of a  
pitcher's park,'' said Seattle starter Jamie Moyer, who gave up 
only one run on seven hits during eight innings. I don't think you 
can judge a park on one game. If this ends up being a pitcher's 
park, I'm happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego scored twice in the top of the ninth off Jose Mesa to  
beat Seattle 3-2 in Safeco's opener Thursday. Mesa didn't give up 
any hits, but four walks doomed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm gonna do good here, believe me,'' Mesa (0-4) predicted.  
``I didn't give up a hit, but I lost the ballgame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their first outdoor game ever in Seattle, the Mariners got  
seven hits and two runs off San Diego starter Andy Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Griffey Jr. ducked reporters after going went 1-for-3,  
including a long fly to left that might have cleared the fences in 
the Kingdone. Alex Rodriguez and Jay Buhner each went 0-for-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``That lazy fly that Junior hit, that might have been out of the  
Kingdome,'' Moyer said. ``But we're not there anymore. We have to 
move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hitting star was Seattle leadoff man David Bell, who tied a  
team record with three doubles, including the first Mariner hit in 
the new park. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening night at Safeco included skies filled with  
thunderclouds, and the air was moist in this baseball palace near 
Elliott Bay. The game was played with the retractable roof open in 
temperatures that started at 67 degrees and dropped all evening. 
Shortly after the game ended, a spectacular lightning and rain 
storm hit the Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a far cry from the climate-controlled Kingdome, where the  
Mariners batted .297 with 75 homers in 39 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can't compare to the Kingdome,'' outfielder Butch Huskey  
said. ``Now we have to adjust to twilight and the difference 
between light and dark. We didn't have time to work out before the 
season in this new stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several other Mariners noted they will need some time to adjust.  
But not too much time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 17 of our next 21 games at home,'' Rodriguez said.  
``We can't take 10 games to get used to the environment and 
ambiance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will the ball carry in the new stadium?  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea,'' Rodriguez said. ``I didn't hit the ball  
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle became the sixth major league team to move into a new  
stadium during the season and the fifth to lose their first game in 
the new home. Only the St. Louis Cardinals were winners, beating 
Atlanta 4-3 in 1966 in the first game at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of ballgames here,'' Mariners manager Lou  
Piniella said. ``We'll win our share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was too early to determine how the park will play.  
``One game does not allow a true read,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a little dampness in the air tonight,'' Piniella  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one complained about trouble seeing the ball, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Russ Davis was victimized by a bad hop in the  
third that led to San Diego's first run. The hop was a freak thing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been a footprint,'' Davis said. ``It's an  
immaculate field. I love it.''

<HEADLINE> Reebok Children's Sneakers Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 140,000 sneakers are being recalled  
because part of the shoe may come off and pose a choking hazard to 
young children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reebok Classic Leather Zip, sold since September in toddler  
and children's sizes, has a decorative zipper on the side that ``is 
easily twisted off,'' the Consumer Product Safety Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	That zipper can choke or injure a child if put in the mouth or  
ingested, said commission spokeswoman Jane Francis. No injuries 
have been reported, but Reebok notified the commission of the 
defect two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may return the shoes to the store where they were  
purchased for a refund or an exchange.

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Want Capitalism in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said  
Friday after a visit to Cuba that the emergence of a small private 
sector on the island offers ``a small but hopeful opening'' that 
the chamber wants to help develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas J. Donohue, chamber president and chief executive  
officer, said at a news conference and in a written statement that 
while there is no evidence of a change in Cuba's ideology, it is 
significant that certain entrepreneurial activities are now 
permitted as part of a reform process. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this small way, the process of change in Cuba has begun and  
we ought to seize the opportunity to spur it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the chamber will be working with Cubans over the next  
few weeks to flesh out the details on building relationships with 
both independent companies and public corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue's three-day visit was the first by a chamber of commerce  
president to Cuba since the 1959 communist revolution. He spent six 
hours with President Fidel Castro and also met with other top 
government officials along with dissidents and church leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he showed up late for his meeting with Castro because he  
did not want to cut short his meeting with the dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue said he found Castro to be ``very smart and very strong  
about his own convictions.'' He said Castro acknowledged to him 
that some aspects of an economy work better when carried out by the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, who has called capitalism a ``brutal, inhumane system,''  
had little in common with his pro-free enterprise visitor, who 
heads the world's largest business federation. But both are sharply 
critical of the trade embargo the United States imposed against 
Cuba not long after the triumph of the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cuba was undergoing an economic free-fall earlier in the  
decade, Castro, in a radical departure, allowed Cubans to operate 
family-owned and operated businesses. For example, private 
restaurants are permitted so long as there are no employees outside 
the family and the number of chairs is limited to 12. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 Cubans took advantage of the opening at its  
peak, but taxes and other disincentives have lowered the number to 
fewer than 140,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beneath the surface, an ideological spark has been ignited,''  
Donohue said. ``The government has yet to decide whether to nurture 
it or snuff it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a nationally televised appearance on Wednesday at the  
University of Havana, Donohue voiced opinions that have not been 
heard in a public setting in Cuba in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	With Castro watching the broadcast, Donohue said his  
organization ``fundamentally disapproves'' of Cuba's political, 
economic and human rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a tragedy,'' he said, ``that during one of the most  
exciting and dynamic periods of economic expansion and 
technological innovation, the Cuban people have been left out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the lack of private enterprise more than any other  
factor that has played the greatest role in holding Cuba back.''

<HEADLINE> Safeway To Pay Fine for Dumping Milk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Safeway has agreed to pay $200,000 for  
dumping thousands of gallons of spoiled milk into Northern 
California storm drains in 1996, federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty settles a federal civil suit filed Thursday that  
accused the supermarket chain of numerous violations of the Clean 
Water Act, said U.S. Attorney Robert Mueller's office. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10,500 gallons of milk products were dumped by 24  
Safeway and Pak'n Save stores into drains after a production error 
in March 1996 made the milk unacceptable for sale, the lawsuit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The waterways included San Francisco Bay, the Petaluma River and  
other bay tributaries, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeway spokeswoman Debra Lambert said the milk had been kept at  
the stores beyond its prescribed sale date but was not a health 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some stores in the Bay area violated company policy, in place  
at the time, on proper disposal of food products,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people reported seeing ``milky'' creeks, and others saw  
store employees pouring milk into storm drains, Mueller's office 
said. It said company headquarters had ordered store managers to 
get rid of the milk, but didn't tell them how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Milk can harm the aquatic environment because microorganisms in  
the milk use up oxygen as they degrade, the suit said. It said 
Safeway did not have a permit to discharge pollutants and had not 
treated the products.

<HEADLINE> Senators Hear About Y2K Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National League of Cities says the vast  
majority of cities, based on a recent survey, expect to be ready 
for any computer glitches that may occur in the new year. But some 
senators are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey of 403 large and small cities by the league  
found that 92 percent of respondents said that all critical systems 
would be Y2K compliant by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities identified their top four critical systems as public  
safety, including emergency management and jails; water and 
wastewater treatment; utilities; and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready,'' said Brian O'Neill, a Philadelphia councilman  
who testified on behalf of the league Thursday at a Senate hearing 
on state and local Y2K preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 8 percent said their readiness will be 80 percent to 90  
percent complete, and 81 percent expected to have contingency plans 
completed by Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem may occur in computers and microchips programmed  
to recognize only the last two digits of a year. They may 
malfunction if they misread the year 2000 as 1900, possibly 
disrupting basic civil services such as tax and garbage collection, 
police and fire response, and water treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Y2K Committee Chairman Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said the  
cities' compliance rate sounds good. But 8 percent still means more 
than 1,400 localities won't be fully ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all hope that the city or town where we live is not among  
those,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the committee's top Democrat,  
warned cities and counties about delaying Y2K work until late in 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who thinks they're going to get ready between October  
and December is traveling in a fantasy world,'' Dodd said at the 
hearing. ``You'd better have a contingency plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses said Y2K readiness may not be a major issue in  
very small or rural counties, where much business is still 
conducted on paper. Others, though, warned that conditions could be 
worse than surveys reflect, if only because municipal workers may 
hesitate to report Y2K planning failures to their superiors. 
</P>
<P>
	The league of cities didn't independently verify its survey  
results, which were more optimistic than a report released Thursday 
by Congress' investigatory arm, the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO found that nearly half the nation's 21 largest cities won't  
complete work on coping with the Y2K computer bug until the final 
quarter of the year. Just two cities, Dallas and Boston, have 
finished preparations. Nine others expect to be fully ready by 
Sept. 30, and 10 cities say they will be ready between Oct. 1 and 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people lie about their Y2K compliance,'' said Randy  
Johnson, chairman of the Hennepin County, Minn., board of 
commissioners. ``It's much easier to say, 'Yeah, we're doing it, 
don't worry about it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The association's April survey of 500 randomly selected counties  
found that 51 percent of respondents were finished with Y2K 
assessments, and 31 percent were mostly finished with testing.

</P>
<P>
	``We haven't decided to allow it,'' said John Morris, vice  
president of communication for the PGA Tour. ``The idea is to give 
us a chance to see how well it works, how it looks, the player 
reaction and the caddie reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said that the shorts would only be allowed when the heat  
index, which is a gauge of temperature and humidity, rises above 
100. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour's policy board will decide in September whether to  
retain the new policy, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	The change applies only to male caddies, who have been required  
to wear trousers when on club property. Women caddies have had the 
option of wearing culottes, a choice made by such caddies as Fanny 
Sunesson, who works for Nick Faldo, and Nicki Stricker, who used to 
carry husband Steve's bag. 
</P>
<P>
	The test comes just two weeks after a 51-year-old caddie  
collapsed during the third round of the Western Open outside 
Chicago. Garland Dempsey's heart stopped as he walked off the 15th 
tee July 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature that day was in the 90s at the Cog Hill Golf and  
Country Club in Lemont, Ill., with a heat index reading of more 
than 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey underwent quadruple bypass surgery for a blocked artery  
on Monday, PGA Tour spokesman Mark Cubbedge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garland, who was expected to be released Friday afternoon, told  
officials the heat and humidity was not a factor in his collapse, 
Cubbedge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shorts issue been raised increasingly over the past few  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1996 PGA Championship in Louisville, Ky., tournament  
officials threatened to expel caddies Andy Martinez and Scott Jones 
for wearing shorts on a day when the heat index reached 115. 
Martinez caddied for Tom Lehman and Jones for Steve Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1997 U.S. Open in Bethesda, Md., U.S. Golf Association  
officials changed their policy to allow caddies to wear shorts.

<HEADLINE> 90th Annual NAACP Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A few short months ago, it seemed the NAACP's  
return as a major player on civil rights was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Word was NAACP President Kweisi Mfume was headed to Baltimore's  
City Hall to run for mayor. And if that happened, it would leave 
the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization to its 
fourth search for a leader in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	But in May, Mfume, a former congressman from Maryland, chose to  
stay on. That decision, coupled with new national campaigns to 
address issues ranging from the spread of handguns to the lack of 
minority role models in Hollywood, left members at this week's 90th 
annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like the direction of the organization,'' said George  
Moore, an NAACP member from New York City. ``We have a good 
agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rita Hawley, a NAACP member from Denver, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard not to get excited about our message on the national  
level. Mr. Mfume has been pushing the right buttons so I'm glad he 
stayed,'' Hawley said. ``Now we have to go home to our towns and 
get the work done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP captured national headlines this week announcing a  
federal suit seeking unprecedented limitations on the nation's gun 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, citing the absence of minorities in major roles in new  
fall programs on the four major television networks, the 
organization launched a campaign against the entertainment industry 
that could involve lawsuits and boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	The week also included forums on education, employment  
discrimination, health disparities between the races and speeches 
by Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
and Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	One discordant note was sounded by Ronald Walters, a University  
of Maryland political scientist, who said that while the health of 
the organization is good, he would like to see its agenda reflect 
more core issues as opposed to fighting for more Hollywood role 
models. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see more focus on housing, education, crime and  
health care issues,'' Walters said. ``I'm not sure that filing a 
gun lawsuit will fix anything. We need to deal with the ideas in 
these kids heads that lead them to use guns. That's what I expect 
from the NAACP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you deal with these popular issues like guns or  
television shows, you deal in symbolism,'' Walters said. ``There 
are decisions coming out of Federal Election Commission and court 
decisions in education that are wrong and hurting minorities. We 
need more focus on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters added, however, that despite the problems he sees in the  
NAACP agenda, the group has taken great strides. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization is as strong as its been in a while,''  
Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters point was underscored during a Wednesday morning session  
when a virtual parade of corporate leaders, led by BellSouth 
Chairman Duane Ackerman and including representatives from United 
Airlines, Anheuser-Busch, General Motors and Fannie Mae, took to 
the stage with five and six-figure checks in hand to support NAACP 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see that kind of major investment corporations are  
making now, it makes a big difference. You didn't see that 
before,'' Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before'' was as recent as 1996 when the NAACP was ripped by  
bruising leadership fights and a multimillion dollar deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one talks of the ``before'' days anymore at the NAACP.  
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, they get a good solid B,'' Walters said. ``They have  
a good leadership team in place.''

<HEADLINE> Town Tries To Recover After Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUGHES SPRINGS, Texas (AP) -- Gail Rowe only has to glance out  
her front window to be reminded of the beating death of her elderly 
next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	What she sees across the street from her tiny wooden home is the  
train station along the Kansas City-Southern rail line. It makes 
her think of 87-year-old Leafie Mason, whom prosecutors say was 
bludgeoned by rail-riding drifter Angel Maturino Resendez. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all relieved, but we're not satisfied yet,'' said Mrs.  
Rowe, who knew Ms. Mason for more than 20 years. ``We want justice. 
I think the death penalty's too easy. I think he should suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,500 people in this old railroad town have yet to recover  
from last fall's killing, one of four Maturino Resendez is charged 
with in Texas, Illinois and Kentucky. He is suspected in five other 
Texas slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rowe's strong feelings are typical among residents here.  
Hughes Springs, nestled in the rolling hills about 30 miles west of 
Arkansas, has never witnessed such a gruesome attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mason was struck repeatedly in the head last October with  
her own antique iron by someone who entered her home through a 
window. She apparently struggled with her assailant, who probably 
surprised her while she slept. She was left to die in a pool of 
blood on her bedroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say her body was covered by a blanket, as were the  
bodies of several other people believed to have been killed by 
Maturino Resendez. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the strongest tie to the suspect is just 70 yards from  
Ms. Mason's doorstep: the railroad. Maturino Resendez often hitched 
rides in unlocked boxcars. 
</P>
<P>
	For Police Chief Randy Kennedy, the case is personal. He mowed  
Ms. Mason's lawn as a teen-ager and remembers her as a polite, firm 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that's been on my mind every day since it  
happened,'' said Kennedy, who was the first to find what he called 
the ``most gory'' crime scene he ever investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one may feel the loss of Ms. Mason more than her sister.  
</P>
<P>
	Virgie Mason was born mentally retarded and requires full-time  
care. Leafie Mason visited her each day at the local nursing home 
to make sure she received adequate attention and to keep her 
spirits up. Virgie Mason now has no family and no visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all (Virgie) had in this world,'' said Mrs. Rowe, who  
works at the nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lawrence Lancaster, a Cass County commissioner, the killing  
also hit close to home. His 90-year-old mother lives alone, just 
two doors from Ms. Mason's red brick house on State Highway 49. 
Lancaster says he now checks on her more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all hurt when this happened,'' he said. ``This is such  
a small, laid-back kind of town. This wasn't supposed to happen 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It never has before. This is the first capital murder case on  
record in Hughes Springs. Kennedy and his two full-time officers 
usually investigate petty crimes and write traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	During the long manhunt for Maturino Resendez, police were  
flooded with calls from nervous residents. Some heard mysterious 
noises or saw suspicious-looking people. Others hurried to install 
security systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and Cass County District Attorney Randall Lee are  
preparing to travel to Houston next week, to meet the suspect who 
took away Hughes Springs' peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy knows how he plans to open his interview with Maturino  
Resendez: ``I'm going to ask him why he picked our town, why he did 
this and why he picked this defenseless old woman.''

<HEADLINE> Report: NKorea To Release American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An American woman taken into custody a month  
ago in North Korea will be released in a few days, Sen. Robert 
Torricelli said Friday after being notified by Pyongyang's U.N. 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Han, who has homes in California and New Jersey, was  
detained near North Korea's borders with Russia and China on June 
17. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, D-N.J., had pressed for the release of Han, a  
Korean-American, during a visit to North Korea last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sincerely gratified that North Korean leaders responded  
favorably to my request,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has not been notified officially of Han's  
impending release, but expressed hope that the information given to 
Torricelli was correct. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin had said last month  
the American was in North Korea on a trip related to an effort to 
build a hospital and a garment manufacturing business. But 
Torricelli said she was there to provide medical care as part of a 
humanitarian program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration was irritated by the North Koreans'  
refusal to allow consular access to the woman. The Swedish Embassy 
in Pyongyang, which handles U.S. interests in North Korea, had 
asked for access, which is required under international law. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said they were told the woman was being  
investigated for possible violations of North Korean law. 
Torricelli said she was arrested for ``insulting local officials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department would release no details about the woman,  
citing U.S. laws designed to protect citizen privacy.

<HEADLINE> Norman Could Rise Again at British  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- A wise guy suggested that what Greg  
Norman liked most about playing golf in this windswept corner of 
the world was that it provided an excuse to leave his silly hats at 
home. That's probably true -- as far as it goes. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Norman, the real lure of the British Open is that it  
strips everyone and everything else down to the bare essentials, 
too. That makes it the one -- maybe the only -- major championship he 
can still win. 
</P>
<P>
	More than the Masters, U.S. Open or PGA, this singular event is  
about adversity. About shaking off wind, rain and cold, bad 
bounces, strange vegetation and tabloid reports, and no one does 
that better than Norman, Every time you think his spirit has 
drowned, cue the soundtrack from some horror movie and wait for the 
bubbles to appear on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman has risen from the murky depths more times than Lloyd  
Bridges in a season's worth of ``Sea Hunt'' reruns. And to prove 
that neither 23 years in the business nor his latest setback at 
Augusta National just three months ago has blunted his desire or 
skill, Norman did it one more time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He picked himself up off the turf after a disastrous  
triple-bogey seven at the 17th to card a 1-under-par 70 and climb 
back within three strokes of the lead in a tournament he's won 
twice before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a real dose of the true punishment, of what it's like,''  
Norman said, ``and it doesn't feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he had a taste of the true reward, too, the chance to get up  
on the high wire in front of a crowd and make that exhilarating 
walk that born showmen and competition junkies crave. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very, very good feeling,'' Norman said, ``because of  
all the people. 
</P>
<P>
	``One minute there's a couple hundred, the next minute you have  
a couple thousand. I don't know where they come from, but it's an 
amazing sight. You make your first birdie, you might get another 
hundred; you make your second one, you get another 500. Make a 
third one and then there's another thousand. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way it was for the last five or six holes,'' he  
said, ``which was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not entirely.  
</P>
<P>
	Norman's start to the day provided few clues about what lay  
ahead. Coming off an opening-round 76, he made pars at the first 
three holes and a birdie at the fourth. He cruised through the next 
seven holes with pars, then strung together birdies at Nos. 12, 13 
and 14, the equivalent to showing Carnoustie the back of his hand. 
Three holes later, the links struck back with that humbling 
triple-bogey 7 at No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, in that way that Norman likes to confront trouble, he  
took a chair in the interview room a half-hour after that and said, 
``You want me to go right into the triple bogey, do you? Well, let 
us go right into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The short version begins with his tee shot at the 459-year,  
par-4 straying three paces from the fairway into the right rough. 
That was the last time Norman got a really good look at his ball 
until he was lying 4 in the fairway. In between, he whiffed his 
second shot entirely and took an angry hack at his third that 
pushed the ball from the right rough to the left rough. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade had passed since the last time Norman was similarly  
embarrassed -- he whiffed in the Australian Open when he got stuck 
underneath a tree and tried to make a swing on the ball from his 
knees. But in the same way that he got over that shot, and the 
disappointment of all the other cruel or freakish ways that other 
tournaments were wrenched from his grasp, Norman was already moving 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	What has changed over the years, Norman said on Sunday at the  
Masters, was his perspective on the losses and the time he needs to 
bounce back. Shoulder surgery in April 1998 sent him to the 
sideline for nearly a year. He rediscovered his family and his 
motivation, and found the calm that a hectic schedule and the 
pressures of competing had kept hidden all these years. 
</P>
<P>
	When he looked up at the leaderboard at the end of the day,  
there was an untested Frenchman named Jean Van de Velde, an 
untested Argentine named Angel Cabrera and eccentric Swede Jesper 
Parnevik between him and the top. Tiger Woods lurked one stroke off 
his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	A glimpse of how many of them will be around the lead come  
Sunday could be had by looking at what happened to the untested 
Australian who led after Day 1. By the time Norman was safely back 
at the clubhouse, Rodney Pampling was en route to shooting an 86, 
missing the cut and making arrangements for a flight home. 
</P>
<P>
	Things only figure to get harder. Norman's clubs were stolen  
from his house and the thief spent last weekend trying them out on 
the driving range. They only found their way back to him at the 
start of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of being angry, Norman was amused.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were all marked up. I had to get all the carpet stains  
and rubber off them,'' Norman said. ``He wasn't a very good 
golfer.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Kicks Off U.S. Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Looking relaxed and fit, Bruce  
Springsteen kicked off his first U.S. tour in 11 years with the E 
Street Band before thousands of fans at New Jersey's Continental 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freehold native is performing 15 sold-out concerts in his  
home state before hitting other cities across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time Springsteen and his band have traveled the  
United States since a 1988 tour for Amnesty International. They 
have already finished a 17-city European tour. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Springsteen said, ``Good evening, New Jersey,'' and  
then launched into ``My Love Will Not Let You Down,'' a song 
released late last year. The Boss quickly dove into old tunes that 
brought fans to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the last great rock 'n' roll tour of the century,'' said  
Robert Santelli, a vice president at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
and Museum in Cleveland. ``He embodied a whole lot of New Jersey 
culture in his music. ... He gave a sense of pride to a lot of 
young people.''

<HEADLINE>  Ripken Sidelines With Wrist Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken could miss several games because of  
a deep bone bruise in his right wrist, an injury that occurred when 
he was hit by a pitch from Montreal's Mike Thurman on Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken walked into the clubhouse Friday afternoon with a bandage  
on his wrist. Although the wrist was swollen and sore, the 
Baltimore third baseman expected to avoid a second trip to the 
disabled list this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll keep it immobilized for a day or two and see what kind of  
improvement I get, if any,'' he said. ``It didn't feel good when it 
happened and it doesn't feel good today. It could improve very 
rapidly. Hopefully it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken is 50 hits short of 3,000 for his career and just four  
home runs shy of 400. He's hitting .313 this year with 12 homers 
and 38 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken played in 2,632 consecutive games from May 1982 to last  
September 20, when he willingly ended the streak by sitting out a 
game against the New York Yankees. He managed to avoid serious 
injury throughout the span, but things are different this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Ripken was batting .179 when back spasms landed  
him on the disabled list April 18 for the first time in his career. 
If his wrist doesn't show significant improvement by the weekend, 
he could be headed back for a second stint on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	``At best, you can say right now it's a deep contusion, a deep  
bruise. Time will tell if it's anything else,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was batting against Thurman in the second inning when the  
pitch struck him. He winced in pain and trotted to first base, 
where he kicked the bag in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken stayed in the game and scored a run, but was replaced at  
third base by Jeff Reboulet in the top of the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran around the bases and started to get some feeling back in  
my hand. When I came in I really couldn't shake hands too well with 
the guys,'' Ripken said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then tested the wrist by throwing the ball, and experienced  
only a little pain. But he couldn't swing the bat, so Orioles 
manager Ray Miller sent Reboulet into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Reboulet started at third base Friday night against Montreal.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a bone bruise, Cal will be ready in a few days,''  
Miller said. ``Apparently that's all they can find. They've checked 
everything and they don't see anything else. I hope that's all it 
is, because he's swinging the bat as good as I've seen him swing 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning from his stint on the disabled list May 13,  
Ripken has hit in 40 of 51 games.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Output Rises in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *JEANNINE AVERSA   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The worst may be over for America's  
manufacturers. New production figures Friday showed a solid second 
quarter after a long struggle under the global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve reported that a modest rise in industrial  
production last month helped give manufacturing its best three 
months in more than a year. Economists hailed it as a sign of 
recovery after hard times that included the loss of 488,000 jobs 
since March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities posted a  
0.2 percent rate of increase in June, matching the gain in May. 
</P>
<P>
	June's performance left industrial output rising at an annual  
rate of 3.9 percent in the second quarter, the best showing since 
the end of 1997 and triple the rate for the first three months of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think manufacturing is back again,'' concluded Wells Fargo  
economist Sung Won Sohn. ``I think the worst is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's manufacturing sector has been struggling for the  
past two years under the impact of a global financial crisis that 
has cut sharply into U.S. exports while triggering a flood of 
cheaper foreign-made goods into the U.S. market, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manufacturing is making a moderate comeback from the problems  
posed by the global economic turmoil over the last two years,'' 
said Mark Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates. 
``It's not roaring back, but there are modest gains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economists mainly attributed the good news to a gradual pickup  
in demand for U.S. goods from other countries that are now slowly 
recovering from the global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998 industrial output posted a 2.3 percent gain compared to  
a 7.2 percent increase the year before, said Merrill Lynch 
economist Stan Shipley. He forecast a gain this year of 3 percent 
to 3.5 percent, representing a modest pickup from 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though industrial output edged up in June, the  
manufacturing sector continued to lose jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said productivity gains -- largely through computers  
and other technological improvements in the workplace -- help 
explain why output rose even as jobs were shed. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's also a psychological factor. ``Companies are holding  
off hiring until it is clear that the industry is in a sustained 
recovery. I think we're close to that and that employment in 
manufacturing will soon expand again,'' said Tim O' Neill, 
economist with Bank of Montreal and Harris Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month a survey by the National Association of  
Purchasing Management showed that the manufacturing sector expanded 
for the fifth straight month in June at a stronger pace than 
expected with new orders rising at a good clip. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, meanwhile, said that the strength in industrial  
production in June was led by a 2.7 percent increase in production 
of cars and trucks, almost as strong as the 3 percent rise in May. 
Another sizable gain in manufacturing was a 3.2 percent increase in 
the production of semiconductors, printed circuit boards and other 
electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
	National Association of Manufacturers economist Gordon Richards  
said the report indicates ``steady as she goes'' growth. ``We're 
simply cruising along,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	This mostly responds to a pickup in demand from Latin America,  
Asia and other overseas markets for U.S. technology to fix possible 
computer problems related to the so-called Y2k computer bug, 
Shipley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, production of durable goods, items expected to last at  
least three years, rose 0.4 percent in June following gains of 0.6 
percent in both April and May. The strength in durable goods was 
offset somewhat by continued weakness in the production of 
nondurable goods, which fell 0.2 percent in both May and June. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 80.3  
percent of capacity in June, down slightly from a May operating 
rate of 80.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatively low operating rate is one reason economists are  
optimistic that there will not be the bottlenecks that normally 
occur late in an economic expansion, driving up costs and setting 
off inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, an operating capacity of 84 percent would alarm  
economists. They said it indicated that factories just couldn't 
produce fast enough, something that leads to price increases. But 
nowadays, economists said, that concern is eased because factories 
can easily bring in what they need from overseas to meet demand.

<HEADLINE> Weather Satellite Launch Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The launch of a sophisticated new weather  
satellite has been postponed until October, the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	GOES-L was originally scheduled for a launch in May. That was  
postponed during a NASA review of recent launch failures and now 
has been rescheduled for the fall, sometime after Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite will  
monitor hurricanes, severe thunderstorms and other severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States operates two weather satellites in  
geostationary orbit 22,300 miles over the Equator. GOES-8, launched 
in 1994, is overlooking the East Coast out into the Atlantic Ocean 
and GOES-10, launched in 1997, is currently overlooking the West 
Coast out into the Pacific including Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	GOES-L, to be renamed GOES-11 once in orbit, will be stored on  
orbit ready for operation when needed as a replacement for GOES-8 
or 10.

<HEADLINE> Five Killed in Alabama Police Chase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROBERTSDALE, Ala. (AP) -- Five people trying to outrun police  
were killed Friday when their pickup truck crashed into a 
tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	A bag of what was believed to be marijuana was thrown from the  
pickup before the crash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on a rural highway about 3:30 a.m.  
Officers pulled the pickup over for speeding, but the driver sped 
away. Police estimated the pickup truck exceeded 110 mph at times 
during the chase, which covered nearly 20 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The pickup ran a stop sign and collided with a tractor-trailer,  
knocking its rear axle off, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were ages 14 to 20.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they have not determined who was driving.

<HEADLINE> Committee Endorses Suspending Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon efforts to save the F-22 fighter  
suffered another blow on Friday when the House Appropriations 
Committee endorsed a recommendation to suspend production. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel went along with the decision of its defense  
subcommittee to spend $1.8 billion on buying more current fighter 
jets and to increase bonuses for military pilots instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel then approved an overall $266.1 billion defense  
spending bill, sending it to the full House for a vote later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall bill, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, is  
$15.5 billion above spending in the current fiscal year and $2.8 
billion more than requested by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes money for a 4.8 percent across-the-board military  
pay raise beginning in January, up from the 4.4 percent increase 
Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also includes $94 million to upgrade ``readiness  
shortfalls'' in the Army's Apache attack helicopter program. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was included after the commander of the 24 Apache  
helicopters sent to the Balkans, Brig. Gen. Richard Cody, 
complained last month of equipment and pilot training inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopters were sent to Albania. None flew against Serb  
forces. But two crewmen were killed when two helicopters crashed in 
a night training exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon had requested $3 billion for the F-22 program. The  
Air Force considers the costly and sophisticated fighter to be its 
top warplane in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $3 billion, $1.8 billion was to go to buying six of the  
new planes from Lockheed Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon mounted a heavy lobbying campaign this week to try  
to save the program. A Senate-passed bill contains the full $3 
billion for the program.

<HEADLINE> Wanted Man Who Faked Death Captured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVE OAK, Fla. (AP) -- A man who allegedly faked his death in a  
1994 diving accident while awaiting trial on child molestation 
charges has been captured in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found 43-year-old Arwyn Carr living in a trailer park in  
Flagstaff, Ariz., on July 1. He had taken the name of a man he knew 
in Live Oak and obtained a phony Social Security number and 
driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most unusual cases I've worked,'' said Bill  
Gootee, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement agent who tracked 
Carr for five years. ``Most of them just run. They pack up their 
car and drive off. But to fake your own death and go to those 
extremes, that's quite elaborate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Carr will be returned to Florida within a week to  
face trial on the child-sex charges and for failing to appear in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr disappeared in the Gulf of Mexico. His mother reported him  
missing after his boat was found two miles offshore. A body was 
never found. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Carr was two months away from a trial. A conviction  
could have brought a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gootee said it was hard to believe that an experienced swimmer  
and diver like Carr would go out alone and then drown months before 
his trial. He left behind his family and forfeited his $25,000 bond 
and all of his possessions, including a dive shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The break in the case came recently when Carr's mother visited  
him in Flagstaff and made some cellular phone calls that were 
traced, investigators said.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Party Boycotts Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A U.N.-sponsored effort to bring  
Kosovo's political leaders together failed today when the party of 
Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian leader, boycotted the 
first meeting of a provincial advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, apparently stayed  
away in protest because the rival Kosovo Liberation Army and 
another faction were to have been as strongly represented at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Kosovo, sporadic violence, including a grenade  
explosion that injured 30 in the sector patrolled by U.S. 
peacekeepers, further complicated attempts to re-establish 
normality in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova's absence today weakened hopes for any swift and  
substantial step to give the province's people control of their 
political affairs and foreshadowed a possible power struggle 
between leading Kosovo political factions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sad that the LDK has chosen not to participate in that  
first meeting,'' Bernard Kouchner, the new U.N. administrator for 
Kosovo, said at the opening of the session. ``They are unhappy 
about the current composition of the council.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova arrived in Kosovo on Thursday to great fanfare, but  
quietly slipped away in the evening with an aide, saying he went to 
neighboring Macedonia. His quick departure disappointed the many 
supporters of a man twice chosen president of Kosovo's mainly 
ethnic Albanian population in unofficial elections. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he had promised to join the council providing that  
all ``credible'' parties were represented. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova resents having only two seats on the council while the  
rival Kosovo Liberation Army and allied United Democratic League 
have four seats between them, U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Serb representatives did show up today, a minor victory in  
attempts to bridge Kosovo's sharp ethnic divide. 
</P>
<P>
	The council cannot make decisions, but will serve as an  
intermediary with the U.N. officials now administering the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, about 400 angry Yugoslav army reservists blocked the  
center of Nis in central Serbia, joining a growing number of 
soldiers demonstrating to demand long-overdue back pay for their 
service in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media reported that the central square in Nis, Serbia's  
third largest city, was blocked for about one hour as the 
reservists demanded back pay, free electricity and rent. They 
pledged to return Saturday and continue protests until their 
demands are met. 
</P>
<P>
	The grenade attack that injured 30 happened Thursday afternoon  
at a crowded market in Vitina, 25 miles southeast of Kosovo's 
capital, Pristina, said Lt. Jake Kramer of the 82nd Airborne 
Division. He said four people suffered serious injuries and were 
taken to U.S. treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. troops also arrested 13 ethnic Albanians believed to be  
members of the KLA after finding a cache of gasoline bombs, two 
grenades and several automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear they were going to set some houses on fire,''  
Kramer said of the detained Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Pristina, unidentified gunmen shot a man and a grenade  
exploded outside a building near the local headquarters of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the central city of Goric, a NATO patrol detained four KLA  
soldiers with weapons. Such detentions have been continuing despite 
an agreement by the militia to turn over most of their arms and 
demobilize. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents coincided with a visit to by Gen. Henry Shelton,  
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, who expressed concern 
about violence in the U.S. sector and attacks on American 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	They also underscored the difficulties NATO troops face as they  
try to quell violence between ethnic Albanians and minority Serbs 
in Kosovo more than a month after starting the peacekeeping 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping force ``needs to be augmented by local police  
that are there 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' Shelton said. 
``We don't have enough to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency also expressed alarm over killings,  
kidnappings and forced expulsions of Serbs and Gypsies, or Roma, by 
ethnic Albanians intent on avenging the bloodshed and destruction 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In one incident, two Serbs were abducted from a UNHCR-run center  
in downtown Pristina by five men dressed in black and carrying 
radio handsets. The remaining Serbs were so frightened the UNHCR 
decided to move them.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Cyclist Quits Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-FLOUR, France (AP) -- As the Tour de France wound through  
the French countryside Friday, tensions from last year's doping 
scandal resurfaced after a rider who has consistently spoken out 
against drugs quit the race. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Christophe Bassons left claiming he felt  
``psychologically isolated'' after he had been told by other riders 
to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bassons, who wrote in a newspaper column that he only drinks  
``plain water,'' has drawn attention by speaking out against drug 
taking in a daily column in the Le Parisien newspaper. On Thursday, 
he wrote that leader Lance Armstrong approached him and suggested 
that he leave the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Armstrong told me: Why don't you just go away?'' Basson wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year's race was overshadowed by a doping controversy in  
which the Festina team was thrown out of the race and six other 
teams withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal brought the race to a temporary halt and has plagued  
the sport since. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has been forced to respond to a campaign of innuendo  
in parts of the French press about what might be fueling his 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who has made an astonishing recovery from testicular  
cancer, has categorically denied taking banned drugs, crediting his 
success to hard work, preparation and good luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Marie Leblanc, president of the company that runs the Tour,  
said Friday that the results from a third set of blood tests -- 
which included race-leader Lance Armstrong and his U.S. Postal 
Service team -- turned out negative. 
</P>
<P>
	And he voiced confidence in this year's competitors, saying on  
French radio he is convinced that illegal drugs such as the 
performance-enhancing EPO have ``all but disappeared'' from the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to sign a piece of paper guaranteeing that  
Armstrong or another is completely pure, but experienced Tour 
watchers can tell by observing the riders and their performances,'' 
Leblanc added.

<HEADLINE>  Dierckxsens Won Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-ETIENNE France (AP) -- A factory worker, Ludo Dierckxsens  
decided to become a professional cyclist at an age when many riders 
are already pondering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging by the nature of his victory on the 11th stage of the  
Tour de France on Thursday, the 35-year-old Dierckxsens is 
determined to savor every minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming just two weeks after becoming Belgian champion, this is  
a dream,'' said Dierckxsens, who punched the air in delight and 
blew kisses to the crowd even before crossing the finishing line. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierckxsens turned professional in 1994. Although he is one of  
the cycling circuit's veterans, he believes he'll be able to 
compete at the top level for another two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
	At an event like the Tour de France, Dierckxsens plays a vital,  
although unsung, role for his team -- Italy's Lampre -- as someone 
who nurses the team's stars in his slipstream, tactically blocking 
off its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hardly glamorous, but on a day like Thursday when most of  
the leaders at the tour -- including top three Lance Armstrong, 
Abraham Olano and Alex Zulle -- were happy to sit back and rest 
their muscles after two punishing days in the Alps, the Belgian 
grabbed his chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``At last I've done it!'' he rejoiced after his stage victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Although it was a low-key race, his victory was a refreshing  
one. But it didn't change the overall standings. Going into the 
race, Dierckxsens was trailing overall leader Armstrong by 1 hour, 
14 minutes and 33 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union authorities today carried out  
the third set of blood tests on 40 riders from eight teams, 
including Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team. Tour president 
Jean-Marie Leblanc said all the results turned out negative. 
</P>
<P>
	However, tensions from last year's doping scandal reemerged  
today, when Christophe Bassons, an outspoken critic of drug taking, 
quit the race, claiming that he had been told to keep quiet by 
other riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bassons, who wrote in a newspaper column that he only takes  
``clear water,'' claims that Armstrong was among those who told him 
to keep his thoughts to himself on doping. 
</P>
<P>
	In second place Thursday was Dmitri Konyshev of Russia, 1 minute  
27 seconds behind. He narrowly edged out Kazakstan's Alexandre 
Vinokourov. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium had two high finishes, with Rik Verbrugghe coming in  
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The main pack, including Armstrong, Richard Virenque and other  
top contenders, finished more than 22 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming down from the Alps, the riders snaked through tranquil  
villages and rolling countryside alongside vineyards, apricot 
orchards and fields of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a relatively flat 14-mile ride from Le Bourg d'Oisans in  
the Alps to Saint-Etienne, capital of French bicycle manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	A group broke away after about 62 miles and led for the rest of  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's U.S. Postal team was happy to lead the pack for much  
of the race, controlling the only riders likely to eat into the 
27-year-old Texan's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one notable climb, the 3,963-foot Col de la Croix de  
Chaubouret, before a descent into St. Etienne. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's stage is a 126-mile race between Saint-Galmier and  
Saint-Flour. The race ends on the Champs Elysees in Paris on July 
25.

<HEADLINE> Longshore Workers Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Longshore workers and West Coast port  
managers have agreed to terms on a three-year contract, ending a 
dispute that affected some of the nation's largest ports, union 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement reached Thursday were not disclosed  
pending ratification of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement ushers in a new era for the West Coast  
waterfront as we move into the 21st century,'' said Joe Miniace, 
president of the Pacific Maritime Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike originated with Local 10 of the International  
Longshore Workers Union in San Francisco. The walkout stopped most 
activity at the Port of Oakland, which includes 12 cargo terminals 
serving 33 shipping lines. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the PMA reported slowdowns at all major ports up  
and down the West Coast -- Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Oakland, Los 
Angeles and Long Beach -- which handled $266 billion in goods last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The association and union leaders had negotiated since May on a  
contract affecting 14,700 union members on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's offer included a 32 percent boost in pension  
benefits to future retirees and a 15 percent raise for those 
already retired. Miniace had said it would make West Coast workers 
``among the highest compensated union workers in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pay in 1998 averaged $99,000 for workers, $117,617 for clerks  
and $156,251 for foremen, according to the association. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing contract allows union members to stop work whenever  
they perceive a safety problem. The association sought to eliminate 
that option, arguing the union rank-and-file has used it to stage 
unauthorized work stoppages and slowdowns.

	Industrial Output Rises in June  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Output at the nation's factories, mines and  
utilities posted a slight increase in June, finishing the best 
quarter for manufacturing in more than a year. The Federal Reserve 
reported today that industrial production rose 0.2 percent, 
matching the gain in output in May, and was in line with analysts' 
expectations. The June performance left industrial output rising at 
an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the second quarter, the best 
showing since a 6.6 percent rate of increase in the final three 
months of 1997. The growth rate in the April-June quarter this year 
was triple the 1.3 percent growth rate of the first quarter.

<P>
	ROY, Utah (AP) -- Iomega Corp., maker of removable-media  
data-storage devices, has posted a net loss of $47.1 million, or 17 
cents a share, for its second quarter. That compared with a net 
loss of $39.9 million, or 15 cents a share, for the same period of 
1998, and was within the range announced by the company on June 18. 
The company's second-quarter loss announced yesterday includes a 
pretax restructuring charge of $41.9 million stemming from closing 
facilities and eliminating jobs. Before the restructuring charge, 
the company posted a net loss of $19.8 million, or 7 cents a share.

	Nissan Chief Wants Profits Soon  
</P>
<P>
	FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- After two weeks on the job, the  
former Renault executive charged with overhauling Nissan Motor Co. 
says the Japanese automaker needs to start turning a profit again 
next year. Nissan will have to come back to profit very quickly,'' 
Carlos Ghosn said. ``When I say quickly, I'm saying specifically 
the year 2000. I think the year 1999 is already, unfortunately, in 
the red.'' Ghosn is the Renault SA vice president who became 
Nissan's chief operating officer July 1. He's on a two-week tour of 
Nissan's U.S. operations as part of his effort to develop a 
turnaround plan by late September.

<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower today on  
fears of a possible military showdown between Taiwan and China, 
with the key index in Taipei plunging more than 6 percent. The 
Taipei bourse's Weighted Stock Price Index tumbled 506.46 points, 
or 6.4 percent, to close at 7,411.58, in the biggest one-day fall 
since January, 1996 when the market was rattled by Chinese war 
games. The index has lost 12.4 percent since the latest political 
row between Beijing and Taipei started battering prices on Tuesday. 
The Japanese 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 183.56 points, or 
1.00 percent, to close at 18,248.30 points. In Hong Kong, the Hang 
Seng Index fell 213.65 points, 1.6 percent, to close at 13,545.24.

surprising strength still hasn't sparked inflation. The Dow Jones 
industrial average advanced 38.31 to 11,186.41, finishing the day 
less than 15 points from Monday's record close of 11,200.98. 
Broader stock indexes also advanced. The Nasdaq composite rose 
21.24 to 2,839.37 for its second straight record close, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 11.45 to 1,409.62, topping last Friday's

contamination problems in Europe, posted a profit of nearly $1 
billion that met most Wall Street forecasts. The Dow also drew a 
big boost from Hewlett-Packard, which rallied late in the day, 
closing 4 9/16 higher at 113. There was no news to explain the late 
surge, which may have been related to last-minute positioning 
before the expiration of options contracts on Friday.

<HEADLINE> 1st Perfect Game of Pac-Man Played </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPER CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Baseball has produced 15 perfect games  
in more than 120 years of the major leagues. Now, after 19 years, 
Pac-Man has its first. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Mitchell, 34, become the first person to master the video  
arcade classic when he posted a score of 3,333,360 during the 
Fourth of July weekend at a New Hampshire arcade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the race to the Holy Grail,'' said Mitchell, an  
entrepreneur who runs two South Florida restaurants and markets a 
brand of hot sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	No one ever had played a perfect Pac-Man game before, said  
Walter Day, chief scorekeeper for the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic 
Score Board and editor of its Official Video Game and Pinball Book 
in Fairfield, Iowa. Game experts call the feat a one in 10 billion 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	To attain Pac-Man perfection, one must navigate the yellow  
pie-shaped title character so it gobbles each and every dot, enemy 
blue ghost, energizer and fruit on the game's 256 boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell accomplished the feat during a two-day quest at Funspot  
Family Entertainment Center in Weirs Beach, N.H. That's the site of 
the Twin Galaxies International Classic Video Game and Pinball 
Tournament each May. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting anew each time he made a mistake, Mitchell finally  
found his groove in a game that lasted almost six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``At about 1.9 million (points), I went off pattern,'' he said.  
``I said to myself, `I'm losing it here. I didn't come this far to 
lose.' I started talking out loud to myself, talking my way through 
it. I was able to cheat death, so to speak. It was flawless the 
rest of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though hardly a household name, Mitchell is famous among video  
game and pinball players, whose numbers worldwide are estimated at 
500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 17, Mitchell set the world record in Donkey Kong, a title  
he still holds. Today, he holds the records for Pac-Man, Donkey 
Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.

<HEADLINE> Senate's Civility Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the Senate was but 8 years old, Thomas  
Jefferson lamented the decline in civility among its members. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third president made the comment in a letter to a  
friend. It was read Friday by Senate Historian Richard Baker at a 
conference, where more than two centuries later, academics and 
congressional staffers bemoaned the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in the majority, it's easier to handle this  
civility thing,'' observed former Sen. Bob Dole, the Kansas 
Republican who quit his job as majority leader during his 1996 
presidential bid. ``The topic is `Civility and Deliberation in the 
United States Senate.' We have too little of one and too much of 
the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole was the main speaker of the event, which was put on by the  
University of Kansas institute bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Dole's speech and brief remarks by Kansas Republican  
Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback, the scholars, staffers, 
lobbyists and reporters who attended the Capitol Hill seminar heard 
from no other senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference was funded with a $100,000 grant from the Pew  
Charitable Trusts and the Aspen Institute, which developed an 
interest in the subject following two civility retreats in Hershey, 
Pa., for members of the House, whose raucous behavior has at times 
brought lawmakers close to blows. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, decorum rules the Senate, whose members refer to  
one another as ``my distinguished colleague'' and address each 
other only through the presiding officer, 
</P>
<P>
	Then why the concern about propriety in the Senate?  
</P>
<P>
	Because, said the National Journal's Richard Cohen, deliberation  
-- ``at least, deliberation that's accountable, inclusive, 
thoughtful and wide-ranging'' -- is lacking. Lawmakers have too many 
committee assignments, staff member have too much power and party 
agendas rule the day, he said.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Add 2 From Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays promoted  
outfielder Terrell Lowery from Triple-A Durham and recalled 
reliever Mike Duvall from the minor league affiliate on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Randy Winn, who was batting .253 with one homer and  
20 RBIs, was optioned to Durham, while left-hander Scott Aldred, 
who was 3-2 with a 5.18 ERA in 37 games, was designated for 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Aldred must be traded, sent outright to the minors or released  
within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowery, the second-leading hitter in the International League at  
.335, was the starting center fielder in Friday night's game 
against the New York Mets. He batted .200 in seven games during a 
stint with the Devil Rays in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Duvall appeared in 16 games in two earlier stays with the Devil  
Rays this season and was 0-1 with a 3.27 ERA.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has ordered provincial  
leaders to redouble efforts to stimulate China's faltering economy 
following reports that economic growth slowed further in the first 
half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics released Friday confirmed what earlier reports had  
already suggested: that the economy has weakened due to continued 
deflation, sluggish foreign investment and trade, and the Communist 
legacy of an inefficient, unprofitable state sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic growth fell to 7.6 percent in real terms, down  
substantially from the 8.3 percent rate reported for the first 
quarter. Exports slipped 4.6 percent from the same period a year 
earlier, while foreign investment fell 19.9 percent to $19.4 
billion, the State Statistical Bureau announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the figures announced had been reported piecemeal in the  
country's state-controlled media in recent days, including gross 
domestic product and foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's report, however, provided a fuller portrait of an  
economy that has failed to respond as hoped to policies intended to 
catalyze a recovery through higher consumer spending and public 
works projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu summoned provincial leaders to the capital to flesh out  
China's economic strategy and unify the leaders in devoting greater 
attention to economic problems, the Communist Party's leading 
newspaper, the People's Daily, said. 
</P>
<P>
	To stimulate foreign investment, China also plans to ease  
foreign exchange restrictions for foreign-funded firms, another 
official newspaper, the China Daily, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the second quarter's growth of 7.1 percent was above  
the government's target of 7 percent, current trends are clearly 
downward. China reported economic growth of 7.8 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Such figures, however, can be deceptive. Compared with other  
major economies, inefficient China wastes state money on dubious 
building projects and production of goods that nobody buys. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has been spending heavily on highway building and  
other public works, trying to pump up demand that is so feeble 
consumer prices have been falling for 18 straight months. It has 
slashed interest rates on savings accounts and begun promoting 
consumer credit to encourage more spending by thrifty consumers, 
who save 40 percent of their income on average. 
</P>
<P>
	With millions losing their jobs, and associated benefits such as  
cheap housing and health care, each year as inefficient state 
factories close, many Chinese prefer to keep their money in the 
bank. Growth in consumer spending slipped to 5.5 percent in the 
second quarter, down from 7.4 percent in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty on eBay Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A man could be sentenced to 15 years in  
prison for bilking more than $37,000 from customers who bid on 
items with the eBay online auction site. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert J. Guest, 31, of Blue Jay, pleaded guilty Wednesday to  
one count of mail fraud and one count of illegally obtaining a 
credit card, the U.S. Attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Guest -- who also used the name Darren Jay  
Farmer -- posted phony listings with eBay in May 1998, including 
offers to sell digital cameras, laptop computers and gems. After 
the auctions closed, Guest contacted the winning bidders and asked 
them to send payment for the merchandise through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Guest accepted and cashed some $37,000 in checks and money  
orders from bidders and then never delivered the merchandise, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 1.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic To Stud at Lane's End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Charismatic, who broke a leg in the  
Belmont Stakes as he attempted to complete racing's Triple Crown, 
will enter stud next year at Lane's End Farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, was co-bred by  
Lane's End owner William S. Farish, and owned during his racing 
career by Bob and Beverly Lewis. A statement issued by Lane's End 
on Friday did not address who will own the horse during his stud 
career, and Farish could not immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic ran twice in $62,500 claiming races last winter,  
then emerged unexpectedly as the best of the 3-year-old crop, 
winning the Lexington Stakes, Kentucky Derby and Preakness in 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the June 9 Belmont, the D. Wayne Lukas-trained colt  
was poised to be the first horse to sweep the Triple Crown since 
Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	At Belmont, Charismatic led with an eighth of a mile to go, but  
took a bad step and fractured his left foreleg as Lemon Drop Kid 
swept by to win the race. Charismatic finished third, 1 1/2 lengths 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said the fracture, which shattered Charismatic's  
cannon bone and broke his sesamoid, easily could have proved fatal 
had the bone broken through Charismatic's skin. They praised jockey 
Chris Antley for dismounting shortly after the finish line and 
lifting Charismatic's injured leg to take weight off it. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the injury and subsequent surgery, Charismatic has been  
recuperating in Lukas' barn at Belmont. He is expected to remain in 
his stall for another two to three months, and it was not 
immediately clear when he will be shipped to Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> Northridge Fires Football Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cal State Northridge coach Ron Ponciano was  
fired Friday amid an internal university inquiry into alleged rules 
violations in the football program. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the independent inquiry continues, interim university  
president Louanne Kennedy said the results so far show ``serious 
and substantial'' violations of NCAA and university rules that 
compelled the school to take action. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are continuing to sort through some of the  
allegations, the picture of non-compliance that has already emerged 
is clear, serious and substantial,'' Kennedy said. ``Thus it was 
necessary to make a change now for the coming season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university sent Ponciano a letter firing him from the job  
he's held since February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Matadors were 7-4 last season, tying for second in the Big  
Sky Conference with a 5-3 record. Previously, Ponciano was 
defensive coordinator during the 1995 and 1996 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ponciano will receive the standard 90 days severance pay, the  
university said. He wasn't available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry was spurred by an anonymous letter received May 19  
that listed 20 allegations. The inquiry, begun May 24, is being 
headed by Northridge's internal auditor and its faculty athletic 
representative. The NCAA also has been consulted, university 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are determined to resolve all of the allegations raised in  
the letter,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials met Friday with the football coaching staff  
and players to explain the firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said assistant Terrance Johnson will be the team's  
administrator in charge until a coach is hired. Northridge opens 
the season at home Sept. 4 against Western Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an institution, Cal State Northridge is committed to a  
strong athletic program that plays by the rules and wins,'' 
athletic director Dick Dull said. ``We'll be looking for a football 
coach who can do both.''

<HEADLINE> Tony Gwynn on DL With Strained Calf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Tony Gwynn doesn't know when he'll be back,  
leaving the eight-time National League batting champion scratching 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very frustrating,'' the San Diego outfielder said Friday.  
``It tightened up completely out of the blue yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, 18 hits shy of reaching 3,000 in his career, is on the  
disabled list for the second time this season because of a strained 
left calf. He is batting .338. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, 39, was optimistic at the All-Star game this week that he  
would be able to play in Thursday night's opening game at Safeco 
Field against Seattle. He was in Boston on Tuesday night even 
though he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday's game at Safeco, Gwynn felt tightness in his  
left calf while doing some light running on the new stadium's grass 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	He described his injury as being ``like a knife'' being stuck  
into his injured calf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I was out there,'' he said before Friday night's game.  
``I've been on the DL now for seven of the last eight weeks. I'm a 
guy who likes to play, but I just can't go out here and blow it now 
just to be back in the lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be healthy and 100 percent well so I don't have to  
worry about anything,'' he said. ``All I can do is keep rehabbing 
and doing what I've been doing until I get to the point where I can 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was hurt the first time May 21 breaking out of the  
batter's box and missed 19 games. He came back June 12 and played 
seven games, then sat out three. His calf bothered him as he 
pursued a fly ball in warmups and he went back on the disabled list 
June 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this injury, I can't do anything in a game without being  
able to run,'' Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres manager Bruce Bochy is keeping his fingers crossed about  
his star right fielder. Like Gwynn, he's unsure when he can pencil 
him back into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really has us buffaloed, to be honest,'' Bochy said. ``We  
thought he was ready a couple weeks ago and then he reinjured it. 
We gave him a little bit more time than normal and he hurt it again 
yesterday after feeling great.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Congratulates Tommy Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- With ex-wife Pamela Anderson Lee and his  
toddler son looking on, tattooed rocker Tommy Lee was congratulated 
by a judge for behaving while on probation for spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Lawrence Mira told the former Motley Crue  
drummer Thursday that he was ``entitled to more confidence than I 
have had in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge refused a plea by Lee's lawyer to dismiss  
probation restrictions entirely, though he did loosen some rules. 
Lee will now be allowed to be in stores that sell alcohol and he 
can perform in places where alcohol is served. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Lee or the actress spoke to reporters as they left the  
courthouse with 18-month-old Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was placed on three years' probation after pleading no  
contest in April 1998 to kicking his wife several times during a 
fight while she held their son. The couple split, but have 
reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Lee was on probation for attacking a photographer  
in 1996.

<P>
	Today is Saturday, July 17, the 198th day of 1999. There are 167  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	One hundred years ago, on July 17, 1899, actor James Cagney was  
born in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1821, Spain ceded Florida to the United States.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1898, during the Spanish-American War, Spanish troops in  
Santiago, Cuba, surrendered to U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1917, the British royal family's name was changed from  
Saxe-Coburg Gotha to Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, 322 people were killed when two ammunition ships  
exploded in Port Chicago, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, Disneyland debuted in Anaheim, Calif.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, an ``Apollo'' spaceship docked with a ``Soyuz''  
spacecraft in orbit in the first superpower link-up of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza resigned and fled  
into exile in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, 114 people were killed when a pair of walkways above  
the lobby of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel collapsed during a 
``tea dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, TWA Flight 800, a Paris-bound Boeing 747, exploded and  
crashed off Long Island, N.Y., shortly after leaving John F. 
Kennedy International Airport, killing all 230 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Woolworth Corp. announced it was closing its 400  
remaining five-and-dime stores across the country, ending 117 years 
in business. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The controversial B-2 Stealth bomber underwent  
its first test flight at Edwards Air Force Base in California, two 
days after a technical problem forced a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy continued to  
smash into Jupiter, sending up towering fireballs. Brazil defeated 
Italy to win its fourth World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Prosecutors in the Monica Lewinsky case questioned  
President Clinton's Secret Service protectors before a grand jury. 
Nicholas II, the last of the Romanov czars, was buried in Russia 80 
years after he and his family were executed by the Bolsheviks. In 
Rome, delegates from more than 100 countries overwhelmingly 
approved a historic treaty creating the world's first permanent war 
crimes tribunal -- ignoring strenuous U.S. objections over certain 
provisions.

<HEADLINE> Franchitti Loves Toronto Circuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Some people might find racing on a temporary  
street circuit confining, with concrete barriers looming at every 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Dario Franchitti, like most of the drivers in the CART FedEx  
Series, professes to love the 1.755-mile, 11-turn circuit where 
Sunday's Toronto Molson Indy will be run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scotsman certainly isn't intimidated. He's won the pole here  
each of the past two years, and Friday he took the provisional pole 
with a record lap of 109.023 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	That was considerably better than the track record of 105.694 he  
set last year, and it ended a string of races in which problems in 
the opening qualifying session put Franchitti in a hole for the 
second and final round of time trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this track, although I have a love-hate relationship  
with turn one,'' Franchitti said, referring to racing incidents in 
turn one each of the past two years that kept him from competing 
for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I love the challenge of running close to the walls  
and trying to run faster every lap,'' he added. ``You do a quick 
lap and brush the wall a little bit. It's pretty thrilling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who would pick up his first pole of the season and  
the seventh of his career if he held the top spot today in the 
final round of qualifying, credited improvement in the track and 
his Firestone racing tires for the speed increase from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The track is a lot faster than last year,'' he said. ``They  
sandblasted the concrete bits to make them more grippy in the 
transitions, and it's really working well. And the tires are great 
for the whole run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he was happy just to get through the 30-minute session  
without going off course or running into a mechanical problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a while since we didn't have a problem on the first  
day,'' Franchitti said. ``When I came in, my engineer said, `Thank 
God Friday's over.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't really think the provisional pole is all that  
important. Unless it rains tomorrow, everybody is going to be 
quicker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gil de Ferran was second at 108.760, followed by five-time  
Toronto winner Michael Andretti at 108.410, Paul Tracy at 108.229 
and Tony Kanaan at 108.220. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very good day for us,'' de Ferran said. ``I was lucky  
to get a clear lap on each set of tires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, whose last victory here came in 1995, was a little  
disappointed with his fast lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little sideways coming onto the final straightaway,  
and the computer said we lost three-tenths of a second,'' the 1991 
series champion said. ``That would have put us close. I think 
tomorrow is going to be pretty competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie sensation Juan Montoya, who leads the season points with  
four poles and four wins in his first 10 CART starts, was a 
somewhat disappointed eighth at 107.731. 
</P>
<P>
	``The track is pretty difficult because of the cement patches at  
the apex of each corner,'' said Montoya, who never saw the course 
before driving around it on a scooter on Thursday. ``We're going to 
have to work on the balance to get it right. We're not where we 
want to be with the car right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya's teammate, Jimmy Vasser, was sixth at 107.731, followed  
by Helio Castro-Neves at 107.937 and Montoya, who holds an 18-point 
lead over Andretti in the championship battle.

<HEADLINE> Spaniard Wins Tour Stage Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-FLOUR, France (AP) -- American Lance Armstrong managed to  
take it easy during a stage race, finished in a modest position and 
still extended his lead at the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	After grueling rides through the Alps, the main contenders sat  
back for the next two stages before next week's crucial climb 
through the Pyrenees on the Spanish border. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, yellow jersey holder Armstrong finished 19th, yet  
still gained a couple of seconds over his nearest rival, Spaniard 
Abraham Olano. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, none of the riders needing to cut into Armstrong's  
7-minute, 42-second lead have been attacking through the French 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Texan, who has staged a remarkable recovery from  
cancer, has twice led the main pack alongside his U.S. Postal 
teammates, keeping a close eye on rivals behind him, while lesser 
names have won the stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's winner was Spain's David Extebarria, who said he hoped  
the victory would help his ONCE team give Spanish cycling a timely 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Basque was the first Spaniard to win here in two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This victory is very satisfying from a personal point of view,  
but also for the team,'' Extebarria said. ``This shows we have a 
place on the tour, and maybe will even get one on the podium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time last year, all four Spanish cycling teams angrily  
withdrew midway through the race to protest the way police were 
handling the doping scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Extebarria dedicated the win to a Frenchman -- teammate and world  
No. 1 Laurent Jalabert -- who boycotted this year's tour because of 
the doping scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalabert was angered at how ONCE team director Manolo Saiz was  
banned from participating in the race due to drug abuse 
allegations. Team doctor Nicolas Terrados was also banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Saiz's ban was recently overruled by the International Cycling  
Union, and he was reinstated. But it was too late for Jalabert to 
get in condition to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jalabert taught me a lot and always has supported me in  
difficult moments,'' Extebarria said. ``My victories are partly 
thanks to his advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Extebarria started the day more than 28 minutes behind Armstrong  
in 27th position. He said his victory was in some respects a 
vindication of the ONCE team. 
</P>
<P>
	In second place for the stage was French champion Francois  
Simon, 26 seconds behind the leader. In third was Italy's Alberto 
Elli. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage began in Saint-Galmier in southern France and ended in  
Saint-Flour, a picturesque town perched on a huge rock and boasting 
a 15th-century cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	There were six climbs Friday, and the race took place in warm  
sunshine. There were very few straight patches, and on the way up 
to the finish line there was a 2.6-mile climb. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a similar scenario Thursday as Belgian champion Ludo  
Dierckxsens won the 11th stage, with the leaders taking care not to 
exert themselves too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's 13th stage is a 148-mile descent from Saint-Four, high  
in the Auvergne, to Albi, in the heart of French Midi.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Peace Still Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's feuding  
Protestant and Catholic politicians just need more space and time 
to repair the heavy-duty damage inflicted on their peace accord, 
Britain's senior official here insisted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said all the players  
involved were ``sad and disappointed'' over Thursday's dramatic 
failure to form a new Protestant-Catholic administration for the 
British-ruled province. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mowlam stressed that she believed it still eventually will  
happen, adding, ``We're not going to stand still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the British government was hoping former U.S. Sen.  
George Mitchell would play a role in identifying the best route 
forward, beginning Tuesday at a meeting in London with the British 
and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell chaired two years of negotiations that produced the  
1998 Good Friday peace accord, which called for the establishment 
of the coalition government. Since then, he has steered clear of 
any direct involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the prime ministers conclude that I can usefully play a  
role at this time, then I will do all I can to be helpful,'' 
Mitchell said in a statement late Friday from London. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair's Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister talked  
to President Clinton for 20 minutes on Friday and that the two men 
``both agreed that the peace process is still very much alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president said that he would continue to do whatever was  
felt to be helpful in bringing a lasting settlement to Northern 
Ireland,'' said the spokesman, speaking on customary anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belfast, eight grim delegations from each party that  
supported the landmark accord had separate meetings with Northern 
Ireland political development minister Paul Murphy, who is likely 
to replace Mowlam if she transfers, as expected, to a new 
government post this month. 
</P>
<P>
	But the wounds opened Thursday when the Ulster Unionists,  
Northern Ireland's major Protestant party, refused to take part in 
the long-postponed election of a cross-community Cabinet were still 
running raw 24 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble was supposed to oversee the  
formation of the intended 12-member, four-party administration, but 
stymied it coming together Thursday by keeping his party away from 
a crucial nominating session. 
</P>
<P>
	He defended his boycott as necessary to ensure that the Irish  
Republican Army-linked Sinn Fein party didn't receive its allotted 
two Cabinet posts until the IRA agreed to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Murphy, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams lambasted  
Trimble's attitude to the whole peace process and questioned 
whether his party had ever accepted last year's accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Good Friday agreement is either a ladder out of injustice,  
discrimination and inequality -- or it's a sham,'' Adams said, 
repeating his call for Trimble to resign as the unformed 
administration's leader-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, refused to discuss  
whether he would resign from his post to allow the process of 
forming a government to start from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble's moderate Catholic deputy, Seamus Mallon, resigned  
Thursday in condemnation of the Ulster Unionists' tactics and 
suggested Friday that Trimble could ``catch up'' by doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Mowlam would not say whether she thought Trimble should resign,  
at least temporarily, as the Cabinet's designated first minister. 
Trimble has privately been calling for her own resignation for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mowlam conceded there was ``a question mark'' over whether  
Trimble could remain with Mallon gone, since Northern Ireland's 
legislature elected Trimble and Mallon in a single joint vote last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in southern Belfast, police arrested three people  
after finding a cache of weapons when they raided a house in a 
hard-line Protestant area. Among the weapons were a submachine gun, 
three handguns, a pipe bomb and a detonator.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Wants Boycott of S. Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The NAACP wants blacks to avoid  
vacationing in South Carolina until the state removes a Confederate 
Flag flying from its statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
on Thursday approved the boycott at its national meeting in New 
York. The resolution must still be ratified by the national board 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking African Americans and others who believe in  
fairness to consider relocating their family reunions, conventions, 
church groups and other meetings outside of the state as long as 
the Confederate flag is flown over the state Capitol,'' said James 
Gallman, president of the group's South Carolina chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism is a top industry in South Carolina and visitors spent  
$6.8 billion in the state last year, according to the state Parks, 
Recreation and Tourism Department. Two million blacks vacationed in 
the state in 1997, the latest numbers available. They accounted for 
$280 million in direct spending. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawmaker accused the civil rights group of fostering  
stereotypes about white Southerners. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they brand it as a symbol of racism I guess they're  
saying all of us who like it for heritage reasons are somehow 
flirting with racism, and that's just not true,'' said Glenn 
McConnell, a Republican state senator who owns a Confederate 
memorabilia gallery in Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't like to be stereotyped, and one thing the NAACP  
has successfully and admirably fought against is the stereotyping 
of African Americans. They should not now make the mistake of 
trying to stereotype white Southerners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Past efforts to bring down the flag have failed, including a  
lawsuit filed by the city of Columbia and state business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in 1995 passed a law giving the Legislature sole power  
to remove it. Former Republican Gov. David Beasley's campaign to 
take it down has been credited as one reason he lost his 
re-election bid in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag was raised over the Statehouse in 1962 to commemorate  
the Civil War's centennial. Opponents say it is an offensive 
reminder of slavery. Supporters say it celebrates the state's 
heritage and the sacrifice of South Carolina natives during the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's heritage, put it in a museum where it belongs,''  
Gallman said. ``It does not belong on top of the state Capitol as a 
symbol of a conqueror over people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP resolution also asked the U.S. Justice Department to  
investigate and remove the flag from any public building or display 
across the nation. South Carolina is the only state that still 
flies the flag over its Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi and Georgia incorporate the flag in their state  
flags.

	LAYTONSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The mayor of this tiny town is looking  
for a big gesture from its 285 residents: He wants all of them to 
register as organ donors. 
</P>
<P>
	At a picnic Thursday night, Charles White plied his constituents  
with fried chicken, soft drinks and plenty of encouragement. About 
60 of the 100 families who live here turned in pledge cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a start,'' said White, who hopes to register everyone  
by summer's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done research, and, as far as we know, no other  
community in America has done this,'' said Barbara Kerr, 
spokeswoman for First Family Pledge, a program set up by the 
American Society of Transplant Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some Laytonsville residents remained skeptical. Donna  
Potcner remembered the moments her family spent together after the 
deaths of her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't know if I would want to be rushed right off''  
after dying, she said. ``I still have the image in my mind of 
having family time with my brothers and sisters with the body. It's 
just a wonderful thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4,000 patients die each year in the United States  
while waiting for donated organs.

<HEADLINE> Alexander's Campaign Gets Personal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSCEOLA, Iowa (AP) -- To a large extent, Lamar Alexander is  
starting over. The former Tennessee governor is focusing his 
presidential campaign on Iowa, trying to build an organization that 
will give him some much needed momentum in his drive for the 
Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But as he travels the state, he is competing for attention with  
GOP presidential rivals like George W. Bush and Steve Forbes who 
are far better financed and draw much bigger crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander finished third in the 1996 Iowa caucuses.  
</P>
<P>
	Even after dropping out of the 1996 race, he never really  
stopped running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to start over,'' Alexander said Thursday during a  
stop at The Quilt Patch Family Restaurant on his 60-county tour of 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have moved away, some people have died and some  
people have lost their interest,'' said Terry Branstad, governor of 
Iowa for 16 years and Alexander's Iowa campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
	Short on money, Alexander is focusing on Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
	He needs a strong finish in the Ames straw poll next month to  
jumpstart his campaign. While he insists that no candidate should 
quit the race on the basis of results of the straw poll, his 
organization has mapped out a county-by-county goal of how many 
people they need to participate. Alexander plans to meet with 
people where they live. 
</P>
<P>
	``My objective is to show that I'm better prepared ... and that  
I have an organization that's capable of winning the caucuses,'' 
Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander reported Thursday that over the first six months of  
the year, he had raised about $2.5 million and spent most of it. He 
had $90,750 in the bank and debts totaling $234,123. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, by comparison, reported raising $37 million and had $30  
million cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	In Creston, Alexander told voters that big money poses a threat  
to the Iowa caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to save the Iowa caucuses, send a message that  
Iowa cannot be bought, that time and attention matter more than 
money, and that a candidate's message matters more than the balance 
of his or her account,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some political analysts say that Alexander, along with others  
running again for the GOP nomination, fails to excite the passion 
of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're has-beens,'' said Arthur Miller, director of the Iowa  
Social Science Institute at the University of Iowa. ``They're not 
the new kid on the block and they're not getting people excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five minutes before he arrived on his campaign stop, two  
retirees and an elderly couple waited patiently to meet with 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure he is the one,'' said Clarence Stalcup, 72, a  
retired farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	The only sign in town of Alexander's visit was a three-paragraph  
mention in the local newspaper and balloons outside the cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time we had a crowd out by the courthouse,'' said Helen  
Saylor, Alexander's Clarke County campaign chairwoman. ``This was 
short notice. We got word of it last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived here in his recreational vehicle ``Exceeding  
Expectations.'' A television news crew, photographers and local 
reporters quickly outnumbered supporters waiting in a private 
dining room at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	While about a dozen attended this event, earlier ones attracted  
about three dozen each. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander touched on his themes of improving education, flextime  
for parents, and reducing taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told supporters the race hasn't started yet.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander has warned that a Bush win in the Iowa caucuses would  
mean the state would lose its place as a training ground for 
presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Although spending time in the state is important, Miller, the  
political analyst, said Bush may be siphoning the moderate votes 
from Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're for whoever wins,'' Ruth Audlehelm, who with husband  
Paul, said they were undecided and there to hear Alexander out. 
``We're Republicans to the core.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether the time Alexander has spent in the state  
matters, Dave Kaiser, a retired utility linesman, said: ``I think 
it means a whole lot more to him than to me.''

<HEADLINE> HMO Legislation Fights For Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The emotional partisan Senate debate over  
patient protections is over but the battle for public opinion 
labored on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott accused President Clinton of  
refusing to look for a compromise with the GOP over a patients 
rights bill it pushed through the Senate on nearly total party-line 
vote Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president will quit whining, griping and threatening,  
and come up and engage, we'll work with him and see if we can find 
a bill he'll sign,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his opponents were accusing him of ``relying on  
personal stories'' and ``trying to play on the emotions of people'' 
by talking about patients denied access to specialists or forced to 
travel to faraway hospitals after an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, get a life,'' Clinton said of his critics. ``What is  
politics about anyway?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he hoped Republicans would come around and support  
the Democratic health care proposals that went down to defeat this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not too late to do right,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	However, neither Democrats nor Republicans showed much interest  
in finding a compromise in the months of discussions leading up to 
this week's Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans, wary of increased government regulations,  
would be satisfied to let the issue die amid the conflict. And some 
Democrats hope to capitalize on the issue in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton called the GOP bill unacceptable, and Vice  
President Al Gore promised it would never get past the president's 
desk. But Lott said Clinton might change his mind, noting that he 
has signed other legislation during his presidency after initially 
opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't put a lot of stock in his empty threats,'' Lott said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton kept to his pitch Friday, saying Republicans had  
``basically signed up with the health insurance companies against 
all the doctors and all the nurses and all the patients in America 
....'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislative battle now moves to the House, where action one  
package of modest proposals is being held up by Democrats and a 
handful of Republicans on the House Education and Workforce 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But leaders of the House Commerce Committee were still looking  
for a bipartisan compromise, and there were suggestions they might 
produce a bill next week.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Advising Rail Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Mexican officials say they will only act as an  
advisor for a suspected serial killer linked to nine slayings in 
three states, including six in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He specifically requested for us to collaborate with his  
attorneys. We will be available with his attorneys to provide any 
information he would need,'' said Jose Mendoza Caamano, Mexico's 
deputy consul general in Houston. ``We have to conform to the rules 
of the American system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mendoza Caamano made the statements Friday after visiting  
39-year-old Angel Maturino Resendiz for two hours at his jail cell, 
where he is being held without bond for last year's burglary of a 
slain Houston-area physician. 
</P>
<P>
	If Maturino Resendiz's DNA matches samples taken from Dr.  
Claudia Benton's home, the burglary charge will be upgraded to 
capital murder, punishable in Texas by either life in prison or 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The envoy said he and the defendant discussed the illegal  
immigrant's life in Mexico and the possibility of the death penalty 
being imposed if the former fugitive is convicted of capital murder 
in Texas. He declined to disclose the conversation's details. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one of the suspect's family members believes his  
brother was duped by Texas authorities during negotiations for the 
fugitive's surrender Tuesday in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	Florentino Maturino, the brother who walked the alleged killer  
across an El Paso border bridge, says his family was told that 
Maturino Resendiz would not face a death sentence on any of the 
Texas murders linked to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't the intention, to give him the death penalty,''  
said Florentino Maturino. 
</P>
<P>
	But Texas officials say the ex-convict's sister -- Manuela  
Maturino, of Albuquerque, N.M. -- knew she risked seeing her brother 
executed in Texas when she brokered his surrender to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only negotiated with the sister,'' said Tom Vinger,  
spokesman for Texas Department of Public Safety. ``Whatever anybody 
else understood is not something we have control over. With the 
sister, the death penalty was discussed. She understood it was a 
possibility. And there were no promises made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinger confirmed that Ms. Maturino never had an attorney present  
during meetings with Texas Rangers but that she was well informed 
about the possibility that her brother might face an execution in 
Texas if convicted in any of the six murders he's now suspected of 
committing.

<HEADLINE> EU Decision Could Damage Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- A European Union decision to stop granting  
foreign aid to promote tourism would damage South Pacific economies 
that rely heavily on the industry, officials warned today. 
</P>
<P>
	The main tourism body for a dozen Pacific countries fears the EU  
decision will strip its member nations of almost all the funds they 
spend internationally on advertising and promotion as travel 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Levani Tuinabua, chief executive of the Tourism Council of the  
South Pacific, said the new policy might work in the Caribbean and 
Africa, but failed to take into account the isolation and smaller 
size of Pacific nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The European prescription will not work because the needs of  
the Pacific are quite different from the Caribbean and Africa,'' 
Tuinabua said. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union announced last November that tourism  
marketing and promotion would not qualify for foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Funds previously earmarked for tourism are to be switched to  
``humane resource development,'' private sector assistance and 
environmental preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinabua said the change will cost the South Pacific states most  
of the $1.5 million it spends annually on promotion and 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged that the region be treated as a special case because it  
is isolated and its countries are smaller and poorer than in other 
parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation of Pacific tourism ministers was considering a  
visit to EU headquarters in Brussels to argue the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The council represents 13 national tourist offices ranging from  
Tuvalu, whose 9 atolls and 10,000 Polynesian people get some 300 
tourists a year, to Fiji, which receives nearly 400,000 tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiji and Tahiti, the South Pacific's two main destinations, each  
spend about $6 million a year on promotion. But they also rely 
heavily on the council for participation in major world tourism 
fairs in Europe and America. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all Pacific Islands countries rate tourism as their main  
foreign exchange earner and in some cases main economic hope for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The council expects that visitors to the region in 1999 will  
reach one million for the first time.

<HEADLINE> House Proposes Reform of INS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service is  
a failure, said Rep. Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican who has 
introduced sweeping bipartisan legislation that would get rid of 
the agency and replace it with two others. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the proposed new agencies would focus exclusively on law  
enforcement, apprehending illegal aliens and deporting them. The 
other would oversee the naturalization of legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS cannot handle its dual functions, Rogers said Thursday.  
``We are fed up with the incompetence of the INS,'' he said. ``With 
its record of monumental failures, the agency has proven that it 
cannot carry out both missions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea drew immediate protest from immigrant advocacy groups.  
An INS spokeswoman said the agency agreed with many of Rogers' 
suggestions for change and looked forward to working with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The INS and the (Clinton) administration are absolutely  
committed to fundamental change at the INS,'' spokeswoman Maria 
Cardona said. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS supports splitting the agency's enforcement and  
naturalization functions, and putting them under separate chains of 
command, but agency officials believe both should remain in one 
agency, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans have bitterly complained about the INS for  
years, accusing it of fiscal mismanagement, allowing the Southwest 
border of the United States to become a ``sieve'' where illegal 
aliens cross at will and bungling the citizenship process, forcing 
applicants to wait for years to be sworn in as Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency recently came under fire for allowing suspected  
serial killer Angel Maturino Resendez to slip through its fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's supporters recited a long list of complaints about  
the INS, including what they said was its failure to reduce the 
backlog of 4 million immigrants waiting for citizenship, legal 
permanent residence or other visas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current INS resembles a car stranded by the side of the  
road,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a longtime INS critic. 
``Money intended for necessary repairs was spent to make it look 
shiny and new. But new paint can't hide the fact it is a 
broken-down wreck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At their side are some Democratic lawmakers who have been  
opponents of Republican immigration legislation. Rogers said 28 
Democrats and 29 Republicans had signed on as co-sponsors by 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some immigrant advocates denounced the Rogers plan as a  
wrongheaded solution that would make a bad situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If enacted as proposed, this plan will cripple services,  
eviscerate accountability and even weaken enforcement,'' said Frank 
Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Pitchers Leave With Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Jon Lieber and  
reliever Matt Karchner both were forced to leave Friday's game 
against Minnesota because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishaps marked the second straight Friday the Cubs have lost  
two pitchers in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieber left because of a bruised right forearm after being hit  
by Torri Hunter's line drive in the fifth inning. He was taken for 
precautionary X-rays with the Cubs trailing 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sixth, Karchner dropped to all fours on the mound after  
throwing ball four to Terry Steinbach. Karchner apparently 
aggravated a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Kevin Tapani left after two innings against the  
Chicago White Sox with a bruised right thumb after being hit by 
Mark Johnson's grounder. Karchner followed and left because of a 
groin strain. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieber had been the Cubs most effective starter this season. He  
entered the day at 8-3 with a 3.26 ERA, but allowed five runs and 
10 hits in 4 1-3 innings against the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieber was previously disabled April 29 through May 8 with a  
right eye contusion, suffered when he was struck with an errant 
throw during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Karchner was disabled once earlier this season with groin  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs have lost several pitchers to injury this season,  
starting with 1998 Rookie of the Year Kerry Wood, who was sidelined

<HEADLINE> British Open Horror Stories Common  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- The last time Greg Norman whiffed a  
shot he was on his knees trying to play from underneath some tea 
trees in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he missed a ball again -- and this one was only a few  
feet off the 17th fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	It happens at the Carnoustie Golf Links, where horror stories  
abound and one slight mistake or unfortunate bounce can mean 
instant triple bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't see the ball,'' Norman said. ``I don't think I've  
been in a situation like that in grass. It was a sand wedge and I 
was only trying to hit the ball six or 12 feet. It wasn't like I 
was trying to hit it 100 yards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it was any consolation, he wasn't alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Missing fairways that looked like cart paths from the tee made  
players at times resemble farm workers hacking away with scythes in 
wheat fields rather than trying to hit a little white ball. 
</P>
<P>
	First round leader Rodney Pampling hacked it from drainage ditch  
to the gnarly rough and hit it twice more before finding the ninth 
fairway Friday. He then went out of the tournament with a 15-over 
86 that made him the first golfer ever to miss an Open cut after 
leading the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods was more fortunate in the thick grass around the  
12th green, though he appeared to be trying to chop a tree down as 
he took three practice swings to see what the grass would do to his 
club. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods managed to chunk it out 15 feet over the green, which won  
him a round of applause from knowledgeable British golf fans who 
understood how tough the shot really was. 
</P>
<P>
	``This golf course is going to penalize you, whether you hit  
good shots or bad shots,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia found that out quickly, and it seemed to shatter  
the youthful confidence the 19-year-old sensation came in with. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's very first shot of the tournament went into the left  
rough and he followed it with a shot in the deep rough to the right 
of the first green. Like Norman, he whiffed, then plunked his next 
one in a trap. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked off the first green with a triple bogey, and finally  
walked off the 18th hole Friday at 30-over after rounds of 89 and 
83 -- not to mention a bitter taste in his mouth about the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in 10 years I won't watch the British Open  
on TV because I don't think it deserves it,'' Garcia said. ``I just 
think it's not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Garcia's confidence was shaken, just listen to Sandy Lyle,  
who actually won this tournament 14 years ago but couldn't keep out 
of the rough on his way to an 82-81. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has probably set me back six months now, all the hard work  
I've been doing getting my swing organized and it just tore it 
apart,'' Lyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Brooks wasn't thinking good thoughts either, after using a  
series of clubs in an order he might have not thought imaginable on 
the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	On the brutal par-5 sixth hole, Brooks was pulling out clubs  
like a drunken caddy. He hit driver, then sand wedge, then putter. 
He hit driver again, sand wedge again and putter two more times. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do have to be creative here,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	It didn't get any better in the pot bunkers, with fronts that  
rise higher than the players stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Ozaki found out in the first round when he had the early  
lead before failing to get his third shot out of a bunker on 14 and 
then having to turn around and play his fourth backwards just to 
get back into play. 
</P>
<P>
	He never recovered.  
</P>
<P>
	``Good shots end up in the hay, bad shots end up on the green,  
you just don't know what's going to happen,'' David Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows that better than Norman, who was cruising toward  
the Open lead when a ball that bounced just a little too far cost 
him a triple bogey 7 on the 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, we don't like taking sevens,'' Norman said. ``We  
don't like getting the bouncing ball and stuff like that. We don't 
mind trying to manufacture shots, but compounding our problems with 
rough up to your thigh is a different story.''

<HEADLINE> Battle Begins for NATO Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- British Aerospace PLC and Saab AB of  
Sweden fired the first salvo Thursday in what is sure to be a 
fierce battle for an estimated $1.5 billion defense contract from 
NATO's expansion into Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The British-Swedish consortium announced the offer to sell 60  
Gripen jet fighters to Poland just hours before a French delegation 
of defense contractors and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin flew in for 
talks likely to include the airplane deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Such high-level lobbying is part of a European push to make its  
defense industries more competitive against U.S. giants such as 
Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., whose equipment supplied 
NATO's air campaign in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Loath to be trumped on their own continent, European contractors  
are taking on the Americans for the business of NATO's three newest 
members -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- former Warsaw 
Pact nations that need to upgrade their military hardware to NATO 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake are the contracts, along with a major foothold in the  
former Soviet bloc a decade after the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's big money we're talking about,'' said U.S. Embassy  
spokesman Tom Delaney. ``It's highly competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Poles would like to buy 150 aircraft, but lack the money to  
pay now. Their aged fleet of Soviet MiGs requires major 
renovations, and making them compatible with NATO standards is both 
economically and politically unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
	So Poland asked British Aerospace-Saab, Boeing, Lockheed Martin,  
Dassault of France and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG of Germany for 
preliminary sales pitches by Wednesday on an initial order of 60 
advanced jet fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace and Saab spoke about their offer Thursday in  
Poland and Sweden. Besides the 60 new Gripens, which normally cost 
$30 million each, it includes the loan of a squadron of 18 Swedish 
Air Force Gripens to enable Poland to make what British Aerospace 
promised would be a smooth transition to NATO-required air power. 
</P>
<P>
	Julian Scopes, the British Aerospace vice president for Central  
Europe, also emphasized that Polish companies would be given 
contracts and training that matched the value of the jet fighter 
contract. The deal, he said, would ``bring Polish aerospace into 
the heart of European (defense industry) activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, Jospin opened a two-day official visit  
accompanied by representatives of Dassault, which makes the Mirage 
fighter. Dasa, the German-based company, leads a consortium 
producing the Eurofighter, while Boeing offers the F-18 and 
Lockheed Martin the F-16. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. planes have long been the front-runners for the Polish  
contract, but Poland's economic constraints delayed the bidding 
process as has the political issue of choosing a U.S. or European 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	A Warsaw conference on the NATO policy views of the alliance's  
three new members was postponed last week after U.S. objections 
that it may have provided British Aerospace -- one of the sponsors -- 
an unfair lobbying advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace chief executive officer John Weston and  
British Defense Minister George Robertson were to participate in 
roundtable discussions on NATO policy and European defense issues -- 
without U.S. or Western Europe representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to be sure that it's a transparent process,''  
said Delaney of the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference organizer, Janusz Reiter of the independent  
Center for International Relations in Warsaw, called suggestions 
that the conference was for lobbying ``completely groundless.''

<HEADLINE> The Three Tenors Become Duo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The Three Tenors became a dynamic duo  
when Luciano Pavarotti had to bow out of a news conference because 
of a hoarse voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras promised all three would be  
ready to perform in Saturday's concert in Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always gone on with the concerts,'' Domingo said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti spoke a few hoarse words and blew kisses before  
leaving the news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert will launch the Michigan Opera Theatre's New Century  
Fund Campaign to complete the Detroit Opera House project. Aretha 
Franklin will sing the national anthem before the performance and 
may join the tenors for an encore at the end.

<HEADLINE> Lottery Audit Reveals Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Lax oversight and possible fraud at the state  
lottery allowed scam artists to collect millions of dollars and 
avoid state and federal taxes, according to a report from the state 
auditor. 
</P>
<P>
	The controls were so weak that ``winners'' who claimed multiple  
cash prizes under names like Chris Mis and Walter Purple didn't tip 
off lottery officials, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a cavalier attitude and the audit recommendations in  
the past were ignored and that's why we're talking about the same 
things today,'' Auditor Joseph DeNucci said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, 319 winning tickets worth $412,000 were cashed last  
year by a person, or people, going by the name Clarance Jones 
without anyone questioning the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to believe anybody can be that lucky,'' DeNucci said  
in today's editions of the Boston Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six of every 100,000 tickets yield a $1,000 to $5,000  
prize, DeNucci said. Someone like Jones, then, would have to buy 
hundreds of thousands to millions of tickets to get so many 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	DeNucci believes the winnings were collected by ``10  
percenters,'' people who for a fee collect winnings under a bogus 
name to allow the real winners to avoid paying taxes or other 
financial obligations like child support. The practice has been 
used by racetrack winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors found that the top 10 multiple winners last year won  
842 times for a total of $1.8 million. Five of those top 10 used 
fake identification. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not estimate the total amount of tax evasion, but about  
1,800 W-2 forms for $7 million in winnings were returned by the 
post office as undeliverable last year, the Herald reported. The 
mysterious Clarance Jones, for example, listed a post office box 
for his address. State officials can't find a home or telephone 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
	DeNucci said the audit provides strong evidence that the scam  
artists were aided by lottery employees. Copies of the report were 
forwarded to the attorney general's office for review. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state Treasurer Joseph Malone, who was in charge of the  
lottery last year, did not return a call to his home Thursday.

<HEADLINE> House Chair Urges China Reparation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China should pay the United States for damage  
from rioting before being reimbursed in the mistaken bombing of its 
embassy in Yugoslavia, a House chairman suggested Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the International  
Relations Committee, introduced a nonbinding resolution to hold up 
U.S. reparations to China until such payments are made. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us not forget that the Chinese retaliated against our  
accidental bombing with government-sanctioned violent protests 
against American facilities in Beijing,'' Gilman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted in a statement that the State Department sent a  
delegation to Beijing to discuss reparations for the May 7 bombing 
in Belgrade, Yugoslavia's capital. The United States says a series 
of intelligence mistakes misidentified the embassy as a Yugoslav 
government building. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy bombing killed three Chinese journalists and injured  
more than 20 other people. In several days of demonstrations after 
the bombing, U.S. diplomatic offices in China were stoned and in 
one case set afire by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	China has said the compensation talks would not cover payment  
for damage to U.S. diplomatic offices.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Friday on  
fears of a possible military showdown between Taiwan and China, 
with the key index in Taipei plunging more than 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei bourse's Weighted Stock Price Index tumbled 506.46  
points, or 6.4 percent, to close at 7,411.58, in the biggest 
one-day fall since January, 1996 when the market was rattled by 
Chinese war games. 
</P>
<P>
	The index had lost 12.4 percent since the latest political row  
between Beijing and Taipei started battering prices on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	China's military on Thursday threatened to use force against  
Taiwan if President Lee Teng-hui declares the island's 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's comments in a radio interview a week ago that China should  
deal with Taiwan on a ``state-to-state'' basis infuriated Beijing, 
which regards the island as a renegade province to be reunited 
eventually with the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to Taiwan's political uncertainty, former Taiwan Province  
Governor James Soong announced that he was leaving the ruling 
Nationalist Party to run in the 2000 presidential elections as an 
independent candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears about tensions between China and Taiwan also dragged down  
the Tokyo and Hong Kong markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell  
183.56 points, or 1.00 percent, to close at 18,248.30 points. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 74.00 points, or 0.40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei fell as part of an Asian-wide selloff, after a Hong  
Kong newspaper article said China was beefing up its military 
presence near Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks also fell due to profit-taking and selling ahead of  
the weekend, traders said. Dealers often avoid holding securities 
that may fall in value over the weekend, when the stock market is 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei rose at one point in the day to 18,623.15 points,  
bolstered by an overnight rally in high technology issues on Wall 
Street. That was the first time the Nikkei hit above the 18,500 
mark since Sept. 11, 1997, when the day's high reached 18,625.56 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was trading at 120.92 yen in  
late afternoon trading, unchanged from late Thursday in Tokyo, but 
above its late New York level of 120.83 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 213.65 points, 1.6  
percent, to close at 13,545.24. On Thursday, the index had gained 
183.32 points, or 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Seoul Stock Exchange, where shares  
prices closed sharply higher on aggressive buying from local 
institutional investors and foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 38.68 points, or 3.9  
percent, to 1,020.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed lower in part due to  
nervousness about the latest political developments between Taiwan 
and China. The Composite Index fell 1.74 points, or 0.2 percent, to 
843.12. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices slumped across the board on worries  
over the rising tensions between Taiwan and China. The Stock 
Exchange of Thailand (SET) index fell 8.19 points, or 1.6 percent, 
to 488.51.

<HEADLINE>  Minor League Umps Vow To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The minor leagues vowed Friday to keep playing  
even if their umpires go on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations of most major league umpires were received late  
Thursday by the American and National leagues, and minor league 
umpires held a telephone conference call Friday with Richie 
Phillips, the lawyer for the Major League Umpires Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips says minor league umpires have voted to form a union,  
but it hasn't been recognized by the National Association of 
Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of the minors, or 
the Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation, its subsidiary that 
hires umpires for 16 minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Campbell, an assistant to Phillips, said Thursday night a  
minor league walkout could ``happen sooner rather than later.''

as pawns in his ongoing battles with the major leagues,'' the

the umpires will do, but we owe it to our fans to be prepared. 
Minor league baseball will be played as scheduled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations of major league umpires take effect Sept. 2,  
and major league officials seem prepared to accept them.

	On Friday, meanwhile, players' union head Donald Fehr sent a  
memo to all player representatives regarding the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have probably already heard or read reports about the  
actions the umpires are taking,'' the memo said. ``It is my strong 
recommendation that no player make any public comments at this 
time. We will keep you informed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the major leagues don't bring up umpires from the minors,  
they would hire college and high school umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips wouldn't say if any decisions were made on the  
conference call with the minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a possibility of a work stoppage in collective  
bargaining. It is inherent in the labor process,'' he said. ``When 
decisions are finally made as to course of actions, those decisions 
will be made known.''

<P>
	Phillips said 220 of 228 minor league umpires voted to form the  
Minor League Umpires Association, with two abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``PBUC does not believe that the best interests of minor league  
umpires or our fans will be served by having a union involved,'' 
the National Association said. ``Of course, if the umpires 
themselves elect a union to represent them through the 
secret-ballot procedure of the National Labor Relations Board, 
where these issues are commonly resolved, PBUC would bargain in 
good faith in an effort to reach an agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With management's refusing to recognize a minor league union,  
the minor leaguers' next step would be to petition a regional 
office of the NLRB to hold an election. The NLRB would decide who 
is in the bargaining unit and eligible to vote, a procedure that 
could be complicated because the individual minor leagues and PBUC 
jointly are their legal employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can resist it if they want,'' Phillips said, ``but these  
guys have 220 of the 228 votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the minor leagues haven't prepared for a walkout, the  
organizing attempts of their umpires are sparking them to get 
ready. The minor league umpires have individual contracts that run 
through this season, and the PBUC and the minor leagues could seek 
an injunction to prevent a strike this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phillips' letter to us suggests that umpire-management peace  
will be disturbed if PBUC does not begin to bargain with him,'' the 
National Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league umpires say they are resigning because of a lack of  
respect from baseball owners, who want greater control over them, 
and because they fear they will be locked out after their current 
labor agreement expires Dec. 31. The deal contains a no-strike 
clause, and the resignations are an attempt to get around that.

<HEADLINE>  Minor League Umps Vow To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The minor leagues vowed Friday to keep playing  
even if their umpires go on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations of most major league umpires were received late  
Thursday by the American and National leagues, and minor league 
umpires held a telephone conference call Friday with Richie 
Phillips, the lawyer for the Major League Umpires Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips says minor league umpires have voted to form a union,  
but it hasn't been recognized by the National Association of 
Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of the minors, or 
the Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation, its subsidiary that 
hires umpires for 16 minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Campbell, an assistant to Phillips, said Thursday night a  
minor league walkout could ``happen sooner rather than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``PBUC suspects that Phillips wants to use minor league umpires  
as pawns in his ongoing battles with the major leagues,'' the

<HEADLINE> NAACP Sues Handgun Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP filed a lawsuit against nearly 100  
handgun makers in federal court Friday, claiming the industry's 
marketing practices fuel street violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
asked for injunctions that would place sweeping restrictions on 
sellers and buyers of handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are putting the gun industry on notice that it can't be  
business as usual,'' NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP announced its intention to sue gunmakers Monday at its  
annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that negligent marketing of handguns has  
``led to disproportionate numbers of injuries, deaths and other 
damages among those whose interests the (NAACP) represents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks to force distributors to restrict sales to  
dealers who have storefront outlets, prohibit sales to gun show 
dealers and limit individual purchasers to one handgun a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include industry heavyweights like Smith &AMP; Wesson  
Corp., Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. and Glock, Inc. Those companies and 
industry trade groups have argued that it's unlawful to try to hold 
manufacturers liable for the criminal use of a legal product. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's lawsuit ``would inappropriately try to change the  
law through the courts,'' said Glock attorney John Renzulli. ``This 
is a political, legislative issue, and not an issue for the 
judiciary. ... The industry already is well-regulated; some may say 
over-regulated.''

<HEADLINE> HMO Legislation Fights For Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The emotional partisan Senate debate over  
patient protections is over but the battle for public opinion 
labored on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott accused President Clinton of  
refusing to look for a compromise with the GOP over a patients 
rights bill it pushed through the Senate on nearly total party-line 
vote Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president will quit whining, griping and threatening,  
and come up and engage, we'll work with him and see if we can find 
a bill he'll sign,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he hoped Republicans would come around and  
supported the Democratic health care proposals that went down to 
defeat this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not too late to do right,'' Clinton said Friday while  
traveling in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	However, neither Democrats nor Republicans showed much interest  
in finding a compromise in the months of discussions leading up to 
this week's Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans, wary of increased government regulations,  
would be satisfied to let the issue die amid the conflict. And some 
Democrats hope to capitalize on the issue in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton called the GOP bill unacceptable, and Vice  
President Al Gore promised it would never get past the president's 
desk. But Lott said Clinton might change his mind, noting that he 
has signed other legislation during his presidency after initially 
opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't put a lot of stock in his empty threats,'' Lott said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton kept to his pitch Friday, saying Republicans had  
``basically signed up with the health insurance companies against 
all the doctors and all the nurses and all the patients in America 
....'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislative battle now moves to the House, where action one  
package of modest proposals is being held up by Democrats and a 
handful of Republicans on the House Education and Workforce 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But leaders of the House Commerce Committee were still looking  
for a bipartisan compromise, and there were suggestions they might 
produce a bill next week.

<HEADLINE> Tribune Co. Profits Rise 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The parent of the Chicago Tribune, WGN  
superstation and the Chicago Cubs reported its second-quarter 
profits jumped nearly 13 percent amid strong showings in its 
television unit. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended June 27, Tribune Co. profits from  
operations rose to $118 million, or 88 cents a share, from $104.7 
million, or 75 cents a share, the comparable period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street expectations by a penny a share,  
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 7 percent to $837 million from $786 million a year  
earlier. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, revenue rose 3 
percent as the company charged higher advertising fees on the 
strength of its television unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune reported strong showings of syndicated episodes of the  
television show ``Friends'' at its television stations in Boston, 
Chicago and New York. The company also benefited from the 
popularity of such shows as ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer'' on the WB network, in which it owns a 25 percent 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue at Tribune's publishing operations rose 5 percent,  
helped by lower prices for newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
	In the recent quarter, after gains from investments and a change  
in accounting, the company had net income of $880.3 million, or 
$6.75 a share. Tribune had a gain on investments in the year-ago 
quarter, resulting in net income of $143 million, or $1.07.

<HEADLINE> Mutant Gene May Cause Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Researchers have identified a mutant gene that  
may be responsible for a severe kind of back pain caused by 
ruptured disks in the spine, a finding that could lead to new 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Back pain has long been one of the most poorly understood  
disorders, though it affects most adults at some point in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The gene defect appears to cause sciatica, a type of back pain.  
It often results from slipped or ruptured disks, which occur when 
the soft material in the center of a disk protrudes from its 
cartilage container and pinches the sciatic nerve in the spine. 
</P>
<P>
	The new research was published in today's Science magazine and  
reported by The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	According to scientists at MCP Hahnemann University in  
Philadelphia, the mutated gene alters part of an important 
structural protein inside the disk called collagen IX, preventing 
it from forming into the correct shape. 
</P>
<P>
	This makes the disk material too soft and less capable of  
absorbing the shocks placed on the spine during movement, 
researchers said. Over time, it is prone to pressing against the 
nerve. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted with scientists at the University of Oulu  
in Finland, analyzed the DNA of 180 Finnish patients with sciatica. 
Nine patients were found to have the mutation, and none of 230 
patients in a control group without back pain had it. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA of the extended families of four of the nine patients  
with the defect revealed a total of 23 relatives with the mutation, 
all of whom suffered disk problems, indicating that the defect 
likely causes back trouble.

<HEADLINE> GM: Bid for Saab Makes Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will decide soon on a  
possible buyout of the remaining half of Saab Automobile AB, the 
president of GM-Europe says. 
</P>
<P>
	GM acquired half of Saab from the Swedish holding company  
Investor AB for $600 million in 1989 and has an option to buy the 
remaining half for the six months starting July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish automaker's chief executive announced in March that  
talks would begin this month on whether GM will exercise its 
takeover option. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking complete control over the struggling automaker is seen as  
a way to give GM a stronger position in the global luxury car 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we will do will play out in the near future,'' GM-Europe  
President Michael Burns told The Detroit News in Frankfurt, 
Germany, for a story Friday. ``Our final decisions have not been 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a March interview with Dow Jones Newswires and financial  
cable network CNBC, Saab chief executive Robert Hendry suggested 
that Saab may not come cheap, given the automaker's recent sales 
gains and improving financial balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saab's good performance makes both parties want to keep their  
shares,'' Hendry said at the Geneva Auto Show.

<HEADLINE> Montgomerie Fears He's Out of Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Colin Montgomerie gives up too  
easily. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Scot, Europe's No. 1 player the last six years,  
shot a 5-over 76 in Friday's second round to go with an opening 74. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be bad news under ordinary conditions, but this is  
Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie moaned that he'd blown his chance to win his first  
major at this year's British Open. Not true. Maybe he was trying to 
take the pressure off himself because at 150 he's only seven shots 
behind leader Jean Van de Velde. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid this is gone now,'' said Montgomerie, billed with  
Phil Mickelson as the best golfers never to have won a major. ``I'm 
out of the tournament now and I look forward to the U.S. PGA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie, who missed the cut in five of the last seven  
British Opens, let his temper get the best of him during the round. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-putt bogey on No. 1 set the tone. Two holes later, he  
told a fan to put away his camera. On the fourth, he berated an 
entire camera crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need a break, we need a break -- go away and have a  
coffee,'' he said. ``We're under enough pressure without you lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AN ANGEL:* Angel Cabrera, a stroke behind French leader Jean  
Van de Velde, is the latest Argentine to shine at Carnoustie. 
Roberto Di Vicenzo was the runner-up in 1953 to Ben Hogan, and in 
1931 Tommy Armour beat Jose Jurado when Jurado double bogeyed the 
18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabrera, 29, said there is nothing quite like Carnoustie in  
Argentina. But one course does resemble it -- a links layout in the 
Atlantic coastal city of Mar del Plata. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we have nothing like this one, but in South America we  
are used to playing in conditions like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cabrera, a winner 15 times in South America, is playing in  
Europe thanks to ``financial and moral support'' from fellow 
Argentine pro Eduardo Romero, whom he calls his godfather. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NORMAN THIEF:* Greg Norman, just three strokes off the lead at  
146, is lucky to be playing with his own clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	After completing a 1-under 70 on Friday, the two-time champ said  
his best set of clubs disappeared a week ago when a construction 
worker who was working on his home in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came knocking at the door on Monday morning, and he made up  
some cockamamie story that somebody had put them in his car. And he 
decided to use them for the weekend, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept them for the weekend and took them to the driving  
range,'' Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the clubs back Monday and they were all marked out. I  
had to get all the carpet stains and rubber off them. He wasn't a 
very good golfer.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STRIP TEES:* The young woman dressed only in a black bra and  
panties who raced onto the 18th green Thursday to kiss Tiger Woods 
was caught in action by at least two of Britain's tabloids. The 
front page of the Mirror shows Woods being hugged by the blonde 
with a headline, ``Streaker brings some fun to farcical Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Star had a photo of Woods breaking into a wide smile as he  
crouched behind his putter lining up a shot when the women 
approached. ``Wood you believe it?'' read the headline. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WEATHER FORECAST:* Saturday could be the toughest weather day  
of the four at Carnoustie with scattered showers and winds at 30-35 
mph. Such was the wind Thursday when 57 players failed to break 80. 
On Sunday, there should be less wind, with mostly sunshine and a 
chance of showers. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *QUICK BREAK:* Tiger Woods was no match for Craig Parry when  
nature called. 
</P>
<P>
	After Woods and Parry hit onto the green on the par-3 eighth  
hole, Woods started trotting quickly down the cart path. Parry, 
however, scooted through waist-high weeds and beat Woods to the 
portable toilet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aw, you cut me off,'' Woods said. He then started kicking on  
the door to get Parry to hurry up. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH, LOW:* Only seven players broke par 71 in two maddening  
days at Carnoustie -- all on Friday: Jean Van de Velde at 68; 
Costantino Rocca, Angel Cabrera, David Frost, all at 69; Greg 
Norman, Mark Brooks, Tim Herron, all at 70. Van de Velde leads 
after two rounds at 1-over 143. 
</P>
<P>
	At the high end, 19-year-old Sergio Garcia of Spain was 30 over  
(89-83) and last. Simon McCarthy of England (82-89) was the next 
worse and Prayad Marksaeng (91-79) of Thailand was third from the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	A partial list of top players missing the 12-over cut: Phil  
Mickelson, Tom Watson, Tom Lehman, Nick Faldo, Jose Maria Olazabal, 
Steve Stricker, Steve Elkington, Mark O'Meara, Vijay Singh, Gary 
Player, Sandy Lyle, Seve Ballesteros. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ODDS AND ENDS:* Steve Pate took a quadruple bogey on par-5 No.  
6. Then, starting on No. 8, he had pars on the last 11 holes. ... 
Nick Faldo, trying to rebuild his game, used a right-over-left 
crosshanded putting grip on Friday. Still, he had a 78-79 and 
missed the cut for the first time in his 24th British Open. ... 
``I'll tell you what, even par here feels like 5- or 6-under 
anywhere else,'' said Jim Furyk after making the cut with a 71-78. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Meara (83-74--157) is the first defending champion to  
miss the cut since Mark Calcavecchia in 1990 at St. Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Price joined David Duval in his harsh criticism of  
Carnoustie and its meadow-length rough. ``If I were a spectator, 
I'd ask for my money back.'' Countering Price's complaint was a 
headline in The Daily Telegraph, ``Who said it was meant to be 
easy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hal Sutton said Carnoustie is unplayable for a medium-handicap  
player. ``If you took an ordinary 15-handicapper out there in the 
wind and he actually kept a score and played fair, breaking 120 
would be pretty difficult for him.''

including Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team. Tour president

<P>
	However, tensions from last year's doping scandal reemerged

	Bassons, who wrote in a newspaper column that he only takes

	Belgium had two high finishes, with Rik Verbrugghe coming in  
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The main pack, including Armstrong, Richard Virenque and other  
top contenders, finished more than 22 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming down from the Alps, the riders snaked through tranquil  
villages and rolling countryside alongside vineyards, apricot 
orchards and fields of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a relatively flat 14-mile ride from Le Bourg d'Oisans in  
the Alps to Saint-Etienne, capital of French bicycle manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	A group broke away after about 62 miles and led for the rest of  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's U.S. Postal team was happy to lead the pack for much  
of the race, controlling the only riders likely to eat into the 
27-year-old Texan's lead.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe did not file for  
arbitration by the deadline and will continue negotiations for a 
new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Bruins, forward Dmitri Khristich and defenseman Darren  
Van Impe, did file for arbitration by the deadline of midnight 
Thursday. All three players are restricted free agents, meaning the 
Bruins have the right to match any contract offer they receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins and Dafoe already have exchanged contract proposals.  
The club also can continue negotiating with Khristich and Van Impe 
before any arbitration hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston general manager Harry Sinden said he would match any  
offer for Dafoe, who led the NHL with 10 shutouts and was third in 
goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	Under arbitration, the club can declare whether the offer should  
be for one year or two years. Each side then submits a monetary 
proposal and an arbitrator can choose any figure but usually picks 
an amount between the two that are submitted.

<HEADLINE> Bush Calls Farm Belt 'a Disaster' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Warning that the Farm Belt is ``a  
disaster,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush bashed President Clinton for 
not doing more to pry open the giant market that is China. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said Congress should quickly approve direct payments to  
farmers who are suffering from historically low commodity prices. 
``We must recognize in the halls of Congress that we're in a 
disaster,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Congress should provide disaster relief, Clinton damages  
farmers' cause by not bringing China into the world trading 
community, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the administration made a mistake not admitting China  
to the World Trade Organization. We ought to open the China market 
to Iowa producers and producers across the nation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening a two-day campaign, Bush took care to hammer at troubles  
facing the farm economy, a big issue in Iowa, where precinct 
caucuses launch the presidential nominating season. He was also 
seeking to deflect critics who argue he doesn't talk about issues, 
sounding his farm theme in stop after stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we ought to use food as a sanction for  
diplomatic means,'' said Bush. ``We're too good a people to use 
food as a sanction.'' He bashed Clinton for ignoring the issue, 
noting that the president just completed a tour of economically 
depressed regions of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has recently been on a poverty tour,'' said  
Bush. ``Perhaps he ought to come to farm country. If he wants to 
find some people who are hurting, he ought to look right here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Bush took pains to talk policy, he clearly warmed to  
the task when rubbing shoulders with voters and talking politics. 
He was rumbling across the state with a pair of brightly decorated 
buses, pressing the flesh, posing for pictures and spending far 
more time mingling than talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's a big step going from governor to president, but  
I've had some pretty good training,'' he said. ``I've learned how 
to lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made veiled references to the president's impeachment,  
drawing cheers by pledging to ``uphold the dignity and the honor of 
the office to which I have been elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush holds a commanding lead in money and in the polls for  
the Republican presidential nomination, his critics argue he has 
campaigned scantily in key early states like Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	He was seeking to counter that with intense barnstorming and  
pledges to engage heavily in coming months. ``Shaking as many hands 
as I can,'' he said. ``I intend to earn every single vote. I intend 
to win the Iowa caucuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor brought things in Webster City grinding to a  
halt when he stopped off for a carefully staged ``impromptu'' lunch 
where he wolfed down a cheeseburger and fries and mingled with the 
folks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Litzel brought along a baseball and magazine for Bush to  
sign, noting that Bush is a former owner of the Texas Rangers. 
``I'm a fan of the Texas Rangers and I'm a fan of his,'' said 
Litzel. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Hughes gave him a big hug before squealing to a friend:  
``He's the best-looking one we've worked for yet. I don't usually 
get on bandwagons, but I'm on this bandwagon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a good day on several fronts for Bush, who said he was  
drawing strength from mingling with the crowds. He also announced 
that with $30 million in the bank he wouldn't take federal campaign 
money. ``With $30 million in the bank, I've got pretty good staying 
power,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best salesperson we've got,'' said Luke Roth, running  
Bush's Iowa campaign. ``When he's here, I'm happy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft is reportedly considering creation of  
a new stock to track its presence in the Internet business. The 
Wall Street Journal says the software giant has been mulling the 
idea for months. The idea is seen as attractive because it could 
help fund Internet-related acquisitions and attract executives who 
like the high valuations of the dot-com stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal says the company could make an announcement as early  
as next week when it holds an annual conference for Wall Street 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates reportedly told people attending  
last week's gathering of executives in Sun Valley that he thinks 
the Internet stock frenzy will last several more years.

<P>
	SAINT-ETIENNE France (AP) -- A factory worker, Ludo Dierckxsens  
decided to become a professional cyclist at an age when many riders 
are already pondering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging by the nature of his victory on the 11th stage of the  
Tour de France on Thursday, the 35-year-old Dierckxsens is 
determined to savor every minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming just two weeks after becoming Belgian champion, this is

<HEADLINE> Cyprus-Amax, Asarco To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Cyprus-Amax Minerals Co. and Asarco Inc.  
have agreed to a $2.3 billion merger that will create world's 
largest publicly traded copper company. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly formed company will be called Asarco Cyprus Inc. The  
merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year, company 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Milton Ward, Cyprus chairman and chief executive, will serve as  
co-CEO through April with Francis McAllister, Asarco's chairman and 
CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus-Amax, Colorado's largest mining employer, plans to close  
its Arapahoe County headquarters after the merger. Company vice 
president Gerald Malys said some of the 100 employees might be 
offered jobs in New York City, where Asarco is based. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the continuation of a trend toward consolidation in  
our industry,'' said Stuart Sanderson, president of the Colorado 
Mining Association. ``Companies are merging and restructuring to 
lower costs and increase efficiencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the merger goes through, Asarco Cyprus Inc. will supplant  
Phelps Dodge Corp. as the world's largest publicly traded copper 
company. It also will be the largest molybdenum producer, with 
assets of $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	With copper prices at historic lows, major producers are trying  
to slash operating costs. The Cyprus-Asarco merger is expected to 
reduce expenses by $150 million, allowing the company to expand its 
copper production, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our U.S. mines, which are primarily in Arizona, are in close  
proximity to one another, providing the opportunity to achieve 
operating efficiencies and reduce administrative overhead,'' Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the merger will have no immediate impact  
on those operations, which employ about 4,500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies also operate major copper mines in Peru and  
Chile.

<HEADLINE> DirecTV, SBC Strike Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Satellite television provider DirecTV Inc.  
and SBC Communications Inc. on Friday announced a joint marketing 
and distribution deal that could help SBC reach its goal of 
becoming a one-stop provider of telephone, Internet and television 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement with DirecTV, the nation's biggest satellite TV  
broadcaster with more than 7 million customers, boosts SBC's 
ability to compete with AT&AMP;T Corp. and other big telephone 
companies that want to bundle television and Internet and telephone 
services into a single package for their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	For DirecTV, a unit of General Motor Corp.'s Hughes Electronics,  
the deal opens up access to 18 million customers of SBC 
subsidiaries Southwestern Bell, Nevada Bell and Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	SBC, based in San Antonio, plans to begin offering DirecTV  
service to customers sometime in the fall, officials said. SBC is 
in the process of merging with Ameritech Inc., a deal that would 
create the nation's largest local telephone company. The merger has 
received tentative government approval though is facing intense 
scrutiny by the state of Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of companies are talking about providing their customers  
with a complete communications package, but SBC will soon be the 
only one actually doing it,'' said Royce Caldwell, president of 
operations for SBC. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has a similar plan to offer cable television and high-speed  
Internet access to its customers. AT&AMP;T has made more than $100 
billion in cable purchases over the past year, including its 
acquisitions of cable operators TCI and MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is already connecting customers to its new local telephone  
service in Northern California in direct competition with Pacific 
Bell. By next year, AT&AMP;T plans to offer bundled Internet, 
television and telephone service to thousands of people in Pac Bell 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and DirecTV already have a deal to sell DirecTV services to  
apartment and condominium dwellers through a single satellite dish 
installed on buildings. That deal is similar to arrangements 
DirecTV has made with Atlantic Bell and other regional telephone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new arrangement, SBC will market DirecTV to its other  
residential customers both as a bundled package and as a 
stand-alone service. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expanded relationship provides consumers in SBC's  
territory with a strong alternative to cable,'' said Helen Latimer, 
vice president of sales and distribution for DirecTV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely the same marketing synergy that AT&AMP;T is  
counting on with TCI,'' said Tom Adams, president of Adams Media 
Research, a Carmel, Calif.-based consulting service. ``They're 
going to be competing against someone offering an integrated 
package, all in one. They have to keep up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down the road, the deal may offer SBC yet another option --  
offering high-speed Internet service via DirecTV's satellite 
network. Regional phone companies such as SBC's subsidiaries 
already offer high-speed digital subscriber line service to some 
customers, but the technology lacks the potential of satellite and 
cable connections, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keeping up via high-speed connections over satellite may be  
their best counter to speeds that cable is going to be offering,'' 
he said. ``That's downstream some because the technology is still 
being worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's leading Internet service provider, America Online  
Inc., recently reached a marketing agreement with Hughes for 
delivery of its own high-speed Internet service via satellite. It 
also has an agreement SBC to provide high-speed services over phone 
lines.

the leaders at the tour -- including top three Lance Armstrong, 
Abraham Olano and Alex Zulle -- were happy to sit back and rest 
their muscles after two punishing days in the Alps, the Belgian 
grabbed his chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``At last I've done it!'' he rejoiced after his stage victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Although it was a low-key race, his victory was a refreshing  
one. But it didn't change the overall standings. Going into the 
race, Dierckxsens was trailing overall leader Armstrong by 1 hour, 
14 minutes and 33 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union authorities today carried out  
the third set of blood tests on 40 riders from eight teams, 
including Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team. Tour president 
Jean-Marie Leblanc said all the results turned out negative. 
</P>
<P>
	However, tensions from last year's doping scandal reemerged  
today, when Christophe Bassons, an outspoken critic of drug taking, 
quit the race, claiming that he had been told to keep quiet by 
other riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bassons, who wrote in a newspaper column that he only takes  
``clear water,'' claims that Armstrong was among those who told him 
to keep his thoughts to himself on doping. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has denied taking performance-enhancing drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	In second place Thursday was Dmitri Konyshev of Russia, 1 minute  
27 seconds behind. He narrowly edged out Kazakstan's Alexandre 
Vinokourov. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium had two high finishes, with Rik Verbrugghe coming in  
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The main pack, including Armstrong, Richard Virenque and other  
top contenders, finished more than 22 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming down from the Alps, the riders snaked through tranquil  
villages and rolling countryside alongside vineyards, apricot 
orchards and fields of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a relatively flat 14-mile ride from Le Bourg d'Oisans in  
the Alps to Saint-Etienne, capital of French bicycle manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	A group broke away after about 62 miles and led for the rest of  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's U.S. Postal team was happy to lead the pack for much  
of the race, controlling the only riders likely to eat into the 
27-year-old Texan's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one notable climb, the 3,963-foot Col de la Croix de  
Chaubouret, before a descent into St. Etienne. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's stage is a 126-mile race between Saint-Galmier and  
Saint-Flour. The race ends on the Champs Elysees in Paris on July 
25.

<HEADLINE> Gore Calls on College Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before a youthful audience that could help  
carry his message into the future, Vice President Al Gore promised 
to take the legacy of the civil rights movement ``the rest of the 
way'' in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore gave hundreds of College Democrats -- assembled at their  
national convention Thursday -- an open invitation to join his 
campaign as a way to shape a future with less discrimination and 
greater opportunity for all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the capacity to overcome evil with good,'' the vice  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to build on the successes of the civil rights  
movement, by helping to make sure that all people benefit from the 
nation's prosperity. One of the most important missions of the 
country in the future, Gore added, will be to prove that people of 
different backgrounds can benefit from working together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to go the rest of the way in the 21st century,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president used the event to take aim at the GOP's tax  
cut proposals, warning they could ruin the chances of saving 
Medicare and Social Security and might divert money from global 
warming and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``So the choice is whether or not we do the right thing and move  
forward or take a right-wing U-turn back to the old ways that drove 
our economy into the ditch,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also accused Republicans of doing ``the bidding'' of the  
National Rifle Association and repeated his call for strong 
national gun safety provisions, saying handgun purchasers should be 
required to have photo licenses. The photo license provision is 
part of an anti-crime agenda Gore has outlined this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the raucous cheers from most of the 500 students on  
hand, a few animal rights activists standing close to the stage 
interrupted Gore's speech with chants of ``burn bunnies, lose 
votes.'' Gore was unfazed and turned the protests into greater 
support from the crowd at large. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's hear it for the First Amendment. Let's hear it for free  
speech,'' he said. After the students started chanting again, the 
vice president spoke directly to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be glad to speak with you later if you want to actually  
exchange ideas,'' he said. Hotel security eventually led the 
activists out of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president was very good at diffusing the situation  
without trying to draw attention and embarrass them,'' said Kevin 
Oxendine, a sophomore at the University of Maryland, attending the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Gore told the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People that ending the practice of racial 
profiling by police departments would be a top priority in his 
presidential administration.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil and Gasoline Futures Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil and gasoline futures soared a second day Friday on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange as refinery troubles in California 
threatened to cause spot shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain and soybeans fell sharply amid forecasts  
for moderating, wet weather. Copper futures also fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline led energy futures higher after California regulators  
said Chevron Corp. could sell lower grades of fuel that do not meet 
clean-air regulations following an explosion over the weekend at 
Chevron's Richmond, Calif., refinery. Production at the refinery 
now is down 70 percent, causing prices at the pump in the San 
Francisco area to rise sharply this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is expected to divert gasoline away from Northeast  
and other destinations and sharply boost prices as companies 
compete for available supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron's continuing refinery troubles allowed investors to  
ignore comments from Venezuela's energy and mines minister, who 
said it is too early to decide whether members of the Organization 
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries should increase output this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement among key world producers to cut output has helped  
boost crude to its highest level in 20 months, but some analysts 
say prices could fall if the agreement falls apart or members start 
offering more oil too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for August delivery rose 46 cents to $20.62 a barrel;  
August unleaded gasoline rose 0.85 cent to 62.55 cents a gallon; 
August heating oil rose 0.11 cent to 51.84 cents a gallon; August 
natural gas rose 0.08 cent to $2.187 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
August rose 27 cents to $19.35 a barrel at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of  
Trade as the weather outlook again turned favorable for developing 
bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices gave up much of the gains made this week as  
forecasters predicted rain and cooler temperatures will move into 
major growing states by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean prices had jumped on expectations for  
temperatures to rise in the 90s under dry skies. With portions of 
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio reporting soil moisture rapidly 
evaporating, there was some concern about heat stress occurring. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, crops appear to be back on track for bumper production. The  
U.S. Agriculture Department is predicting a third record year of 
soybean production, and the third-largest corn crop on record. 
Wheat production this year also appears to be better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.58 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 6 1/2 cents to $1.98 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
2 cents to $1.09 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 10 cents to 
$4.17 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
after two copper producers announced plans to merge but said no 
production cuts were planned. 
</P>
<P>
	As had been rumored, Asarco, the third-largest U.S. copper  
producer, and Cyprus Amax, the fourth-largest, announced late 
Thursday they were merging to become the world's second-largest 
supplier of copper behind Chile's state-owned Codelco. 
</P>
<P>
	But the companies said they had no immediate need to slash  
production. Prices have risen sharply this week on market talk such 
cuts would come, helping reduce a world supply glut. 
</P>
<P>
	September copper fell 1.6 cents to 78.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Leave Fort Dix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- The last of the thousands of Kosovo  
refugees who called this Army base home quietly left Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With little fanfare, Xhemajl Hajra left the refugee village at  
Fort Dix for a hospital in Trenton, said Michael Kharfen, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Hajra, in his late 30s or early 40s, is being treated for  
tuberculosis and will be reunited with six relatives who also 
settled in Trenton this week, Kharfen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's departure marks the official closing of the village  
that opened May 5 to handle refugees from crowded camps in the 
Balkans. The village once was a sanctuary for more than 4,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees at Fort Dix were matched with relatives, sponsors  
or charities for resettlement around the United States. They can 
work or attend school and have a year to apply for permanent 
residence. They also can return to Kosovo, and the U.S. government 
would pay for their flight.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said  
today the Clinton administration intends to intervene if there is 
any faltering in the Middle East peace process. ``It is important 
that we take the time that is necessary and calibrate our role to 
what is clearly called for,'' Albright said after a strategy

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The influential moderate ethnic  
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova failed to show up for the first 
meeting of a U.N.-backed provincial advisory council today. He 
reportedly felt the number of seats his party was allotted was 
unfair. But the United Nations pressed ahead without Rugova or any 
representatives of his Democratic Party of Kosovo. Rugova's absence

Torricelli said today after being notified by Pyongyang's U.N. 
ambassador. Karen Han, who has homes in California and New Jersey, 
was detained near North Korea's borders with Russia and China on 
June 17. The Clinton administration was irritated by the North 
Koreans' refusal to allow consular access to the woman. U.S. 
officials said they were told the woman was being investigated for 
possible violations of North Korean law.

	Libya Gives $33 Million to Families

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Libya has given $33 million to France to be  
distributed to relatives of victims of the 1989 bombing of a French 
passenger jet, the French Foreign Ministry said today. The payment 
came after a French court in March convicted six Libyans in 
absentia on charges of masterminding and carrying out the Sept. 19, 
1989, bombing of UTA Flight 772. The jetliner exploded over Niger, 
killing all 170 on board. In a statement, the foreign ministry 
noted ``with satisfaction'' that the transfer of compensation by 
Libyan officials ``expresses the fact that Libya accepts the 
responsibility of its nationals.''

Maturino Resendez knew he could get the death penalty in Texas when 
she brokered his surrender, officials said today. ``We only 
negotiated with the sister,'' said Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the 
Texas Department of Public Safety. The question of what she knew 
came up when Maturino Resendez's brother complained earlier this 
week that the family was duped by Texas Rangers into believing he 
would not face the death penalty. Maturino Resendez, 39, 
surrendered Tuesday after a six-week manhunt.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve reported today that a

manufacturing its best three months in more than a year. Economists 
hailed it as a sign of recovery after hard times that included the 
loss of 488,000 jobs since March 1998. Output at the nation's 
factories, mines and utilities posted a 0.2 percent rate of 
increase in June, matching the gain in May. ``I think manufacturing 
is back again,'' concluded Wells Fargo economist Sung Won Sohn. ``I 
think the worst is over.''

stock price surged following a report that it might create a 
separate stock for its Internet properties. Microsoft's stock was 
up $5.06 1/4 to $99.43 3/4 a share in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
With more than 5.1 billion shares outstanding, that gave Microsoft 
a total market capitalization of about $507 billion. Microsoft's

<HEADLINE> China Says U.S. Goalkeeper Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Three slightly blurred photos have angered many  
in China and prompted suggestions the country was robbed of 
possible victory in the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos show U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry moving forward to  
save a shot by China's Liu Ying in the penalty-kick shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry's lunging save, after 120 minutes of scoreless play,  
opened the door for her team to win the shootout 5-4 for the title 
July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the game, Chinese media wondered whether the  
officiating would be fair in what many viewed as a politically 
charged showdown. A victory, they felt, might help avenge NATO's 
May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The frame-by-frame images show Scurry taking a few steps forward  
before Liu hit her penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's goalkeeper broke the rules,'' screamed the Beijing  
Morning Post in a headline above the photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, soccer rules forbid goalkeepers from moving forward  
before a penalty kick. But virtually all goalies do so, and such a 
violation is rarely called. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morning Post said the referee's failure to blow the whistle  
on Scurry and allow Liu to retake the penalty kick ``caused the 
Chinese team to `wrongly' occupy second place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the perceived injustice was Scurry's admission to the  
Los Angeles Times, like the photos widely published by Chinese 
state-run media, that she knew she was breaking the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chinese soccer authorities have decided to let the matter  
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The referee's decisions are final. An appeal could not alter  
the result,'' Wang Junsheng, a vice chairman of China's Soccer 
Association, told state media. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang was also forgiving about a chance China had to win the game  
during overtime. Fan Yunjie drove a header toward the goal that 
midfielder Kristine Lilly cleared off the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese newspapers, citing a CNN replay, said the ball crossed  
the line and should have made China the winner. The Shanghai News 
published a sketch of Lilly with her head and the ball behind the 
line as she knocked it out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wang, the soccer official, said the shot was hard for the  
referee to call. He likened the play to Diego Maradona's ``hand of 
God'' goal when the Argentine star got away with fisting a ball 
into England's net to advance to the 1986 World Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the loss, the Chinese stars were feted as national  
heroines. Hundreds of fans beating drums and cymbals greeted them 
Monday at Beijing's airport and Communist Party leaders, including 
President Jiang Zemin, honored the team with a reception at the 
capital's Great Hall of the People. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run television has produced a rock song for the team,  
complete with ripping electric guitar solos and a video showing 
clips of them playing. ``Daughters of China, daughters of China, 
the motherland's pride, the motherland's pride,'' goes the song. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hong Kong tycoon and legislator, Timothy Fok, on Thursday  
offered the team $362,000 for its efforts, the China Daily reported 
Friday.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Cease Use of Diarrhea Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Doctors are being asked by the federal government  
to temporarily stop giving children a diarrhea vaccine because at 
least 20 infants have developed a bowel obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday  
that RotaShield, the vaccine against rotavirus, has not been 
conclusively linked to bowel obstruction, but early studies show it 
may increase the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstruction occurs when one part of the bowel becomes folded  
within another. Symptoms include vomiting, bloody stools and 
abdominal pain. Surgery is often needed to clear the blockage if it 
isn't caught early. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC recommended suspending use of the vaccine in all  
children -- including those who have begun the three-dose series -- 
until November so health officials can conclude additional studies. 
Following the CDC's move, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued 
the same recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's enough to make us worry,'' said Dr. Melinda Wharton, head  
of the CDC's child vaccine preventable diseases branch. ``We're 
fortunate that rotavirus is a seasonal disease so we can postpone 
vaccination for a few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rotavirus, an intestinal infection, is the leading cause of  
severe diarrhea in children under 5 in the United States. Each 
year, an estimated 3 million American children are sickened, 50,000 
are hospitalized, and 20 die. The disease primarily occurs in the 
winter and spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine's manufacturer, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, said 1  
million infants have been vaccinated with RotaShield since it 
received government approval in August. The three-dose series is 
given at ages 2 months, 4 months and 6 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Before its approval by the Food and Drug Administration, five  
cases of the bowel obstruction were reported for every 10,000 
vaccine recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the bowel obstruction was listed as a potential  
adverse reaction on the package insert. The CDC said it is still 
investigating, but based on the early findings so far, it appears 
that the bowel obstruction rate may be higher than expected.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Complex Gets Wake-Up Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Gov. Ben Cayetano wants a reality check on the  
planned $27 million sports complex in Kapolei where professional 
baseball teams from Japan would hold spring training, he said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, it has been a sort of ``Field of Dreams'' for Senate  
President Norman Mizuguchi and his close friend, Japanese baseball 
hall of famer Wally Yonamine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a big believer in: `Build it and they will come,'''  
Cayetano said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're holding the project because we had asked Wally Yonamine  
to explore if there were any Japanese teams interested in using it 
for spring training and so far, we don't have any,'' he said. ``So 
what we're doing is reevaluating it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is looking at reconfiguring the 60-acre  
project for which the Legislature appropriated the money in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, the thought has always been to maybe have a  
Williamsburg of the Pacific for Little League baseball or 
international soccer, stuff like that, where they could come to 
hold meets and in between the local people could use it,'' Cayetano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local soccer officials say there are many soccer organizations  
which would like to hold international tournaments in Hawaii, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It could also include a stadium that would be an alternative to  
Aloha Stadium for high school football games, Cayetano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seiji Naya, director of the Department of Business, Economic  
Development and Tourism, suggested a marketing and feasibility 
study into having a facility for sports spring training, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hasn't been done,'' Cayetano said.  
</P>
<P>
	The governor denied but appeared amused at the suggestion his  
holding up the sports complex had anything to do with differences 
with Mizuguchi over the Senate's rejection of his reappointments of 
Margery Bronster as attorney general and Earl Anzai as budget 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizuguchi wasn't immediately available to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Cayetano last year hired Yonamine, who played, coached and  
managed in Japanese baseball for 38 years, for $1 a year as a 
special advisor for sports promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the governor said Hawaii could become a great  
location for a training facility for pro and amateur teams and 
Olympic athletes, while also providing medical care and 
rehabilitation services for injured athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	His vision at the time was to build the sports complex and  
position Hawaii as a leader in the international sports industry. 
He said daily coverage of the Japanese teams in spring training 
would attract more visitors to Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> Julia Roberts Uses Lyle-O-Meter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Law and Order'' star Benjamin Bratt is a  
winner on girlfriend Julia Roberts' Lyle-o-meter. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts told US magazine that the man in her life must accept  
her close friendship with ex-husband Lyle Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have what I call the Lyle barometer,'' she said. ``If a guy  
cannot deal with the fact that Lyle and I are such good friends, 
then OK, we just don't go any further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts stars with Richard Gere in ``Runaway Bride,'' which  
conjures images of her own tumultuous love life in the early '90s, 
including two near misses at the altar and her short-lived marriage 
to Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, `Runaway Bride' is a great title, incredible, evocative,  
but it doesn't attach to my life at all,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> CR Renegade Wins Beacon Course Trot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- CR Renegade took advantage of a  
break in stride down the stretch by heavy favorite Self Possessed 
on Friday to win the $430,000 Budweiser Beacon Course. 
</P>
<P>
	CR Renegade, driven by Rod Allen and trained by Carl Allen, was  
racing third behind Self Possessed and Starchip Enterprise down the 
backstretch when Starchip Enterprise broke stride in the one mile 
trot, which is the last major tuneup for the Aug. 7 Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to stay with him (Self Possessed) and stare him in  
the eye,'' said Allen. ``No horse has done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't quite work out that way for Allen and CR Renegade. But  
when Self Possessed, a heavy 1/5 favorite, drifted wide and finally 
broke down the stretch, Allen and his colt were right there to win 
by three and three quarters lengths in a best-ever 1:53 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that happened this colt was half up on his bit and ready  
to roll,'' said Rod Allen. ``I just wanted to stay calm and 
consistent and hope I'd get lucky and I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Self Possessed, with Mike Lachance in the bike, hit the top  
of the stretch he began to drift wide and finally broke stride just 
before the eighth pole. CR Renegade, who had won his Beacon Course 
qualifier last week, then held off a futile bid by longshot Comets 
Tail to win easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why he broke but it wasn't the track that caused  
it,'' said Lachance. ``He hit himself during the mile and when he 
bore out I got worried but I had enough horse to win. I was just 
trying to keep him together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed's trainer, Ron Gurfein, admitted he was concerned  
about his horse who until Friday had seemed to be the odds-on 
favorite to win the Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned about him last week,'' said Gurfein, who has  
never won the Beacon Course. ``We don't really know what's 
bothering him. We just have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the fifth in 10 starts this year for CR  
Renegade, who is the full brother of 1995 Beacon Course winner CR 
Kay Suzie. CR Renegade's stable mate CR Commando was scratched from 
the race earlier in the week due to illness but is expected to be 
back for the Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (CR Renegade) made his sister proud,'' said Rod Allen. ``I  
just hope he can avenge her miscue (she broke as a heavy favorite) 
in the 1995 Hambo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angus Hall, which was an entry along with Self Possessed,  
finished third while Self Possessed was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory boosts CR Renegade's career earnings to $301,630 and  
makes the 3-year old colt a legitimate threat to Self Possessed in 
the Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner paid $18.40, $8.40 and $2.40. Comets Tail provided a  
$25.40 and $3.20 payoff, while Angus Hall paid $2.10 to show. The 
4-3 exacta was good for $329.00 while 4-3-1 trifecta paid $696.00 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Noble Ability came charging down the stretch and set  
a world record in winning the 1 1/8 mile, $275,000 Classic Series 
Final pace by one and a half lengths in 2:03 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory put Noble Ability, a 5-year old bay owned by Bob  
Glazer and driven by John Campbell, over the million dollar mark 
($1,040,313) in career earnings. He paid $15.40.

<HEADLINE> Winds Worried Stadium Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Workers building the new Milwaukee Brewers  
baseball stadium expressed concern about high winds before a crane 
came crashing down, killing three and injuring five, union 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds were gusting at 26 mph when the 567-foot crane collapsed  
and essentially broke in half Wednesday while it was lowering a 
piece of the stadium's retractable roof. The three victims were in 
a basket suspended from a smaller crane inside the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers were doubtful it was safe to lift the roof  
sections, said Brent Emons, business manager for Ironworkers Local 
8, which represents workers on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not engineers. We're iron workers,'' he said Thursday.  
``But we have a gut feeling of when we should and when we 
shouldn't, and most of our guys felt we shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironworkers Local 8 business representative Steve Boudreaux told  
WITI-TV that he spoke with one victim, Jerome Starr, an hour before 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``He questioned as to why we're doing this ... ,'' Boudreaux  
said. ``Why they carried on is beyond us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A medical examiner's report said Starr's wife had stopped at the  
construction site shortly before the accident and was told by her 
husband that there had been an argument about whether to proceed 
with the roof raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Lev Baldwin said investigators were looking at all  
possible causes, including the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Larry Gardner said two ``black boxes'' in the cab of  
the giant crane recorded wind speed and the weight being lifted, 
but mechanical problems have prevented investigators from 
retrieving the data.

<HEADLINE> Mary Kay Convention Opens in Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- When Mary Kay cosmetics disciples mention the  
company's founder, they may get a little misty. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just an incredible woman,'' said Karen Irwin of St.  
Louis. ``Unfortunately, I haven't met her. I mean, I feel like I 
have. From a distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40,000 Mary Kay makeup sellers have converged on  
Dallas from all around the country for this summer's two-week, 
14-hotel convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Kay Ash herself doesn't make it to the national meetings  
these days. A plucky Texan who built the direct-sales company 30 
years ago, the aging Ms. Ash is recovering from a stroke and a 
broken leg. But her framed photos cast serene gazes over the Dallas 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The manicured fingers of Mary Kay reach far. The company has  
representatives in 29 countries, including Russia and China. Last 
year, 500,000 Mary Kay vendors sold more than $1 billion worth of 
merchandise worldwide, according to spokeswoman Shelley Whiddon. 
</P>
<P>
	The women who pay their $100 fee to join the Mary Kay sales  
force are handed a mantra, a set of priorities and a prescribed 
mental outlook along with the standard case of creams and powders. 
They must wear skirts or dresses. They must not drink or smoke. 
They must tell themselves, over and over, ``I am making other 
people's lives better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big sales bring lavish rewards -- diamond bar pins, diamond  
rings, cars and the ultimate prize: the pink Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is struggling to shed its image as a work force for  
housewives only. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have this image of big, blond hair,'' said Ms. Irwin, a  
former corporate executive whose brown hair is cropped short. ``But 
we're teachers, CPAs, financial directors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two marriages, a stint running a metaphysics bookstore and  
a few years driving a Federal Express truck, Sally Fairbanks of 
Orlando, Fla., joined the Mary Kay sales force. She liked the idea 
of setting her own hours, pulling down high pay and working outside 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women have come full circle,'' Ms. Fairbanks said,  
speedwalking into the convention center in a crush of perfumed 
women. ``We've got it all. Now we want to give some of it back.''

<HEADLINE> Two Plead Guilty to Baby Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two women have admitted to taking part in an  
illegal adoption ring in which 17 Mexican babies were smuggled 
across the border and placed in American homes for $20,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene Reingold and Arlene Lieberman pleaded guilty to breaking  
immigration laws. Conspiracy charges were dropped in exchange for 
their pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	The two neighbors in the Long Island community of Medford face  
up to two years, three months in prison. Each was ordered to pay 
$43,500 restitution to the American families. 
</P>
<P>
	The women are free on bail until their sentencing; no date was  
set. Both refused to comment as they left federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The two came to the attention of authorities in 1990, when the  
state Department of Social Services received complaints that they 
were arranging adoptions without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were arrested in May with a third defendant, Mario  
Reyes, 40, a Douglas, Ariz., lawyer with an office in a Mexican 
border town. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes allegedly paid to have babies -- some only days old --  
smuggled across the border to his Arizona home. From there, 
according to court papers, Reingold and Lieberman took the babies 
to the New York City area and delivered them to adoptive parents 
without any of the required immigration and adoption paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Timothy Macht said he could not comment on how the  
children were obtained in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Thorn, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service, said the agency would work to secure citizenship for the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The INS views these children as innocent victims,'' he said.  
``We have no intention of removing them from this country.''

<HEADLINE> United States 8, Nicaragua 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Craig Paquette, Kansas City's starting  
third baseman as recently as 1997, went 2-for-2 and drove in four 
runs, and the U.S. Pan Am team overpowered Nicaragua 8-2 Friday 
night using professional players for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	John Patterson, a Double-A farmhand of the Arizona Diamondbacks,  
allowed one run and five hits in five innings and picked up the 
team's first victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Asdrudes Flores allowed six runs on five hits and two walks in 1  
1-3 innings and took the loss for Nicaragua (11-3). 
</P>
<P>
	The game was the second of a warmup tournament for the Pan Am  
Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, from July 24-Aug. 2. The top two teams 
in Winnipeg qualify for next year's Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette, playing first base, had a sacrifice fly in the first  
inning. The Americans later stretched the lead to 7-0 with a 
six-run second that featured two-run triples by Paquette and Travis 
Dawkins, an RBI double by Shawn Gilbert and an RBI triple by Adam 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette added a run-scoring double in the fourth.  
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Padilla drove in Nicaragua's runs with singles in the  
fourth and seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early game, Melvin Rosario hit a two-run homer in the  
eighth inning as the Dominican Republic beat the U.S. National 
squad, a group of college stars, 2-0. It was the first game for the 
Dominicans, who have five minor league pros. 
</P>
<P>
	The American collegians would have been on the Pan Am team until  
the International Baseball Association's decision to let minor 
leaguers play. USA Baseball, the national governing body, chose an 
all-professional roster this year.

<HEADLINE> Six-Year-Old Catches Record Catfish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Call it the young man and the sea.  
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Josh Dickert's battle with a 31.12-pound blue  
catfish may not have been of Hemingway proportions, but the catch 
was. The Springville youth is likely headed to the International 
Game Fish Association as a world record holder for the prize he 
landed Tuesday on Lake Logan Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh's catfish, which won't be recognized by the IGFA until it  
receives the proper documentation, surpasses the current junior 
world record of 21.03. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-inch-long fish is almost as big as Josh, who is 42 inches  
tall and weighs 39 pounds. Josh did all the work, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him that the fish was his and he had to do all the  
work,'' his father, Joe, said. ``It was 15 minutes before I finally 
saw the fish. I never dreamed it was that big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To catch the fish, Joe Dickert dropped the live bait on a  
25-pound test line to the bottom of the lake. The two saw the rod 
jump when the fish took the bait, then waited to make sure the fish 
swallowed it. After a few seconds, Dickert told Josh to set the 
hook. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he did, it was like Josh was on a seesaw,'' Dickert said.  
``The butt of the rod lifted Josh's feet plumb off the bottom of 
the boat. I thought it was going to toss him overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickert said he had no idea how big the fish was, but got an  
idea when Josh started begging him to take over the reel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickert said Josh remained calm when the fish appeared, even  
though the two didn't have a clue how they were going to get it 
into the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	They struggled with it for some time, while trying to get it  
into a net, but the fish eventually wore itself out and floated on 
its side beside the boat while Dickert scooped it up. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Dickert almost made a mistake that would have  
cost Josh the world record. Since they weren't going to eat the 
fish, Dickert convinced his son to let it go once they took a 
picture of it. But because Dickert had accidentally forgotten his 
camera, they stuffed the fish into the shad tank and brought it 
home to take pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when they realized it might be a world record.  
</P>
<P>
	To be a world record, the fish must be photographed and its  
length and girth measured. The fish must also be weighed on 
certified scales. 
</P>
<P>
	After that information was gathered, the fish was released live  
into a private lake in St. Clair County.

<HEADLINE> American, Pilots Settle Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines and its pilots union  
have settled the disagreement that led the pilots to stage a 
sickout earlier this year that inconvenienced hundreds of thousands 
of passengers and led to a huge fine against the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal on how the company would treat pilots from its recently  
acquired Reno Air was reached on Wednesday and announced on 
Thursday by the Allied Pilots Association and American Airlines 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-day sickout in February led to the cancellation of more  
than 6,700 flights. A judge declared it illegal and fined the union 
$45.5 million for ignoring his order to tell pilots to return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Rader, an American spokeswoman, declined to comment  
pending approval of the pact by the union's board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't say much about it until the board has a chance to  
review the contract language and vote on it,'' said Rich LaVoy, 
president of the 9,500-member Allied Pilots. The union board will 
probably vote in the next two to three weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've put an awful lot of work into this, and we hope it will  
be substantial enough to get through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots had accused American of dragging its feet on paying  
some 300 pilots of Reno Air, which American had purchased in 
December, the same amount as its own pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth Star-Telegram quoted unidentified sources as  
saying that under the deal, the former Reno Air pilots will get two 
immediate pay raises if the deal is approved, one retroactive to 
March 1, the other to June 1. A third raise, on Sept. 1, will bring 
them up to the pay levels of other American pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Union negotiators had originally demanded that the Reno pilots'  
pay be upgraded to the higher American pay scale retroactive to 
last Dec. 23, the day American acquired financial control of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Management had proposed interim pay raises for the Reno pilots  
but had argued that American wasn't obliged to pay the Reno pilots 
full American-level pilot salaries until they were trained and 
assigned as American pilots.

<HEADLINE> Albright Satisfied With Barak Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clearly pleased with Israeli Prime Minister  
Ehud Barak's promises to get on the land-for-peace track with the 
Arabs, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday the 
Clinton administration intends to intervene if there is any 
faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that we take the time that is necessary and  
calibrate our role to what is clearly called for,'' Albright said 
after a strategy session with Barak at her home in the Georgetown 
section of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, who is planning to travel to the region in August,  
said her aim was ``to do what I believe is necessary to make the 
peace process work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Albright has spent little time in the Middle East, in  
contrast to most of her predecessors since Israel crushed the Arabs 
in the 1967 Six-Day War and captured territory on all fronts. 
</P>
<P>
	With the election of Barak, who came here as a self-described  
``messenger of peace,'' the Clinton administration sees a new 
opportunity to promote Israeli pullbacks in exchange for promises 
of peace from the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I will do is what is needed and what I am asked to do,''  
Albright said as she stood with Barak in a backyard garden after 
they conferred over breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Barak and Defense Secretary William Cohen reached an  
agreement for Israel to buy F-16 jet fighters from Lockheed Martin 
Corp. to update Israel's air force. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Defense Department official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the agreement calls for Israel to buy 50 of the 
planes with an option to buy 50 more. A source in Barak's party put 
the potential value of the deal at $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Moshe Arens, Israel's defense minister under former Prime  
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also favored the F-16 over the F-15 
fighter manufactured by the Boeing Co. But the decision was 
deferred to Barak after the Israeli elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak then flew to New York for meetings with American Jewish  
groups and the American Jewish media. He is due back in Washington 
late Sunday and will see Clinton again on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On his way here, the prime minister said he would not want the  
United States to act the ``judge'' and ``arbiter'' of Israel's 
negotiations with the Arabs. But once here, he gave no indication 
he wanted the United States to keep its distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak on Friday promised to implement all agreements reached  
with the Arabs, including a pullback on the West Bank that was 
halted seven months ago on the grounds the Palestinian Authority 
had not done all it could to uproot terrorist cells in areas 
already under its control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reaffirmed to the secretary our commitment to abide by  
international agreements signed by our government, including our 
determination to move forward on all tracks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak had already told President Clinton on Thursday that in the  
next few weeks he would pursue with Syria prospects for what would 
be a ``painful compromise'' for Israel. This suggested a 
willingness to turn over most or even all of the Golan Heights to 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a senior Israeli official, Barak said he wanted to  
make a fresh start in the negotiations that were suspended three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Syrian President Hafez Assad hopes to recover the strategic  
border enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 war. And he wants 
the negotiations to pick up with an offer from a previous Labor 
government to meet his demand if the terms were right. 
</P>
<P>
	Before entering politics, Barak had insisted Israel needed to  
retain the Golan Heights for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that we are facing very important decisions  
that will impact the fate of the state of Israel,'' he said Friday 
at a joint news conference with Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from the solitude of Camp David, Md., where a landmark  
Mideast peace treaty was forged 21 years ago, Barak echoed 
Clinton's view that Israel's security is best served with 
land-for-peace accords with the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Camp David, Clinton brainstormed with Barak for 3 1/2 hours  
Thursday night over how to revive long-stalled Arab-Israeli peace 
talks. They continued their talks over breakfast Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual gesture, Clinton drove Barak around the grounds in  
a golf court and took him to the villa where Israeli Prime Minister 
Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1978 initialed 
what was to become the first peace treaty between Israel and an 
Arab country the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak was the first Israeli leader to be a guest at Camp David  
since Begin. The breakfast with Albright was a further gesture 
designed to make the prime minister comfortable with the active 
role the United States is taking in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Job Hoppers Face Retirement Problems / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gone are the days when employees spent entire  
careers at one company. Average workers nowadays change jobs every 
five years, and in today's labor market, it's not unusual to make a 
switch after a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
	While job hopping may mean bigger salaries and new business  
opportunities, it also can bring financial instability when it 
comes to retirement planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers covered under defined-benefit pension plans -- the  
traditional plan that guarantees benefits based on length of 
service and salary -- have the most to lose by changing jobs. Those 
who leave employers every 10 years may end up with less than half 
the benefits they would have earned working for the same employer 
their entire careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many big companies have been moving away from traditional  
pensions in recent years, instead offering cash-balance accounts, 
which are career average plans that accrue gradually each year. 
Others offer only defined contribution plans, such as a 401(k), in 
which employees put aside a percentage of their salary and 
employers often match that contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	While the move away from traditional pensions can hurt those  
close to retirement by reducing their benefits, it's better for 
those who move around. 
</P>
<P>
	Money manager Jim Jorgensen of Orinda, Calif., noted in his June  
investor newsletter ``It's Your Money,'' that the most attractive 
feature of the pension changes is portability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Company-paid pensions can now be portable and follow a  
job-hopping employee from job to job,'' he said. ``The new plans 
... give workers who expect to change jobs over the years more 
meaningful benefits sooner and more evenly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some companies are making it easier for today's job  
hoppers, there are still many steps employees need to take to 
ensure their financial future. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are a few suggestions from financial advisers:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Try to work for an employer long enough to become vested.  
</P>
<P>
	Often that means five years for most pension plans. It's a  
different story for 401(k)s. Some companies allow employees to 
enroll right away, while others have a one-year waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cover the gaps until you become eligible.  
</P>
<P>
	Employees who have to wait before they are able to participate  
in a 401(k) or become vested in a pension plan should save on their 
own in the interim. They might want to contribute the maximum to an 
Individual Retirement Account or put money aside in a separate 
investment account. That may include all or part of any pay raise 
they received by switching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Refrain from cashing out of old plans.  
</P>
<P>
	The tendency for some workers is to cash out of what they have  
accumulated in their previous employer's retirement plan. That's a 
big mistake. Not only do they lose out on future tax-deferred 
growth, they also may face stiff tax penalties. A better strategy 
would be to transfer the balance to an IRA or to the new employer's 
retirement plan, if that's possible. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Continue your health benefits.  
</P>
<P>
	A serious illness or injury could devastate anyone's personal  
finances. Therefore, it's crucial to make sure there's adequate 
health insurance coverage until new hires are eligible to 
participate in the new employer's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	One option is to continue the group coverage offered by the  
former employer. Employees are eligible to purchase COBRA benefits 
(named for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1986), but they'll have to pay all the premium, plus administrative 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Watch for fringe benefits and cost of living changes.  
</P>
<P>
	Some employers offer valuable benefits like flexible spending  
accounts that help pay for child care, health care or life 
insurance. Take advantage of them whenever they become available. 
In some instances, they could offset any higher living costs that 
may come from switching jobs.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Trade Pitcher to Brewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles finally gave up on Rocky  
Coppinger, trading the right-hander to the Milwaukee Brewers on 
Friday night for a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Coppinger, 25, won 10 games as rookie with the Orioles in 1996  
and started a game in the AL Championship Series against the New 
York Yankees. But he recorded only one victory with the Orioles 
since then while fighting injuries and shuffling back and forth 
between Baltimore and the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 0-1 with a 8.31 ERA in 11 games this season, including  
two starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rocky probably needed a change. I wish him the best,'' Orioles  
manager Ray Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm turning the page here. I'm not looking back,'' Coppinger  
said. ``I had a great year in '96, which was fun. It was probably 
my fondest memory as an athlete. It was just time to move on, turn 
the page and start my career all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, Coppinger is looking for stability. He was used as  
a starter and middle reliever this season, and the Orioles at one 
point sent him to Triple-A Rochester to practice as a closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets an opportunity in Milwaukee,'' Orioles general manager  
Frank Wren said. ``I'm not sure what role they're going to use him 
there. They were one of the most active clubs as far as pursuing 
him. I think they'll give him an opportunity to win a job over 
there on the major-league club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade of Coppinger was one of many moves in a busy day for  
the Orioles, who designated catcher Lenny Webster for assignment 
before their game against the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Baltimore announced the Coppinger trade and also  
recalled third baseman Ryan Minor from Rochester. Minor will start 
at third base Saturday in place of Cal Ripken, who is sidelined 
with a deep bone bruise in his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor, 25, appeared in 88 games with Rochester through Thursday,  
hitting .244 with 18 homers and 56 RBIs. Last season he made 
headlines by replacing Ripken on the night that baseball's all-time 
iron man decided to end his consecutive games streak at 2,632. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time he won't have to ask if it's OK with Cal if he  
starts,'' Miller quipped, referring to Minor's innocent question 
last September when he was informed that he would be replacing 
Ripken in the game the streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles also sent right-handed reliever Gabe Molina to  
Rochester and activated right-hander Ricky Bones from the disabled 
list.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Fall on Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures fell sharply Friday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as the weather outlook again turned 
favorable for developing bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices gave up much of the gains made this week as  
forecasters predicted rain and cooler temperatures will move into 
major growing states by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean prices had jumped on expectations for  
temperatures to rise in the 90s under dry skies. With portions of 
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio reporting soil moisture rapidly 
evaporating, there was some concern about heat stress occurring. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, crops appear to be back on track for bumper production. The  
U.S. Agriculture Department is predicting a third record year of 
soybean production, and the third-largest corn crop on record. 
Wheat production this year also appears to be better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.58 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 6 1/2 cents to $1.98 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
2 cents to $1.09 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 10 cents to 
$4.17 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle and pork futures advanced strongly. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .28 cent to 63.70 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .22 cent to 76.87 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .17 cent to 47.07 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
1.25 cents to 34.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Gains in GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush has increased his dominance  
in the race to win the New Hampshire GOP presidential primary, 
while his opponents are scrambling for the coveted position of top 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for Bush, the governor of Texas and national  
front-runner in the GOP race, increased from 38 percent in June in 
an independent poll by the American Research Group Inc. of 
Manchester, to 47 percent in the firm's latest poll, released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona received 13 percent, compared with  
10 percent in June, while Pat Buchanan had 9 percent, compared with 
5 percent in June. Elizabeth Dole's support dropped to 7 percent 
from 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The sampling of 450 Republican registered voters in the state  
holding the nation's first presidential primary was conducted July 
8-12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased,'' McCain told WMUR-TV of Manchester. ``I think  
the kind of campaigning I'm doing in New Hampshire has paid a 
dividend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole spokesman Ari Fleischer said the McCain campaign has put  
more resources into New Hampshire than the Dole campaign has. 
``This is all part of Senator McCain's strategy to spend early, 
peak early and get an early artificial bump in the polls,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who won the 1996 New Hampshire primary, ``has emerged  
as the conservative alternative to the establishment candidates,'' 
said Bay Buchanan, the candidate's senior adviser and sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Commentator Alan Keyes was at 4 percent; former Vice President  
Dan Quayle at 3 percent; publisher Steve Forbes at 2 percent; 
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander at 2 percent; conservative 
activist Gary Bauer at 1 percent; and New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, 
who has announced he is leaving the GOP, at 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 415 registered New Hampshire Democrats questioned, 48  
percent preferred Vice President Gore, 32 percent preferred former 
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and 20 percent were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier New Hampshire polls, Bradley had cut into Gore's  
lead. Gore led 61 percent to 9 percent in February, but only 45 
percent to 30 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The error margin in the New Hampshire poll for both Democrats  
and Republicans was plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Asst. Coach Joins Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Tex Winter, whose triple-post offense helped  
Chicago win six NBA championships in eight years, quit Friday as 
Bulls assistant to join Phil Jackson's staff with the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Winter is the third member of Jackson's former staff to be  
reunited with him. Earlier this month, assistant Frank Hamblen left 
the Bulls for the Lakers. Jim Cleamons also joined the Lakers this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the toughest decisions of my life,'' the  
77-year-old Winter said in a statement released by the Bulls. But 
Winter said he only wants to coach one more year and the talented 
Lakers are considered a contender for the NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be joining an extremely talented team with a great chance  
to win a championship very soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winter, whose 53 years in coaching is the longest tenure of any  
coach in basketball history, literally wrote the book (``The 
Triple-Post Offense'' in 1962) on the triangle scheme the Bulls ran 
during their championship years. 
</P>
<P>
	Winter spent 14 years with Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks closed lower Friday on  
profit-taking following gains earlier in the week. The dollar edged 
higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 183.56 points,  
or 1.00 percent, to close at 18,248.30 points. On Thursday, the 
average closed up 74.00 points, or 0.40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.94 yen in midafternoon trading, up 0.02  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 120.83 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, shares fell due to profit-taking and  
selling ahead of the weekend, traders said. Dealers often try to 
avoid holding securities that may fall in value over the weekend, 
when the stock market is closed. 
</P>
<P>
	A plunge in Softbank Corp. shares also hurt the market, said  
traders. Brokerage Warburg Dillon Read cut its rating in the 
software wholesaler and credit rating company Standard and Poor's 
said it will closely monitor Softbank publishing subsidiary 
Ziff-Davis for possible downgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei rose at one point in the day to 18,623.15 points,  
bolstered by an overnight rally in high technology issues on Wall 
Street. That was the first time the Nikkei hit above the 18,500 
mark since Sept. 11, 1997, when the day's high reached 18,625.56 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 4.71 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,507.02 points 
at the end of trading. The TOPIX closed down 14.66 points, or 0.98 
percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar rose against the yen on concern  
China will devalue its currency, the yuan. Such a move by China 
could set off drops in other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also bought dollars on the view the Bank of Japan may  
intervene to prop up the U.S. currency against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai financial newspaper reported Friday that the  
Bank of Japan bought dollars the previous day to stop the U.S. 
currency from falling below the 120 yen mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the international bureau at the  
Finance Ministry, declined to comment Friday on whether Japan's 
central bank had intervened in the foreign exchange markets 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizoguchi said, however, he is ``watching the foreign exchange  
markets carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haruhiko Kuroda, Japan's vice finance minister for international  
affairs, Thursday also declined to comment on the reported BOJ 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ has on several occasions in recent weeks intervened in  
currency markets to support the dollar against the yen in an effort 
to safeguard the country's fragile recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
therefore less competitive, while reducing exporters' foreign 
revenues in terms of the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 123.34 yen, down from  
123.54 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7400 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6800 
percent, driving its price down to 100.51 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> White House Plays Down Bomb Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said they  
didn't believe China's rare public confirmation of its nuclear 
weapons capabilities had anything to do with increasing tensions 
between China and Taiwan. But some lawmakers feared Beijing was 
``saber rattling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see the connection on Taiwan,'' State Department  
spokesman James Rubin said Thursday after an official in Beijing 
announced what U.S. intelligence officials long have known, that 
China has the neutron bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Taipei drew a threat of attack from China this week when it  
hinted that the island was ready to move toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's been as dramatic as other rhetorical  
episodes in the past, but it is significant,'' Rubin added. ``We 
don't think it's beneficial for these kind of statements to be made 
or the reactions to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China is known to have exploded a neutron bomb in 1988. But in  
an extraordinary admission Thursday, Zhao Qizheng, the chief 
Chinese government spokesman, said in Beijing that Chinese 
scientists had developed neutron bombs and miniaturized atomic 
warheads in the 1970s and '80s, without stealing U.S. secrets. He 
also gave details of Chinese programs to develop anti-submarine 
microwave technology, missile design techniques and technology to 
launch multiple satellites from a single rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, key lawmakers were concerned about China's  
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a spokeswoman, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of  
the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, ``The timing of China's 
announcement could be perceived as saber rattling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., senior Democrat on the committee,  
called China's announcement ``quite serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an escalation of the proliferation problem,'' Kerrey  
said. ``They were starting to move in the right direction. It means 
they are now moving in the wrong direction. This is not in the 
world's best interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And House International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin  
Gilman, R-N.Y., said the Chinese announcement was ``sort of a 
clouded threat to Taiwan at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did they suddenly make this announcement when this has  
been an understood fact for a number of years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman said it sends a ``clear signal to the administration''  
and ``they should recognize that this engagement with China is not 
doing what it should be doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In light of heightened tensions with China, administration  
officials did take care to note that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is 
vastly superior to China's. 
</P>
<P>
	``China, we know, has less than two dozen long-range nuclear  
weapons. The United States has over 6,000,'' White House press 
secretary Joe Lockhart said. ``We have no doubt that our nuclear 
deterrent is strong enough to protect our national interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement about the neutron bomb came in reaction to a  
congressional investigation led by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., 
into allegations the Chinese stole sensitive nuclear secrets from 
U.S. research labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said the announcement suggested nothing that would take away  
from the findings that China ``acquired weapons information through 
espionage, including specifically information about the neutron 
bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the ritual denial of espionage, but apart from that it  
is the first public acknowledgment that indeed they possess a 
neutron bomb which they had not yet deployed,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said that from a security  
standpoint, whether China developed its own neutron bomb instead of 
stealing the technology from U.S. labs was a minor issue. He said 
the United States was more concerned about other nations gaining 
nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't find it to be a particularly fruitful discussion as to  
whether they claim to have this capability internally or have 
acquired it elsewhere,'' Cohen said. ``The fact that's of concern 
to all of us is that there seems to be a proliferation of nuclear 
technology to a number of countries.''	   Neutron bombs are meant to produce a smaller blast than 
conventional nuclear weapons but more intense radiation, limiting 
physical damage while killing large numbers of people.

<HEADLINE> Japan Cos. Urged To Turn Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- With Japan stuck in an almost decade-long economic  
slump, Japanese companies will have soon exhausted their last 
financial reserves and must now learn how to turn a profit -- or 
perish, the government warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many companies have been putting off reform, betting that  
the economy would eventually recover. But with a rebound in private 
consumption as elusive as ever, the tough times appear certain to 
continue, the Economic Planning Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency offered the uncharacteristically stinging criticisms  
of corporate Japan in its widely read ``white paper'' on the health 
of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The white paper called for a change in the way Japan Inc. does  
business, such as ending the old obsession with market share at the 
expense of profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Such strategies worked while Japan was chalking up record growth  
rates but are inappropriate for a mature economy -- especially in a 
country trying to claw its way out of its worst recession since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``Businesses, as the core of economic activities, must transform  
themselves into entities that can generate new profits,'' Takashi 
Omori, the director of domestic research, said in releasing the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The white paper said that during the long economic downturn of  
the 1990s, Japanese companies have forgone painful but necessary 
reforms by living off of capital gains made during the booming 
1980s, when the country's stock and land markets soared. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the government has also been guilty of helping out  
with generous stimulus spending packages, which lifted business 
bottom lines, Omori said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, however, corporate Japan has burned off all its fat, and  
the country's ballooning national debt means the government is less 
able to help out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, despite surprisingly strong growth in the first  
quarter of this year, consumers remain anxious about their jobs -- 
and are keeping a tight hold on their purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The force of recovery in private demand is weak. In order for  
the economy to start recovering, there has to be a recovery in 
private demand while policy effects provide support,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	To survive in this environment, companies must trim waste and  
long payrolls and rid themselves of an enormous glut in factories 
and production equipment, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	That could take years to do, with the value of such excess  
capacity now reaching $300 billion, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent earnings results show some industries, such as  
brokerages, have already begun making the sorts of reforms being 
called for. 
</P>
<P>
	Battered by years of losses, several medium-sized brokerages  
showed a strong earnings turnaround in the April-June quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following drastic restructuring measures taken over the past  
several years, profitability at Japanese brokerages is improving,'' 
said Sachio Ishikawa, a general manager at Chuo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, such restructuring does not come without its dangers, the  
white paper warned. As businesses curtail spending and trim work 
forces, they run the risk of throwing the economy into a vicious 
cycle by further driving down demand -- and thus creating still more 
unneeded capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	The best remedy for Japan's problems is a far-reaching change in  
the country's financial system, Omori said. 
</P>
<P>
	This change is already under way, he said. The economic  
stagnation of the 1990s has brought an end to the ability of banks 
to serve as the main source of funding for business, and the 
government has cut regulations in the financial industry in an 
effort to revive markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The declining role for banks and the freer access has led many  
businesses to turn to capital markets for funding. That is forcing 
more managers to focus on the bottom line in order to please 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Omori said this process must be encouraged by such steps as  
forcing businesses to be more frank in opening their books to 
investors, channeling more pension savings into the stock and bond 
markets and making it easier for companies to merge or restructure.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Sued Over Patent Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- An Omaha company is suing baseball  
manufacturer Rawlings Sporting Goods Co., alleging patent 
infringement on a small practice baseball used to sharpen batting 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my invention,'' said Thomas Decker, who received a  
patent on the small ball last Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker's company, Decker Sports LLC, filed the lawsuit on July 9  
in U.S. District Court in Omaha. It claims Rawlings is using 
Decker's invention to make and sell a similar product. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see a major baseball manufacturer knock off my idea is  
disconcerting,'' Decker said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings, which makes baseballs for the major leagues, had not  
been notified of a lawsuit and had no immediate comment, 
spokeswoman Cindy Cepicky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker, 34, said the practice baseball, which measures 7.5  
inches in circumference versus the standard 9-inch ball, makes it 
harder to hit, improving hand-eye coordination, visual tracking 
skills and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker said baseball coaches for years have used smaller balls,  
such as whiffle balls and golf balls, to produce similar practice 
challenges. But those balls do not react the same as a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought those were poor substitutes, so I set out to make  
the same baseball, just smaller,'' Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker, who played baseball at Texas Tech, applied for the  
patent in 1994 and began selling the ball that same year. Customers 
include major league, college and high school teams, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker's company also sells smaller versions of bats, softballs  
and gloves for training. Decker said those cannot be patented 
because sizes long have varied for those products. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseballs, he said, have remained virtually unchanged since the  
beginning of the sport.

<HEADLINE> LPGA Envious of Women's Soccer Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- The LPGA looks at the hoopla  
surrounding the women's World Cup team and wants some of the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attractive, fun, approachable, college-educated,  
good-looking,'' LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw said. ``The same 
attributes used to describe the World Cup team can be used to 
describe our athletes, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Votaw and several top golfers acknowledge that commanding  
that kind of attention is no easy thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading tour money winner Karrie Webb points to soccer star Mia  
Hamm's ads and the grand scale on which the World Cup was 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just look at all the commercials in the World Cup -- Adidas and  
all of those companies ran spots throughout,'' Webb said. ``Those 
were huge ads. We need to do that -- throw it back to the major 
companies like Titleist and Callaway. ... You never really see just 
women -- the top players -- promoted individually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LPGA tour events have Nabisco, McDonald's, Mercury, Oldsmobile,  
Wendy's, Michelob and Gillette as tournament sponsors. But no LPGA 
player has participated in anything like the Mia Ham-Michael Jordan 
``Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better'' TV commercial. The 
Gatorade ad ran often during and after the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw said one problem for the LPGA is the relatively small  
number of active golfers in America -- about 25 million. He said 
there are probably more girls in youth soccer programs in his 
hometown of Ridgefield, Conn., than are in LPGA youth golf programs 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, inducing the golf industry to better promote players is  
``one of the codes that we need to crack,'' said Votaw, who became 
commissioner in March. 
</P>
<P>
	LPGA players said the World Cup team has helped all female  
athletes, as do successes by the WNBA, the women's tennis tour and 
other sports played by women. 
</P>
<P>
	Meg Mallon, who played in a pro-am Wednesday with Hamm, Julie  
Foudy and Brandi Chastain before this week's Japan Airlines Big 
Apple Classic, called the World Cup the ``greatest event'' for 
women in the 1990s. The soccer players were mobbed by autograph 
seekers, mainly young girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it does is push women's athletics forward,'' Mallon said.  
``It helps the LPGA. It helps tennis. It helps basketball. It helps 
every aspect of women's athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annika Sorenstam is thought by many to be the LPGA star with the  
best potential to achieve more mainstream attention in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Swede said she was not offended by any sexually  
suggestive promotions regarding the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great,'' she said. ``It seems like that's what  
needs to be done. They're in really good shape, so whatever it 
takes, I guess.''

<HEADLINE> Lilly Has $1 Billion Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- State and city leaders Friday praised Eli  
Lilly and Co.'s $1 billion investment that could land 7,500 
high-paying science and technology jobs for Indiana over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is a terrific victory,'' Indianapolis Mayor Stephen  
Goldsmith told a crowd of Lilly employees, many in white lab coats. 
``This is really one of the most important days for the future of 
Indiana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials offered $214 million in tax abatements and  
other incentives like improvements to roads and sewers near the 
Lilly campus in exchange for the company's promise of 7,500 new 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The job expansion would push Lilly's current Indianapolis  
employment from 9,000 to over 16,000 people, and would be ``exactly 
the sort of jobs that we want to grow and nurture in our 
community,'' Goldsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion includes improvements at the pharmaceutical  
company's headquarters in downtown Indianapolis and other 
facilities across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the new jobs are expected to be high-paying positions,  
such as scientific and computer specialist jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly's expansion comes during a time of fast growth after the  
company faced slowdowns in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical's need to expand is so pressing that the $1  
billion it expects to spend during the next decade will only be 
one-sixth or one-seventh of its total projected capital investment 
in Indianapolis in that time, said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., Lilly 
senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly president Sidney Taurel said the growth was being spurred  
by new drug-discovery methods made possible by biotechnology. 
Actos, a new Lilly drug to treat Type 2 diabetes that resensitizes 
patients' bodies to insulin, was approved by the federal Food and 
Drug Administration on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have several other products in our pipeline that will help  
fuel our growth,'' Taurel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert J. Kirk, a professor of economics at Indiana  
University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, said the investment 
could boost the city's national reputation in health care and 
related industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's encouraging in a variety of ways,'' Kirk said.  
``It makes a statement to other areas of the country that 'Look, 
Lilly has made a decision to make a substantial investment in 
Indianapolis.' That's the bottom line today. It's a globally 
competitive environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly, founded in 1876, is best known for its popular  
antidepressant, Prozac.

<HEADLINE> Schwab Earnings Rise 98 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings at Charles Schwab  
Corp., the nation's leading discount and online broker, surged 98 
percent, slightly exceeding Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after the company also said Friday that major  
investments in technology, advertising and personnel would hold 
down earnings in the second half of the year, shares of Schwab fell 
by 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab stock closed at $52.43 3/4, down $2.93 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter earnings totaled $151 million, or 18 cents per  
share. The San Francisco-based financial services firm earned $76.3 
million, or 9 cents per share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had projected earnings of 17  
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's second-quarter revenues were $982.1 million,  
compared to $638 million in last year's second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab said it was handling $592 billion in customer assets, up  
$100 billion from the year-ago period, and had opened 422,000 
online trading accounts during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, the company earned $293.9  
million on $1.9 billion in revenues. In the year-ago period, Schwab 
earned $144.3 million on revenue of $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and CEO Charles Schwab said the company's  
second-quarter 15 percent profit margin may not remain as high in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our ongoing investments in people, technology and our brand  
may cause our profit margin for the second half of 1999 to move 
back towards the levels we've achieved in recent years,'' Schwab 
said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Iomega Reports $47.1 Million Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROY, Utah (AP) -- Iomega Corp., maker of removable-media  
data-storage devices, has posted a net loss of $47.1 million, or 17 
cents a share, for its second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That compared with a net loss of $39.9 million, or 15 cents a  
share, for the same period of 1998, and was within the range 
announced by the company on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's second-quarter loss announced Thursday includes a  
pretax restructuring charge of $41.9 million stemming from closing 
facilities and eliminating jobs. Before the restructuring charge, 
the company posted a net loss of $19.8 million, or 7 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the second quarter was $348.8 million compared with  
$393.8 million for the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring charge and pending loss were announced last  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega projects $40 million in annual cost savings beginning  
next year from the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of this year, Iomega reported a net  
loss of $46.5 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $735 
million. That compared with a net loss of $58.5 million, or 22 
cents a share, on revenue of $801.3 million for the same six months 
of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Valued Above $500B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. became the first company to be  
worth more than half a trillion dollars Friday as the software 
company's stock price surged following a report that it might 
create a separate stock for its Internet properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's stock was up $5.06 1/4 to $99.43 3/4 a share in trading on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market. With more than 5.1 billion shares 
outstanding, that gave Microsoft a total market capitalization of 
about $507 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's market value far outpaces the No. 2 company, General  
Electric, which was worth about $384 billion based on Friday's 
stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Microsoft, which  
will report its annual earnings Monday, is moving closer to 
creating a tracking stock for its Internet businesses to take 
advantage of the stock market's infatuation with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A tracking stock is designed to give investors the opportunity  
to focus on just one aspect of the company's business without 
creating a separate publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would be a way to pay for Internet-related acquisitions  
and attract talented employees seeking the high valuations of 
Internet companies, the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also received a boost when a federal court jury in  
Connecticut ruled it had not violated federal antitrust laws in its 
dealings with Bristol Technology Inc., a small software company. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call  
to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's MSN.com is one of the most-visited sites on the Web,  
and includes such services as Hotmail e-mail, the Expedia travel 
site and the CarPoint auto buying service 
</P>
<P>
	Although critics assail Microsoft's take-no-prisoners  
competitiveness, investors have favored a company with large profit 
margins, rapidly growing sales and no debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's phenomenal rise has created countless millionaires  
and made company founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen two of the 
richest men on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	At current stock prices, Gates would be worth more than $100  
billion, based on the more than 1 billion Microsoft shares he was 
listed as owning in a Feb. 11 proxy statement. Allen, listed as 
having more than 276 million shares, is worth more than $27 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Rail Slaying Suspect Gabbed To Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Former fugitive Angel Maturino Resendez was  
downright talkative after he surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
	He gabbed into the wee hours with Houston police detectives  
about U.S. foreign policy, economics, mathematics -- almost anything 
except the nine slayings he's suspected of committing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would either turn the conversation back to what he wanted  
to talk about, or he simply would not answer the questions,'' said 
Sgt. Tom Ladd. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez, 39, remained jailed today without bond. He is  
charged with capital murder in the east Texas town of Hughes 
Springs and murder in Illinois and Kentucky. He could get the death 
penalty in the Hughes Springs case, the slaying of an 87-year-old 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also charged with burglarizing the home of a Houston-area  
doctor killed in December. If Maturino Resendez's DNA matches 
evidence left in her home, Houston prosecutors plan to charge him 
with capital murder. The FBI is checking on possible links to more 
than 200 other unsolved killings, though most are expected to 
produce nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ladd, Maturino Resendez talked extensively about  
his displeasure with capitalism, the treatment of migrant workers 
and many U.S. government policies, including the recent air raids 
in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does not like America or Americans,'' Ladd said. ``I asked  
him if he didn't like this country, why was he always here? For 
that he had no answer, just a blank stare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect also discussed a mathematical theory concerning the  
numeral zero, going so far as to sketch a formula. 
</P>
<P>
	After he surrendered Tuesday, Maturino Resendez agreed to speak  
to police without an attorney present, but he neither admitted nor 
denied guilt in any crime, Ladd said. However, he tried to plead 
guilty during two court appearances on the burglary charge the next 
morning, saying he wanted to proceed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladd said Maturino Resendez's demeanor during the interrogation  
was the same meek, soft-spoken persona he has shown in the 
courtroom. He dismissed suggestions that Maturino Resendez is not 
of sound mind or that he was hoodwinked into surrendering with a 
possible death penalty looming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his mental capacity is just fine,'' Ladd said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Allen Tanner said Maturino Resendez and his  
family took authorities' promise of ``humane treatment'' to mean 
eliminating the chance of capital punishment. There is no death 
penalty in his native Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and his family understood that he would be treated  
humanely, and he doesn't think that if they're going to seek the 
death penalty, that that's humane,'' Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner added that Maturino Resendez has not yet sought help from  
the local consulate, but he hopes they can bring some pressure upon 
authorities not to seek the death penalty. Thirteen Mexican 
citizens currently are on death row in Texas.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- A few things to know about Briana Scurry:  
She doesn't feel overlooked or a victim of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, soccer is not her best sport. And she's thinking of  
playing in the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. goalkeeper says she's gotten all the attention she  
wants since her stellar performance helped send her country to the 
Women's World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	She has heard complaints she did not get enough credit for her  
shutout last weekend in which her key save during penalty kicks 
helped the United States beat China. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know some people are saying the camera wasn't on me enough  
during the game,'' she said in the NBC dressing room Thursday 
before her appearance on the ``Tonight'' show. ``But I watched a 
tape today, and I had the camera on me tons. Goalies never get too 
much notice on highly offensive teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry grew up the youngest of nine children in Dayton, Minn.,  
20 miles outside Minneapolis. She was the only black starter on the 
team and disagrees with those who contend she was overlooked 
because of her race. 
</P>
<P>
	And that includes her mother. Robbie Scurry on Wednesday said  
her daughter has been kept from the limelight because she is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom is a little biased in that sense,'' said Scurry, who  
has signed an endorsement deal with Pepsi. ``She probably never 
thinks I get enough attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old goalie also said she has an idea for her next  
career -- the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry was an all-state basketball player in high school but  
played soccer at the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to change my focus in sports because basketball is the  
sport I love more than anything else,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, she will stay busy.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last week has been hectic but great,'' she said.  
``Actually, I'm getting a lot of attention. Pepsi has all kinds of 
things planned for me. I've been on the 'Today' show, the 'Tonight' 
show, 'Good Morning America,' you name it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team plans to visit the White House and President Clinton on  
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Casey Out With Sore Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Sean Casey took a few strides on his tightly  
taped, painfully swollen right ankle and knew he wouldn't be 
playing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati Reds manager Jack McKeon saw those halting steps and  
called Casey aside to tell the first baseman what he'd already 
figured out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey was out of the lineup against Colorado because of a  
swollen ankle. He fouled a ball off the top of the ankle Thursday 
night and came out of the game in a double switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, who began the night with the National League's  
second-highest batting average at .373, got in uniform and went out 
for infield practice Friday to test the ankle. It wasn't good. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just sore. It's right there in the joint,'' Casey said.  
``I'm sure in a day or two it will be all right. There's a lot of 
swelling that needs to go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker, the NL's hitting leader at .375, also was out of  
the Rockies' starting lineup Friday, getting a day of rest. Walker 
went 0-for-5 Thursday night in the Reds' 10-7 victory, his first 
0-for-5 since Aug. 19, 1997 in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were available to pinch hit, although Casey's ankle  
made him doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey fouled a ball off the ankle in the seventh inning Thursday  
night and initially thought he'd broken something. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little worried. I knew I'd hit it pretty bad,'' he  
said. ``I was afraid to walk on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed in the game and flew out, then came out as part of a  
double switch. X-rays found no fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	When he awoke Friday morning, the ankle was throbbing. He was  
still moving slowly when he made it to the stadium and went out to 
the field. McKeon watched for a few moments, then called Casey 
aside and told him to take the night off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like the way he came out,'' McKeon said.

	The Dow Jones industrial average rose just 23.43 to 11,209.84,  
topping Monday's record close of 11,200.98 and extending this 
year's gain to 22 percent. For the week, however, the Dow only 
mustered a gain of 16.14. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad market finished mixed on Friday, with declining issues  
outnumbering advancers overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The only decisive buying came in the technology sector, which  
helped boost the Nasdaq composite index 25.11 to 2,864.48, its 
third straight record close. The rally pushed the Nasdaq's gain for 
1999 past 30 percent. 
</P>

	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index closed at a record high for a  
second consecutive day, rising 9.16 to 1,418.78.

<P>
	Microsoft led the Nasdaq advance, rising 5 1/16 to 99 7/16 after  
a federal jury in Connecticut decided the company did not violate 
antitrust laws in its dealings with a smaller software maker. The 
shares also drew a boost from news Microsoft might create a 
separate stock for its Internet properties. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little reaction to a report showing that production at  
the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a slight 0.2 
percent in June. For the quarter, industrial output rose 3.9 
percent, the best showing since late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the government released two reports showing  
that inflation has remained mild. The data helped calm worries the 
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again to slow the 
economy, keeping a lid on pricing pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the good news, investors mostly refrained from making  
big bets before next week's busy schedule of second-quarter 
earnings reports, including the latest results from IBM, Citigroup 
and Microsoft on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the market has managed to push higher because not many  
companies have issued early warnings and the early signs from major 
players such as General Electric have been encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am impressed with the quality of corporate earnings. It's a  
good quarter and investor enthusiasm about profits thus far is well 
placed,'' said Charles G. Crane, chief market strategist at Key 
Asset Management. But, he added ``What continues to nag at me is 
the very high valuations that stocks sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another obstacle for Wall Street may be the rising tensions  
between China and Taiwan over the status of the island province, 
said Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond James &AMP; 
Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian financial markets slumped Friday after a Hong Kong  
newspaper reported that China was beefing up its military presence 
near Taiwan. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.0 percent, while

<HEADLINE> Memphis Mayor Faces 20 Challengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A scion of a powerful Memphis political  
family is challenging the city's first elected black mayor in a 
race observers say may very well be dominated by a family feud. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Willie Herenton faces 20 challengers in the Oct. 7  
election, an eclectic list that includes a professional wrestler 
and a former football coach. However, political observers see the 
race coming down Herenton, the two-term incumbent, and City Council 
chairman Joe Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, 45, is a brother of former congressman Harold Ford Sr. and  
an uncle of current Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ford Sr., the state's first black member of Congress,  
represented the 9th Congressional District for 22 years. He runs 
one of the state's most active political organizations, and he and 
Herenton have made it clear they don't like each other. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a family dispute almost certain to affect the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's deep and long-standing,'' said Marcus Pohlmann, a  
political scientist at Rhodes College in Memphis. ``I get the 
impression it's more than just political, that it's personal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herenton, 59, claims his opponent is part of a power-hungry  
family bent on controlling Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ford family is moving in the direction of trying to occupy  
all major elected positions in our system,'' the mayor said. 
``They've shown how ruthless they can be in wielding power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenger counters that Herenton ``is more interested in  
enriching himself than the city of Memphis'' and is beholden to 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have clashed several times but this is their first  
head-to-head political contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis, with 650,000 residents, is 55 percent black.  
</P>
<P>
	Pohlmann said he thinks Herenton and Ford will split most of the  
black vote. How that split breaks down -- and how many white votes 
each attracts -- will be the keys to victory, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herenton has gotten along well with the city's predominantly  
white business establishment, so that will help him, Pohlmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, Ford may be hurt by brother Harold, who angered many  
whites over the years with an us-against-them bid for black votes, 
Pohlmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who beat Thursday's filing deadline for the October  
election include wrestler Jerry ``The King'' Lawler and former 
football coach Pepper Rodgers, who led the city's failed bid to 
land a National Football League franchise.

<HEADLINE> Fight for Phone Cos. Said Near End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The takeover fight for U S West Inc. and  
Frontier Corp. appears to be ending in a compromise that will split 
the targets between the two bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest International Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd., two upstart  
telecommunications companies that have been battling one another 
for the rights to acquire U S West and Frontier, are likely to 
reach an agreement this weekend, according to two people close to 
the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal being discussed, Denver-based Qwest  
is expected to win U S West, a Denver-based regional telephone 
company with operations in 14 states in the West and Midwest. 
Meanwhile, Global Crossing will acquire Frontier, the people said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current deal is still in the preliminary stages and talks  
were still continuing late Friday night. Nevertheless, any 
settlement would end the one-month struggle for control of U S West 
and Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Qwest and Global Crossing are building worldwide  
fiber-optic cable networks, and they want the customers and 
revenues of U S West and Frontier to help them succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing struck deals to acquire with U S West and  
Frontier first, but Qwest tried to break up the agreements last 
month by launching its own bids. Qwest has persisted in the face of 
a backlash from its own shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the companies would comment on the current negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms being discussed, Qwest will pay $34.7 billion in  
stock for U S West, and has agreed to structure the deal as a 
merger of equals, giving U S West equal representation on the board 
of directors, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, however, apparently is ready to back off from its pursuit  
of Frontier, a Rochester, N.Y.-based long-distance and local phone 
company. Frontier would be acquired by Global Crossing for $10.9 
billion in stock, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Global Crossing, based in Bermuda, would  
cut in half the penalty fee U S West would owe for severing their 
acquisition agreement. U S West would have to pay only $420 million 
instead of $850 million, according to one person familiar with the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	This is just the latest in a series of recent bidding wars in  
the communications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest long-distance company,  
won a bidding war against Comcast Corp. for MediaOne, a large cable 
company. And in Europe, upstart Olivetti SpA recently won a 
takeover fight with Deutsche Telekom for control of Telecom Italia 
SpA.

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Want Capitalism in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said  
today after a visit to Cuba that the emergence of a small private 
sector on the island offers ``a small but hopeful opening'' that 
the chamber wants to help develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas J. Donohue, chamber president and chief executive  
officer, said at a news conference and in a written statement that 
while there is no evidence of a change in Cuba's ideology, it is 
significant that certain entrepreneurial activities are now 
permitted as part of a reform process. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this small way, the process of change in Cuba has begun and  
we ought to seize the opportunity to spur it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the chamber will be working with Cubans over the next  
few weeks to flesh out the details on building relationships with 
both independent companies and public corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue's three-day visit was the first by a chamber of commerce  
president to Cuba since the 1959 communist revolution. He spent six 
hours with President Fidel Castro and also met with other top 
government officials along with dissidents and church leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he showed up late for his meeting with Castro because he  
did not want to cut short his meeting with the dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue said he found Castro to be ``very smart and very strong  
about his own convictions.'' He said Castro acknowledged to him 
that some aspects of an economy work better when carried out by the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, who has called capitalism a ``brutal, inhumane system,''  
had little in common with his pro-free enterprise visitor, who 
heads the world's largest business federation. But both are sharply 
critical of the trade embargo the United States imposed against 
Cuba not long after the triumph of the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cuba was undergoing an economic free-fall earlier in the  
decade, Castro, in a radical departure, allowed Cubans to operate 
family-owned and operated businesses. For example, private 
restaurants are permitted so long as there are no employees outside 
the family and the number of chairs is limited to 12. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 Cubans took advantage of the opening at its  
peak, but taxes and other disincentives have lowered the number to 
fewer than 140,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beneath the surface, an ideological spark has been ignited,''  
Donohue said. ``The government has yet to decide whether to nurture 
it or snuff it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a nationally televised appearance on Wednesday at the  
University of Havana, Donohue voiced opinions that have not been 
heard in a public setting in Cuba in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	With Castro watching the broadcast, Donohue said his  
organization ``fundamentally disapproves'' of Cuba's political, 
economic and human rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a tragedy,'' he said, ``that during one of the most  
exciting and dynamic periods of economic expansion and 
technological innovation, the Cuban people have been left out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the lack of private enterprise more than any other  
factor that has played the greatest role in holding Cuba back.''

<HEADLINE> Gene Research Promising for Farmers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLOWS, Calif. (AP) -- Judy Brown gazes over her 240 acres of  
flowering cotton plants with a worried expression on her face. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder. Threats to the third-generation farmer's crop between  
now and the October harvest include weeds, bugs, a lack of water, 
bad weather -- and, for the first time in years, sagging cotton 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping. That's what farmers do. They hope,'' said Brown,  
the 53-year-old co-owner of Finch Ranch, a patchwork 2,400 acres of 
various crops in Glenn County in the northern Sacramento Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Her hopes are buoyed by researchers' genetic engineering efforts  
that already have made her cotton plants more resistant to 
herbicides used to kill weeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest gene research promises to make cotton strands  
stronger and longer, boosting the quality and therefore the price 
of cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Science Foundation has awarded a $3.8 million  
federal grant for a three-year cotton gene research project to be 
headed by the University of California, Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're researching cotton genes that determine what makes a  
fiber, with the goal of making a better fiber and more fiber,'' 
said Thea Wilkins, the molecular geneticist directing the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are studying tens of thousands of cotton genes to  
determine what proportion are linked to creation of fibers. By 
scrutinizing defective cotton fibers, researchers try to determine 
which genes are flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``By looking at which ones have gone bad, we find out which ones  
are critical to the fibers. We're building a tremendous database 
that will be invaluable,'' said Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins believes the work, which started last month, is  
important to the future of cotton production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growers are really, really between a rock and hard place, with  
rising production costs, a plateau of production levels, and 
stagnating market prices. They're at an all-time low. Farmers are 
looking at alternative crops,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't make it profitable for farmers to grow it, we're  
going to have to rely on the rest of the world for cotton and its 
byproducts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton is used primarily in clothing and furniture but its  
byproducts also are widely used in paper and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	California's 1 million acres of cotton yields 14 percent of the  
nation's total crop, making it the second largest cotton-producing 
state after Texas, said California Farm Bureau spokesman Bob 
Krauter. 
</P>
<P>
	With a value of nearly $1 billion in 1997, cotton was the  
state's 8th biggest crop and its largest agricultural export 
commodity, Krauter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the California cotton, known for its high quality, has  
been shipped to Asian markets. But since the recent economic 
downturn in Asia, California cotton prices have plummeted while the 
costs of doing business -- pesticides, herbicides, water -- have not. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price right now is really, really low,'' said Brown, who  
has been growing cotton for six years. ``It's in the mid- to 
high-50s (cents) per pound. It's probably down 10 cents a pound 
from when we planted this year. Last year, I sold my cotton for 78 
cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now there isn't any profit in cotton. But I'm hoping by  
the time I sell it that the market will be better.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Fund-Raising Overwhelms GOPers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush raised more money in just two states -- Texas and California -- 
than Democratic front-runner Al Gore collected across the country 
in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	With $30 million already in his campaign account, Bush says he  
will turn down federal matching funds for his primary campaign, 
freeing himself from the spending limits restricting his poorer 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has raked in $37 million donations this year,  
more than the rest of the Republican field combined. That's also 
more than the two Democratic candidates together. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got it, spend it,'' former Vice President Dan  
Quayle, also seeking the GOP nomination, said this morning on NBC's 
``Today'' program. ``What (Bush) is doing is tryingo win this 
campaign by money alone. He really believes in the school of old 
politics that money wins elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has raised $19.5 million this year -- $9.5 million over the  
past three months, including some earmarked for legal fees. Bush 
took in $10.6 million from Texas and California alone from April 
through June. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley has raised $11.7  
million so far, and after campaign expenses he has $7.5 million 
saved, not too far behind Gore's $9.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bush wins the GOP nomination, his spending could bedevil his  
eventual Democratic adversary long before next summer's party 
nominating conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bush will be unlimited,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of  
government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. ``One thing we 
have seen in recent presidential elections is that the summer 
period has become increasingly important for framing the general 
election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the period where candidates have tried to define their  
opponents in a way that gives them a clear advantage heading into 
the fall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending limits -- and federal matching funds -- last until  
the national party conventions. Once selected, the major party 
nominees can choose to have the federal government pay for their 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush already has raised almost as much as he could spend during  
the primaries under the limits, which are expected to be around $40 
million. By forgoing the matching funds, he faces no spending 
restrictions in the primaries, although he still can only accept 
individual contributions of $1,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got limits that constrain a candidate,'' Bush said. ``I  
want to be in a position to respond. I want to be in a position to 
plan, and I want to be in a position to plan according to need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who finances most of  
his own campaign, joins Bush as the only other GOP candidate 
rejecting matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush raised the most in his home state of Texas, an Associated  
Press computer analysis of his quarterly spending report found. 
Bush took in 10,269 contributions totaling $7 million from the Lone 
Star State from April through June. 
</P>
<P>
	While California ranked second for Bush, with 4,132  
contributions totaling $3.6 million, the state offered Democrats 
their richest territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley took in $1.6 million from California, and Gore raised  
$1.1 million. New York came in second for both Democrats, with $1.4 
million for Bradley and $597,281 for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $110,000 of Bush's millions came from members of  
Washington lobbying firms. Gore also received at least $50,000 from 
Washington lobbyists, while Bradley took about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also gathered almost $700,000 from political action  
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Roger Salazar said his campaign spent a lot of  
money recently building its organization in key states such as Iowa 
and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made some pretty major investments in the campaign that  
we feel are already paying off,'' Salazar said. ``By contrast, our 
primary opponent has yet to make those key investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also leads Bradley in opinion polls, but Bradley spokesman  
Tony Wyche said it was still too early to worry about surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more content to build our organization at the grassroots  
level, building from the bottom up rather than the top down,'' 
Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some well known names contributed the $1,000 maximum to the  
campaigns: 
</P>
<P>
	--Actors Chevy Chase and Kevin Costner gave to Gore, as did  
producer Quincy Jones, television producer Norman Lear and former 
TV executive Grant Tinker. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bradley's contributors included actors Tom Selleck, Paul Reiser  
and Steve Guttenberg. Former professional basketball players Bill 
Walton and John Havlicek gave to the former New York Knick, as did 
former Knicks broadcaster Marty Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bush had few celebrity contributors, but martial artist and  
actor Chuck Norris kicked in some support.

<HEADLINE> National Mary Kay Convention Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- When Mary Kay cosmetics disciples mention the  
company's founder, they may get a little misty. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just an incredible woman,'' said Karen Irwin of St.  
Louis. ``Unfortunately, I haven't met her. I mean, I feel like I 
have. From a distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40,000 Mary Kay makeup sellers have converged on  
Dallas from all around the country for this summer's two-week, 
14-hotel convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Kay Ash herself doesn't make it to the national meetings  
these days. A plucky Texan who built the direct-sales company 30 
years ago, the 81-year-old Ms. Ash is recovering from a stroke and 
a broken leg. But her framed photos cast serene gazes over the 
Dallas Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The manicured fingers of Mary Kay reach far. The company has  
representatives in 29 countries, including Russia and China. Last 
year, 500,000 Mary Kay vendors sold more than $1 billion worth of 
merchandise worldwide, according to spokeswoman Shelley Whiddon. 
</P>
<P>
	The women who pay their $100 fee to join the Mary Kay sales  
force are handed a mantra, a set of priorities and a prescribed 
mental outlook along with the standard case of creams and powders. 
They must wear skirts or dresses. They must not drink or smoke. 
They must tell themselves, over and over, ``I am making other 
people's lives better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big sales bring lavish rewards -- diamond bar pins, diamond  
rings, cars and the ultimate prize: the pink Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is struggling to shed its image as a work force for  
housewives only. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have this image of big, blond hair,'' said Ms. Irwin, a  
former corporate executive whose brown hair is cropped short. ``But 
we're teachers, CPAs, financial directors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two marriages, a stint running a metaphysics bookstore and  
a few years driving a Federal Express truck, Sally Fairbanks of 
Orlando, Fla., joined the Mary Kay sales force. She liked the idea 
of setting her own hours, pulling down high pay and working outside 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women have come full circle,'' Ms. Fairbanks said,  
speedwalking into the convention center in a crush of perfumed 
women. ``We've got it all. Now we want to give some of it back.''

	ROY, Utah (AP) -- Iomega Corp., maker of removable-media  
data-storage devices, has posted a net loss of $47.1 million, or 17 
cents a share, for its second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That compared with a net loss of $39.9 million, or 15 cents a  
share, for the same period of 1998, and was within the range 
announced by the company on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's second-quarter loss announced Thursday includes a  
pretax restructuring charge of $41.9 million stemming from closing 
facilities and eliminating jobs. Before the restructuring charge, 
the company posted a net loss of $19.8 million, or 7 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the second quarter was $348.8 million compared with  
$393.8 million for the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring charge and pending loss were announced last  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega projects $40 million in annual cost savings beginning  
next year from the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of this year, Iomega reported a net  
loss of $46.5 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $735 
million. That compared with a net loss of $58.5 million, or 22 
cents a share, on revenue of $801.3 million for the same six months 
of 1998.

<P>
	KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) -- Rene Weller, the former European  
lightweight boxing champion, was sentenced to seven years in prison 
Friday after being convicted of selling cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in the Karlsruhe state court said that from 1992  
until his arrest on June, 1998 Weller sold about 33 pounds of 
cocaine with a street value of about $390,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-year-old Weller could have gotten up to 15 years in  
prison. But Judge Joachim Nusseln said his admission of guilt was 
taken into consideration in the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	A German native, Weller was champion in 1983 and in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested in Karlsruhe in a sting operation. He has been

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Technicians to Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Technicians who maintain the nation's air  
traffic control system are protesting because they believe 
equipment is being rushed into service without sufficient testing 
or training. 
</P>
<P>
	They planned to leaflet 21 airports across the country today  
with their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for  
ensuring the system's safety, said the labor union representing the 
10,000 technicians is merely trying to spur along stalled contract 
negotiations. The membership has been without a contract since 
February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go through an extensive development and testing of  
equipment before it is even sent to the specific air traffic 
facility,'' said FAA spokesman William Shumann. 
</P>
<P>
	The Professional Airways Systems Specialists union says a ``rush  
to modernize'' the system has caused equipment outages and traffic 
delays at facilities controlling air travel in several cities, 
including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, there have been at least six serious outages from New  
York to Seattle since January, but they have been blamed on a 
variety of causes. Among them have been power failures, faulty 
computers and software glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Another outage on July 8 in Miami was caused when a contractor  
working on a communications system accidentally tripped circuit 
breakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem is that the Federal Aviation  
Administration is not listening to its highly skilled technicians 
about how the outages can be avoided,'' said a statement by union 
President Michael D. Fanfalone. ``The agency has also refused to 
provide appropriate staffing levels or to train employees on new 
technology so they can quickly deal with equipment failures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA says a $13 billion upgrade of the nation's air traffic  
control system now under way should reduce such problems and make 
maintenance easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumann, the FAA spokesman, said contract negotiations have  
bogged down over pay, job security and the amount and type of work 
that can be transferred to private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency adamantly denied that its equipment replacements have  
jeopardized air traveler safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``On major systems, we introduce them gradually into operation  
so both the technicians and the controllers are fully aware of the 
systems and comfortable with it when we use it exclusively to 
control air traffic,'' Shumann said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also complained that leaflets distributed by the union on  
July 2 did not disclose that the union was in the midst of 
negotiating a contract with the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The system specialists planned to distribute leaflets in  
Atlanta; Albuquerque, N.M.; Beaumont, Texas; Buffalo, N.Y.; Corpus 
Christi, Texas; Covington, Ky.; Dallas; Houston; Indianapolis; 
Jacksonville, Fla.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Memphis, Tenn.; Nashville, 
Tenn.; Oklahoma City; Orlando, Fla.; Pittsburgh; San Antonio; 
Seattle; Tampa, Fla.; Tulsa, Okla.; and Tyler, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaflets provided the telephone number for the Capitol  
switchboard and urged readers to call their local congressman and 
register their views.

<HEADLINE> Ranger Credited in Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Drew Carter, who dreamed for years of becoming a  
Texas Ranger, has made his own mark in the legendary crime-fighting 
force that killed outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter is the Ranger who orchestrated the surrender of Angel  
Maturino Resendez, a suspected serial killer who was the subject of 
a nationwide manhunt until Carter slipped the cuffs on him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surrender at the Ysleta international bridge in El Paso came  
after 1 1/2 days of negotiations in Albuquerque, N.M., with Maturino 
Resendez's sister. Officials credit Carter's relationship with 
Manuela Maturino as the break that led to the fugitive's capture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obtaining information about him and in setting up the  
interviews, and in talking with them and setting up things, they 
understood that I could be trusted, and I could trust them,'' 
Carter said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I love about this job,'' the 32-year-old lawman  
said. ``You don't know what the next day is going to hold. It's a 
real neat adventure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One former classmate at Bellaire High School in Houston said  
he's not surprised that Carter, a 1985 graduate, easily built a 
relationship with the suspect's relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always real talkative, a real good listener, very  
attentive and real interested in other people,'' said Craig 
Loewenstern, who works at a Houston software firm. ``I'm sure 
that's part of his job, building up the trust, being a good 
listener and that probably helped that lady trust him with her 
brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Luling, La., and raised in Houston, Carter rose through  
the ranks quickly after joining the Texas Department of Public 
Safety in 1988, becoming a lieutenant with the highway patrol in 
1996. A year later, he was accepted into the Rangers, the 
investigative arm of the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter had long dreamed of donning the force's uniform white  
hat, silver badge and cowboy boots -- even if it meant taking a 
demotion to sergeant, the entry rank for a Ranger, 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be a Ranger since I was five years old. It's been  
a lifelong dream,'' said Carter. ``I've pretty much always been a 
cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers were founded in 1823 when Texas leader Stephen F.  
Austin hired 10 gunmen to ``range'' his property and punish hostile 
Indians for attacks. The original Rangers got $1.25 a day and had 
to supply their own guns, horses and food. 
</P>
<P>
	The legend of the Rangers and their toughness grew during the  
Mexican War, as they fought alongside regular U.S. Army troops. The 
Rangers also captured or killed some of the Old West's most 
infamous outlaws, including train robber Sam Bass and gunslinger 
John Wesley Hardin, a preacher's son reputed to have killed 31 men. 
In the 1930s, a Texas Ranger tracked down and killed Bonnie and 
Clyde. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the force has just 107 members and there are usually  
between 100 and 200 candidates for each opening, said DPS spokesman 
Mike Cox.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Favors Photographer of Nudes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A photographer who wants to take a picture of  
100 nude models on a street received permission Friday from a 
federal judge, who said the work is protected under the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The city had objected, saying the sheer number of nude models  
violated the privacy rights of residents in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. decided in favor of  
photographer Spencer Tunick, who is known for shooting nudes in 
public places. Tunick planned to take the shot around dawn Sunday 
on a street in lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly think the body can be used by an artist as an art  
object, not as a sexual object,'' he said. ``Bodies not touching, 
lying prone like they're sleeping, is a human sculpture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, Baer noted that laws do not limit the number of  
people who can be nude while performing in a play, exhibition or 
show. Therefore they should not limit the number of nude people in 
a photograph, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The privacy interests of the residents of this neighborhood  
who can avert their eyes cannot outweigh the rights of others to 
exercise their First Amendment right to artistic expression,'' Baer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the photograph will be taken at 5:30 a.m., it will not  
threaten the privacy rights of residents or present overwhelming 
concerns for traffic or safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherrill Kurland, a lawyer for the city, said she will appeal.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Mechanics Reject Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Mechanics have rejected a proposed  
contract with US Airways Group Inc. that was negotiated last month 
by their union. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's sixth-largest airline said in a recorded telephone  
message for employees that it was ``particularly disappointed'' 
with the results ``in light of an increasingly competitive 
atmosphere within our East Coast markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines' 7,000 members of the International Association of  
Machinists and Aerospace Workers refused to ratify the contract 
agreement. The vote totals were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The US Air mechanics have sought a new contract since their  
current one came up for renewal in late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Weintraub, spokesman for the Arlington-based US Airways,  
said Friday that that company would release no information beyond 
what was recorded on the interoffice telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	The message stated that the airline was hopeful that an  
agreement would be reached, permitting USAir ``a reduction in the 
unusually high number of maintenance-related cancellations that the 
airline is experiencing.''

<HEADLINE> Columnist Suspended Over Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A San Jose Mercury News business  
columnist was suspended after earning $9,000 from an investment 
opportunity she got from a local executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Nolan, who writes the ``Talk is Cheap'' column, which  
focuses on the high-tech industries of Silicon Valley, expressed 
regrets. But she said she hadn't considered it to be a conflict of 
interest because the executive was a longtime friend and she had 
not planned to write about him because of the friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan said she advised an assistant business editor when she was  
offered the investment opportunity, and wasn't told not to proceed. 
Neither the columnist nor the editor sought other guidance, the 
Mercury News said. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive Editor David Yarnold said he was upset when he learned  
about the transaction on Thursday in a brief news item in The Wall 
Street Journal. He said Nolan would be suspended indefinitely while 
news executives look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's ethics policy says staff members shouldn't make  
news decisions about companies in which they have a financial 
interest. The policy also advises business news staff members not 
to invest in local companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us care deeply about our integrity and we all have a  
responsibility to avoid either a real conflict of interest or the 
appearance of a conflict of interest,'' Yarnold said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan's investment involves an increasingly common practice in  
the Silicon Valley stock market -- a ``friends and family'' 
arrangement to buy shares of an initial public offering at the 
opening price. 
</P>
<P>
	In late February, Dean DeBiase, chief executive of Autoweb.com  
of Santa Clara, an online car-buying service, let her buy 500 
shares at the opening price of $14. She sold them later for $29 and 
$45, making $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Such opportunities, while legal, aren't usually available to  
ordinary investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Silicon Valley, the management of many companies isn't a  
bunch of old guys we never get to talk to,'' Nolan, 40, said 
Thursday. ``CEOs are people in their 30s and 40s, who have friends. 
He's treating me like he treats other friends.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Endorses Most Reform Suggestions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- International Olympic leaders say they have  
embraced most of the recommendations of an American panel that 
blamed them for the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee said it has already accepted  
or is considering virtually all the suggestions made in March by 
the U.S. Olympic Committee bid oversight panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, chaired by former Senate Majority Leader George  
Mitchell, assailed the IOC for its role in the vote-buying affair 
stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's report accused the IOC of fostering a ``culture of  
improper gift giving'' and recommended a series of reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch met with Mitchell in London  
this month. Also present was Ken Duberstein, a former White House 
chief of staff and vice chairman of an ethics inquiry that 
criticized the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	In a policy statement issued Thursday night, the IOC thanked  
Mitchell for his ``very useful recommendations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them are being or will be considered very carefully,''  
the IOC said. ``Nearly all of them have already been integrated 
into the reform process currently underway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000, an 80-member task force set up in the wake of the  
scandal, is studying ways of reforming the organization's 
structure, rules and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Three working groups are meeting throughout the summer to draft  
proposals, which will be completed in October and submitted for 
approval at an IOC session tentatively scheduled for December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Few international organizations ... have ever set such goals  
within such short time limit,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	On specific points:  
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC said it agreed with the Mitchell commission's  
recommendation for term limits and periodic re-election of IOC 
members. Under the current system, members are appointed to virtual 
life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC said it had already met the recommendations for public  
financial statements and open meetings. Last month's IOC session in 
Seoul, South Korea, was beamed live to reporters for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	--The new IOC ethics commission will act on Mitchell's call for  
disclosure of gifts offered to members and enforcement of rules 
governing Olympic bid cities and members. 
</P>
<P>
	--While Mitchell proposed a series of tighter rules for the host  
city bidding process, the document said the IOC had adopted ``even 
more drastic changes,'' including a ban on member visits during the 
campaign for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it was still considering the question of site  
visits for the future, as well as a ``pre-selection'' of finalist 
cities and a possible open vote instead of secret ballot in 
choosing the host. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC took exception to Mitchell's recommendation for the  
organization to strengthen language in its bid manual to ensure 
that rules are binding and enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was always made clear to the candidate cities that the IOC  
rules contained in its manual were binding,'' the IOC said. ``The 
fact is that the Salt Lake City Bid Committee chose to ignore them; 
so did some IOC members. We all know by now that, in these 
instances, the system in place did not work. It is a matter of 
compliance and enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Referring to the recommendation for a ban on gifts other than  
those of minimal value, the IOC said its rule limiting gifts to a 
value of $200 had existed for years, and that the ethics panel 
would work to ensure compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC questioned Mitchell's call for the committee to be  
designated as a ``public international organization'' subject to 
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which covers bribery of 
international officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The document said the law may not apply because the IOC is a  
nongovernmental institution covering 200 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC also questioned Mitchell's recommendation that ``a  
substantial majority'' of IOC members be ``elected'' by their 
national Olympic committees, international federations and other 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC expressed concern that this would introduce the concept  
of ``representative members,'' challenging the long-standing rule 
that members represent the IOC in their countries and not the other 
way around. 
</P>
<P>
	The document said the IOC's future membership should include an  
unspecified number of national Olympic committee chiefs, the 
presidents of all major sports federations, active athletes chosen 
by their peers and ``a number of senior personalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it hopes to have a maximum of 110-120 members.  
There are currently 104 members.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Stars Sign 2 Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars signed centers Pavel Patera and  
Roman Lyashenko, a pair of draft picks who played overseas last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars general manager Bob Gainey announced Friday that Patera  
signed a one-year contract with an option for the 2000-01 season. 
Lyashenko's contact is for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Patera, 27, was drafted by Dallas in the sixth round of the 1998  
draft. He played in the Czech League last year, posting 16 goals 
and 37 assists in 52 games. He led Vsetin in scoring and assists to 
lead the team to the league title. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 186-pound Patera was a member of the Czech  
Republic's gold medal team in the 1998 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyashenko, 20, was drafted by the Stars in the second round of  
the 1997 draft. He played the past three seasons in the Russian 
League, where he had nine goals and nine assists in 42 games last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, the defending Stanley Cup champions, begin training  
camp on Sept. 4. They open their 1999-2000 season on Oct. 1 against 
Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Hoechst Shareholders OK Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Hoechst shareholders voted  
overwhelmingly today merge the company's life science business with 
that of France's Rhone-Poulenc. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors representing 64.8 percent of the company's stock voted  
99.7 percent in favor of forming Aventis, a huge drug and 
agricultural chemical conglomerate to be headquartered in 
Strasbourg, France. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is scheduled for November, pending approval of  
European Union antitrust authorities. Rhone-Poulenc shareholders 
approved the merger earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A second vote to spin off the group's industrial chemicals unit  
to Hoechst shareholders as Celanese AG received even stronger 
support at 99.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Objections from small shareholders had held up the voting, which  
had been expected to take place on Thursday, the first day of the 
meeting called expressly for the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	While most large, institutional investors and banks were  
satisfied with the proposal, small shareholders wanted more 
details, saying they are concerned about their post-merger rights, 
tax implications of the deal and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders continued to question minute details of the merger  
during Friday's meeting, inspiring concerns that the vote might not 
happen by a midnight deadline. That would have meant a costly delay 
for the merger, because another vote could not have been held until 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the vote, a small shareholder claimed Hoechst  
violated the protocol of the meeting by failing to provide a 
complete list of all shareholders present. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoechst supervisory board Chairman Martin Fruehauf ruled the  
company had fulfilled its legal obligations and that the vote was 
valid.

<HEADLINE> Bush Gets Down To Business in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush tucked his tie in his  
pocket, eyed the steaming pancake griddle and girded himself for 
some serious campaign work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a tradition?'' asked Bush. ``I think I like it.''  
</P>
<P>
	With that, Bush began flipping pancakes to a giggling Kelly  
Egenberger, taking care not to hold up the breakfast serving line 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a voter, I'm getting out of the way,'' declared  
Bush, kicking off yet another campaign day filled with hand 
shaking, autographing, posing for pictures and, occasionally, 
giving a speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a natural,'' said real chef Gregg White. ``When he gets  
done running, I've got a job for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me to come out here and shake as many hands as I  
can,'' said Bush. ``That's what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's soft Texas accent, well-tooled belt and silver saddle  
buckle mask an in-your-face campaign style. Touching is everything, 
as Juan Trujillo found out on a sun-splashed Webster City street. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bush strode by, Trujillo tossed out a phrase in Spanish. Bush  
pulled him aside, draped an arm over his shoulder and the two 
spoke, faces barely inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about the role of the Hispanic community,'' said  
Trujillo. ``He's going to be our next president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush brings substantial assets to this business of retail  
politics. Handsome and energetic, his backers say he can light up a 
room. Politics in small states like Iowa is all about working the 
diners and storefronts where voters hang out. 
</P>
<P>
	He has critics, GOP rivals and Democrats who charge that Bush is  
vague and trying to use a big financial edge to buy the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just trying to buy the caucuses and the caucuses are not  
for sale,'' grumbled Democrat Joe Jongewaard, walking a picket line 
outside one event. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush ignores the carping.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a person who tries to shake every possible hand,'' he  
said. ``I'm comfortable with people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He insists he's dealing with the issues.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a pace to a campaign that's important to maintain,''  
said Bush. ``By the time the main events begin, I'll have laid out 
what I'm going to lay out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At rally after rally, he works the crowd tirelessly, staying to  
shake hands until virtually everyone has left. At an Ames picnic, a 
light rain began falling and many retreated to cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush didn't miss a beat, working the crowd for another half-hour  
in an increasingly damp shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	During each 45-minute campaign stop, Bush tosses off a 10-minute  
pep talk and spends the rest of his time up close and personal -- 
and intense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope people see it as enthusiasm,'' said Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to shake people's hands, I want to look people in the  
eye,'' said Bush. ``Ultimately, it's the grass-roots politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got great charisma,'' said Ron Larson, munching on lunch  
at a Webster City diner. ``It shows the minute he walked through 
the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Hughes started her encounter with Bush on a serious  
note, quizzing him directly about abortion and tax cuts. Within a 
couple of minutes, though, she was giving him a hug and gushing to 
a friend: ``He's the best looking one we've worked for yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I generally don't get on bandwagons, but I'm going to get on  
this one,'' Mrs. Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bush, working a crowd is an intensely physical event, with  
eyes burning and hands reaching in every direction. His famous name 
may get him through the front door, but he works to close the sale 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really there as a dad, not as a political adviser,'' Bush  
said of his father, the former president. ``My mother gives me the 
political advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family name does carry a lot of clout.  
</P>
<P>
	``May I hug you?'' said Roberta Trees. ``With your parents,  
you've got to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Des Moines radio personality Van Hardin dragged Bush aside  
at the pancake breakfast, most of his questions were about the role 
other candidates would play in a Bush administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``How come you're so far ahead in all the polls?'' Hardin asked  
a clearly delighted Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``You better ask all these people following me around,'' said  
Bush, gesturing to a crowd of reporters. ``That's their job, to 
figure it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The intensity seemed to be having at least some effect. Andy  
Cable showed up at the Ames picnic to hear Bush for the second time 
to ``confirm my thinking. ``I like his vigor, his enthusiasm,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Output Rises in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Output at the nation's factories, mines and  
utilities posted a slight increase in June, finishing the best 
quarter for manufacturing in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve reported today that industrial production  
rose 0.2 percent, matching the gain in output in May, and was in 
line with analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The June performance left industrial output rising at an annual  
rate of 3.9 percent in the second quarter, the best showing since a 
6.6 percent rate of increase in the final three months of 1997. The 
growth rate in the April-June quarter this year was triple the 1.3 
percent growth rate of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's manufacturing sector has been struggling for the  
past two years under the impact of a global financial crisis that 
has cut sharply into U.S. exports while triggering a flood of 
cheaper foreign-made goods into the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March 1998, U.S. manufacturing has lost 488,000 jobs.  
</P>
<P>
	But the June report on industrial output is the latest in a  
number of signs that manufacturing may be emerging from its steep 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month a survey by the National Association of  
Purchasing Management showed that the manufacturing sector expanded 
for the fifth straight month in June at a stronger pace than 
expected with new orders rising at a good clip. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Fed said, strength in industrial production was led  
by a 2.7 percent increase in production of cars and trucks, almost 
as strong as the 3 percent rise in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Other big gains in manufacturing included a 2 percent rise in  
home electronics and a 2.7 percent increase in production of 
business computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, production of durable goods, items expected to last at  
least three years, rose 0.4 percent in June following gains of 0.6 
percent in both April and May. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in durable goods was offset somewhat by continued  
weakness in the production of nondurable goods, which fell 0.2 
percent in both May and June. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of petroleum products, leather, tobacco and clothing  
fell in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Output in mining, the category that includes oil and gas  
drilling, rose 0.4 percent in June, matching the May increase. But 
even with the gains, the operating rate in the mining industry 
still remains well below its long-run average because of continued 
slack in oil production. 
</P>
<P>
	Output at the nation's utilities was up 0.4 percent in June,  
reflecting big gains in electrical power output. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 80.3  
percent of capacity in June, down slightly from a May operating 
rate of 80.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatively low operating rate is one reason economists are  
optimistic that there will not be the bottlenecks that normally 
occur late in an economic expansion, driving up costs and setting 
off inflation pressures.

<HEADLINE> Utah Mogul Supports 2002 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah's richest industrialist threw his  
support -- but not his money -- behind the 2002 Winter Olympic Games 
on Friday, shoving aside some long-held ``reservations about these 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I excited and enthused the games are coming to Utah? No. I  
cannot be dishonest. I am not. But I must put that matter behind us 
(and) support these games,'' said Jon M. Huntsman, owner of one of 
the world's largest chemical manufacturers, Huntsman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman, 61, turned from unyielding critic to supporter after  
blasting Olympic leaders only last week on ethics, fundraising and 
the possibility the games will leave Utah taxpayers with a debt. 
</P>
<P>
	His conversion came Wednesday after a three-hour meeting with  
Gov. Michael Leavitt and top leaders of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee, chairman Robert Garff and president Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman's support provides a psychological boost to the Utah  
games. He plans to help raise money, but only from out-of-state 
corporate donors, saying Utah has already paid enough in dollars 
and a damaged reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The billionaire philanthropist said he ``probably will not be  
contributing financially to the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He considers other causes -- finding a cure for cancer, caring  
for the poor, supporting hospitals and education -- ``far more 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Olympic critic since Salt Lake City in 1995 won the right to  
host the games -- ``I felt very much like the solitary figure'' -- 
Huntsman has dismissed the Olympics as a ``three-week carnival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was particularly critical of Olympic board members who stood  
to profit personally from the games. He now praises the board's 
adoption -- ``only last week'' -- of a strict ethics policy. 
</P>
<P>
	He still worries that Olympic fundraising will sap other  
worthwhile Utah charities. He calls Romney's goal of raising $100 
million from Utah companies ``an impossible amount of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman's worst fears were realized in December, when it  
surfaced that Salt Lake bidders had lavished gifts, favors, cash, 
medical care and jobs on International Olympic Committee members 
and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was terribly embarrassed as I traveled to many countries in  
the past four to five months,'' Huntsman said. ``I have found that 
throughout the world our integrity as a city has been severely 
questioned. The bribery is well known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It left him ``angered, flustered, frustrated.''  
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman said he was assured by Leavitt that Olympic leaders  
will not ``pressure'' Utah residents to give priority to Olympic 
contributions over other charities. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Romney and others assured Huntsman the games will  
break even, ``Heaven help us if they're not accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah companies and residents ``should feel free'' but don't have  
to help out the Olympic games, Leavitt said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to need people to volunteer, and they will,'' the  
governor said. ``But that doesn't mean they'll abandon the homeless 
or the symphony.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts Education in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Touting a proposal to help modernize  
classrooms, President Clinton today challenged congressional 
Republicans to take advantage of good economic times to invest in 
education before promising tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes down to this: What do you want to do with this  
moment of prosperity?'' Clinton asked more than 400 people packed 
into a steaming hot gymnasium at Amos Hiatt Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton kicked off a ``Rebuilding America's Schools'' campaign  
by questioning why GOP leaders on Capitol Hill want to promise 
broad tax cuts before addressing such pressing needs as the 
long-term stability of Medicare and deteriorating classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot pretend that there are not consequences,'' Clinton  
said. ``There are choices to be made, and we should be thinking 
about the children and the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The middle school event was a precursor to two fund-raisers in  
the Des Moines area to raise almost $200,000 for a major 
impeachment ally, Sen. Tom Harkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wasn't the only politician meeting and greeting Iowans  
today. Republican hopefuls Lamar Alexander, Steve Forbes and George 
W. Bush were stumping in the state where party caucuses in February 
will give the first indication of candidate preferences in the 2000 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys should be glad to see me here in Iowa,'' Clinton told  
his audience, many of whom fanned themselves against the heat. 
``I'm the only guy in weeks that's been here who's not running for 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But sniping between Clinton and Bush, the GOP front-runner,  
continued to keep the president at the center of the political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush criticized Clinton on Thursday, saying his administration  
has done little to ease the economic pressures on the nation's 
farmers. Without referring to Bush directly, Clinton tried to lay 
blame for the farmers' problems on policies generated by Congress 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He said those who supported the Freedom to Farm Act, which  
weaned farmers away from price supports in exchange for more 
freedom to choose what they planted, ``acted like there never would 
be a bad day on the farm.'' Clinton signed the legislation into law 
but hinted today that important changes will be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening a two-day campaign, Bush took care to hammer today at  
troubles facing the farm economy, a big issue in Iowa. He also was 
seeking to deflect critics who argue he doesn't talk about issues, 
sounding his farm theme in stop after stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of Clinton's education event was a proposal,  
part of his fiscal 2000 budget, to give tax breaks to investors who 
buy municipal bonds to back school construction and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The item, which would provide $3.7 billion in federal tax breaks  
over five years, could support up to $25 billion in school 
modernization, according to administration estimates. The tax break 
would make the low-rate bonds more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar proposal failed to win congressional passage last  
year. Clinton says his proposed budget includes money to pay for 
the proposal, but the initiative is again lacking support on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and building trades union members in Houston, New  
Orleans, New York City and Philadelphia were holding rallies to 
coincide with Clinton's speech in Des Moines.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Wins Conn. Antitrust Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The founders of tiny Bristol Technology  
Inc. knew they had their work cut out for them when they took on 
Microsoft Corp. in an antitrust lawsuit. But this time around, 
David didn't get the best of Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danbury, Conn.-based company, with just 70 employees and  
$8.7 million in revenues last year, sued Microsoft in August, 
claiming that the industry leader was trying to crush competition 
by preventing access to its source code -- the software blueprints -- 
for Windows NT. Bristol spent more than $1 million to prepare its 
case for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	After a federal jury in Bridgeport rejected Bristol's antitrust  
claims Friday, the company's lawyers were crestfallen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely disappointed and surprised, and will be  
exploring all of our options,'' said attorney John Altieri. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still firmly believe that Microsoft engaged in  
anticompetitive behavior against Bristol, and that Microsoft is 
attempting to monopolize additional operating system markets,'' 
said Bristol Chief Executive Officer Keith Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury did find that Microsoft committed a deceptive act that  
violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. The panel 
didn't specify what the act was, and awarded Bristol just $1 in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Aeschbacher, senior corporate attorney for Microsoft,  
called the verdict ``an important victory for the whole software 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This protects the rights of people who developed intellectual  
property to be able to license it in a fair and equitable way,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust experts said Microsoft's victory was clearly important  
but was expected to have little impact in the much larger antitrust 
case in Washington, D.C., brought by the Justice Department and 19 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends that Microsoft illegally wielded  
monopoly power from its dominant Windows product to expand into new 
markets, such as Internet software, and thus crush competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a boost to the company principally because it's going to  
discourage other private parties from taking a swing at it for the 
same type of behavior,'' said William Kovacic of George Washington 
University. ``It will slow down others who thought it was time to 
pile on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the verdict  
has no bearing on the legal claims made by the states in the 
Justice Department case. He said Microsoft's ``monopolistic 
abuses'' have ``shortchanged customers and stifled competition in 
the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be optimistic about prevailing in our action,''  
Blumenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is also facing an antitrust suit filed by Caldera Inc.  
of Orem, Utah. That case is scheduled to go to trial in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a software product called Wind/U, which allows  
programs written specifically for Windows to be converted to run on 
computers with different operating systems such as UNIX. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1994 to 1997, the two companies had a contract under which  
Microsoft provided Bristol access to source code for an earlier 
version of Windows NT. Bristol filed its lawsuit after they were 
unable to reach an agreement on a contract for the newest versions. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-week trial in U.S. District Court pitted Bristol, a  
little-known company, against the Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft 
with 27,000 employees and $14.48 billion in fiscal 1998 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol made two antitrust claims, first, that Microsoft refused  
to negotiate a new contract. Secondly, Bristol asserted that 
Microsoft illegally leveraged its monopoly power in personal 
computer operating systems to monopolize markets for operating 
systems for computer servers and technical workstations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol's lawyers did not ask the jury to award a specific  
amount of money, but in closing arguments suggested a range of $130 
million to $263 million. That range was given by an economic 
damages expert testifying for Bristol who said the company would 
lose that amount in profits from 1996 to 2006 because it lost the 
latest Windows source code for more than two years.

<HEADLINE> IRL Ponders Fender Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) -- Will open-wheel racing become an archaic  
term in the Indy Racing League? 
</P>
<P>
	A crash that killed three fans and injured eight others at  
Lowe's Motor Speedway near Charlotte, N.C., has sparked serious 
debate about adding fenders to the cars for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruton Smith, who owns Lowe's and three other tracks where the  
IRL stages five of its 11 races, is pushing the idea mainly as a 
way of improving safety. He is still troubled by the grim scenario 
of debris flying into the grandstands at the May 1 race. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also owns the similarly designed Atlanta Motor Speedway,  
where the Kobalt Mechanics Tools 500 will be held Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The drivers who will qualify tonight in their open-wheelers are  
reluctant to make such a drastic change. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, open-wheel cars are the pinnacle of racing,'' said  
Kenny Brack, winner of the Indianapolis 500 and defending IRL 
champion. ``You've got to be very accurate at all times. They 
respond to the slightest mistake you make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Mehl, the IRL's executive director, said he plans to meet  
with Smith this weekend to discuss the fender proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bruton is a great promoter and he's always trying to  
think of ways to make the sport better,'' Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehl and others have concerns about whether fenders would  
actually make the sport safer. While they might help contain the 
tires and suspension systems that break off in crashes, they 
wouldn't be as secure as the wall of metal that surrounds the tires 
on a NASCAR Winston Cup car. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think putting a piece of fiberglass around the tire is  
going to stop all debris?'' Brack asked. ``I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IRL already has taken steps to improve safety on high-banked  
tracks like Atlanta and Charlotte, which were originally designed 
for the slower Winston Cup cars. 
</P>
<P>
	A wheel-tether system -- designed to keep tires from flying loose  
from the car -- was implemented after the tragedy in North Carolina. 
High-banked tracks have raised the height of catch-fences in front 
of the grandstands. New engine regulations have drastically reduced 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Billy Boat, Brack's teammate with A.J. Foyt  
Motorsports, won the pole for the league's inaugural Atlanta race 
at more than 224 mph. During Thursday's opening practice session, 
the fastest laps were around 216 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can never do too much,'' Brack said. ``But we've already  
done a lot since Charlotte. We're going in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prototype developed by Smith's organization -- with fenders  
covering all four wheels -- looks similar to a Le Mans-type 
endurance car. Mehl said such a car would undoubtedly increase 
speeds in IRL, since the exposed tires of an open-wheel car account 
for 40 percent of the aerodynamic drag. 
</P>
<P>
	More troubling, sports cars have shown a tendency to lift off  
the track. During the 24 Hours of Le Mans last month, a car flew 60 
feet into the air and flipped five times. Fortunately, the wreck 
occurred on a road course, far away from any fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an accident could be disastrous at a facility like Atlanta,  
where massive grandstands are located right next to the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're going after safety, that's the wrong approach,''  
Boat said. ``A lot of aerodynamic issues become more of a factor 
when you put a body on something that's going 220 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR racing is the main source of income for Smith's tracks in  
Atlanta, North Carolina, Texas and Las Vegas, so he's reluctant to 
continue playing host to IRL events if there are concerns for fan 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also is intrigued by the economic possibilities. Fenders  
would allow more distinctive color schemes and provide additional 
room for advertising -- no small consideration in a sport driven by 
corporate cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem we have is identifying the drivers and the  
cars for the fans,'' said Sam Schmidt, who drives for Treadway 
Racing. ``If there's more space on the car, there's more room for a 
Rainbow Warrior paint scheme (the colors of NASCAR star Jeff 
Gordon) and on and on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But safety will be the deciding factor in the debate over  
fenders. 
</P>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second straight year, concussions are  
ending the career of a New York Rangers player. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, center Pat LaFontaine retired because of repeated  
hits to the head. Now, defenseman Jeff Beukeboom will join him on 
the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom, 34, suffered three concussions last season, the final  
one on Feb. 12 against Carolina. He did not play after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that is most glaring, the thing that makes it easy  
is that the Feb. 12 knock was quite slight, something you see most 
every night in the NHL,'' Beukeboom said Thursday. ``The last 
incident was an eye opener. Players get hit like that, 99 percent 
are fine. I'm part of the 1 percent that are not fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom said his concussion symptoms have not subsided the  
last five months. He said he continues to experience headaches and 
loss of concentration in conversations. He has been unable to work 
out or do anything physical since the February injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom said he absorbed a number of other concussions during  
his 13-year career. ``You get knocked a little silly,'' he said. 
``You see stars, maybe five or 10 times. It's hard to document 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom was first injured at Los Angeles on Nov. 19, when he  
was hit by Matt Johnson. He said he talked with Johnson about the 
hit at an NHL Players Association meeting in Quebec last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not one to hold grudges,'' the defenseman said. ``I don't  
look back. I like to look forward. He felt really bad. He 
apologized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom said doctors warned that he might not be able to play  
again. ``The way I play, there's a high percentage of another 
concussion,'' Beukeboom said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that quarterback Chris Miller, who retired from  
football because of a series of concussions, plans to make a 
comeback next season with the Denver Broncos. ``I don't plan on 
coming back to test any theories to help the medical community,'' 
Beukeboom said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never an easy decision to walk away, but it's easier to  
walk away because of medical problems. Everything in the game comes 
to your health. My body is healthy. My mind is not healthy right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom played on four Stanley Cup championship teams, three  
with Edmonton and one with New York. In 804 NHL games, he scored 30 
goals with 129 assists and had 1,890 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	While losing Beukeboom, the Rangers at the same time continued  
their free-agent signing blitz Thursday, agreeing to terms with 
center Tim Taylor on a four-year $5.8 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who missed the NHL playoffs the last two seasons,  
have signed five free agents in the last month at a cost of $59.9 
million, including forwards Theo Fleury and Valeri Kamensky, 
defenseman Stephane Quintal and goalie Kirk McLean. 
</P>
<P>
	In other NHL developments, the Detroit Red Wings signed  
free-agent goalie Manny Legace to a multiyear contract. The move 
came less than a week after signing free-agent goalie Ken Wregget 
as a backup to Chris Osgood. 
</P>
<P>
	Legace, 26, played in 17 games with the Los Angeles Kings last  
season, posting a 2-9-2 record with a 2.60 goals-against-average 
and a .911 save percentage. He spent the last four seasons in the 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
	In another deal, the Thrashers acquired right wing Martin  
Prochazka from the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for a 
sixth-round draft pick in the 2001 NHL entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said the club also signed  
Karlsson, whose rights were acquired in a trade with the Calgary 
Flames following this year's NHL expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs announced the signing of forward Jason  
Bonsignore, a former first-round draft pick, and forward Vladimir 
Antipov, who spent the last three seasons in the Russian Hockey 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edmonton Oilers said that former forward Craig MacTavish  
will return to the NHL club as an assistant coach under head coach 
Kevin Lowe. MacTavish spent the last two years as an assistant 
coach with the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Atlanta Thrashers announced a pair of trades and  
agreed to terms with Swedish center Andreas Karlsson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers, who appointed Curt Fraser as coach on Wednesday  
and will make their NHL debut in the fall, acquired left wing Jason 
Botterill from the Dallas Stars in exchange for defenseman Jamie 
Pushor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carolina Hurricanes announced they signed center Josef  
Vasicek, a fourth-round pick in the 1998 entry draft.

<HEADLINE> Backstroke Champ Wins at Evans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lenny Krayzelburg, a two-time world champion,  
easily won the 200-meter backstroke Friday at the sixth annual 
Janet Evans Invitational held at the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg, a graduate of USC, holds the American record in the  
event. His time of 1:57.68 was less than a second off his U.S. 
mark, but better than his meet record of 1:59.82 set in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Peirsol, 15, finished second at 2:01.90. In a previous  
match, Peirsol became the youngest person to swim the event in 
under two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian national champion Leonardo Costa, who also swims for  
USC, finished third at 2:01.91 and Brad Bridgewater, who won the 
1996 Olympic gold medal in the event, finished fourth at 2:02.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryk Neethling of South Africa won his second event of the meet  
by taking the men's 400-meter freestyle in 3:52.62. Neethling set 
his second meet record with the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Thompson of Stanford, an Olympic gold medal winner, won  
the 100-meter freestyle in a meet-record time of 55.51 seconds. She 
easily beat second-place finisher Ashley Tappin of Irvine who 
touched at 57.04. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good about the race,'' Thompson said. ``I was  
working on my stroke, which went well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this meet. It's an important meet because it's the last  
before nationals and it's a good opportunity to race hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The invitational has drawn more than 700 competitors for the  
four-day event.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Investigate Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is  
conducting a utility industry-wide investigation into suspicions 
that coal-burning power plants are emitting much more pollution 
than they are permitted under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary findings suggest a pattern of violations of the 1990  
Clean Air Act by operators of many of the country's biggest and 
dirtiest coal-burning plants, Clinton administration officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Congress exempted more than 100 of the largest coal  
burning power plants from new, stringent pollution controls with 
the understanding that many of these plants would be phased out 
over time. 
</P>
<P>
	The law also requires that the plants not be retrofitted or  
expanded to produce more electricity unless they get permits 
requiring upgraded pollution control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to officials, a six-month preliminary investigation by  
the EPA has found evidence that utilities have made substantial 
capital improvements to many of the plants including additional 
turbines and new distribution pipes to produce more electricity -- 
and more pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Such improvements without a permit violates the 1990 law if they  
result in additional pollution, Clinton administration officials 
said Thursday. The officials all spoke on condition of not being 
identified further. 
</P>
<P>
	An official familiar with the investigation said authorities  
suspect a large number of coal-power utilities have profited -- some 
for four of five years -- by producing additional electricity 
without having to install expensive new pollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases additional electricity generation at a plant has  
caused smokestack releases of smog-causing nitrogen oxide to 
increase as much as 1,000 tons a year, officials said. A pollution 
increase of 40 tons in many cases is enough to trigger the 
requirement for new pollution controls, officials said. The release 
of 1,000 tons of nitrogen oxide is equivalent to pollution from 
150,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We suspect this is a widespread pattern of coal-powered  
utilities profiting by polluting the air beyond the legal limits,'' 
said one officials. ``They have done things (to the plants) far 
beyond routine maintenance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry spokesmen acknowledged that the EPA for some time has  
been discussing a potential enforcement action involving emissions 
from coal-fire power plants. Some utilities have provided the EPA 
with large amounts of data on electricity generation, smokestack 
releases and power plant maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not been advised of any specific allegations,'' said  
Pat Hemlepp, a spokesman for the American Electric Power Co., one 
of the largest operators of coal-burning power plants, largely in 
the Ohio Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddy Eller, a spokesman for Southern Co., another major owner  
of coal-burning plants, said he could only confirm that discussions 
were taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA investigation, although industry-wide, is focusing on  
more than 100 coal-burning power plants -- many of them in the 
Midwest and Ohio Valley -- that were allowed to continue operating 
under the 1990 Clean Air Act under the ``grandfather'' clause that 
allowed them to avoid installation of modern pollution controls 
required on newer plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, utilities operating the ``grandfathered'' plants  
must obtain new permits, requiring additional pollution controls, 
if they expand the power plants beyond what they were in 1990. The 
EPA investigators so far have found little evidence of permits 
being sought or issued, the federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 largest coal-burning electric power plants produce nearly  
4.5 million tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide a year with three 
companies -- American Electric Power, Southern and the Tennessee 
Valley Authority -- accounting for about 1.3 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity generation accounts for 29 percent of nitrogen oxide  
emissions. The rest comes from transportation and to a lesser 
extent industrial sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Two environmental groups released a study this week that showed  
electricity generation from coal-burning plants had increased 16 
percent between 1992 and 1997, resulting in an additional 755,000 
tons of nitrogen oxide emissions annually. The groups used EPA and 
Energy Department figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings back up what we've been saying for the last  
couple of years: The old plants are not living up to modern 
pollution standards,'' said Rebecca Stanfield of U.S.PIRG, one of 
the authors of the study.

<HEADLINE>  A's-Giants Series Gets Some Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- As teammates surged toward home plate to  
celebrate his game-winning homer, Olmedo Saenz blew a kiss toward 
the box seats above the Athletics' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-run shot with two outs in the bottom of the ninth made  
an instant hero of the career minor leaguer. And it just might have 
pumped a large dose of drama into the usually passionless cross-bay 
rivalry between Oakland and the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	But to Saenz, the triumph was much more personal.  
</P>
<P>
	In the box seats were his wife, young son and mother-in-law.  
Until last weekend, they were home in Panama and had not seen Saenz 
since spring training. They were attending their first game in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was for them. It's a great feeling,'' said Saenz, who hit  
his fourth major league homer. ``Doing it in front of them was 
special. I saw them in the stands jumping around. I think I'm never 
going to feel something like this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old third baseman spent the past eight seasons in  
the minors. He got into five games for the Chicago White Sox in 
1994, but otherwise shuttled among places such as South Bend and 
Calgary. This season, he has split time at third with fellow A's 
rookie Eric Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the minor leagues a long time, but I never quit  
dreaming,'' he said. ``Dreaming is a very important part of 
baseball. I don't think there's anything wrong with dreaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saenz's homer ended a wild game in which the Giants blew leads  
of 4-0 and 9-4. The A's scored four in the seventh to pull within 
9-8, and then Saenz won the game against Robb Nen. 
</P>
<P>
	Nen, bothered by a sore elbow, was pitching for the first time  
in 13 days. It was his fifth blown save in 26 chances this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``A tough night. I made bad pitches and it cost me,'' Nen said.  
``My concern is throwing strikes and getting people out. I didn't 
do that. My velocity is there. But I've still got to make pitches 
and I didn't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game featured 10 pitchers, three hit batters, 22 hits, 11  
walks and five three-run homers. Jason Giambi and John Jaha also 
hit three-run shots for the A's, while Rich Aurilia and J.T. Snow 
had three-run homers for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The A's had the long ball going on. They kept chipping away at  
us,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``There's not much to say. 
It was one of those that got away from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saenz's homer deprived Giants starter Shawn Estes of a win and  
was just the fourth time in 49 games this season that San Francisco 
had blown a ninth-inning lead and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put ourselves in a position to win and they got lucky and  
beat us. We had a big lead and blew it. We scored nine runs and 
couldn't win,'' Estes said. ``If we score nine tomorrow, I bet we 
win. Give Robb the ball tomorrow and he gets guys out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 29,428 -- nearly double the average attendance for  
an A's home game this season but still more than 14,000 short of 
capacity at the 43,662-seat Oakland Coliseum -- included a large 
number of Giants fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants-A's matchups have lacked passion during the past three  
years of interleague play, mostly because the A's have been awful 
during most of that span. But Oakland now has the best home record 
in the majors at 27-15 and is challenging in the AL West. The 
Giants lead the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Thursday night's game, which evened the regular-season  
series between San Francisco and Oakland at six games apiece, can 
create more spice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big win. I think it's a rivalry already,'' said  
Oakland's Tony Phillips, who was with the A's when they swept the 
Giants in the earthquake-interrupted 1989 World Series. ``I know 
I'm taking it personally.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Attacks Media in Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALAMANCA, N.Y. (AP) -- Linking news coverage to copycat killings  
and recent school shootings, a judge Friday refused to release a 
hearing transcript from a racially charged murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	Penny Lockwood Brown, a 39-year-old white woman, was raped and  
murdered as she jogged in a park on Mother's Day. Sixteen-year-old 
Edward Kindt, an American Indian, has been charged with the attack 
on the mother of two. 
</P>
<P>
	In his order, City Court Judge William Mountain III said making  
the transcript of a May 17 preliminary hearing public could taint 
the jury pool. 
</P>
<P>
	He also derided the media, suggesting the reporting of ``grisly  
details'' might have helped trigger crimes such as the school 
shootings in Jonesboro, Ark., and Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The norm in this day and age seems to be the news media  
circling like vultures, each hoping to be the first to feast on the 
gory details of a story such as this,'' Mountain wrote. ``Perhaps 
if the media were to refrain from dwelling on this carrion, we 
would have fewer 'copy-cat killers.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He continued, ``Perhaps, we would also be spared the attempts of  
disturbed children to attain their 15 minutes of fame by murdering 
their peers ... if the public were not endlessly bombarded by 
pictures and grisly details of prior senseless tragedies of the 
same ilk by the news media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Records in the case, including a statement allegedly made by  
Kindt to police, were sealed when the preliminary hearing was 
closed at the request of Kindt's attorney, Fern Adelstein, and 
District Attorney Edward Sharkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The order to close the hearing was challenged by The Associated  
Press, The Buffalo News and the Salamanca Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Finnerty, an attorney representing the media, said the  
rights of all parties could be balanced without exclusion of the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public's and press' right of access to judicial  
proceedings under the First Amendment and this defendant's Sixth 
Amendment rights to a fair trial can be balanced and accommodated 
in less restrictive ways,'' Finnerty said. ``Everyone involved in 
the proceedings is concerned with integrity of the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said an appeal would be considered.  
</P>
<P>
	The case has heightened racial tensions in Salamanca because  
much of town lies within the territory of the Seneca Nation of 
Indians, and residents pay the Senecas to live there. 
</P>
<P>
	Lease negotiations that wrapped up two years ago led to heated  
protests and evictions of some white residents who refused to sign 
the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Racer Fittpaldi Overcomes Adversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- For a driver who is just 28 years old, Christian  
Fittipaldi has fought his way through a lot of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into Sunday's Toronto Molson Indy, Fittipaldi can  
finally say he is a winner in the CART FedEx Series after a victory 
at Road America on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The young Brazilian won a European Formula 3000 title in 1991  
and stepped up to Formula One the next season, ready to follow in 
the footsteps of his uncle, two-time world champion Emerson 
Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian, the son of Wilson Fittipaldi, another Formula One  
driver, was 21 years old and had all the confidence in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But driving for Minardi, a middle-of-the-pack team, Fittipaldi  
struggled to finish races. Then he crashed hard during practice for 
the French Grand Prix, injuring his back badly enough that his 
career appeared in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngster with the movie star looks got back, though,  
driving the Minardi car by the end of the season while in pain and 
still finishing well off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	His Formula One struggles continued with Minardi for another  
season, and then with Arrows before he came to CART with Walker 
Racing in 1995 and just missed out on rookie of the year honors -- 
losing it to Gil de Ferran on the last day of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittipaldi moved to Newman-Haas Racing in 1996 and looked  
continually on the verge of his first win, but it just wouldn't 
come. Something always seemed to happen -- like a blown engine at 
Detroit as he battled Michael Andretti for the win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was driving every lap like it was a qualifying lap,''  
Fittipaldi said. ``I'm a little wiser now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His career took another detour in 1997 when he broke his leg in  
the season-opener in Australia after getting knocked into a wall at 
170 mph by de Ferran. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors put a rod and screws into the leg and he was out of the  
car for more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	The frustration continued after Fittipaldi returned to the  
cockpit. In June 1998, he backed the car into a wall in Milwaukee 
and came away with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when he was completely healthy, Fittipaldi couldn't break  
through for a victory -- until last Sunday at Road America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like I had a tremendous weight lifted off my  
shoulders,'' Fittipaldi said. ``I knew all along I could win, but 
after so many bad things you begin to wonder if it will ever really 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, his teammate and the Road America runner-up, said, ``I  
wouldn't be surprised to see him win a lot more races now. 
Sometimes, getting that first one just seems to unlock the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Carl Haas, co-owner of the team along with actor Paul  
Newman, it was an emotional victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always had faith in Christian,'' Haas said. ``I knew he  
could win. He has more talent than people give him credit for. He 
has been on the verge all season and I am just so happy for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fittipaldi and the rest of the CART drivers got started Friday  
with practice and provisional qualifying on the 1.721-mile 
temporary road circuit at the edge of downtown Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Although rookie Juan Montoya fell out of last Sunday's race with  
a broken gearbox, the 23-year-old Colombian still leads Andretti by 
18 points, 113-95, at the halfway mark of the CART season. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Montoya, other non-finishers at Road America included  
Gil de Ferran and Dario Franchitti. That considerably tightened the 
points battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Second to seventh is now separated by only 16 points. De Ferran  
is third with 87, followed by Franchitti with 85, Road America 
winner Christian Fittipaldi with 82, Greg Moore with 81 and Adrian 
Fernandez with 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Each race has a maximum of 22 points, with one awarded for a  
pole, 20 for winning a race and one for leading the most laps.

<HEADLINE> MLS All-Stars Ready for Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Graphic    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Western Conference coach Glenn Myernick has the  
right attitude for the Major League Soccer All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Play hard. Have fun. Not necessarily in that order.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the true tradition of what the All-Star game is all about,  
I talked to my team this morning and said: `Please follow my 
philosophy as your leader. I will have two Coronas,''' Myernick 
said Friday afternoon, not long after leading his team through its 
one and only practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game atmosphere will be vastly different than the  
last big soccer match in Southern California, when the U.S. women 
battled China through 120 tense, scoreless minutes before winning 
the World Cup title on Brandi Chastain's penalty kick a week ago at 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	It's practically guaranteed there won't be a 0-0 tie at Qualcomm  
Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled Zach Thornton and Matt Jordan, our goalkeepers, aside  
this morning and offered them two very philosophical words of 
coaching wisdom, and they were: `Be Brave.' I'm sure it's going to 
be a very entertaining game,'' said Myernick, who coaches the 
Colorado Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's format featured American stars against their  
international counterparts, and the Americans, coming off a 
disappointing World Cup showing, saved some face with a 6-1 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, it's back to East versus West. What probably won't  
change is the amount of scoring. The first three All-Star games 
averaged seven goals. By comparison, the league average last 
regular season was 3.56, and this year it's closer to 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it, this is fun,'' said Colorado defender Marcelo  
Balboa, a starter for the West. ``This is for the fans. We're going 
to go out and we're going to have a good time. You'll see us 
playing defense, there's no doubt. Nobody wants to lose. But are 
you going to see it like you see in the MLS? No chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a chance that Kansas City defender Alexi Lalas  
will go forward. ``We might even send Zach forward on a corner 
kick, you know, just for the heck of it,'' Balboa said. ``The 
people come to see from the midfielders forward do all their 
things. And we run around chasing everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Lalas: ``I was chosen as a starting defender, and I'm real  
proud of that but that's in name only. I'm going forward. I am 
going full-on forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The East is dominated by seven D.C. United players, six voted to  
start plus midfielder Richie Williams, who replaced injured Tab 
Ramos of the New York-New Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	The other D.C. United starters are midfielder Marco Etcheverry,  
the league's 1998 MVP; Tom Presthus in goal; defenders Eddie Pope 
and Jeff Agoos; midfielder Ben Olsen and forward Roy Lassiter. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been some grumbling about the presence of so many  
players from D.C. United, which has played in all three MLS 
championship games, winning the first two. Three reserves are from 
D.C. United, and its coach, Thomas Rongen, will lead the East. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three finalists, two champions. It speaks for itself,''  
Etcheverry said. ``It's not because of luck. There's a lot of merit 
involved in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five members of the defending MLS champion Chicago Fire were  
selected to the Western Conference team. They are Thornton, forward 
Roman Kosecki, midfielders Chris Armas and Peter Nowak, and 
defender Lubos Kubik. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game will be followed by an exhibition between  
Chivas of Mexico and Universidad Catolica of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second straight All-Star game to be played in a  
non-MLS city. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS wants to have a team in San Diego by 2002, the year the  
Padres are scheduled to vacate Qualcomm for a downtown ballpark. 
However, the league is interested in perhaps finding another site 
to play because crowds would be swallowed up in the 70,000-seat 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS officials said they'd be happy if they sold 30,000 tickets.  
By late in the week, they'd sold about 22,000.

<HEADLINE> Students Must Retake Lost SATs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- Federal Express is trying to figure out  
how to compensate 695 high school students after losing their 
college entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
	But the teen-agers say nothing the courier does will compensate  
them for the time they invested in preparing for the Scholastic 
Assessment Test. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really leave me no option,'' Jessica Fleming, a  
17-year-old Torrance High School junior, said of having to retake 
the test. ``Everybody has to have the SAT for colleges and stuff. I 
have to take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and other students from schools in Torrance and neighboring  
Gardena took the test on June 5. But all the SATs disappeared 
between the Gardena High School test site and the New Jersey 
headquarters of the Educational Testing Service, which conducts and 
scores the tests nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica's mother, Anita Fleming, said her daughter received mail  
this week from ETS and mistakenly believed it was her test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``She read the letter, then read the letter again,'' Anita  
Fleming said. ``She said, `Mom, there's no score.' ... Things were 
coming out of my daughter's mouth I didn't think she knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Boyd, spokeswoman for Federal Express, said a test  
administrator brought in the package of SATs to a local depot ``but 
that's the last anyone has seen of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ETS has scheduled July 24 and Aug. 7 for students to retake the  
test for free. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was to the point where I thought I was all done and it was  
taken care of. Now it's just thrown back in my face,'' Jessica 
said.

<HEADLINE> Davis Cup Fans Bear Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Marjorie Marshall came all the way from  
England for the Davis Cup but spent most of a steamy Friday unable 
to see the matches from the shady spot she'd chosen under the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in my seat but not for long,'' the 67-year-old tennis  
fan said as the crowd cheered a point. ``I'd rather hear what's 
going on than risk getting ill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanna Emert, a trumpet player from Nashville, Tenn., delivered  
bottles of water to other members of the Harvard band that played 
occasionally while spending the day in the stands with the sun 
bearing down on them. It could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our usual uniform is black pants, black shoes, white shirt,  
black tie and a wool jacket,'' she said. ``So this is a little bit 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the temperature on the Longwood Cricket Club court  
was reported at 126 degrees. That took a toll on the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, just 18 years old, handled it  
better than 29-year-old Todd Martin of the United States and won 
the first match of the best-of-five quarterfinals 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Todd was starting to get a little bit tired'' in the  
third set, Hewitt said. ``That was the most positive thing I could 
take out of it; that whatever I am feeling, I am sure he is feeling 
a lot worse than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin played singles because Pete Sampras, a late addition to  
the team, didn't want to bump him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty hot,'' Martin said. ``The first set I felt  
lousy. I was definitely a little shocked by the weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature cooled a bit for the second match. The result  
though, was similar as Australia won again with Patrick Rafter 
beating Jim Courier 7-6, 6-4, 6-4. A win in Saturday's doubles 
match would clinch a semifinal spot for Australia even before 
Sunday's two singles matches. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sampras watched part of the first match from courtside  
with a wet towel over his head, Rafter chose to watch from the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to come out and watch,'' Rafter said. ``It was  
too damn hot out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some spectators waved small yellow fans to stir up a breeze. But  
at least 20 people were treated by medical personnel, mostly for 
heat-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighter Joe Hingston of the Brookline Fire Department,  
working in a medical tent, put a positive spin on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're actually thankful we haven't had any heart attacks or  
strokes because there are a lot of older people here,'' Hingston 
said. ``We're actually glad that the refreshment stands are spread 
out as they are because the availability of fluids is greater and 
the problems are less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of those stands, Bob MacDonald was doing a brisk business  
selling iced tea, soft drinks, beer and water. He had little time 
to comment as he passed out beverages and took in money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have to make it quick. I'm pretty busy,'' he said.  
``Water is a big seller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall, the fan from Lanbourn, England, enjoyed the atmosphere  
of the event but was looking forward to returning to the Rhode 
Island home where she was staying with family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to get back and swim in the pool,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Future of Milwaukee Stadium Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wendy Selig-Prieb hoped her first season as  
president of the Milwaukee Brewers would be marked by wins and a 
successful move to Miller Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the deaths of three stadium workers in a massive  
construction accident have cast a pall on the season and put the 
immediate future of the Brewers in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been through anything like this in my life,''  
Selig-Prieb said. ``The only thing we know for sure is that Miller 
Park will be built, it will have a retractable roof and it will be 
second to none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller Park was the dream of baseball commissioner Bud Selig,  
Selig-Prieb's father and the Brewers' former majority owner. He 
visited the building site almost daily, and on Thursday at the 
opening of Seattle's Safeco Field, he wept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind telling anybody it is about as painful an  
experience as I have ever gone through in my life. Very sad. Very 
emotional,'' he said in his speech before the first game in the 
Mariners' new field. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I'm very glad to be here tonight for a lot of reasons,  
you will understand my heart is still in Milwaukee,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody knew those workers, it was my father,'' Selig-Prieb  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The retractable-roof stadium was only months from completion  
before a giant crane collapsed while lifting a piece of the roof 
Wednesday, crushing another crane and landing heavily on the 
first-base side of the stadium structure. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite several hundred tons of smashed, mangled evidence to  
the contrary, the team insists its plans to open next April in 
Miller Park have not yet been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers' baseball palace looked more like a war zone  
Thursday as team officials joined investigators in a tour of the 
site. Later in the day, however, officials said the damage did not 
appear to be as extensive as previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea as to whether there will be a delay or not,''  
vice president of corporate affairs Laurel Prieb said. ``We could 
just as likely be opening on time as not opening on time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prieb said the team is playing ``a very secondary role in what  
is going on'' in the investigation of the causes and consequences 
of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the main concerns in finishing the project on  
time are finding suitable replacements for the crane and for the 
roof pieces, which are made with a type of steel manufactured only 
in Luxembourg. Those decisions won't be made for several days, 
stadium board officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee canceled Thursday's game against the Kansas City  
Royals and announced the teams would play a doubleheader today. 
Both teams held closed workouts under sunny skies at County Stadium 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers also plan to wear a memorial patch featuring the  
logo of the iron workers' local union. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said the County Stadium bleachers -- the section of the  
old park closest to the accident -- will be closed until the 
investigation is completed. Fans with tickets for the bleachers 
will be given different seats for their game or another. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a family in the Brewers organization and in the  
Milwaukee community,'' Brewers outfielder Jeromy Burnitz said. 
``The workers at Miller Park are a part of our family, and this 
loss has affected us all very deeply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials stressed that despite the catastrophe that occurred  
only feet away, County Stadium is completely safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is still a dangerous area for when they start picking  
things up, but it won't affect the activity in the other 
ballpark,'' Fire Chief Larry Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, the team has planned its marketing and  
publicity agendas around Miller Park's existence. The team's slogan 
for the current season is ``Bringing Down the House,'' and County 
Stadium was scheduled for demolition this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the team faces the prospect of remaining in County Stadium  
in 2000 and even beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Any delay in opening the park would deprive the Brewers of  
millions of dollars in revenue. Prieb refused to say whether any 
lost funds would seriously hurt the Brewers' finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for the Brewers, the Miller Park project is  
thoroughly insured, members of the stadium's board of directors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project has $325 million in property insurance and $70  
million in liability insurance, with a minuscule deductible of 
$25,000, board member Bill Duckett said. The policy also contains a 
rider covering actual lost income sustained by the Brewers if the 
stadium doesn't open on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance also helps protect the public from footing the  
bill for any additional work. Residents in five counties 
surrounding the stadium have paid a one-tenth of 1 percent stadium 
sales tax to help fund the project since 1996. A recent audit 
concluded the tax must remain in effect until 2014. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers haven't ventured a guess on a cleanup schedule, but  
a local demolition contractor said the process could be completed 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on a real compressed schedule (of two eight-hour  
shifts, seven days a week), the demolition team could remove the 
debris and do the demolition work in 30 days,'' said David M. 
Ahern, president of Barrett of Wisconsin Inc.

<HEADLINE> NFL Suspends Rams Linebacker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leonard Little, the St. Louis Rams linebacker  
who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the drunk-driving 
wreck that killed a woman, was suspended without pay Friday by the 
NFL for the first eight games of the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the NFL said the suspension was based on  
Little's violation of the league's substance-abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Little faces 90 days of jail time over the next year as part of  
his plea agreement in the death of Susan Gutweiler, 47, of 
Oakville, Mo., last October. Little drove his sports utility 
vehicle through a red light and struck the woman's car. She died a 
short time later. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Little, 24, got drunk on his birthday at a charity  
function attended by several Rams players at a downtown hotel bar 
before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plea agreement, Little will be able to attend  
informal workouts and training with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the jail time, Little must serve four years  
probation, submit to drug and alcohol testing, perform 1,000 hours 
of community service and work with Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
	In its statement, the NFL detailed the case, adding that  
``players are subject to discipline by the commissioner for 
alcohol-related violations of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension runs through the game of Nov. 7. He will be  
allowed to work out with the team and take part in exhibition 
games.

<HEADLINE> Mini Circuits May Speed Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Researchers have developed a chemical  
process that could lead to computer components no thicker than a 
single molecule, an important step toward the creation of new, 
ultrafast machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The team from the Hewlett-Packard Co. and the University of  
California at Los Angeles say their work could ultimately lead to 
computers 100 billion times faster than today's most powerful 
personal computers. Their findings were published today in Science 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, integrated circuits -- the on-off switches that are  
the basis for computing -- have been made by etching silicon wafers 
with beams of light. The ability to shrink those circuits is 
limited by the wavelength of light. 
</P>
<P>
	But the researchers said they found a way to construct the  
circuits using a chemical process, making the switches as small as 
a molecule. They believe the process could lead to components much 
smaller than today's smallest transistors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about as small as we're going to get things,'' Phil  
Kuekes, a physicist and computer designer at Hewlett-Packard, said 
today in a phone interview from the computer giant's headquarters 
in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller transistors consume less power and generally switch on  
and off more quickly. They also can be produced in greater 
quantities without raising production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although still a long way off, researches say the possible  
applications are endless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine millions of tiny computers everywhere in our lives.  
Tiny probes in the body, monitoring body functions -- perhaps a very 
sophisticated pace maker,'' said Eric Wong, a UCLA researcher 
involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The research team used chemicals to coax molecules with the  
necessary electrical characteristics into specific positions, much 
like getting puzzle pieces into the right positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said their findings are only a first step. For  
example, the current device can switch only from one state to 
another and cannot switch repeatedly, which it must do if it is to 
replace silicon-based chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, computer researchers lauded the advance, calling it a  
sign of the rapid acceleration of a new field known as moletronics 
or molecular electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology might eventually replicate the power of 100  
computer work stations in a space the size of a grain of salt, 
according to the scientists on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here for the first time is a molecular device  
that is a real technology -- not just an isolated device,'' said 
James R. Heath, professor of chemistry at UCLA, who led the team. 
``This is a real step toward making a molecular computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technology also is promising as a means of prolonging the  
electronics boom. As advances in silicon chip technology approach 
its physical limit -- expected within 15 years -- molecular 
electronics could continue the steady rise in computing power.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Man Kills Girlfriend, Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- When Jose Marin tucked his little daughter  
into bed, he told her that when she awoke, ``Mommy and Daddy won't 
be here.'' The next morning, his girlfriend was found stabbed to 
death and he committed suicide by setting himself on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Five-year-old Alejandra Marin discovered her mother's body  
beneath a quilt in their one-room apartment Thursday morning, said 
Detective Sgt. Daniel Severin. The mother, Iris Fernandez, 35, had 
been stabbed in the chest and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Alejandra had gone upstairs to a neighbor's apartment when she  
woke, as her father instructed her to do the night before. The 
neighbor came back downstairs with her and the two found the body, 
according to Severin. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe Ms. Fernandez's boyfriend, 47-year-old Jose  
Marin, killed her before dousing himself with a flammable liquid 
and igniting it with a lighter, Severin said. A Long Island Rail 
Road engineer spotted him, in flames, running across the tracks 
just after 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not know why Marin, who worked in an auto store,  
killed Ms. Fernandez and himself. The couple, immigrants from 
Colombia, moved to their apartment after a house they were renting 
was destroyed by fire a year and a half ago. Police had no record 
of domestic violence calls at the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Temporarily, Alejandra will probably live with an aunt.  
</P>
<P>
	According to Severin, the little girl told police that as her  
father tucked her into bed Wednesday night, he said: ``When you 
wake up in the morning, Mommy and Daddy won't be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told her to go upstairs to a neighbor's apartment when she  
woke. 
</P>
<P>
	``This young girl's life has come to an end as she knows it,''  
Severin said.

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Fatal Flea Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a story about the dangers to pets of  
certain flea control products, The Associated Press reported 
erroneously on July 15 that flea powders could be fatal to cats. 
Flea powders are not fatal to cats, but some liquid flea products 
that are marketed for dogs only and contain concentrated levels of 
a common chemical, permethrin, can be fatal to cats, according the 
U.S. Pharmacopeia Veterinary Practitioners' Reporting Program, 
which was cited in the AP story.

<HEADLINE> Working Mom Wins Custody Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A working mother who lost her two daughters to  
their stay-at-home father in a custody case that drew national 
attention has regained custody of the children in an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	A 7-3 ruling in the 3rd District Court of Appeal this week  
returned the couple's children to Alice Hector, a 54-year-old 
lawyer. Judges reinstated an original trial judge's 1996 decision 
that was based in part on the fact that Robert Young, Hector's 
ex-husband, was unemployed at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lawyer for Young said the original court ruling did not  
adequately apply Florida's 1993 ``gender-neutral'' law granting 
custody to the proven caretaker -- not always the mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``A woman would never be asked `Why don't you have a job?'''  
said the lawyer, Ellen Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	Young successfully argued in an appeal last year that he was the  
primary caregiver and it would be in the children's best interest 
to remain with him because he stayed at home while Ms. Hector 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the girls, now aged 14 and 11, never should have been  
removed from their mother's custody and turned over to Young, the 
judges said in a ruling Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said there was enough evidence presented to the judge  
who handled the couple's divorce to support giving primary custody 
to Ms. Hector. A message left Thursday for Ms. Hector was not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Young and Ms. Hector were married in 1982 in Albuquerque, N.M.,  
where she worked as a public defender and he was an architect. She 
landed a job at a law firm in Miami and moved here in 1989 with the 
children. Young followed six months later but couldn't find work. 
</P>
<P>
	As a stay-at-home father, Young led a Brownie troop for one of  
his daughters, coached the other's soccer team and took both to 
doctor and dentist appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hector, who later joined a large firm, did what she saw as  
her fair share: woke the children up in the morning, helped with 
homework and spent time with them on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	She filed for divorce in 1995 and was given primary custody a  
year later. Young was to have frequent contact with the girls, and 
within five years they were to move in with him for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who got a full-time job early in 1997, fought the custody  
ruling and in June 1998 won a decision by three members of the 
appeals court. Ms. Hector's lawyers asked for another hearing, 
resulting in the latest ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had advocates of working mothers and supporters of  
fathers' rights questioning whether a working mother must choose 
between career and children if she wants to maintain primary 
custody, or if a father has the same nurturing ability as a mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision is a tremendous victory for working mothers as  
well as working fathers,'' said Nancy Chang, an attorney with the 
Center for Constitutional Rights in New York. ``The parents ought 
not (to) be penalized when ... pursuing a career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sidney Siller, founder of the National Organization for Men in  
New York, said: ``You can't rule against a woman in this country, 
that's what it's come down to.''

<HEADLINE> Mini Circuits May Speed Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Researchers have created computer circuitry  
in a single molecule -- a breakthrough that could open a brave new 
world of tiny computers billions of times more powerful than 
current PCs and sensors that could be injected into the bloodstream 
to diagnose disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are proposing is essentially building a computer in a  
test tube,'' said Phil Kuekes, a computer architect for 
Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto. ``Eventually computers are going to 
be so small you won't be aware of them. The computer won't just be 
in your wristwatch -- it will be in the fibers of your clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Hewlett-Packard and the University of California  
at Los Angeles, in a paper published Friday in the journal Science, 
reported early success in combining computer technology with 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	They have found a way to make part of a molecule operate like a  
switch that can be turned on or off -- the first step in basic 
computing. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, computers are run by semiconductor silicon chips that  
are increasingly jammed with transistors to make them faster and 
more powerful. Within about 15 years, scientists say, it simply 
won't be possible to push such chips any further. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where ``chemically assembled electronic nanocomputers,''  
or CAENs, come in. Scientists say such molecular-based computers 
will be much smaller, much more powerful and a lot less expensive 
than silicon-based counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers created their switch using two regular wires and  
synthetic molecules. For now, however, the device can switch only 
from one state to another and cannot switch repeatedly, which it 
must do if it is to replace silicon-based chips. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here for the first time is a molecular device  
that is a real technology -- not just an isolated device,'' said 
UCLA chemistry professor James R. Heath, who led the team. ``This 
is a real step toward making a molecular computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is for scientists to put the molecules between  
much smaller wires, and create a device that can perform basic 
computer functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to build something as complex as a chip you could  
have bought in the 1970s,'' Kuekes said. ``It will be very simple, 
but the point is it will have a real legitimate function, in a 
space much smaller than anyone can make a transistor now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although substantial molecular electronics are still a decade  
away, researchers are already excited about the possible 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine millions of tiny computers everywhere in our lives,''  
said Eric Wong, a UCLA researcher involved in the project. ``Tiny 
probes in the body, monitoring body functions -- perhaps a very 
sophisticated pacemaker.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged higher Friday against other  
major currencies in lackluster trading as the euro was unable to 
extend its modest two-day rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0196, down  
from $1.0219 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's decline ended its recovery from a record low of  
$1.0108 set during trading on Tuesday. The euro has been trading 
since January when it replaced the currencies of 11 European 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gargano, managing director of currency derivatives at First  
Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C., said the euro had gotten a 
lift from Thursday's comments from the head of the European Central 
Bank that suggested interest rates in Europe may be headed higher. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, ECB president Wim Duisenberg told reporters ``you  
could see a tightening bias slightly creeping in'' into the bank's 
monetary policy stance, a development that could push rates up. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gargano said the euro ``was not reacting as much as you  
might expect'' on Friday to Duisenberg's comments. It traded as 
high as $1.0240 but faded as the say wore on and ended slightly 
above its low for the day of $1.0187. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows people are still concerned about European growth,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates would make returns more attractive on  
holding assets denominated in euros, but may also crimp European 
economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest data on the U.S. economy -- the Federal Reserve said  
industrial production rose a modest 0.2 percent in June -- continued 
to indicate ``the U.S. growth rate is stabilizing,'' Gargano said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said many currency traders expect another quarter percentage  
point rise in U.S. interest rates at the Federal Reserve's August 
meeting but see no evidence to warrant a bigger rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 120.98 Japanese yen in late New York  
trading Friday, up from 120.83 yen, and rose to 1.5759 Swiss francs 
from 1.5739, and 1.4833 Canadian dollars from 1.4816. The British 
pound fell to $1.5625 from $1.5654. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.9183 German 
marks, up from 1.9139, and 6.4350 French francs, up from 6.4185.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Wins Conn. Antitrust Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. was absolved by a  
federal court jury Friday of abusing a small software company, a 
legal victory that could discourage others from challenging its 
dominance in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury rejected a claim by Bristol Technology Inc., of Danbury  
-- a one-time Microsoft business partner -- that Microsoft improperly 
withheld software code that Bristol contended is vital for its 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury did find that Microsoft committed a ``deceptive act''  
that violated a state antitrust law. It didn't specify what the act 
was, but awarded Bristol just $1 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust experts said Microsoft's victory was clearly important  
but was expected to have little impact in the much larger antitrust 
case in Washington, D.C., brought by the Justice Department and 19 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a boost to the company principally because it's going to  
discourage other private parties from taking a swing at it for the 
same type of behavior,'' said William Kovacic of George Washington 
University. ``It will slow down others who thought it was time to 
pile on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft stock gained more than 5 percent in heavy Friday  
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and breached a historic 
milestone. As the stock rose $5.06 1/4 to close at $99.43 3/4, the total 
value of the shares topped $500 billion, the first time that's 
happened. Helping push the shares higher was enthusiasm over a 
report that Microsoft might create a separate stock that would 
track the performance of its Internet properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Aeschbacher, senior corporate attorney for Microsoft,  
called the verdict in the Bristol case ``an important victory for 
the whole software industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This protects the rights of people who developed intellectual  
property to be able to license it in a fair and equitable way,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol had not decided whether it would appeal the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely disappointed and surprised, and will be  
exploring all of our options,'' said John Altieri, a lawyer for 
Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit pitted Bristol, a little-known company with 70  
employees and $8.7 million in revenues, against the Redmond, 
Wash.-based Microsoft with 27,000 employees and $14.48 billion in 
fiscal 1998 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol sued Microsoft last year, contending the maker of the  
Windows computer operating system had stifled competition by 
preventing access to the source code -- the software blueprints -- of 
Windows NT, its system for powerful machines that run computer 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a software product called Wind/U, which allows  
programs written specifically to work with Windows to be converted 
to run on computers with different operating systems such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to create Wind/U, Bristol had signed a contract with  
Microsoft giving Bristol access to the source code for Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six-week trial in U.S. District Court, Bristol  
contended that Microsoft said it would continue providing such 
access as it created new versions of Windows, but later reneged on 
those promises. That, in effect, severed 200 customers of Bristol 
from the latest Windows technology, Bristol contended. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft's lawyers argued that the smaller company's  
lawsuit was motivated by greed. They told the jury that while 
Microsoft executives continued to try to negotiate a new contract 
with Bristol, the smaller company's executives were contacting 
lawyers, a public relations firm and an economic damages expert to 
prepare their lawsuit against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol made two antitrust claims, first, that Microsoft  
illegally refused to negotiate a new contract. Secondly, Bristol 
asserted that Microsoft illegally leveraged its monopoly in 
personal computer operating systems in an attempt to monopolize 
markets for operating systems for powerful network computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found, however, that Bristol failed to prove that  
because of Microsoft's actions there is a dangerous probability 
that it will acquire monopoly power in those markets. 
</P>
<P>
	It did find that Microsoft had committed a deceptive act that  
violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, resulting in 
the tiny fine. It wasn't immediately clear what the act was; the 
jury ruling was released in the form of a response to a list of 
charges and jurors were not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the larger antitrust case, the federal government contends  
that Microsoft illegally wielded monopoly power from its dominant 
Windows product to expand into new markets, such as Internet 
software, attempting to crush a number of competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence in Washington is broad, a broad pattern and a  
huge amount of deception going on,'' said Ed Black, president of 
the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group 
that has been critical of Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department declined to comment on the Bristol  
decision, saying it would be inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony ended last month in the Microsoft trial in Washington,  
but the judge may not issue a final verdict until after January. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is also facing an antitrust suit filed by another  
software company Caldera Inc. of Orem, Utah. That case is scheduled 
to go to trial in January.

<HEADLINE> Minor league Umps Might Walk, Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With major league umpires set to resign en  
masse, minor league umps might go on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Major League Umpires Association planned a  
conference call today with minor league umpires that could lead to 
a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	Union head Richie Phillips said 220 of 228 minor league umpires  
voted to form a union, with two abstaining, but management refused 
to negotiate. Union lawyer Pat Campbell said a walkout could 
``happen sooner rather than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are forced to live two to a room in second-rate motor  
lodges, as opposed to minor league hockey officials who are in 
Marriotts and Hiltons,'' Phillips said. ``They have no pension plan 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations  
in the commissioner's office, said the minor league move was 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised by it,'' Alderson said. ``I heard he might  
make an effort like this in the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At some major league ballparks, including Yankee Stadium, The  
Ballpark in Arlington and the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, 
umpires were booed when they took the field Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's painfully obvious that guy can't retire soon enough,''  
White Sox pitcher Mike Sirotka said of rookie umpire Paul Nauert, 
who appeared to blow a call that cost Chicago a win against St. 
Louis. ``It's kind of a joke that the game has to be in his hands 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials said they are not inclined to challenge the  
umpires' decision to quit Sept. 2 over tension that began when 
Roberto Alomar spat at an ump in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad. It's very, very sad,'' commissioner Bud Selig said.  
``I will have plenty to say in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While baseball is leaning toward hiring a new set of umpires,  
Selig will make the final decision, said several officials who 
spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``That reaction typifies the smugness, the arrogance that has  
led us to where we are, and it exemplifies the lack of appreciation 
for the umpires,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson is expected to take a hard-line approach with umpires,  
who would get up to $400,000 each in severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he submitted the resignations of 57 of the 68  
major league umpires, effective Sept. 2, 4 1/2 weeks before the end of 
the regular season. The American and National League offices said 
Thursday they hadn't received them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that doesn't happen, because that's when the pennant  
races start heating up and you want your best back there working 
the games,'' said catcher Jeff Reed, whose bumping incident with 
umpire Tom Hallion led to the latest escalation in tension. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the remaining umpires will soon add their resignations,  
Phillips said. Three haven't been heard from and two, John Shulock 
and Darryl Cousins, aren't union members because they joined the AL 
staff as strikebreakers during the seven-week walkout in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	If the umps do quit, owners could hire umpires from minor  
leagues, high schools and colleges, as they have during previous 
work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son plays college ball and I've seen those umpires  
intimidated by college coaches,'' NL umpire Ed Montague said. 
``What happens when they go to Atlanta and New York with 50,000 in 
the stands? You think those guys are going to be intimidated by 
Bobby Cox or Joe Torre?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players and manager agreed the quality of umpiring would go  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You certainly don't want to start all over,'' San Francisco  
manager Dusty Baker said. ``That's like starting all over with a 
new police department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While hiring new umps, owners could use legal maneuvers to avoid  
or delay handing over $15 million in termination pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``When push comes to shove, the fans know the umpires are the  
real people of baseball,'' Phillips said. ``They are not phonies; 
they go out and work hard. They are blue-collar workers, like the 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether all umpires would follow through on the  
resignation threat. In March, about 50 umpires voted to give 
Phillips a new five-year contract, but about a dozen voted against 
him, wanting to bring in Ron Shapiro, the agent for Cal Ripken and 
many other players. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro is much less confrontational in negotiations than  
Phillips, but Shapiro told umpires he wouldn't become involved as 
long as the majority of them backed their longtime leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have been angry since Alomar spat at John Hirschbeck  
three years ago and was suspended for five games, a punishment they 
deemed too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no support,'' AL umpire Jim McKean said. ``(The NFL)  
came out in support of their officials, said they were the best in 
the world. ... You never hear that about us. The only thing you 
hear about us is negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions rose even higher earlier this month when NL president  
Len Coleman suspended Hallion for three days for bumping a player, 
the first such action that baseball officials could remember.

<HEADLINE> Sixers Sign Jumaine Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers signed first-round  
draft pick Jumaine Jones to a three-year contract on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the NBA rookie salary scale, Jones, the 27th  
overall pick in last month's draft, must be paid at least 80 
percent and no more than 120 percent of $570,000 the first year, 
$612,800 the second and $655,500 the third. The club holds the 
option for a fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
	Exact terms were not revealed.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Jones was obtained by the Sixers in a draft-day  
trade with the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for a future No. 1 pick. 
He averaged 18.8 points and 9.5 rebounds as a sophomore last year 
at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers hope the spot-up shooter can come off the bench and  
take some of the offensive pressure off Allen Iverson and Larry 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited to have Jumaine under contract and available for  
the upcoming summer league,'' general manager Billy King said. 
``This will give him an early start and help him get ready for next 
year.''

	The Sixers' second-round choice, Todd MacCulloch, remains  
unsigned.

<HEADLINE> Bush Fund-Raising Overwhelms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush raised more money in just two states -- Texas and California -- 
than Democratic front-runner Al Gore collected across the country 
in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	With $30 million already in his campaign account, Bush says he  
will turn down federal matching funds for his primary campaign, 
freeing himself from the spending limits restricting his poorer 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has raked in $37 million donations this year,  
more than the rest of the Republican field combined. That's also 
more than the two Democratic candidates together. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has raised $19.5 million this year -- $9.5 million over the  
past three months, including some earmarked for legal fees. Bush 
took in $10.6 million from Texas and California alone from April 
through June. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley has raised $11.7  
million so far, and after campaign expenses he has $7.5 million 
saved, not too far behind Gore's $9.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bush wins the GOP nomination, his spending could bedevil his  
eventual Democratic adversary long before next summer's party 
nominating conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bush will be unlimited,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of  
government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. ``One thing we 
have seen in recent presidential elections is that the summer 
period has become increasingly important for framing the general 
election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the period where candidates have tried to define their  
opponents in a way that gives them a clear advantage heading into 
the fall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending limits -- and federal matching funds -- last until  
the national party conventions. Once selected, the major party 
nominees can choose to have the federal government pay for their 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush already has raised almost as much as he could spend during  
the primaries under the limits, which are expected to be around $40 
million. By forgoing the matching funds, he faces no spending 
restrictions in the primaries, although he still can only accept 
individual contributions of $1,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got limits that constrain a candidate,'' Bush said. ``I  
want to be in a position to respond. I want to be in a position to 
plan, and I want to be in a position to plan according to need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who finances most of  
his own campaign, joins Bush as the only other GOP candidate 
rejecting matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush raised the most in his home state of Texas, an Associated  
Press computer analysis of his quarterly spending report found. 
Bush took in 10,269 contributions totaling $7 million from the Lone 
Star State from April through June. 
</P>
<P>
	While California ranked second for Bush, with 4,132  
contributions totaling $3.6 million, the state offered Democrats 
their richest territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley took in $1.6 million from California, and Gore raised  
$1.1 million. New York came in second for both Democrats, with $1.4 
million for Bradley and $597,281 for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $110,000 of Bush's millions came from members of  
Washington lobbying firms. Gore also received at least $50,000 from 
Washington lobbyists, while Bradley took about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also gathered almost $700,000 from political action  
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Roger Salazar said his campaign spent a lot of  
money recently building its organization in key states such as Iowa 
and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made some pretty major investments in the campaign that  
we feel are already paying off,'' Salazar said. ``By contrast, our 
primary opponent has yet to make those key investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also leads Bradley in opinion polls, but Bradley spokesman  
Tony Wyche said it was still too early to worry about surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more content to build our organization at the grassroots  
level, building from the bottom up rather than the top down,'' 
Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some well known names contributed the $1,000 maximum to the  
campaigns: 
</P>
<P>
	--Actors Chevy Chase and Kevin Costner gave to Gore, as did  
producer Quincy Jones, television producer Norman Lear and former 
TV executive Grant Tinker. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bradley's contributors included actors Tom Selleck, Paul Reiser  
and Steve Guttenberg. Former professional basketball players Bill 
Walton and John Havlicek gave to the former New York Knick, as did 
former Knicks broadcaster Marty Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bush had few celebrity contributors, but martial artist and  
actor Chuck Norris kicked in some support.

<HEADLINE> Warner Calls For Holbrooke Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed  
Services Committee and two other senators expressed impatience 
Friday with the long delay in confirming Richard Holbrooke as U.N. 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	``The urgency for the Senate to address this nomination is  
increasing daily,'' Sen. John Warner of Virginia said in a floor 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said he had been told by Pentagon briefers the continued  
lack of U.S. leadership at the United Nations had increased the 
risk level of the Balkans peacekeeping operation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said senators who have put so-called ``holds'' on the  
nomination should abandon their stalling tactics in the national 
interest. The U.N. post, formerly held by Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson, has been vacant since last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner was joined by Sens. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and Daniel  
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally think `holds' are irresponsible,'' said Hagel, a  
member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``This body 
should have the courage to bring this nomination up and vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Holbrooke has wide bipartisan support, at least four  
senators have placed holds on the nomination, preventing it from 
coming to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of delay, most of it caused by the administration  
itself, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved 
the nomination on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators with holds on the nomination are Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss.; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, 
and George Voinovich, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate procedures allow members to keep a nomination from the  
floor for unrelated reasons as a pressure tactic against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, an influential voice in the Senate on all national  
security matters, said he fully recognized ``the rights of senators 
to place holds on nominations. And I have done it myself, although 
sparingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he suggested the stalling on Holbrooke should cease, saying  
``the United States is increasingly in need of having a very 
powerful voice at the U.N. at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said that on Thursday his committee ``had a briefing by  
the Balkan task force from the Department of Defense. I put the 
question to the uniformed officers: is there a correlation between 
the absence of strong leadership in the U.N. from the top down and 
risk? The answer was in the affirmative.''

<HEADLINE>  Astro Carl Everett on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros have been hurting this season  
-- and now the pain has extended to Carl Everett's right hamstring 
and Derek Bell's feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros placed Everett on the 15-day disabled list Friday and  
called up Lance Berkman from Triple-A New Orleans. Bell was silent 
on Friday after complaining Thursday about being dropped to sixth 
in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett has been playing with a left hamstring injury, but it  
was his right hamstring that popped in the seventh inning of 
Thursday's game, landing him on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``My leg is gone,'' Everett said. ``I'll just have to let it  
heal. I hate the fact that I've been playing well and then get 
hurt. But there's no use rushing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everett has been a key offensive performer with a .313 average,  
98 hits and 65 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell has hit in the No. 2 slot much of his career with the  
Astros and also has batted fourth. Manager Larry Dierker dropped 
him to the No. 6 spot for Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is batting .247 with 10 home runs and 50 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm speaking of my feelings from the heart, how I feel,'' Bell  
said after the contest, an 8-6 win over Detroit. ``The way it's 
been going, it hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Dierker, making his managerial return after missing more  
than a month because of brain surgery, said he would wait for the 
proper moment to discuss the move with Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll look for an opportunity, not like calling him into the  
office like going to the principal's office or walking up to his 
locker in front of everybody,'' Dierker said. ``When it seems 
comfortable, maybe at the batting cage, we'll talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe after a couple days when he sees what it's like, it  
won't be so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everett was sympathetic toward his outfield mate.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he feels like expressing himself, it's his choice,''  
Everett said. ``Ninety-nine percent of the fans don't know the 
game. They shouldn't get on him. Those fans that are booing him 
ought to keep their mouths shut and encourage him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always have concern when a teammate is hurting. We're so  
close when a teammate is feeling bad we know it. I'll tell him to 
forget the fans. I'll tell him to forget about the first half and 
take off from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker called Bell's complaints  
a family dispute that would not affect Bell's use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Derek is a big part of our club and will continue to be a big  
part of our club,'' Hunsicker said. ``This is nothing unique in 
this business. It's a long season with a lot of ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``All families have their spats and this is just one of them.''  
</P>
<P>
	Berkman hit .303 and 45 RBIs in 58 games with the Zephyrs this  
season. He'll platoon in left field with Matt Mieske, who started 
Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other starters, shortstop Ricky Gutierrez (fractured wrist)  
and third baseman Ken Caminiti (calf injury) are on the DL. The 
Astros also moved Caminiti to the 60-day disabled list. Ten Astros 
have been on the DL this season.

<HEADLINE> 4 Mariners, 3 Dodgers Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dodgers bullpen coach Rick Dempsey was suspended  
for 17 days while Todd Hundley and Jay Buhner were among six 
players penalized Friday following a bench-clearing brawl between 
Los Angeles and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Paniagua and Damaso Marte, David Segui and Buhner were  
suspended from the Mariners. Jamie Arnold, Hundley and Dempsey were 
suspended from the Dodgers. All seven were fined undisclosed 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-minute fight broke out last Sunday at Dodger Stadium after  
Seattle's Frankie Rodriguez threw a pitch at Mark Grudzielanek's 
head. The brawl led to seven ejections. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it was an interleague game, AL president Gene Budig and  
NL president Len Coleman jointly announced the penalties. Paniagua, 
Buhner, Segui and Hundley said they intend to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey, suspended from Saturday until Aug. 3 for running in  
from the bullpen, wants to talk to Coleman on Saturday before 
deciding whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Paniagua's five-game suspension was to start Friday night  
against San Diego. The reliever was penalized for fighting, 
attempting to kick another player and using an obscene gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold also was suspended for five games. The reliever's penalty  
was to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner's four-game penalty was to start July 24. The outfielder  
was on the disabled list when he took part in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley's three-game suspension was to start Saturday against  
Anaheim. The catcher was cited for fighting, being out of control 
and using obscene gestures in view of fans and television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Marte, another reliever, was given a three-game suspension that  
was to start Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Segui got a one-game suspension, which the first baseman was to  
serve July 28.

<HEADLINE> Amish Take Part in Gene Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STRASBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The Amish and Mennonite people of  
Lancaster County are taking part in some very advanced medicine 
these days: gene therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists hope to learn more about genetic diseases by studying  
members of the insular community, people who often ride in 
horse-drawn buggies and don't have electricity but are willing to 
climb into an MRI machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see how it could be confusing if you don't understand  
our beliefs,'' said Leon Newswanger, a Mennonite whose son will be 
one of the first participants in human trials of a new gene 
therapy. ``But if we don't do whatever it takes, if we know what 
could help -- then that is worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish and Mennonites, known as the Plain community for their  
simple, dark clothes and rural way of life, have a higher rate of 
certain inherited diseases than other people. 
</P>
<P>
	They have become instrumental in genetic research because the  
estimated 75,000 sect members are descended from just 47 families. 
The sects have been providing blood samples and family histories to 
geneticists for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, scientists have studied Ashkenazi Jews, Cajuns in  
Louisiana and other groups with a high degree of genetic 
uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amish people know the reality of genetic diseases and so any  
advances are welcomed,'' said Dr. Holmes Morton, who opened the 
Clinic for Special Children in the heart of Pennsylvania's Amish 
country in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of the most advanced gene research clinics in the  
country, situated in a timber-frame house surrounded by fields 
plowed by mules. 
</P>
<P>
	Newswanger's son, Marlin, and two other children from Morton's  
clinic will be the first subjects in a test of a process called 
chimeraplasty, which involves tricking the body into correcting a 
gene mutation. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the technique could be used to treat up to 80  
percent of all genetic diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	All three children are stricken with Crigler-Najjar, a rare  
liver disease that is more common among Amish and Mennonites. About 
300 people worldwide have Crigler-Najjar; 16 trace their roots to 
Lancaster's Plain sects and are being treated by Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	Crigler children suffer severe jaundice and must sleep under  
special rehabilitating lights for up to 16 hours a day to prevent 
deadly brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, Morton treats hundreds of children with more than 70  
rare genetic diseases, and many regularly undergo MRIs and 
complicated blood tests and may be hospitalized for months at a 
time. Some children must be fed special formulas and vitamins -- 
another contrast in a community where nearly all the food is 
homegrown. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what it takes to keep him alive,'' said Glenda Groff,  
a Mennonite whose 8-year-old son has a genetic disorder called 
maple syrup urine disease, which is fatal without a proper diet. 
</P>
<P>
	That disease -- extremely rare in the general population but more  
common among Mennonites -- prevents the body from processing certain 
amino acids, which then become toxic. One of the symptoms is urine 
that smells like maple sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	With the opening of Morton's clinic, many Amish and Mennonite  
have shed their traditional fatalism about disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a perception in the Plain community that some things  
are a fact of life,'' said Rebecca Smoker, an Amish worker at 
Morton's clinic. ``For years, these children lived their short 
little lives and died without any medical person seeing them 
because everybody knew they were going to die.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Sprague Resigned to Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Ed Sprague was the only player wearing a  
Pittsburgh Pirates uniform in the All-Star game. Still to be 
determined is what uniform he will be wearing in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprague has been one of baseball's biggest bargains this season,  
with a .300 average, 16 home runs and 53 RBIs in little more than a 
half-season. He is making $1 million, a relatively low figure for 
such production. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates signed Sprague mostly to improve their power and to  
add a proven veteran in a clubhouse that was noticeably bare of 
such players last season. 
</P>
<P>
	By signing Sprague for one year, the Pirates also gave  
20-year-old third base prospect Aramis Ramirez another year to 
mature in the minors. Ramirez floundered as a 19-year-old rookie in 
the majors last season, batting .235, and the Pirates are convinced 
they erred by rushing him into their lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to wait until players are ready,'' general manager  
Cam Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ramirez has been one of the top players in the minors this  
season with a .355 average at Triple-A Nashville, and his return to 
Pittsburgh may not be far away. He played in the Futures Game for 
top prospects Sunday in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Pirates decide to trade Sprague for a top prospect or two  
before Sept. 1, that time may come later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about stuff like that,'' Sprague said. ``I've  
been involved in trade rumors since the first day I played in the 
big leagues. I don't worry about it because it's a part of 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates haven't discounted signing Sprague past this season,  
but they would likely have to more than double Sprague's salary to 
do so. With Ramirez waiting impatiently to return, that might be 
impractical for a franchise whose payroll is one-third that of 
teams such as the Yankees and Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just worried about the second half of the season,''  
Sprague said. If a trade situation unfolds, so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the teams said to be interested in Sprague are the  
Indians, who are playing Enrique Wilson at third base. He had 
played only 37 games in the majors prior to this season.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus-Amax, Asarco Agree to Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Cyprus-Amax Minerals Co. and Asarco Inc.  
have agreed to merge in a stock swap worth $764.2 million that 
creates the world's largest publicly traded copper company. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly formed company will be called Asarco Cyprus Inc. The  
merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year, company 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Milton Ward, Cyprus chairman and chief executive, will serve as  
co-CEO through April with Francis McAllister, Asarco's chairman and 
CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus-Amax, Colorado's largest mining employer, plans to close  
its Arapahoe County headquarters after the merger. Company vice 
president Gerald Malys said some of the 100 employees might be 
offered jobs in New York City, where Asarco is based. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the continuation of a trend toward consolidation in  
our industry,'' said Stuart Sanderson, president of the Colorado 
Mining Association. ``Companies are merging and restructuring to 
lower costs and increase efficiencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the merger goes through, Asarco Cyprus Inc. will supplant  
Phelps Dodge Corp. as the world's largest publicly traded copper 
company. It also will be the largest molybdenum producer, with 
assets of $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	With copper prices at historic lows, major producers are trying  
to slash operating costs. The Cyprus-Asarco merger is expected to 
reduce expenses by $150 million, allowing the company to expand its 
copper production, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our U.S. mines, which are primarily in Arizona, are in close  
proximity to one another, providing the opportunity to achieve 
operating efficiencies and reduce administrative overhead,'' Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the merger will have no immediate impact  
on those operations, which employ about 4,500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies also operate major copper mines in Peru and  
Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, Asarco shareholders would get a share  
in the new company for each of their 39.7 million shares, or $764.2 
million. Asarco closed Thursday at $19.25 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus Amax shareholders would get 0.765 shares in the combined  
comoany for each of its 90.5 million shares, or about $1.33 billion 
at Thursday's closing price for Asarco.

<HEADLINE> Now, Everyone Is Famous! Who Knew? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Warhol was wrong. No one is famous for just  
15 minutes. These days you get to be famous whenever you feel like 
it. Just like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, anyone can ring up Larry King and ask a question on  
the air. You can e-mail John Gibson, host of that goofy MSNBC talk 
show, and if it's brash enough he might read your note aloud. Or, 
any time you visit Manhattan, you can wave at the ``Today'' cameras 
and be seen coast-to-coast -- just like Katie and Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	With the right personal crisis, you could wangle an appearance  
on ``Sally Jessy Raphael.'' If you make your home video suitably 
freakish or bloody, Fox might put you in a special. You could even 
launch your own Web site and star in your own live streaming video: 
You, brushing your teeth; you, playing with the dog; you, taking a 
nap and dreaming of fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember: The First Amendment now guarantees not only free  
speech, but also a mass audience. Access! Exposure! To paraphrase 
Descartes, ``I think, therefore I am famous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's just one thing missing: Impact. It's easy to go public,  
but who will really notice you? Remember you? Enrich you? Sure 
you're famous, but for the moment, only you know it. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder you still have to stand in line.  
</P>
<P>
	Even, conceivably, at a certain McDonald's near Long Island's  
East End. On this recent Friday afternoon, McDonald's is jammed 
with people standing in line. 
</P>
<P>
	But just a few miles farther on traffic-choked Route 27, the  
glamorous Hamptons grant refuge to the truly fame-enabled. These 
are people like Alec Baldwin and Christie Brinkley, Martha Stewart 
and Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, Lorne Michaels and Donna Karan and Jimmy 
Buffett, not to mention famous people you may not know, people 
famous in the eyes of other famous people, like Henry Kravis and 
Ron Perelman and Diane Von Furstenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the sort of people who can invite Bill and Hillary to  
join them in the Hamptons and, last summer, did. They are people 
who don't wait in line. 
</P>
<P>
	But what's this? Regis and Joy Philbin, of all people, have just  
entered the McDonald's. The ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee'' host 
and his wife (and sometimes co-host) are weaving their way through 
the crowd. And standing in line. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a surprise. Regis, clearly Hamptons-bound, is not only  
famous but, thanks to his show, a fame facilitator. Does he really 
need McDonald's? Regis is his own Big Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more surprising: No one but you appears to register his  
presence, or Joy's. Not the hungry throng. Not the counter 
attendant. Not her co-workers monkeying with the shake dispenser 
while Joy, who ordered a vanilla shake, waits and waits. 
</P>
<P>
	From this episode, you learn two things about celebrity: It has  
to be acknowledged to exist. And even then, it wouldn't make the 
shake taste good. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that either rule makes fame any less desirable. Or any less  
thrilling to behold in those who, unlike you, are certifiably 
famous -- especially when that famous orbit happens to align with 
your own humdrum life. 
</P>
<P>
	You once shopped for dinner beside the actress Linda Hunt at a  
Greenwich Village greengrocer's. You got into a cab just as 
actress-comedian Janeane Garofalo got out. And wasn't that Claire 
Danes, then fresh from ``My So-Called Life,'' that you passed on 
the steps of the West Fourth Street subway stop? 
</P>
<P>
	Fame is heady to behold, even when your vantage point is  
secondhand. Your doctor, whose Upper West Side office is next door 
to Jerry Seinfeld's building, tells you he sees Jerry from time to 
time. Confirmed: Jerry Seinfeld strolls on West 81st Street, same 
as you. 
</P>
<P>
	And Christiane Amanpour goes to the movies.  
</P>
<P>
	The CNN foreign correspondent, usually seen reporting from  
faraway trouble spots, could hardly be seen, much less recognized, 
seated in the darkness at a Lower East Side cineplex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Excuse me,'' you murmur, as you blindly wriggle across the  
row. But Amanpour has blocked your path with her leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say `excuse me,''' she directs in her instantly identifiable  
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Excuse me,'' you repeat, a little louder. This time, she hears  
you and lets you pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the feature starts and Amanpour's husband James Rubin, who  
has logged camera time of his own as U.S. State Department 
spokesman, takes a few calls on his cell phone. Calls from his 
boss, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright? From Alec or Puffy? 
</P>
<P>
	If only you could borrow it and call Larry King!

<HEADLINE> Tribune Co. Profits Rise 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Tribune Co., the parent company of the Chicago  
Tribune and the Chicago Cubs, reported Friday that its 
second-quarter profits jumped nearly 13 percent amid strong 
showings in its television business. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended June 27, Tribune's profits from  
operations rose to $118 million, or 88 cents a share, from $104.7 
million, or 75 cents a share, the comparable period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street expectations by a penny a share,  
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 7 percent to $836.9 million from $785.6 million a  
year earlier. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, revenue rose 
3 percent as the company charged higher advertising fees on the 
strength of its television unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune reported strong showings of syndicated episodes of the  
television show ``Friends'' at its television stations in Boston, 
Chicago and New York. The company also benefited from the 
popularity of such shows as ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer'' on the WB network, in which it owns a 25 percent 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue at Tribune's publishing operations rose 5 percent,  
helped by lower prices for newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
	In the recent quarter, after gains from investments and a change  
in accounting, the company had net income of $880.3 million, or 
$6.75 a share. Tribune had a gain on investments in the year-ago 
quarter, resulting in net income of $143 million, or $1.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune Co. shares rose 25 cents to $88.06 1/2 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Marquez Says Vargas Is All Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Nev. (AP) -- Fernando Vargas has a world title  
and a perfect record. Raul Marquez, who used to hold that IBF 
junior middleweight title, says he'll prove Saturday night that 
Vargas is just an overhyped fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, a 1996 U.S. Olympian, has won by knockout in each of his  
16 pro fights. The resident of Oxnard, Calif., will be making his 
second defense of the 154-pound title he captured last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquez, a 1992 Olympian from Houston, is 30-1 with 20  
knockouts. He held the title for eight months in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm eager to find out what Fernando is all about. I think he  
has talent and hype -- he has a little talent and a lot of hype,'' 
Marquez said. ``I think the pressure is on the champ. Fernando is a 
big star, I read all about him in the magazines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marquez, 27, lost the title when he was stopped on cuts by Yory  
Boy Campas in the eighth round in late 1997. It came less than 
three months after the left-handed Marquez needed 70 stitches to 
close cuts in his eyebrows in a successful title defense. 
</P>
<P>
	That tendency to cut easily is one reason why Marquez is a big  
underdog to defeat Vargas in the fight at Caesars Tahoe and regain 
the crown. Another reason is the talent and superior speed of 
Vargas, who has gotten all his knockouts by the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas captured the crown five days after his 21st birthday when  
he stopped Campas in the seventh round last Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas is earning $500,000 for the title defense, while Marquez  
will get $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, that's the only way I was going to get a shot at a title.  
When the opportunity comes, you have to take it,'' Marquez said. 
``I know I beat him and the money will come. I would rather have 
this opportunity than fight for $20,000 or $25,000 in Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas has talked about fighting undefeated WBC welterweight  
champion Oscar De La Hoya, a 1992 Olympic teammate of Marquez, but 
the main goal for now simply is retain his junior middleweight 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my job. This is what I love to do,'' Vargas said. ``I  
love the fact that I'm world champion and there's no way in my mind 
I can think about losing the title.''

<HEADLINE> More Money Sought For Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House anti-drug chief Barry McCaffrey,  
citing an ``explosion'' of cocaine production in Colombia, wants 
Congress to add $1 billion to current drug war outlays of $256 
million, a government official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, McCaffrey  
asked for her support to enhance air interdiction and field 
operations in southern Colombia. He said CIA estimates show sharp 
increases in both cocaine production and opium cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
	Without acknowledging the $1 billion price tag, McCaffrey told a  
news conference, ``I think the support we have given Colombia today 
is inadequate to deal with the enormous internal threats they are 
facing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining him was Colombia's new defense minister, Luis Fernando  
Ramirez, and his chief of staff, Fernando Tapias. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will try in accordance with the president's leadership to  
begin a dialogue among my Cabinet colleagues and with the 
Congress,'' McCaffrey said, declaring the situation in Colombia an 
``emergency''. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently seeing the situation differently, the Senate recently  
cut $80 million from the initial administration request of $295 
million. McCaffrey called that a ``bad signal''. 
</P>
<P>
	His aim is not only to increase the funding but also the  
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be narrowly focused on helicopters; it has to be more  
universal,'' McCaffrey said. He wants more support for Colombia's 
judiciary and for providing alternatives to coca for Colombian 
farmers. Coca is the raw material for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	A discussion paper released by McCaffrey's office said the lack  
of a Colombian government presence in southern Colombia prevents 
effective counterdrug eradication, alternative development and 
interdiction operations. It recommends $360 million to help meet 
these needs. An additional $200 million would be used to upgrade 
customs sensor systems and other anti-drug technologies. A further 
$130 million is recommended to enhance air interdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 80 percent of the cocaine and 60 percent of the heroine  
used in the United States originates in or is transported through 
Colombia, McCaffrey said. He plans to visit Colombia on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's main guerrilla movement, known as by its Spanish  
initials as the FARC, is believed to earn tens of millions of 
dollars annually through its support for drug kingpins.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ruble Continues To Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The ruble rose against the dollar for a sixth  
straight day on Friday after a top official said the Central Bank 
was spending its hard currency to prop up the Russian currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruble strengthened to 24.32 against the dollar on the Moscow  
Interbank Currency Exchange, up from 24.33 the day before. Trading 
volume stayed largely unchanged at just under $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
	First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko said Thursday that  
the Central Bank sold dollars for most of last week to defend the 
ruble. When the bank spends its hard currency to buy rubles, it 
adds to the demand for the ruble and therefore causes its rate to 
go up. 
</P>
<P>
	This, however, depletes the bank's limited foreign currency  
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank reported Thursday that its reserves of gold and  
foreign currency fell to $11.8 billion on July 9, down $300 million 
from a week earlier.

<HEADLINE> Lubbock Denies Hampton Bias Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- The city denied in court documents that  
police were racially biased when they arrested Hampton University 
basketball coach Patricia Bibbs, her husband and an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	In documents filed Thursday, the city said Bibbs and two others  
brought the arrests on themselves with their conduct when 
questioned by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``This defendant denies any behavior that was constitutionally  
deficient for racial or other reasons,'' the filing says. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibbs, her husband, Ezell, and former assistant Vanetta Kelso  
were arrested in Lubbock last year on suspicion of committing a 
money scam in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart. They sued the city, 
Police Chief Ken Walker, five officers and unnamed EMS medics for 
$30 million, claiming discrimination. The three plaintiffs are 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's filing was a response to the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit and the city's answer agree on some points but offer  
vastly different accounts of several events that unfolded Nov. 16, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	When police attempted to pull over the coaches' van, the  
plaintiffs describe the distance they drove before pulling over as 
``very short.'' The city says they drove three-quarters of a mile 
while being followed by two marked patrol cars with emergency 
lights flashing. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Patricia Bibbs, she immediately told officer David  
Houser that she was Hampton's basketball coach and that her team 
was in town for a game against Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers say Ezell Bibbs first revealed the information as  
Sgt. Roger Hearron arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Bibbs stated to Sgt. Hearron, `I hope you all know, you've  
just arrested the head coach of Hampton University,''' the city's 
answer says. ``Plaintiffs chose to be deliberately evasive in their 
answers to police officers at the scene of the initial stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also claims that Kelso, who was pregnant, received  
inadequate medical care. According to Kelso, police ignored her 
pleas for help when she vomited inside a police car. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the city's account, Kelso refused to answer police  
who asked if she needed help and instead repeatedly said, ``You're 
killing my baby.'' Police immediately called an ambulance for her, 
the city says. 
</P>
<P>
	With the city's filing, U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings  
indicated he will rule within 10 days on whether the civil case may 
proceed. Cummings has issued a gag order for all parties in the 
case.

<HEADLINE> Memphis Mayor Faces 20 Challengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A scion of a powerful Memphis political  
family is challenging the city's first elected black mayor in a 
race observers say may very well get personal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Willie Herenton faces 20 challengers in the Oct. 7  
election, an eclectic list that includes a professional wrestler 
and a former football coach. But political observers see the race 
coming down to Herenton, the two-term incumbent, and City Council 
chairman Joe Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, 45, is a brother of former congressman Harold Ford Sr. and  
an uncle of current Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ford Sr., the state's first black member of Congress,  
represented the 9th Congressional District for 22 years. He runs 
one of the state's most active political organizations, and he and 
Herenton have made it clear they don't like each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's deep and long-standing,'' said Marcus Pohlmann, a  
political scientist at Rhodes College in Memphis. ``I get the 
impression it's more than just political, that it's personal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herenton, 59, claims his opponent is part of a power-hungry  
family bent on controlling Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ford family is moving in the direction of trying to occupy  
all major elected positions in our system,'' the mayor said. 
``They've shown how ruthless they can be in wielding power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenger counters that Herenton ``is more interested in  
enriching himself than the city of Memphis'' and is beholden to 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have clashed several times but this is their first  
head-to-head political contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis, with 650,000 residents, is 55 percent black.  
</P>
<P>
	Pohlmann said he thinks Herenton and Ford will split most of the  
black vote. How that split breaks down -- and how many white votes 
each attracts -- will be the keys to victory, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herenton has gotten along well with the city's predominantly  
white business establishment, so that will help him, Pohlmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, Ford may be hurt by brother Harold, who angered many  
whites over the years with an us-against-them bid for black votes, 
Pohlmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's two other Fords seeking a political future. Ophelia  
Ford and her brother Edmund are among the candidates seeking to 
replace their brother Joe on the City Council. Edmund didn't even 
know his sister planned to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has a right to run. I don't have a problem with  
anybody running,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry Bond, who's seeking a City County seat in the same  
district, said there might be some anti-Ford backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some people will look at it and say, `There are too  
many Fords on the ballot,''' Bond said. ``I think it's really 
starting to rub people the wrong way. Every time there's a vacancy, 
they (the Fords) look down the family tree to find a candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other mayoral hopefuls who beat Thursday's filing deadline for  
the October election include wrestler Jerry ``The King'' Lawler and 
former football coach Pepper Rodgers, who led the city's failed bid 
to land a National Football League franchise.

<HEADLINE> Sparky Goes Home After Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Former Detroit Tigers manager Sparky  
Anderson has returned home, nearly two weeks after suffering what 
doctors called a ``quiet heart attack,'' his business manager said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was taken by ambulance Thursday from Henry Ford  
Hospital to Detroit Metropolitan Airport, where he and his wife 
Carol took a commercial flight to California, former Tigers vice 
president Dan Ewald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 65, who is suffering from three blocked arteries, will  
undergo heart bypass surgery at a Los Angeles-area hospital, 
possibly as early as today, Ewald told The Oakland Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sparky would have liked to have had the surgery here,'' Ewald  
told the Pontiac newspaper. ``He really has a lot of confidence in 
Henry Ford Hospital. But he is going to be recovering for at least 
a month, and he would rather do that at home, with his family 
around. The doctors decided it would be safe for him to fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson likely will spend five to seven days recuperating in  
the hospital after the surgery, then spend a month recovering at 
home, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors determined that Anderson suffered the mild heart attack  
on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't feeling good at all, but he thought it was just the  
flu,'' Ewald said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Anderson insisted on flying to Detroit two days later to  
honor a commitment to play in a charity golf tournament organized 
by former University of Michigan football coach and Tigers 
president Bo Schembechler. Anderson appeared at the Monday event 
but did not play. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson managed the Cincinnati Reds from 1970-78, winning the  
World Series in 1975-76. He managed the Tigers for 17 years, 
resigning after the 1995 season with a team-record 1,331 victories 
and a World Series title in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Rail Suspect's Family Had Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The sister of railroad killer suspect Angel  
Maturino Resendiz knew he could get the death penalty in Texas when 
she brokered his surrender, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only negotiated with the sister,'' said Tom Vinger, a  
spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. ``Whatever 
anybody else understood is not something we have control over. With 
the sister, the death penalty was discussed. She understood it was 
a possibility. And there were no promises made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question of what she knew came up when Maturino Resendiz's  
brother complained earlier this week that the family was duped by 
Texas Rangers into believing he would not face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz, 39, surrendered Tuesday after a six-week  
manhunt, crossing from Mexico into El Paso with brother Florentino 
Maturino at his side. His sister, Manuela, negotiated the surrender 
with a Texas Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz is suspected in nine slayings and is charged  
in Texas with capital murder in the bludgeoning of an 87-year-old 
woman. He also faces murder charges in Illinois and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Florentino Maturino said his family was told that his brother  
would not face a death sentence for any Texas murders. ``That 
wasn't the intention, to give him the death penalty,'' Florentino 
Maturino said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinger said that Ms. Maturino had no attorney present during her  
meetings with Rangers but that she was well-informed about the 
possibility that he could face execution in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, Vinger said, ``It's no secret in Mexico that  
there's a death penalty in Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maturino has declined to speak with reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's deputy consul general in Houston, Jose Mendoza Caamano,  
visited Maturino Resendiz in jail for two hours Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He specifically requested for us to collaborate with his  
attorneys. We will be available with his attorneys to provide any 
information he would need,'' Mendoza Caamano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz's attorney, Allen Tanner, said he hopes the  
emissary will persuade the district attorney not to seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy consul said he also visited Maturino Resendiz to  
verify the spelling of his name, which has changed several times. 
On legal documents and by his own spelling in court, the name has 
been spelled with an ``ez'' on the end. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mendoza Caamano and one of the suspect's attorneys insisted  
on Friday that Resendiz with in ``iz'' on the end was the correct 
spelling.

<HEADLINE> Coke Motion on Bias Suit Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Lawyers for four former and current Coca-Cola  
employees suing the company have won the right to continue trying 
to get the case to cover 1,500 black salaried employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they are faced with going through reams of material and  
deciphering computer data before a case can be made that the four 
plaintiffs represent all black salaried employees at the 
Atlanta-based soft drink giant. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Thursday denied a request by The Coca-Cola  
Co. that would have barred class action status. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sobered by the fact that this is not time for a victory  
dance, but a time to get back to work,'' lead plantiff attorney 
Cyrus Mehri said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Richard Story left open the  
possibility of turning down class-action status to the lawsuit as 
the case evolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a danger of reading too much into this, because all  
issues still must be resolved, and a full and complete record must 
be created before I can make a decision on class action,'' Story 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which was filed April 22, alleges Coca-Cola pays  
black employees less, offers them fewer promotions and gives them 
lower performance evaluation scores than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehri told the judge that in addition to the four who are now  
suing Coke, 100 other potential clients already have contacted his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means to me that there is substantive discrimination,''  
Mehri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke lawyers argued that because the suit asks for compensatory  
and punitive damages, as well as a court order to stop alleged 
discriminatory practices, the case does not meet federal criteria 
for a class action. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead Coca-Cola lawyer William Clineburg declined comment after  
the hearing, but Coke spokesman Rob Baskin said while the company 
was ``disappointed with the ruling ... we still recognize that it 
is a first step in a long legal process that will show that 
Coca-Cola has not in this case and does not discriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mehri also submitted to the court a confidential document from  
Coca-Cola that Mehri said shows potential discriminatory policies 
within Coke. The document was obtained as part of the 
evidence-gathering known as the discovery process, and the judge 
has ruled that such material from Coke should not be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke turned over 15,000 documents and a computer database on  
July 1. Plaintiffs' lawyers have 90 days to file a petition for 
class-action status. But they have argued that since they can't 
decipher the computerized records and because not all the requested 
documents have been turned over, the discovery period has not 
officially started. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery process could stretch into next year.

<HEADLINE> Pampling Goes From First to Finished  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- From first to finished.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Pampling's fortunes in the British Open on Friday turned  
quicker than the gusts at Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Australian greenskeeper startled the British Open by  
taking the first-round lead with a par 71. He proceeded to shoot a 
second round of 15-over 86, making him the first player to lead and 
then miss the cut in the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your game's not on this course, you're going to pay the  
price,'' Pampling said. ``My game wasn't on today, and I paid the 
price -- big time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pampling, credited his wife Angela, a psychologist, for his  
confidence in the first round, when he had 11 pars and an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday in almost identical conditions, he had 10 bogeys, one  
double bogey and a triple bogey on the disastrous ninth hole. His 
wife hugged him as he came off the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got off to a slow start and you can't really pick it up out  
here too much,'' Pampling said, little known even in Australia, 
where he lives in the Sunshine Coast town of Caboolture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just kept compounding. A few bad holes, a very bad one on  
nine and a couple of more holes and you have an 86. A few bad lies, 
a few bad shots and you have a big score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pampling came completely undone at the par-4 No. 9, where he  
pushed his second shot with a 5-iron right into a drainage ditch. 
The Australian took a hack at it and pushed the ball a few yards 
further into some ``tough grass that was unbelievable.'' He took 
two more swings to free himself from the bramble and then 
two-putted. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions both days were about the same, perhaps a bit  
easier Friday with the air beginning to stir only after he had 
played a half-dozen holes. He couldn't exactly put his finger on 
what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little things, big things, bad bounces,'' he said. But he was  
sure the pressure of being an obscure first-round leader didn't get 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel worried about that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The previous worst performance by a first-round leader in the  
British Open was in 1922 by Ted Ray. He opened with a 73 followed 
by 83, 85, 80 to finish tied for 47th place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I can always look back on it that I was leading,''  
Pampling said. ``But I'll also have that second round too, won't 
I.''

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Judge Signals Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal judge presiding over former  
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros' approaching conspiracy trial 
indicated Friday he is likely to allow jurors to hear Cisneros' 
voice on tape recordings made by his ex-mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin's comments, at the end  
of a 13-day pretrial hearing on the tapes' admissibility, suggested 
only a qualified victory for prosecutors trying to use as evidence 
26 of the 88 tapes recorded by Linda Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Fretting that some of the tapes bear signs suggesting they could  
have been heavily edited, Sporkin told the government's special 
prosecutors he would not let them introduce all 26 recordings. 
``Some of this is going out, as far as I'm concerned,'' Sporkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings are central to prosecutors' case that while under  
consideration for a Cabinet post in the Clinton administration, 
Cisneros conspired with Ms. Jones and two aides to conceal details 
of his more than $250,000 in payments to her. The trial is set for 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporkin, whose official decision will come in a written ruling,  
said he remains skeptical of the defense's argument that none of 
the tapes are admissible because all are copies, in some cases 
altered, of since-destroyed originals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't buy your argument in total, and I can't buy their  
argument in total,'' Sporkin told a prosecutor as both sides wound 
up their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	During the marathon hearing, which had been scheduled to last  
only two days, Cisneros' legal team labored on several fronts to 
quash the tapes, which lawyer Brendan Sullivan acknowledged Friday 
may carry special weight with jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tapes, as we all know, are very powerful evidence,'' Sullivan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings, made as the relationship soured, captured  
conversations in which Ms. Jones and Cisneros discussed his 
financial support as well as his characterization of the payments 
to the Clinton transition team and FBI agents conducting his 
Cabinet background check. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros revealed during his background check that he gave Ms.  
Jones financial support after their extramarital affair became 
public in 1988, costing her marriage and career as a political 
fund-raiser. But prosecutors contend he falsely told the FBI he 
never paid her more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-count indictment against Cisneros alleges he paid her  
more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993. He has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel David Barrett's office has acknowledged that  
four of the 26 tapes were edited by Ms. Jones, who testified she 
feared legal repercussions if she didn't scrub the recordings to 
delete passages where she threatened to expose her financial 
arrangement with Cisneros if the money flow stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said she also deleted some sexually suggestive  
passages and those dealing with uninvolved parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cisneros team, which undertook an all-out assault on Ms.  
Jones' credibility, said the judge should throw out the tapes 
because he has no independent means of verifying whether her 
depiction of the editing is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Ms. Jones admitted she misrepresented  
the tapes as unaltered originals to the FBI, Internal Revenue 
Service, a Texas court and her own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't rely upon the liar, the government's chief  
witness,'' Sullivan told Sporkin on Friday. ``She's been proven a 
liar hundreds of times before you.''

<HEADLINE> Man Illegally Parachutes, Drowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A man illegally parachuted from the top of  
El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, then apparently drowned after 
diving into a river to evade park rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Frank Gambalie III, 28, was found in the Merced  
River on July 7, about 300 feet from where he was last seen by 
rangers on June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambalie was an experienced skydiver and BASE jumper -- a person  
who parachutes off cliffs or other stationary objects. The acronym 
BASE comes from ``Building, Antenna, Span, Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BASE jumping is illegal in Yosemite, punishable by up to six  
months in jail and a $5,000 fine. The skydiving equipment can also 
be confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of Gambalie's death, BASE jumpers say that the  
penalties are out of line and that rangers overzealously enforce 
the ban. Jumpers and others point out that hang gliding from cliffs 
and rock climbing are legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is at least partially to blame,'' Frank Gambalie II  
said Friday before his son's funeral in Antioch, 50 miles east of 
San Francisco. ``But how they approach the offense may not be in 
line with what the offense is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BASE jumping was legal for a trial period in 1980, but  
restrictions on when people could jump and the number of jumps per 
day were routinely violated, so the activity was banned, said 
Kendall Thompson, a Yosemite ranger. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also concerns about jumper safety, litter and  
disturbing of peregrine falcon nesting areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Park rangers spotted Gambalie as he parachuted from the top of  
7,569-foot El Capitan and approached him after he landed in Capitan 
Meadow. The rangers ordered Gambalie to stop, but he shed his 
skydiving equipment, ran to the river and jumped in the water, 
Thompson said. Gambalie was last seen swimming toward the opposite 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
	``From all indications, this was a pre-planned action,''  
Thompson said. ``He shed his gear quickly and ran without 
hesitation.''

<HEADLINE> Scurry: Attention Has Been Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Goalie Briana Scurry says the attention  
she's received since her stellar performance in the Women's World 
Cup victory over China has been great, and she said she's not a 
victim of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview before her ``Tonight Show'' appearance Thursday,  
Scurry said she signed a lucrative endorsement deal with Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry, a 1990 graduate of Anoka High School, grew up the  
youngest of nine children in Dayton, Minn., 20 miles northwest of 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	She has heard people complaining she did not get enough credit  
for her overtime shutout last weekend against China in the World 
Cup title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know some people are saying the camera wasn't on me enough  
during the game,'' she said in her NBC dressing room. ``But I 
watched a tape today, and I had the camera on me tons. Goalies 
never get too much notice on highly offensive teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The last week has been hectic but great,'' she said.  
``Actually, I'm getting a lot of attention. Pepsi has all kinds of 
things planned for me. I've been on the 'Today Show,' the 'Tonight 
Show,' 'Good Morning America,' you name it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team plans to visit the White House and President Clinton on  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Scurry, the goalkeeper's mother, on Wednesday joined  
those complaining that her daughter is being kept out of the 
post-World Cup limelight because she is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom is a little biased in that sense,'' said Scurry. ``She  
probably never thinks I get enough attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry, 27, also said she has an idea for her next career: she  
wants to play in the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry was an all-state basketball player at Anoka but opted to  
play soccer at the University of Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> New Soap Opera Found in `Bad Taste' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just after she bought a book on Princess Diana  
during a visit to Paris, the wealthy socialite Sheridan Crane got 
into a car crash in the same tunnel where Diana died nearly two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was pure fiction -- just another outrageous story in a soap  
opera -- but it came so uncomfortably close to the real-life tragedy 
that NBC is taking heat for putting it on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers called the storyline ``deplorable'' and  
``disrespectful'' in postings on the Web site for the new daytime 
drama, ``Passions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It even drew a royal rebuke.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is in exceedingly bad taste, and it's totally  
inappropriate,'' Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, a cousin of 
Prince Charles, told Soap Opera Weekly magazine. ``I'm not even 
going to look at it. ... To exploit other people's pain is always 
awful. To make money on someone who died like that is disgusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show's creator defended the plot, saying it was no worse  
than people who tried to capitalize on Diana's death by selling 
souvenirs with her picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a part of her life like everyone else is taking a  
part of her life,'' said James Reilly, the head writer on 
``Passions.'' ``We're taking the most emotional part of her life 
and showing how our character is affected by it and ripped apart by 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Passions'' went on the air July 5, replacing the canceled  
``Another World,'' and represents NBC's attempt to draw a younger 
soap opera audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Crane's character is depicted as a friend of Diana's who is  
disturbed by the parallels in their lives. In a scene during the 
soap's first week, she is shown driving a car and being chased by 
paparazzi. Producers filmed a car going into the actual tunnel 
where Diana died but taped the crash scene in a Los Angeles studio. 
Crane's character survives the crash because she's wearing a 
seatbelt. 
</P>
<P>
	After the crash, the camera focuses on the book with Diana's  
picture lying on the pavement, littered with shattered glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in her hospital bed, Crane has an out-of-body experience  
in which she supposedly hears Diana's voice. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC executives approved the crash scene. ``Our intention was not  
to offend anyone but to portray Diana with respect and warmth,'' 
said Susan Lee, NBC senior vice president for daytime television. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly said soap operas try to get viewers emotionally involved  
with what's on the screen, and Diana's death was particularly 
wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be up in arms if I thought we were demeaning her,  
trivializing her death or laughing at people who were upset by 
it,'' he said. ``We did the total opposite.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts Education in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Saying he is not a candidate but acting  
like he is, President Clinton boasted about his administration's 
record Friday while a crowd of Republican White House hopefuls 
scoured Iowa for votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You folks should be glad to see me in Iowa,'' Clinton told  
several hundred people in a sweltering school gymnasium. ``I'm the 
only guy that's been here in weeks that's not running for 
anything.'' The audience laughed and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spent an hour listening to farmers talk about  
their economic problems and plead for emergency assistance. ``We 
know we've got a terrible problem in farm country all over 
America,'' the president said in a speech later. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized Republicans for defeating Democratic health care  
proposals in the Senate this week. ``We will win the war, you mark 
my words,'' Clinton said. ``A lot of them (the Republicans) think 
politics is about power and position. But we think it's about 
ideas, action and people.... Power and money are incidental.'' 
</P>

ideas, action and people.... Power and money are incidental.'' 



</P>
<P>
	Following on the heels of a two-day Iowa visit by Vice President  
Al Gore, Clinton competed for attention with motor tours by Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush and his GOP rivals Steve Forbes and Lamar 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clinton-Gore administration is not running out the clock,  
hoping the good times will last,'' the president said. ``We are 
trying to push the ball down the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president came to Amos Hiatt Middle School -- built in 1925 --  
to promote his initiatives to modernize classrooms. He challenged 
Republicans in Congress to take advantage of good economic times to 
invest in education before promising tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes down to this: What do you want to do with this  
moment of prosperity?'' Clinton questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his presidency has been good for Iowa, the launching pad  
for the presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here is Iowa unemployment is a whopping 2.6 percent,'' Clinton  
said. ``Home ownership is almost at 75 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's school visit preceded a pair of fund-raisers for  
a major impeachment ally, Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who expected 
to collect $175,000 from Clinton's appearances. Clinton also met 
with farmers, suffering from historically low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Clinton's visit could be a twin-edged sword for  
Gore's campaign: revving up Democrats but also reminding people of 
the president's sex-and-impeachment problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``He reminds the general electorate that Gore is part of a  
somewhat stained team, scandal ridden,'' said Brookings Institution 
political scholar Stephen Hess. ``One of Gore's biggest problems 
will be Clinton fatigue. They're twins in history. All of the 
advantages -- notably an administration of great prosperity and 
peace -- and all the liabilities will cling to Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kohut, polling director for the Pew Research Center, said  
people are tired of the problems of the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that Gore's standing in the horserace polls (behind  
Bush) was more tied to personal evaluations of Bill Clinton than to 
his job approval rating'' which is historically high, Kohut said. 
``You could infer that part of Gore's problems are people are tired 
of Clinton personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A centerpiece of Clinton's education initiative would provide  
tax breaks to investors who buy municipal bonds to back school 
construction and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, which would provide $3.7 billion in federal tax  
breaks over five years, could support up to $25 billion in school 
modernization, according to administration estimates. The tax break 
would make the low-rate bonds more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Bush criticized Clinton's agriculture policies,  
saying his administration has done little to ease the economic 
pressures on the nation's farmers. Without referring to Bush 
directly, Clinton tried to lay blame for the farmers' problems on 
policies generated by Congress in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He said those who supported the Freedom to Farm Act, which  
weaned farmers away from price supports in exchange for more 
freedom to choose what they planted, ``acted like there never would 
be a bad day on the farm.'' Clinton signed the legislation into law 
but hinted that important changes will be forthcoming.
