A REBELLION IS BREWING IN U.S. CAPITAL OVER STATUS
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attitude, the gritty urban ingredient that seemed
to go missing with the fall of Mayor Marion Barry Jr., is
threatening to return to the capital city's profile in the form of
a rebellious new license plate motto decrying the city's status of
``Taxation Without Representation.''
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to proclaim that motto on District of Columbia
license plates has been unanimously co-sponsored by city council
members to protest the fact that residents pay $2 billion in annual
federal taxes but have failed repeatedly to gain a voting
representative in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much chutzpah lately in this city, so why not
make this an in-your-face issue?'' said Mark Plotkin, a local
political broadcaster who was delighted to see the license plate
proposal begin with an angry taxpayer's e-mail message and quickly
spread through the city council.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning it even drew the endorsement of Mayor Anthony
Williams, the gentler, nonconfrontational executive whose image is
no match for the rapscallion style of Barry, who made a spectacle
of this city's political plight.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Williams had wanted new license plate mottoes with
optional pro-environment or pro-children themes. But he decided to
join the protest movement, describing the motto as ``a creative and
effective way to raise nationwide awareness about the lack of full
democracy in the nation's capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, led by the council's chairwoman, Linda Cropp, are
delighted that a city that must routinely police endless
visitations by protest groups might finally rise up on its own and
put a dash of contumely before the eyes of the 25 million tourists
who visit each year. President Clinton's limousine, like all other
cars registered here, bears D.C. plates now proclaiming the tepid,
noncontroversial plea to ``Celebrate &AMP; Discover'' the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Well worth discovering, Cropp emphasized, is the fact that the
district maintains its own statelike level of services and finances
80 percent of local government needs, roughly $3.5 billion, through
its 700,000 residents. The patriotic contribution in lives spent in
the nation's wars, she said, makes the case even more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this mirrors the frustration the colonials felt in
padding the coffers of England and having no say,'' Cropp said,
aiming to put the proposal on a fast track for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Under current House rules, the district has no representation in
the Senate, while in the House its taxpayers have Eleanor Holmes
Norton serving as their elected delegate, not representative. She
has only limited power to vote in committee but never on the floor
where laws are enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans don't even know the district lacks voting power
even though it pays the third highest per capita federal taxes in
the nation,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to happen,'' she said of the license plate
protest, predicting that Congress, which has review power over new
laws passed by the council, would shy from interfering with such a
basic expression of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The delegate drew strong agreement from David Marin, the
Republican spokesman for the House subcommittee on the district.
``I see absolutely no reason why this Congress will not support the
district's decision to highlight this inequity,'' said Marin, press
secretary for the committee chairman, Rep. Thomas Davis III, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Shapiro, a district native and angry taxpayer who proposed
the license plate to Plotkin in an e-mail message, first suggested
the edited version of the colonial rebels' cry of ``No taxation
without representation!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one out there knows how benighted we are,'' said Shapiro,
who made the proposal after a friend she considered well educated
``floored'' her by casually saying he thought district residents
paid no federal taxes and so did not deserve the right to vote in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we went to Yale together,'' Shapiro declared. ``This
guy is not some shrub from Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are clueless.'' she said, of such basic facts as
district residents not gaining the right to vote in the
presidential election until 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five percent of the nation's college graduates do not know
that district residents do not have equal voting rights in
Congress, according to a recent poll by Bisconto Research Inc.,
cited by Norton. When properly informed, 72 percent of those polled
supported voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   This provides evidence for the stand of Plotkin, the political
broadcast polemicist who helped stir up the license plate proposal.
He says the district badly needs to emblazon its plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been so appropriate lately,'' Plotkin complained. ``Now
maybe we'll actually roil some people.''

MARVIN L. STONE, 76, EDITOR OF U.S. NEWS &AMP; WORLD REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marvin L. Stone, a former editor in chief of U.S. News &AMP; World
Report and a former deputy director of the U.S. Information Agency,
died on Monday at his home in Falls Church, Va. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press said the cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was the chief editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report from 1976
to 1985, overseeing a shift toward the center from the more
conservative views of David Lawrence, the magazine's founder. Stone
also created opportunities for members of minorities at the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report was sold in 1984 to Mortimer B.
Zuckerman, the real estate developer and publisher. In 1985 Stone
accepted an offer from the Reagan administration to become the
deputy director of the information agency, and served until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 to 1995, he was president and chairman of the
International Media Fund, an organization dedicated to furthering a
free press in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Stone received a bachelor's degree in 1947 from Marshall College
in Huntington, W.Va., and a master's degree in 1949 from Columbia
University's school of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He was a European correspondent and then director for the Far
East at the International News Service from 1949 to 1958. He joined
U.S. News &AMP; World Report in 1960 as an associate editor.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, the former Sydell Magelaner,
known as Terry, whom he married in 1949; two daughters, Jamie Faith
Stone of Falls Church and Stacey Hope Goodrich of West Melbourne,
Fla.; and a son, Torren M. Stone of Falls Church.

NBA SCHEDULE SOON WILL BE BACK TO NORMAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   American sports fans should know by now the TV networks will do
whatever it wants when it comes to the scheduling of sports events,
so no one should be too cranky that it's taken almost a fortnight
to finish the best-of-five first round of the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Both NBC and Turner Sports wanted the first round extended so it
could maximize its inventory and get around the fact that Nielsen
ratings have declined, and with them the sales price for commercial
time.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has averaged a 4.4 rating thus far for 12 telecasts, a 19
percent drop from a 5.4 a year ago for 11 telecasts over the same
calendar period. The overall ratings for Saturday's tripleheader
was down 26 percent, and down 29 percent for Sunday's tripleheader.
The late Sunday game, Game 3 of the Lakers-Kings series, did a 6.3,
down 26 percent from the late game a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Nielsens for Turner's games on TNT and TBS have at least
stayed steady with last year at 2.3.
</P>
<P>
   In the litany of complaints about schedules, going to slo-mo for
the playoffs ranks far below transgressions like a 9:07 p.m. ET
first pitch for World Series games and college football bowl games
that kick off before lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule from here on should be more normal, with no more
than two days off between games. Should the Lakers beat Sacramento
in Game 5 tonight (7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Net), they'll open up the
next series against Phoenix Sunday at home, time to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW CHICK: The Lakers have made as many appearances on NBC
this season as the TV series ``Freaks and Geeks,'' meaning Bob
Costas is as familiar with them as Chick Hearn and Jack Nicholson.
He'll be there again Sunday if the Lakers advance to the next
round.
</P>
<P>
   He's as surprised as anyone that the Lakers have been forced to
a fifth game by the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that surprised the Kings hit them with an energy
burst on Sunday,'' said Costas. ``Anyone can have an off day. But I
was very surprised at the way Tuesday's game went. I thought they
would take command and end things, and it turned out they were
never in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you reduce any series to one game, with this much at
stake, you can't be 100 percent of the outcome. You sure would
expect the Lakers to win, but you can't be as sure of it as you
might have been a week ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' future is of great importance to NBC, which
televised many Laker games outside of the west coast with the
thought they were the team most likely to play in the finals.
Eliminate the major market team with the best record in the league
and the playoffs immediately become a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Lakers were to fall, that makes it wide open,'' said
Costas. ``I would still favor whoever comes out of the west over
anyone in the east, but we still have to see if Utah will be
around, too.''
</P>
<P>
   NO SKIPPING OUT: Say what you want about the parochial attitude
of the Atlanta Braves broadcast team, but no one on the broadcast
team has flinched when it comes to talking about the Mouth from the
South, John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Both Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren have been critical of his
actions since returning from suspension, which has included trading
barbs with fans in the stands, verbally assaulting media members
and blowing off security personnel placed near the Braves bullpen
in San Diego last week and Los Angeles this week.
</P>
<P>
   Caray took him to task for his comments to a photographer in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, KXTA's (1150 am) always-amusing Vic Jacobs said
he had an interview with Rocker set up, only to have the reliever
blow by him and slightly push him out of the way as he was running
into the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Rocker was just scared off by Jacobs' always intriguing
headwear.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS: HBO airs tape of the Lennox Lewis-Michael
Grant fight tonight at 10 p.m. It also debuts its new boxing
series, KO Nation,'' Saturday at 5 p.m. A pair of fights will be
featured on each broadcast, set for the moment at one telecast per
month ... ABC's lame duck coverage of the Kentucky Derby Saturday
begins at 1:30 p.m., with Al Michaels, Jim McKay and Lesley Visser
among t he cast. The Derby and other parts of the Triple Crown move
to NBC next years ... ABC will only televise a NHL Stanley Cup game
Sunday if Colorado and Detroit go to a Game 6 ... ESPN Classic airs
the 1970 Stanley Cup game that featured Bobby Orr's airborne goal
Wednesday evening ... In a move that has everyone confused, the
Senior PGA has signed a multiyear deal to air its events on
all-news CNBC after several years on ESPN. It sure seems like a bad
fit for all parties ... DirecTV is offering the 31-game, 16-team
Euro 2000 tournament to subscribers as a pay add-on package at a
cost of $149 for the series. The tourney begins June 10 ... Tracy
Dolgin has been promoted to President of Fox Sports Net. he
previously was COO ... Congratulations go out to veteran local

EDITORIAL: THE LESSONS OF SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 5:
</P>
<P>
   With one U.N. peacekeeping force under violent attack in Sierra
Leone, the international organization moved ahead on Thursday with
plans to dispatch another to Congo. The juxtaposition clearly
suggests a need to improve the planning and execution of such U.N.
missions to ensure that peacekeeping forces do not become
casualties in the conflicts they are supposed to help end.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone demonstrates the danger of sending a weak and
inadequately trained peacekeeping force into a country where there
is not yet a peace to keep. Rebels killed four Kenyan peacekeepers
this week and took hostage at least 92 U.N. troops and civilians.
The United Nations must quickly reinforce the 8,500 peacekeepers
already there and regain control of an unraveling mission.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the Revolutionary United Front, the group that
terrorized Sierra Leone throughout an eight-year civil war by
severing the limbs of thousands of civilians, signed a peace accord
with an elected government. But the rebels have flouted it ever
since. In February the Security Council authorized an increase in
the mission from 6,000 to 11,000 troops, but has not fully carried
out the plan because of lagging troop contributions from member
states. Washington can help by providing cargo aircraft to fly
Jordanian, Bangladeshi and Indian troops into Sierra Leone as soon
as they are ready.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. troops have responded to the recent rebel attacks by
surrounding the home of the rebel leader Foday Sankoh in Sierra
Leone's capital, Freetown. They should continue to do so. Sankoh
may be induced to arrange release of the hostages, but he has
failed to honor his pledge to disarm his forces and allow U.N.
troops to move into rebel territory, where they might interfere
with his lucrative diamond-smuggling operation. The peace agreement
gave Sankoh immunity from prosecution for crimes committed during
the war. It is now clear that Sierra Leone is unlikely to enjoy
real peace until he and his confederates are held accountable for
their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' mistakes in Sierra Leone should not be
repeated in Congo, which agreed on Thursday to accept a U.N. force
of 5,500 troops to monitor a tenuous cease-fire there. Richard
Holbrooke, the chief American representative to the United Nations,
rightly noted this week that the United Nations ``can't turn away
from crises like these.'' But an outside force should be called
upon to maintain peace, not to make it. A mission of this kind is
appropriate only when a realistic peace deal is respected by all
sides and a cease-fire has been established. An international force
must then be given the financial resources, manpower and
disciplined command needed to protect itself and effectively carry
out its mandate.

STARS HOPING TO HAVE LEHTINEN BACK FOR GAME 4
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Stars could get two-time reigning Selke
Trophy winner Jere Lehtinen back for Game 4 tonight against San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, stop rolling your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big deal. Really, it is. Sharks players compare it to
the boost they got when captain Owen Nolan returned Tuesday after
missing one game. Lehtinen, honored as the NHL's top defensive
forward the past two seasons, hasn't played in the playoffs, and
the Stars know they'll be a better team when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   Which they're pretty sure _ well, might be, if nothing goes
wrong _ will be tonight. He's ``really, really'' close, and skated
on the checking line with Mike Keane and Guy Carbonneau yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, so you've heard this before, have you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Lehtinen admitted. ``I've been here before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is one step away from returning to a lineup that has
included him only 17 times in 90 games this season. He has had a
little trouble getting from ``here'' to ``there,'' which is in the
lineup. Yes, one or two of Lehtinen's comebacks from a fractured
right ankle he suffered Oct. 16 turned out to be false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on four,'' Stars trainer Dave Surprenant said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Lehtinen's fourth comeback if he is indeed in the
lineup tonight, which won't be a definite until his ankle passes
inspection this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how he is in the morning. If there is no soreness
and he feels fine, then he'll play'' tonight, Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said before adding the ``but'' that usually comes along
with Lehtinen updates. ``There is no lock that this is going to
work. ... He's going to be a bonus if he comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big deal? Why should anybody care?
</P>
<P>
   The big deal is two-fold. One, Lehtinen isn't just another
player. Two, yesterday's practice was only the second time all
season the Stars have had the entire team on the ice. The other was
the team photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of bodies out there. It was kind of nice. You
don't do the drills as often,'' Stars center Mike Modano joked.
``It's probably been since October since we've had everybody out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Mike. Try June.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk hadn't signed in time for
Game 1, and by Game 2, Modano and Darryl Sydor were hurt. Every
time it looked as if the Stars were close to getting their entire
team back, somebody else got injured. (Technically, Brian Skrudland
and Shawn Chambers are still injured, but the Stars have replaced
them, knowing they won't return this season.) The injury carousel
continued all season.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's season spun more out of control than Lehtinen's.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the tale of his ankle has been well-chronicled. He
fractured his right ankle Oct. 16 against Nashville. He was
supposed to miss six weeks, blah, blah, blah. He tired to return
around Thanksgiving but couldn't. He returned on New Year's Eve but
was sidelined again in January. He returned for the regular-season
finale but reinjured his ankle that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough season that way,'' Lehtinen said. ``A lot of
guys out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have managed without all of them. They survived
without captain Derian Hatcher, playoff MVP Joe Nieuwendyk, goalie
Ed Belfour, et al. They've survived without Lehtinen for so long
that it's easy to forget what a loss he really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best two-way players in the league,'' Sharks
winger Niklas Sundstrom said. ``He's like Nolan for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sharks defenseman Jeff Norton: ``He brings what Mike Ricci
brings for us. He's the type of guy who maybe his name isn't in the
score sheet every night or something like that, but he shuts down a
top line.''
</P>
<P>
   These were only two players. Everybody said the same things.
</P>
<P>
   If Lehtinen isn't one of the best two-way players in the league,
it's because he is the best. He can shut down almost anybody, from
Peter Forsberg to Jaromir Jagr. He doesn't look to score big goals,
but he can. He kills penalties. He plays on the power play. He
makes teammates better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get Jere, I think that makes the third line a lot
better,'' Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   There is another if, of course, the if that comes when a guy
misses 65 regular-season games and hasn't played a second in the
playoffs. He'll provide a big boost if he can play his gritty,
tenacious, two-way game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something that a player, even though he's missed a
few games, forgets or loses,'' Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen says the biggest challenge will be mental. Physically,
he says, he's ready. Beyond ready. He has been swimming and
rehabbing and weathering the frustration, all because as he says:
``I think I can play still. Someday I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll see if today is someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Lehtinen said. ``I think so. We'll see how it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't roll your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If he isn't back tonight, it won't be too long in coming.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the difference will be noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you've been out you get hunger, and you have a lot
of energy,'' Lehtinen said. ``A lot.'' nn

AFTER RISING STEADILY, PRODUCTIVITY SLOWS IN FIRST QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ill.)  By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After rising spectacularly for six months, the productivity of
U.S. workers climbed more slowly in the first quarter, the Bureau
of Labor Statistics reported Thursday. Once again, most of the
improvement came in the manufacture of computers, machinery, autos,
appliances and other durable goods _ particularly computers and the
chips that go into them.
</P>
<P>
   Labor productivity rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate. That was
less than half the improvement in the two previous quarters and,
indeed, one of the poorer quarterly performances in the last two
years. But over the last four quarters, productivity is still
rising at a very strong 3.7 percent, unchanged from December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underlying productivity is still very strong,'' said James
Glassman, senior domestic economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The labor productivity growth rate published by the bureau is
the chief measure of the efficiency of the average U.S. worker.
When the growth rate rises at a 2.4 percent annual rate, that means
in effect that a steelworker, for example, has improved his
efficiency sufficiently to produce $102.40 worth of steel each
hour, up from $100. Or an auto mechanic, given better tools, or
simply working faster, has increased the garage's revenue from
repairing cars by a similar amount.
</P>
<P>
   Higher productivity means that companies collect more revenue
without employing more labor. The additional money can then go into
raising profits or raising wages, or both, without having to raise
prices. ``There is not a lot of inflation pressure coming from
labor costs yet,'' said Ken Matheny, senior economist at
Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis, ``but that situation could
quickly reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Unit labor costs, the outlay in wages and benefits to labor for
making a fixed amount of steel or repairing a car, did rise at a
1.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, after having fallen
in the two previous quarters. But over the last 12 months, from
April 1999 through March of this year, unit labor costs were up
only 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strong productivity growth _ averaging 2.8 percent annually
since the end of 1995, up from 1.8 percent in the first half of the
decade and even slower rates in most of the 1980s and 1970s _ helps
to explain why inflation has remained mild.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure of labor costs, however, is not as promising.
Hourly compensation _ covering every outlay for labor, including
bonuses and stock options, when they are cashed in _ rose at a 4.2
percent annual rate in the first quarter, up from 3.8 percent in
the fourth, the bureau reported Thursday. Although 4.2 percent
represents one of the smallest quarterly increases in the last two
years, many economists on Wall Street nevertheless expressed the
worry that inflationary pressures were developing.
</P>
<P>
   They note that the rise in compensation is now clearly
outstripping the rise in productivity, a trend not as clear in the
third and fourth quarters of 1999, when productivity grew at annual
rates of 5 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   If productivity growth is slowing, and it may be, Matheny said,
that would create inflationary wage pressures.
</P>
<P>
   For many economists, the most interesting issue is whether the
surge in productivity since 1995 reflects rising productivity
throughout the economy or is narrowly focused. And the answer
appears to be narrowly focused, on durable manufactured goods:
machinery, steel, appliances, vehicles, computers, semiconductors,
communications equipment and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Those goods account for 12 percent of the nation's nonfarm
business output, and if they are subtracted, then the productivity
growth rate for the remaining 88 percent is only 1.8 percent, said
Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts gave similar credit to the efficiencies achieved
in manufacturing durable goods, particularly computers,
semiconductors and communications equipment. Part of the strong
productivity growth in computers represents improvement in quality.
Workers, in effect, get credit for manufacturing ever more powerful
and more valuable computers.
</P>
<P>
   A drag on productivity in the first quarter came in the service
sector, in such things as legal and educational services and auto
repair. The number of hours worked rose more quickly in the first
quarter than output, contributing to the slower productivity growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department also contributed _ by making payments in
the fourth quarter for goods and services produced in the first.
The payments were added to fourth-quarter output, but the hours
worked to produce the prepaid goods and services were registered in
the first.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bayard Webster, a former editor on the science desk of The New
York Times and former Times science writer, died on Sunday at the
Heron Point Retirement Community in Chestertown, Md. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Webster worked for The Times from 1957 until he retired in 1985;
during that period he was an editor on the metropolitan desk as
well as on the science desk, and a writer specializing in nature,
wildlife and animal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   His versatility in science writing was shown by such headlines
on his articles as ``Alligators in Love,'' ``Elephants Have
Language Inaudible to Humans'' and ``Prehistoric Man's Killing of
90 Giant Baboons Suggests Early Ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster was born in East Orange, N.J., attended Wesleyan
University in the 1930s, became an account executive at a New York
advertising agency and was a Navy pilot with the rank of lieutenant
in the Pacific theater during World War II. He received the
Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal with Silver Star. After
the war he was an editor at The Baltimore Evening Sun before
working for The Times.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Martha Millspaugh, whom
he married in 1951; two sons, Kirk and Anthony; a daughter,
Jacqueline Webster Harwood; and two grandchildren.

WESTPHAL, SONICS MAKE POWERFUL STATEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ It happened moments after an embarrassing Game
2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were in an 0-2 hole, and their best-of-five series
against the Utah Jazz seemed hopeless. Even Gary Payton and Vin
Baker admit they never saw the writing on the locker room wall.
</P>
<P>
   Both stars had already bolted by the time Paul Westphal, armed
with a magic marker, marched over to a board. The Sonics coach
calmly scribbled ``We are coming back to Utah'' amid stark silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't look for a reaction,'' Westphal said. `` ... It was
just a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Seattle has written its ticket in this series,
winning two home games to draw even and force a decisive Game 5
Friday at 5 p.m. against Utah in the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   With their trapping defense, the Sonics reconfigured Utah's
predictable offense and molded the series into Westphal's prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, ``we are coming back to Utah'' means the animosity
between both teams is a notch higher. The pressure is greater on
the Jazz to avoid blowing what appeared to be an insurmountable
series lead.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the seventh-seeded Sonics are confident they deserve to
move on in place of the second-seeded Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Westphal made a good prediction,'' Payton said. ``We're
going back, and we just have to make it stick, and try to move on
in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised (it's come to this). Anything can happen in
basketball. They won two on their floor and we won two on our
floor. That's the way it's supposed to happen in the playoffs.
You're supposed to protect your home. Now we're going back there to
try and reverse it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Sonics are into script, they can also rewrite a few
records.
</P>
<P>
   They can become the sixth team in NBA history to overcome an 0-2
deficit and win a five-game series. The Sonics also are in position
to become the fifth seventh seed to upset a No. 2 seed in the first
round since this format was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an element of doubt has crept into the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 2-2, and you never like a deciding game, but that's what
we've got right now,'' Jazz forward Karl Malone said. ``And I don't
think we need any motivation (for Game 5). I don't think we need
any speech. I don't think we need to read about it or talk about it
because these are the kind of games you should be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics expect a physical, no-holds-barred contest. Verbal
jousting between Malone and Payton at the end of Game 4, which
included seven technical fouls and two ejections, set the tone for
Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to back down to anybody. We're going to play
hard,'' forward Vin Baker said. ``I think (the end of Game 4) was
jockeying, getting ready for Game 5. It's going to be a war and if
you're not ready for a war, you might as well stay home because
it's going to be dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to assume that the game will go in the favor of the
team that executes best.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team has changed strategy the past two games. Even
though the Sonics' defense has effectively taken Utah out of its
sets, the Jazz will run the same plays. Utah, which shot 41 percent
in Games 3 and 4, will dare the Sonics to be as good defensively a
third time.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the last time the Jazz lost three consecutive games
was the last week in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's (Utah coach) Jerry Sloan,'' Payton said. ``I played for
him in the 1996 Olympics. He's not going to change anything. That's
why he's still coaching. That's why he wins games. He's not going
to change his lineup (or game plan) to adjust to us. He's been
winning with it all this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they're going to be more aggressive. They're going to try
to get more calls. They're going to get the fans in the game.
They're going to try to get the referees on their side. We're just
going to have to try and defuse it and stay focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Composure will be a key.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Sacramento's ARCO Arena, the Delta Center is considered
the most rowdy arena in the NBA. It is also a place where the Jazz
seem to always get the benefit of the doubt with officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be the aggressor in this series,'' Westphal said.
``The officials know the Jazz like to flop and get calls. This game
will be determined by how aggressive we are, hopefully, not by
their flops.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said the Sonics' 21-20 road record verifies their
mental toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have guys that like to shut up the crowd,'' he
said. ``If they beat us, it won't be because the crowd intimidated
us. It will be because the Jazz played a better game than we did.
That's why we've had a good road record this year. We go into a
place and play the game and don't worry about whether people are
yelling for us or against us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the Sonics have already won regardless of the outcome.
They were the underdogs left for dead after starting the series
with a revamped lineup and some internal discord.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, though, have proven a point by beating the Jazz
twice _ a feat that made this old-versus-new-blood series
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still contend we have everything to gain by winning this
series, getting into the second round and coming together and
proving to ourselves that we're capable of winning,'' guard Brent
Barry said. ``I don't think that there is so much of that on the
line for them. But there's still pressure on both of us. We both
know if we lose we go home.''

CAMPAIGN NEWS IN BRIEF
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Wash.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUSH VOWS FIGHT IN CALIFORNIA
</P>
<P>
   On the second of what will amount to at least four swings
through California this spring, Gov. George W. Bush insisted
Thursday that he was determined to fight for the state's 54
electoral votes and would not repeat the actions of the last two
Republican presidential nominees, who made an early show of
interest in California and then effectively ceded it toward the end
of the campaign. ``I intend to campaign all the way through
November here,'' Bush said in Mission Viejo, where he visited a
charter school. Although Bush rarely edges up to anything
resembling a criticism of his father, former President George Bush,
who lost his re-election bid in 1992, the Texas governor said on
Wednesday that one reason Republicans had hit hard times in
California was that the party's presidential nominees in 1992 and
1996 abandoned any hope of winning the state.
</P>
<P>
   READ MY LIPS: NO SMIRK
</P>
<P>
   California wasn't the only place where Gov. George W. Bush
discussed his father's presidential campaigns. In an ABC News
interview to be broadcast Friday, he says his father seriously
undermined his credibility by breaking the ``read my lips, no new
taxes'' pledge that had helped him win the White House in 1988. The
Texas governor, who himself has taken a no-new-taxes pledge, says
the switch helped lead to his father's defeat by Bill Clinton. As
for President Clinton, Bush sharply criticizes his affair with
Monica Lewinsky. ``He and Mrs. Clinton have done a great job with
their daughter, no question about it,'' Bush says. ``But Bill
Clinton, unfortunately, in the last chapter of the 20th century,
embarrassed our nation.'' Bush gave Vice President Al Gore credit
for being ``a loving husband and a good dad.'' But he says he is
``a little worried about a man who tends to stretch the truth in
order to get ahead politically.'' And what of criticism of himself,
especially the charge that he wears a habitual smirk? ``I find a
great irony in life and I find humor,'' he replies. ``And I find it
amazing that people would spend time analyzing whether I was
smiling or not, as opposed to what my views are on education or
keeping the economy strong or cutting taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   DETERMINED TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Nethercutt R-Wash., who has been attacked repeatedly
in advertisements run by the U.S. Term Limits group because he
broke a pledge to serve only three terms, is countering with an
advertisement aimed at the head of Term Limits, Paul Jacob. It
begins by noting that Jacob is a convicted felon who served time in
1980 for draft evasion, asserts that Jacob's group is funded by
rich ``secret donors'' and concludes: ``So when you see the next
U.S. Term Limits ad, recognize it for what it is _ lies from
convicted felons.'' In 1994, Nethercutt upset Speaker Tom Foley and
became a hero of the term limits movement with a promise that, if
elected, he would serve only six years. He faces no major
Democratic opponent thus far as he seeks a fourth term, but he said
on Monday that he needed his advertisements to ``fight fire with
fire.'' The U.S. Term Limits response was a new advertisement
stating, ``Nethercutt will say or do anything just to stay in
power.'' &QL;

SONICS STRONGER AFTER ETERNITY ON THE EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ This morning begins the 11th day on the
precipice.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Columbus spent that much time at the edge of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Famous, or infamous, for their play in do-or-die moments during
the term of former coach George Karl, the Sonics under coach Paul
Westphal _ and under an NBA that no longer has a scheduling
conscience _ have stretched brinksmanship to new frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   While five teams in NBA history have come back from 0-2 deficits
to win a best-of-five playoff series, none spent 11 days attempting
to do so. Whatever happens Friday in Game 5 at the Delta Center,
the Sonics will enter the Guinness chronicles in the category of
``Cliffs, Hanging From'' as having the world's toughest
fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the lone gratifying development in spending much of the
spring dangling over the abyss is that for the last couple of days,
the Sonics have had company.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Jazz are with them, handholds crumbling to dust, too.
</P>
<P>
   But as recent newcomers, the Jazz, in a rare twist, are the
lesser experienced unit. The Sonics have been here so long the
cable-TV installer has found them.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for Sonics fans, the Jazz have fewer ways up
and away.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising aspect of the Sonics' riveting 105-94
triumph in Game 4 Wednesday at KeyArena that evened the series was
how little adapted Utah was to the changes in the Sonics defense
that debuted in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   For two games, the Sonics have blunted the best plays the Jazz
offer. Utah is groping for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the favorite, you have something that's been
working and then it stops,'' said Westphal Thursday. ``Suddenly
they say, `Do we change? Do we stick with it?' You start doubting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at (the opponent) and say the line from `Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid': Who ARE these guys?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Sonics this season qualify as a mysterious band of
desperados, as likely to shoot themselves as anyone else. But in
these 11 days, they have finally settled on a starting lineup and
an eight-man rotation, as well as attending school on what the Jazz
do best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep trying to find something that works, and when you do,
it's like enlightenment,'' said Westphal. ``Then you come together
and believe it. Then you tend to be able to play through the ups
and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does such enlightenment strike so belatedly in a season.
But when it does, a fair number of these almost inexplicable
postseason reversals have involved current and former Sonics
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sonics win Friday, Westphal will be the only coach in NBA
history to have come back twice from 0-2. In 1993, his Phoenix Suns
rang up three straight on the Los Angeles Lakers after losing the
first two at home.
</P>
<P>
   The second team to have pulled the feat (after Fort Wayne in
1956) was the 1987 Golden State Warriors, coached by none other
than George Karl and against the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics assistant coach Nate McMillan has experienced both ends
of the whipsaw as a player. He was a rookie in 1987 when the
seventh-seeded Sonics lost the opening game 151-129 to the
second-seeded Dallas Mavericks, then won three straight, including
two at UW's Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he was a part of the Sonics' collapse to the Denver
Nuggets, the first time a No. 1 seed lost to a No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan recalled vividly the '94 nightmare, from which only
Gary Payton remains on the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the favorite, at home, and you have to win the last
game,'' he said. ``It's pressure _ a lot of pressure. You wonder:
`What can we do? Coaches, come up with something!' There's nothing
you can do except go out there and try to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Denver, we started making excuses. We started
believing that these guys matched up well with us _ which they did.
That's similar to what Utah is facing. We've defended their best
plays very well, and stopped what adjustments they can make.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real confidence for them is they're going home. But they
are nervous about the fact that we have their number on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   A year before the Sonics' crash, Westphal had his big reversal,
although it was not an upset. The Suns were top-seeded in the West,
but the eighth-seeded Lakers took the first two games in Phoenix,
mostly because of an injury hampering Suns All-Star guard Kevin
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Westphal boldly predicted after Game 2 that the Suns
would win the series _ no equivocations or asterisks. The
spontaneous maneuver worked when the Suns, with Johnson back in
form, took three straight, eventually advancing to the Finals
against the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had to,'' he said of becoming the lightning rod
for media and fans. ``If I didn't believe in them, who would? The
last thing we wanted was finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took pressure off them and made them feel better that the
coach wasn't kicking them while they were down like everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also had then what the Sonics have now _ a ruthless top
gun willing to eat gravel and spit it at the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team had a crazy superstar who could rise to the occasion
in any circumstance,'' he said. ``For all that swirled around
Charles Barkley and swirled around Gary, the other players have
been able to understand that in a big game, both guys can do
amazing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have somebody like that on your team, you have a
chance to win a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Having returned from the cliff's edge once, doing the deed again
does not seem so preposterous to Westphal. And after this visit of
11 days, it would be a shame to let go now, just when it's become
familiar and comfortable.

RANGERS LOSE IN 11TH AS VAUGHN HOMERS FOR DEVIL RAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Rangers came close last night to
having a wonderful flight back to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They could have sat back, relaxed, popped a cold one at 30,000
feet and toasted many things: a winning road trip, an exhilarating
comeback, Mike Lamb's first career home run and maybe, if
everything had fallen right, John Wetteland's 300th career save.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't quite work out that way. After a wild ride over
the final six innings, the Rangers' gritty effort came to an abrupt
end when Greg Vaughn hit a one-out home run off Jeff Zimmerman in
the bottom of the 11th to give the Tampa Bay Devil Rays an 8-7
victory at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn almost single-handedly destroyed the Rangers' potential
late-night celebration somewhere over the Gulf of Mexico. He had a
broken-bat double off Tim Crabtree in the seventh that led to a
three-run rally and another run-scoring double off Francisco
Cordero in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make a much better pitch than that,'' Crabtree said.
``He flares it out to right field. The story of my season ... our
season.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been that bad lately, but instead of enjoying
themselves last night, the Rangers were left to wonder about
Vaughn's late-inning marvels and the continued vulnerability of
their once-dominate right-handed setup relievers.
</P>
<P>
   There is probably nothing more on the minds of Oates and
pitching coach Dick Bosman than Crabtree and Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our strength,'' Oates said. ``I told Bos during the
game, we've got to get things worked out. We depend on them. It's
been a rough month for Crabby, it's been a rough month for Zim. But
we have a long way to go. They'll get it back because we need
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both admit to being frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as consistent as I want to be,'' said Zimmerman, now
0-4 with a 7.36 earned-run average. ``Definitely a lot more of my
mistakes are being punished than last year, but I don't have to
same level of execution either.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to hold the game at 7-7, Zimmerman executed enough to
strike out Dave Martinez to start the 11th. He then threw one good
slider to Vaughn and one bad one. The bad one ended in the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his bread-and-butter pitch,'' Vaughn said. ``He made a
mistake. The first one was good. The second one was up a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree, with the Rangers up 4-3 on home runs by Lamb and Ruben
Mateo, entered the game for Esteban Loaiza with one out in the
seventh and a runner on second base. But Vaughn doubled down the
right field line to tie the game and, after Fred McGriff was
intentionally walked and Vinny Castilla popped out, John Flaherty
grounded a run-scoring single through the left side.
</P>
<P>
   A wild pitch brought home another run, and the Devil Rays added
an unearned run off Cordero in the eighth to take a 7-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, yeah, I'm frustrated,'' said Crabtree, whose ERA is
9.22. ``It seems like it's been on one good outing, one bad outing.
I can't get on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Zimmerman and Crabtree was nothing compared
with what the Rangers did to their old nemesis, Roberto Hernandez,
in the ninth. Down three runs, the Rangers hammered him for five
consecutive _ including clutch singles from injured infielders Luis
Alicea and Rafael Palmeiro _ to tie it at 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez left with no out outs, runners at first and second,
and the sparse remaining crowd booing loudly. But the Rangers
couldn't finish the rally against Devil Rays reliever Albie Lopez.
After Chad Curtis bunted the runners to second and third and Ivan
Rodriguez was walked intentionally, Lopez induced David Segui to
hit into an inning-ending double play.

 STRAIGHT SKINNY ON A WEIGHTY ISSUE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The city is throwing its weight behind people of
width.
</P>
<P>
   I would say ``fat people,'' but only fat people can say ``fat
people.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't say overweight, because that begs the question, ``Over
 &UR; what? &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the largeness lobby is prevailing upon the S.F. Board of
Supervisors to add height and weight language to city's
anti-discrimination codes.
</P>
<P>
   This is good, but I am hoping the language doesn't leave skinny
people falling between the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   I am a recovering thinny. Long ago I was thin. That's no longer
a problem, but I remember the pain, society's constant hurtful
reminders that thin ain't in.
</P>
<P>
   Who controls the world? Fat cats. Thin cats control nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If you are way overly sensitive, you are thin-skinned. When the
outlook is desperately bleak, your chances are slim and none. If
there's almost nothing left to choose from, it's slim pickings.
</P>
<P>
   If some weasel is looking for dirt or gossip, he asks, ``What's
the skinny?'' Lousy movie or book? Yeah, the plot was thin.
</P>
<P>
   If someone's fat, they are jolly, or prosperous. Someone's
skinny, they are lean and mean.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is in the Dumpster? Lean times, man, I don't have
one thin dime.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of substance in this column? Yes, the material is thin.
Other columnists write heavy stuff; I'm a lightweight. This is a
buncha crap, thinly disguised as journalism. Maybe I can beef it up
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   NORMAN ROCKWELL moment:
</P>
<P>
   Isadora Alman was motoring on Geary, came to a red light and
stopped behind a red sports car and an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Sports car had top down and speakers blaring rap at bone-vibrate
level, the F-word echoing off buildings. The SUV driver was glaring
at the sports-car driver while chatting on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the two of them a helmeted biker glided to a stop. He
lifted both hands from his handlebars and simultaneously gave the
rigid digit to both drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   IN CARMEL, they take their junk seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Wayfarer is having its annual Upscale Rummage
Sale on Saturday, and a special $10 ticket admits you to the
two-hour ``pre-sale'' tonight. After that: Slim pickings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there,'' says Daryl Glen. ``Don't want to miss out on
those castoff Monets.''
</P>
<P>
   WE GOT CARMEL covered here, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Montague read an item about a crime-log note in the Carmel
Pine Cone, a report of a dead bear cub that turned out to be a live
cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this was amusing,'' sniffs Ernie, ``Carmel does have
serious crime. Two years ago, high school kids on a drunken rampage
whacked my mom's mailbox with a baseball bat, causing a dent. It's
sad that you portray Carmel as a crime-free paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, Ernie. I thought Carmel didn't have mailboxes.
It's a felony to defraud a columnist, you know.
</P>
<P>
   MORE LARGE NEWS: People of width have erotic poetry, too.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   They don't say if snacks will be served, but I'm guessing yes.

   And once again, the skinnies are left out in the cold. There are

<P>
   RATS VS. LIZARDS: No, this isn't about politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatory of Flowers is wiping out a cockroach
infestation by unleashing hungry gecko lizards. But someone told me
rats will feast on the lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, says Sherri Ferris, apparently an expert on rats and
geckos. She says the lizards are too elusive for the rats, who
can't get into the building anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And: here's a handy tip offered by Tom Pettyjohn. He remembers
reading in Mother Earth magazine that rats cannot burp. So if you
have a rat problem, put out a saucer of cola. The little pests will
drink up and since the fizz has to go somewhere, they'll internally
belch their little brains out, thus failing the Pepsi Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether geckos or cockroaches can burp.
</P>
<P>
   FUSCHIA. That's the color of the window overhangs at the new San

   REVISIONIST HISTORY: The Kent State shootings were 30 years ago,
and memories fade. But the moment was memorialized by Crosby,

EARLIEST `OYSTER BAR' FOUND IN AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered the earliest well-dated example of an
oyster bar _ a fossil reef on Africa's Red Sea coast where
ancestral humans must have waded out to collect oysters, clams,
scallops and crabs some 125,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery shows that early humans had taken up coastal life
at least 10,000 years earlier than previously believed, and it
suggests that waves of those humans could have migrated out of
Africa and into Europe and Asia along the Red Sea coast, in
addition to other routes.
</P>
<P>
   An international team of geologists and anthropologists
unearthed a trove of stone tools from the fossil reef along the Red
Sea coast of Eritrea. The researchers like to call their discovery
``the world's first oyster bar.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also propose a far more significant meaning to their
find: It could help resolve long-standing debates about the origin
and evolution of modern humans and their migration routes out of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the current issue of the journal Nature describes
the scientists' discovery of two-sided stone hand axes and flaked
obsidian blades in the same fossil reef terrace as the fossil
remains of shelled bivalves and crabs.
</P>
<P>
   The site where the stone tools were found is near the Red Sea
coastal village of Abdur in Eritrea's Gulf of Zula. In the same
area, the team also discovered fossil bones of large land animals,
including elephants, antelopes, rhinoceros and hippopotamus.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the humans who lived at the site may have driven
some of those animals toward the sea and killed them there to
supplement their seafood diet, the team suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition was led by Robert C. Walter, a geologist with
Mexico's Center for Scientific Investigations and Higher Education
in Ensenada, Mexico, and included scientists from Mexico, Canada,
the United States, the Netherlands, France and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   According to Walter, the site offers the oldest evidence of
modern humans' adaptation to seashore living _ at least 10,000
years older than similar evidence from recent finds along the
shores of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, Walter said, that the people of 125,000 years ago
were living during a relatively warm ``interglacial'' period that
succeeded an earlier cold epoch when inland humans might have been
driven toward the east African coast as lakes and rivers froze or
dried up.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that Africa was the original home of humanity.
Recent studies of the genes of today's humans strongly imply that
modern Homo sapiens arose from more primitive species of Homo
between 200,000 and 150,000 years ago. Those studies also suggest
that humanity began spreading into Europe, the Near East, and Asia
well before 100,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, those modern humans eventually must have displaced
the evolutionary dead-end Neanderthal peoples, while other
migration waves eastward reached India about 60,000 years ago and
Australia by 40,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil bones of long-ago peoples discovered in Israel and Jordan
seem to confirm that pattern of northward and eastward migration,
and the discovery by Walter's team provides a significant clue to
at least one of the migration routes out of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our discovery opens up a whole new way of looking at early
man, his origins and immigration routes all along that coast _ and
probably during many more waves of migration,'' said Richard
Buffler, a geologist at the University of Texas at Austin who first
explored the site with Walter and his team three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bones of the larger animals, Buffler said, were found close
to the ``oyster bar,'' and must have offered the early humans who
lived there the world's first opportunity for ``surf and turf
dining.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the expedition hope to return to the site soon to
search for other coastal dwelling places by humans. But that hope
may prove difficult to realize right now, Buffler said, because of
the uncertainties raised by the border war between Eritrea and
Ethiopia.

GOP CANDIDATE REVEALS MORE CANDID _ AND PLAYFUL _ SIDE ON 
 CALIFORNIA SWING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  PALM SPRINGS, Calif. _ George W. Bush, on a campaign swing
through California, heads to the back of the plane where the press
is hunkered down and flashes a mischievous grin.
<P>
   He holds up a newspaper bearing the major endorsement that most
of them missed: The Weekly World News, a tabloid that scooped the
world this week by announcing ``Alien Endorses Bush for
President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New faces, new voices,'' Bush mugged. ``It goes to show I'm
willing to reach across certain demographic lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it a ploy, a practicality or simply good campaign strategy,
but the presumptive GOP nominee is definitely on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, once pegged as a candidate too scared to
deal with the sharks of the Fourth Estate, has not only begun
swimming with them, but seems playfully at home doing it.
</P>
<P>
   As he makes his second campaign trip in California since the
state's March 7 primary _ and vows to return in two weeks _ a Wall
Street Journal and NBC News poll released this week shows he has
seized the lead from Vice President Al Gore, 46 to 41 percent, with
his biggest gains in the crucial Midwest and among women and
Catholics. In a March poll, Bush trailed by three percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   And the polls numbers  &LR; aren't the only place where the campaign
has been pumped up. With the tough primary campaign behind him,
Bush has become noticeably more confident and comfortable, both in
public and in private.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Ana Thursday, he walked the Fourth Street Mall in the
heart of the city's Latino business district, hearing cries of
 &UR; ``Tejano!''  &LR; (Texan) and  &UR; ``Viva Bush, &LR; '' as he practiced his
Spanish on just about anyone who would listen. In the same week a
Field Poll suggested that Republicans have little hope of winning
them over, Bush visited the heart of Democratic Rep. Loretta
Sanchez's district, underscoring his push for new Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fiesta Market and Taqueria, the GOP candidate slid behind
a Formica table and ordered a  &UR; ``taco de carne asada ... &LR; 
 &UR; con todo, &LR; '' then plunged into the plate of meat, guacamole, salsa
and onions _ with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   His style contrasts markedly with that of Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, who stumbled badly with his comments on the
Elian Gonzalez case and whose press availability Thursday made news
because he so rarely meets reporters these days. Journalists
covering Gore's recent visits to California have been kept at bay
behind rope line _ keeping the candidate out of earshot of
reporters yelling questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been so unavailable ... and you have an opponent
who is making love to the press, and the press responds,'' said
state political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe.
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, who advises Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, said Bush
cannot win California because of his stands on key issues like
abortion, gun control and the environment. South claims the GOP
candidate's California outreach is ``designed more to placate the
Republican leadership than it is to influence any voters. It's all
a show.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bebitch Jeffe says Bush's success may reflect voters' desire
for more authenticity from their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are at a place where they're looking for someone who's
at least in their own skin,'' she said. ``Bush has gotten into that
mode, and Gore has gotten away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush, once distant from the media and sheltered in the
front compartment of his campaign plane, now joshes with reporters,
delivering self-deprecating lines and seizing their cell phones to
chat with their surprised families back home.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor gets serious when it counts.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference Thursday, he ramped up criticism of Gore,
saying the vice president has been a candidate more interested in
``tearing people down'' than offering ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like talking about me and my ideas,'' Bush said. ``I'm glad
he's talking about me and my ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appears more frank and confident answering questions
about his father's administration, telling an ABC News crew
Thursday that President Bush made a mistake when he reneged on his
``read my lips'' promise not to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Political insiders say the changes have come because Bush, after
months on the campaign trail, has clearly absorbed some tough
lessons _ many of them from Arizona Sen. John McCain, a onetime
rival for the Republican nomination, whom he will meet with
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of what he knows and what he articulates, yes, he's
begun to study,'' said Bebitch Jeffe. ``His people have begun to
program him, and I don't mean that in the negative sense ... he's
going through what he needs to in a presidential campaign, and he's
become more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Goodman, a longtime Bush friend and GOP consultant, said
``the more personable, comfortable, authentic, in-your-own-skin
side of Bush is starting to penetrate and permeate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bebitch Jeffe said Bush's strategy is ``brilliant: neutralize
Gore on the issues and make this all about character.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, California Democrats fairly fume when they discuss the
campaign these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush could be here on vacation for all the good it's going to
do him,'' said South, the political adviser to Gov. Davis. South
predicted that when the going gets tough in the fall, Bush won't be
as accessible to California media _ and won't be here much at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was quick to counter. ``It's wishful thinking,'' he
said Thursday, ``for Al Gore and his supporters to think I'm going
to write California off.''

 3 NATIONAL FIRMS SOUGHT CHRONICLE BESIDES HEARST  &HT;     By REYNOLDS HOLDING 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three of the nation's largest newspaper
companies competed aggressively to buy The San Francisco Chronicle
last year, but the Hearst Corp. trumped their efforts with a bid at
least $100 million more than the others were willing to pay, a
financial adviser to The Chronicle testified Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Los Angeles Times, the San Jose Mercury News
and USA Today said they would pay between about $400 million and
$550 million for The Chronicle, far below Hearst's winning offer of
$660 million in cash, said Jill Greenthal, a managing director at
investment bank Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed it was the highest price they (The Chronicle
owners) were going to see,'' testified Greenthal, who was called as
a witness by attorneys for Chronicle Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony came during the fourth day of trial in former
mayoral candidate Clint Reilly's antitrust lawsuit to stop Hearst's
purchase of The Chronicle. Chronicle attorney Gregory Lindstrom
used Greenthal's statements to undermine Reilly's contention that
other newspapers would have been willing to pay more for The
Chronicle if Hearst had not pre-empted the bidding with an offer
submitted before the August 10 deadline. The Chronicle announced
its sale to Hearst on August 6.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly argues in his suit that Hearst intends to create an
illegal newspaper monopoly in San Francisco by purchasing The
Chronicle and giving the Examiner to the Fang family, publishers of
the San Francisco Independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle and the Examiner currently operate under a joint
operating agreement that allows the two papers to share printing
and other business operations while maintaining editorial
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly claims that Hearst's proposed transfer of the Examiner _
with a subsidy of up to $66 million over three years _ to the Fang
family is a ``sham'' sale that will ensure the newspaper's demise
in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's testimony, though, offered the first public glimpse
into how The Chronicle solicited buyers and which potential
purchasers were most interested.
</P>
<P>
   According to Greenthal, The Chronicle's owners hired her firm in
February 1999 to evaluate their financial options. By May,
Greenthal had concluded that their best option was to sell The
Chronicle and Chronicle Publishing Company's other holdings,
including television station KRON, Chronicle Books and newspapers
in Massachusetts and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Greenthal valued The Chronicle at between $400 million and $610
million and the entire company at between $2 billion and $2.4
billion, she testified Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle to a sale of The Chronicle, she said, was Hearst's
right to match any offer for the paper. To skirt the problem, she
recommended bundling The Chronicle with Chronicle Publishing's two
other newspapers so that any sale would include all three papers
rather than just The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Before any offers had been solicited, Hearst said it would offer
$565 million for The Chronicle alone, but the bid was rejected,
said Greenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Three other companies quickly expressed interest in The
Chronicle and said they would be willing to take the other two
papers just to get it. The companies were Gannett Co., owner of USA
Today and the Marin Independent-Journal; Knight Ridder, Inc., owner
of the San Jose Mercury News and the Contra Costa Times; and Times
Mirror Co., then-owner of the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder, Greenthal testified, ``really wanted to buy'' The
Chronicle. ``They pursued it aggressively.'' Tony Ridder, president
of the company, indicated to Greenthal that it would be willing to
pay ``in the low to mid-400s for the Chronicle alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror said it would be willing to pay up to ``the low
500s,'' Greenthal testified, about the same as Gannett was willing
to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, meanwhile, asked Greenthal what it would take to buy The
Chronicle, and she suggested that the owners wanted at least $700
million. Hearst then offered $660 million, and a deal was struck,
she testified.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination by Reilly's attorney, Joseph M. Alioto,
Greenthal was forced to explain some of the scenarios presented to
The Chronicle owners in a confidential report. Two of the scenarios
dealt with what might happen after the joint operating agreement
expired in 2005: the first with one surviving newspaper and the
second with a ``newspaper war'' between The Chronicle and the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   With one newspaper, the report projected that advertising rates
would rise about 20 percent. With two competing newspapers, though,
the report said ad rates would drop between 10 percent and 15
percent and that newsstand prices would also drop for The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Greenthal responded that this was ``a worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alioto argued that the report proved consumers and
advertisers would benefit if both newspapers stayed in business
past 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``You call competition `war' and `pessimistic,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenthal pointed out that the report also projected that the
Examiner would lose $160 million if it stayed in business for three
years after the joint operating agreement expired in 2005 and that
Hearst would then shut the paper down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The Chronicle announced Thursday that the paper would
drop its newsstand price from 50 cents to 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto pounced on the announcement, saying that the drop
``appears to be as a result of (Reilly's) lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Falk, president of the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency, which runs the two newspapers' business operations, called
Alioto's charge ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The price drop was announced to Chronicle staff last week, and
new coin boxes for the news racks were ordered months ago, Falk
said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also announced Thursday that it would expand its
business section and publish a special section for San Francisco
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these initiatives are part of our strategic marketing
plan for the year 2000. They are all designed to better serve
readers and advertisers and have been in the planning stages for
several months.''

EDITORIAL: TIME WARNER'S POWER PLAY  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 5:
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner lost more than a skirmish over money with ABC this
week when it backed down from kicking the network's programs off
its cable service. Its blunt use of monopoly power was an instant
public-relations disaster, and in the long run could enter the
annals of business history as a famous strategic blunder. For by
overriding the information and entertainment needs of millions of
customers, Time Warner virtually compelled federal regulators to
take a more searching look at Time Warner's proposed merger with
AOL.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if Time Warner behaves this way now in response to
Disney, the parent of ABC and a media giant itself, how will it
behave after it joins forces with AOL? More to the point, will the
merged company use its control of cable television's vital
electronic pipeline to favor its own programs and deny competing
programs fair access to millions of consumers along that pipeline?
</P>
<P>
   Now that federal authorities have been forewarned about Time
Warner's muscular, proprietary attitude, they cannot consider
approval of the Time Warner-AOL merger a foregone conclusion. If it
is approved, the Federal Communications Commission or Federal Trade
Commission should impose stiff conditions that would make it
impossible for Time Warner to behave in the future as the company
behaved this week.
</P>
<P>
   It must be remembered that the FCC has a mandate to protect the
public interest in the communications and information industries.
Its responsibilities go beyond the narrow questions of
anti-competitive business practices examined by the antitrust
authorities in the Justice Department or, in this case, the Federal
Trade Commission. The FCC must protect the broader public interest
in the free flow of information and in open access to electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental problem for the FCC is that cable companies like
AT&AMP;T and Time Warner own not only the cable wire that runs into
everyone's home, but also some of the programs that are delivered
over that wire. That puts them in position to discriminate in favor
of the program channels they own, and therefore to filter the
information and commercial opportunities presented to cable
subscribers. Monopoly is bad enough in the orange juice or
suspenders markets. It is downright dangerous when it compromises
the public's right to diversified sources of news and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   What divides Disney and Time Warner is not so much the current
financial arrangement as it is the emerging issue of parity of
services and future income opportunities along the information
highway. Soon cable systems will offer a panoply of digital
services _ giving viewers the option, for example, of purchasing a
biography from a local bookstore about a historical figure in the
movie they are watching.
</P>
<P>
   Disney fears that Time Warner will provide better services for
its own channels, like HBO or CNN, than it will for Disney's
channels. To protect itself, Disney wants federal regulators to
require parity, or non-discrimination. Time Warner would be
required to provide equivalent services to all channels. Time
Warner rejects the idea, asserting that the principle of
non-discrimination sounds nice but cannot be defined or regulated
before the digital services exist. Besides, it says, the services
will be profitable and thus should be a matter of private
negotiation, not rule-making from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has a right to make this turf-guarding argument, but
the FCC cannot be paralyzed by it. This battle is not just over
cable broadcasts of quiz shows. Cable operators like Time-Warner
already provide high-speed access to the Internet. But cable
customers can use only the Internet services chosen by the cable
company. This has to be an open environment, where customers have
as full a choice among Internet companies as technology allows.
While this page supported the Federal Communications Commission's
decision last year to wait before regulating access to the
Internet, this week's events remind us of the pace of change and
the need for ongoing vigilance. There is now ample reason for the
FCC to act.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not that we are siding with Disney, but that
federal regulators, as they study the merger, should be guided by
the same principle in regard to Internet access and digital
television services: non-discrimination. Time Warner says there is
no need for federal regulations because it does not in fact
discriminate against programs it does not own and has promised to
provide open access to the Internet. But the public need not rely
on voluntary compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators balked last year because they did not know
how to enforce non-discrimination. But that need not bring
oversight to a halt. They can declare the principle of
non-discrimination without issuing a bevy of rules. The mere
announcement puts cable companies on notice that, as soon as
technology allows, they will be required to treat all Internet
companies and cable programmers the same. If they decide to design
their systems otherwise, they will be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Such a policy would probably serve the long-term financial
interests of this newspaper and many other media companies. But the
decision, in the end, must be shaped by the public interest.
Democracy requires an open communication environment. Monopoly
control over cable access threatens the flow of ideas and opinion
that feeds the democratic process, not to mention the emerging
electronic economy. For now, perhaps, only the principle of
non-discrimination can be declared, with the rule book to be
written as conditions require. But the Time Warner-ABC conflict
proves that it is time to start declaring principles and working on
instituting them.

NET WORTH: TOP-PERFORMING SMALL-CAP VALUE FUNDS ARE
WORTH  INVESTIGATING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A sentence buried in the next-to-last page of
Wednesday's Wall Street Journal caught my attention. It said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 1,596 stock mutual funds that have a rating of four or
five stars (from Morningstar), 342 are large-cap growth funds and
just five are small-cap value funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the market's disdain for small, cheap companies, I was
surprised that any small-cap value fund had earned four or five
stars. Naturally I was curious to see who these 5-foot-10-inch
players in the NBA were. The story didn't say, so I went to
 &LR; www.morningstar.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that no small-cap value funds rate five stars, and
only four get four stars. Although Morningstar's rating system is
based solely on past performance _ a criticism at the heart of the
Journal article _ I still figured these funds were worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   But first a bit of background. For the past few years,
investors, like car buyers, have been infatuated with anything big,
fast and expensive (think SUVs). Last year, they also lusted after
small, fast and expensive (think Porsches). That left anything
small and cheap sitting on the lot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, small-cap value funds trailed growth funds of
all sizes and large-cap value funds. But things may be changing.
With an average return of 2.1 percent this year, small-cap value
funds are at the top of a very small heap.
</P>
<P>
   These funds typically buy stocks that are cheap by traditional
yardsticks such as price-to-earnings or price-to-book value. This
kept most of them out of high-flying technology and Internet
stocks, which hurt their performance in 1998 and 1999 but helped
them this year.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar categorizes funds not by how they say they will
invest, but by how they actually invest. Funds in the
small-cap-value category own stocks with an average P/E ratio of
19.6 and a median market value of $586 million.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar analyst Christopher Traulsen sees three reasons to
reconsider small-cap value. First, growth funds have done so well
that investors may need to ``rebalance'' their portfolios by adding
value funds.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the takeover potential of small caps. ``When companies
get this cheap, it may escape Wall Street's notice, but it doesn't
escape the notice of big companies,'' Traulsen says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, small-cap value ``has a lot of upside potential, and a
lot less price risk'' than growth, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Before jumping into any fund, it's important to find out how it
achieved its returns. If a fund invested in stocks like Cisco
Systems, it may not be a good choice if what you really want is
small-cap value. That said, let's take a look at the four
small-value funds that earned four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Funds
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that two of the four were from the Royce family
of funds.
</P>
<P>
   All nine Royce funds specialize in small-cap value, which makes
these guys total experts, but also makes it a tad confusing if all
you want is one small-cap fund.
</P>
<P>
   The two that made the list are Royce Trust and GiftShares,
managed by Chuck Royce, and Royce Opportunity, managed by Buzz
Zaino.
</P>
<P>
   The Trust and GiftShares fund is an ``off-the-shelf trust'' that
requires investors to put money into an account for someone else _
usually a child _ for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both Royce funds are managed similarly, but GiftShares holds
fewer stocks than most funds. That makes it more volatile on the
upside _ and helped account for its good performance _ as well as
the downside. If you're holding for 10 years, volatility shouldn't
be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the Opportunity fund, Zaino says his ``eclectic approach''
looks first for undervalued assets on the balance sheet and then
for growth prospects on the income statement.
</P>
<P>
   He generally invests for 12 to 18 months. After that time, he
sells his winners ``and moves on to the next thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A former technology analyst, Zaino says he's ``not afraid'' of
tech stocks. During the Asian economic crisis of 1998, the sector
got very cheap and Zaino loaded up on chip-equipment-makers,
distributors and other tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, his big hits included Photon Dynamics and California
Micro Devices. ``This year, we've had Precision Castparts,
Benchmark Electronics and Coorstek.'' The last is a ceramics
company spun out of the Coors brewing empire.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Zaino is finding value in defense and retailing. He
thinks the military budget has been so depleted that defense
spending will grow no matter who becomes president. He especially
likes EDO and DRS Technologies and a couple others he's still
buying and won't name.
</P>
<P>
   He's also bullish on low-end retailers like Burlington Coat
Factory and Fred's, which should benefit from a probable increase
in the minimum wage and a possible tax cut. ``That (money) goes to
people with a high propensity to spend. You'll see it in those
stores fairly quickly,'' Zaino says.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger retailers like Kohl's, Kmart and Wal-Mart also will
benefit, but those companies are trading at 40 to 50 times
earnings. The companies Zaino likes are trading at eight to 10
times earnings, which gives them less risk and greater upside
potential. ``If something goes from six to seven times earnings,
you just made 16 percent. You get that statistical bias,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Royce also likes retailers such as Ross Stores, Claire's and
Urban Outfitters, the last of which ``is in a class by itself. It's
very eclectic and fashion forward _ not the kind of thing you're
ever going to buy on the Internet. The stock fell by 60 percent
when the company missed earnings estimates, and Royce expects at
least two more bad quarters. ``We're not afraid to buy into
short-term disappointments,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Third Avenue Value
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who thinks small-cap value investing is dull has never
talked with Marty Whitman, the long-tenured manager of the Third
Avenue Value fund.
</P>
<P>
   Calling from the Bahamas, the 75-year-old ``vulture investor''
says he'll continue managing the fund ``as long as I'm  &LR; compos
mentis &LR;  (sane). What else am I going to do? If I could qualify to
be a tennis pro, I'd quit tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Third Avenue doesn't bill itself as a small-cap fund. In fact,
it can buy a wide range of big, small, foreign and domestic
equities.
</P>
<P>
   But its median market capitalization of $1.4 billion _ meaning
half of the stocks in the fund are worth more than $1.4 billion and
half are worth less _ still places it in Morningstar's small-cap
value category. (The category ranges from a median market cap of
$325 million to $1.7 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   The fund's larger market cap is partly a result of its success
and its emphasis on minimizing taxes. Compared with the Royce
funds, Whitman is more reluctant to sell his big winners because a
sale triggers capital gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And Whitman has his share of winners. Like Royce, he made a big
bet on technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997 and 1998, when the semiconductor equipment industry
was going through its worst depression, we loaded up and it got to
be almost 40 percent of our assets,'' Whitman says. ``We've
lightened up on some of the more glamorous ones,'' such as Applied
Materials and KLA Tencor. His fund remains the largest shareholder
of San Jose, Calif.'s Silicon Valley Group.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is expanding its positions in real estate, health care,
agricultural equipment and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're steady buyers of Catellus,'' the big San Francisco real
estate developer, Whitman says. ``Nothing is easier for us to
analyze than well-managed real estate selling at a discount from
appraised value.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Whitman will turn his attention to beat-up Internet
stocks. ``I met recently with my research staff. I said we're going
to have a reprise of the semiconductor equipment (sell-off) 10
times over in dot-coms, but the goddamn problem is it's much harder
to analyze. At least 80 percent of the dot-coms are phony
baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; State Street Aurora
</P>
<P>
   The State Street Research Aurora fund is managed by the
self-effacing Rudy Kluiber. He attributes his recent success to
painstaking research and luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our companies got taken over. That helped,'' he says.
But acquisitions are mixed blessings. ``You get a short-term pop,
but then you have to go back to the drawing board.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his big takeovers last year was Wyman-Gordon, which is in
the glamorous business of forging aerospace parts such as a landing
gear. It was acquired by Precision Castparts.
</P>
<P>
   Among his non-takeover winners is Coherent, a Santa Clara,
Calif., maker of medical and industrial lasers. ``My average cost
is probably $17. It's at $54 now.'' he says. The stock represents
about 5 percent of his fund, but ``it's not necessarily one I'd buy
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kluiber says Coherent is ``a leader in its field, it's
profitable and its growth is accelerating. The sizzle is their deep
UV lasers for the semiconductor business. They also have a budding
optical components business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sectors he finds inexpensive include auto parts, rail supply,
casinos and financial institutions. Tech stocks make up 15 percent
of his fund _ matching Morningstar's small-cap-value category
average.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges facing small-cap managers is a
belief that as technology forces prices down and markets become
more global, companies will have to achieve economies of scale to
compete. In other words, bigger is better.
</P>
<P>
   Kluiber says, ``That very well could be true. That's why we try
to make sure our small companies are leaders in what they do. It's
just that their markets are small. A small company that tries to
compete against Microsoft in the operating systems market is not
going to survive. A large company in a small niche can do well.''

 PRICE WAR IS GOOD NEWS FOR BAY AREA READERS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's a good time to be a news junkie.
</P>
<P>
   An old-fashioned newspaper war is breaking out in the Bay Area,
with several major dailies announcing plans to cut newsstand prices
to a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle joined the fray Thursday by saying it will cut its
newsstand price in half, to 25 cents from 50 cents, beginning
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows word from the San Jose Mercury News that it,
too, plans to lower the newsstand price of its paper in San
Francisco, to 25 cents from 35 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the Contra Costa Times said yesterday that it
will also cut its newsstand price, to 25 cents from 50 cents, also
beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that increases newspaper competition is a good
thing,'' said Steve Barnett, a University of California at Berkeley
law professor specializing in the publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had far too little economic competition,'' he said.
``It's very welcome that a newspaper war is breaking out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most observers, Barnett cited the pending acquisition of
The Chronicle by Hearst Corp. and its pending sale of the San
Francisco Examiner as being behind all the changes in the local
media market.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to assume it's a reaction to Hearst's move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Bay Area newspapers are wasting no time in
trying to steal away readers from rival dailies, not to mention
hang on to existing readers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury News, with a daily circulation of about 300,000, was
the first to announce plans to drop the price of its papers in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a price cut, Mercury News Executive Editor David
Yarnold was quoted last month as saying his paper would beef up its
San Francisco bureau and begin publishing a San Francisco section
by early summer.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnold was unavailable for comment yesterday. But Patty Wise,
Mercury News public relations manager, had this to say from a
prepared statement: ``We are in a competitive environment and we do
not discuss our business plans.''
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that she was not contradicting Yarnold's earlier
statements, Wise stressed that the Mercury News' plans for San
Francisco are ``a liquid situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Falk, the president and chief executive of the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency, which is responsible for all
noneditorial aspects of The Chronicle and Examiner, admitted that a
perceived threat from the Mercury News played a role in The
Chronicle's price cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle has a daily circulation of about 457,000. The
Examiner, with a daily circulation of about 107,000, already sells
for 25 cents during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to sell more copies,'' Falk said. ``The Mercury News,
combined with our March publishing numbers that showed circulation
to be down, motivated us to get serious about turning around
newspaper trends.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the lower prices would not extend to The
Chronicle's subscription sales, which will remain at 50 cents a
copy. Falk said this wouldn't change even if the Mercury News
slashed its delivery charges as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Falk did say the lower newsstand price will
probably last for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   George Riggs, publisher of the Contra Costa Times, had no
illusions about why his paper, with a daily circulation of about
173,000, was jumping on the price-cut bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're following your lead,'' he said. ``If you're moving to a
quarter, we're moving to a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, publisher of the Independent and publisher-in-waiting
of the Examiner, could not be reached for comment on how he would
price the Examiner if, as planned, he were to move it to morning
publication.
</P>
<P>
   For now, in terms of a price war, he has all other Bay Area
newspapers beat. He gives the Independent away, three times a week.

 E-TRADE GAINS ON SCHWAB, SURVEY SAYS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The sound you hear in the online brokerage
market could be E-Trade breathing down Charles Schwab Corp.'s neck.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of industry market share released Thursday by the
brokerage firm U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray shows the No. 2 Internet
broker narrowing the gap with San Francisco's Schwab by a full
percentage point in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   During a quarter in which the online brokerage industry's total
trades per day catapulted an astonishing 69 percent from the fourth
quarter of 1999, TD Waterhouse, Fidelity Investments and Ameritrade
also gained on the market leader.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade would be poised to overtake its rival in about a year
were it not for Schwab's recent purchase of CyBerCorp, No. 9 in
trading market share and the fastest-growing firm among the top 10,
said Piper Jaffray analyst Stephen Franco, the report's author.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you fold CyBerCorp in, E-Trade might not catch them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The breathtaking growth in online trading early this year
reflected the continuing move of investors to the Internet plus a
cresting of the mania for technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, brokers stirred the pot by spending a record $600
million on advertising, up from $400 million in the previous
quarter, Piper Jaffray estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Menlo Park, Calif.'s E-Trade spent $154 million, while
Ameritrade shelled out $55 million. They were rewarded with the two
largest trading-volume gains among major brokers, 74.1 percent and
82 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   With many stock prices down, trading has subsided in the current
quarter, Franco said. He predicted a 15 percent fall in overall
volume from first-quarter levels.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab registered an average of 293,318 trades per day during
the latest period, equaling 21.4 percent of the total market.
Buoyed by heavy ad spending, E-Trade posted 214,573 trades per day,
raising its share to 15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures compared with a 22 percent market share for Schwab
and 15.3 percent for E-Trade in the fourth quarter of last year.
And the gap was much wider the year before that. At the end of
1998, Schwab had a 27.6 percent share, while E-Trade was third
behind Waterhouse, with 11.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Schwab lost market share, its trading volume still jumped
65.3 percent, Piper Jaffray calculated. ``The firm should be
extremely pleased,'' Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Schwab said it looks at other market share
measures. ``Trades are important. So are assets and so are
accounts,'' said spokesman Dan Hubbard. ``You've got to look at all
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab continued to have a substantial lead in online customer
assets, with $417.7 billion compared with No. 2 Fidelity's $328.3
billion. E-Trade was a distant fourth by that measure behind
Waterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which operates under the Powerstreet name, took the
top spot in the number of online accounts, with 4.2 million
compared with Schwab's 3.7 million. E-Trade was third with 2.4
million.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Whenever someone hollers ``coach'' during the Comets' training
camp, Van Chancellor or one of his assistants is likely to turn an
ear in the direction of the caller.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Rizzotti might do so as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no. Not now. I'm a player now, not a coach,'' Rizzotti
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her second season as a guard for the Comets, Rizzotti,
25, has just completed her first year as the women's basketball
coach at the University of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   One might think the rigors of coaching at the NCAA Division I
level and being one of the youngest coaches in the college game
would tax a person's physical and emotional mettle enough to want
to take it easy during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But for someone who has played in the now-defunct American
Basketball League and been part of the second NCAA team to go
undefeated and win a national title (Connecticut Huskies in 1995),
squelching the competitive fires can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the fact that Rizzotti comes from an athletic,
competitive family, and the reason she is back fighting for her
place among the three-time defending WNBA champions becomes
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My love of the game, both playing and coaching, is too strong
now,'' she said. ``I feel like I'm young. I feel like I have a
passion to get out on the floor. The closer the season comes, I'm
itching to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Very few women get the
chance to play professional basketball. I've got to take that
chance while I have it. The coaching just falling in my lap was a
very fortunate thing. And I'm going to take that chance while I
have it, too. I'm young and have energy. I'd rather be busy doing
two things I love rather than not be busy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning a WNBA championship ring with the Comets last
summer, Rizzotti didn't actively go in search of the coaching
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The female athletic director at the university called me and
offered the job to me,'' Rizzotti said.
</P>
<P>
   So Rizzotti took her competitive nature to Hartford, grabbed the
reins of a young team and guided the Eagles to a 14-14 record.
</P>
<P>
   That might appear mediocre compared to the 36-1 mark and second
NCAA championship in five years won by UConn. But in recent years,
the women's basketball program at Hartford had struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had an 8-19 record the year before I came. That's all I
know about,'' Rizzotti said. ``I didn't check into what it was
before. That didn't really matter to me.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times during the past season that Rizzotti wondered
when the Eagles would grasp her concepts and begin to turn the
program around.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-1 start served as inspiration. But when the Eagles
approached mid-December and the usual rash of tournaments, their
plight had worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went up to a tournament, we had a really bad week of
practice, and I felt like I was wanting too much from them right
away,'' Rizzotti said. ``I felt I was expecting them to make all
these changes overnight. And I was frustrated when I'd come back to
practice (the following day) and they hadn't made the changes I
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I told them in a pre-game speech (during the tournament)
that my expectations were too high, and I just wanted them to go
out there and have fun. It kind of (angered) them a little bit that
I'd said I had set my expectations a little too high. They went out
and played their best game of the season to that point. And it just
kind of grew from that. They learned from each experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But it pained Rizzotti to reach that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I went to the office in the morning and
wondered what I was going to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rizzotti said she never second-guessed her decision to
accept the coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   The root of her frustrations, Rizzotti said, could be traced to
the team's youth. There were only two seniors on the roster, and
the Eagles' starting five included two freshmen, two sophomores and
a junior.
</P>
<P>
   They began to jell as a team in December, Rizzotti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just got better and better. Some of the frustrations were
still there (later in the season),'' she said. ``We still had our
ups and downs. But when the season was over, I think the important
thing was they gained confidence, they did have pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you build a program, with kids who want to get out
there and they believe in themselves. And that's what I think we
had.''

TIME WARNER-DISNEY FIGHT IS A BOON FOR SATELLITE TV
</HEADLINE>
  By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dispute between Time Warner and the Walt Disney Co. that led
to ABC's being blocked from 3.5 million homes earlier this week is
proving to be a boon for the satellite television industry.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 Time Warner subscribers have asked for the coupons
that entitle them to receive free equipment from DirecTV, a unit of
the Hughes Electronics Corp., which is a division of General
Motors, and thousands more have subscribed to the Dish Network of
EchoStar Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dispute began, DirecTV executives said, 20,000 Time
Warner subscribers in Houston and another 5,000 in New York and Los
Angeles have requested full rebate coupons, but it is unclear
exactly how many of them have bought the systems.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, EchoStar told retailers to start giving away its
Dish Network equipment to Time Warner customers in those cities and
Philadelphia if they agree to buy its service for one year.
Executives from the company were unable to say Thursday how many
people had responded, but they said it was in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies said they began planning to
capitalize on the dispute months ago after Disney, which owns ABC,
and Time Warner began to hit an impasse. The executives said they
saw the situation as a perfect national advertisement for their
services. Their marketing campaigns describe their services as
superior to the cable services and describe the cable companies as
arrogant and inattentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an opportunity to say `Look, there is an alternative
and we're going to make it easier for you to switch to Dish
Network,''' said Charles Ergen, the chief executive of EchoStar.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at DirecTV said they were also making plans to step
into the fray, but their plans accelerated in February, when they
were approached by ABC on a joint agreement to give away dishes for
two weeks in Houston as a way to put pressure on Time Warner there.
The two companies are splitting the cost of the rebates, though
neither would disclose terms of their agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The DirecTV offer was revived in Houston and expanded to include
New York and Los Angeles on Wednesday, after Time Warner had
already agreed to return the ABC signal to its systems, at least
until a new July 15 negotiating deadline passes. The deal, which
includes a $99 rebate and free installation, is expected to stay in
place for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first priority was uninterrupted service for all of our
viewers,'' said Julie Hoover, an ABC spokeswoman. ``In light of the
recent threat, we thought it was important for viewers to have the
security of an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives said they considered Disney's partnership
with DirecTV an act of bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it is something that we think they should suspend as
a way of demonstrating good faith,'' said Mike Luftman, a Time
Warner Cable spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Time Warner began offering refunds and a free
one-month subscription to one of its premium movie services to the
customers who were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Time Warner's chairman, Gerald M. Levin, called
for a cooling of the heated exchanges; ABC executives said that
Robert Iger, the president of Disney, spoke by telephone with Time
Warner's president, Richard Parsons, about resuming talks.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives said it was impossible to tell exactly
how much damage the satellite offers from DirecTV and EchoStar had
done to its bottom line. Neither satellite company can say how many
of the people who requested rebates actually installed the service
and disconnected their cable.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gerbrandt, a media analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, said
each subscriber represented $4,000 to $6,000 of potential revenue
over the life of a contract.
</P>
<P>
   While the loss may hurt, Gerbrandt said, there are much bigger
things at stake in the negotiations _ like how much power Time
Warner is going to have after it is merged with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are big boys playing for large stakes,'' he said. ``It's
not about 25,000 subscribers.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ There are some days when the manager of a big-league club
can simply walk the lineup card out to the home-plate umpire, take
a seat in the dugout and enjoy the game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker doesn't figure to have many of
those this season.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the 2000 Astros will offer little margin for error, and
Dierker had more than a few decisions to make Thursday in the
Astros' 6-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Scott Elarton turned in six strong innings and
Dierker used three relievers to get through the final three frames
as the Astros avoided being swept in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The solid performance by the pitching staff was supported by a
collection of clutch hits. Five of the Astros' six runs scored
after two were out, including the three that came on Jeff Bagwell's
game-breaking double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   It was timely in more ways than one for Bagwell, who had only
five hits in his last 25 at-bats prior to Thursday's big hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was good to see,'' Dierker said. ``Baggy has been in a
little minislump, but he doesn't stay in one for long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' slump has meant few save opportunities for closer
Billy Wagner, who finally picked up No. 4 Thursday. It was his
first since April 12 against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dierker tries to guard against using Wagner for more
than one inning, the fourth-year manager wisely called on his
hard-throwing lefthander to bail Jose Cabrera out of a two-out,
bases-loaded jam in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner retired the Cubs in order in the ninth to seal the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't rest easy until we got the final out,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker had another tough call to make earlier, after Elarton
had completed his sixth inning having thrown just 73 pitches.
Understandably, Elarton wanted to remain in the game, but Dierker
had other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elarton was outstanding,'' Dierker said. ``I practically had
to hold him down to keep him from going back out there. His pitch
count wasn't high, but (pitching coach) Vern (Ruhle) and I wanted
to lock in a good performance, get him a win and get his confidence
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to leave him out there and have him give up a
cheap home run or two and maybe not get the win.''
</P>
<P>
   For that theory to pay dividends, the bullpen had to do its job,
which has been anything but a given this season. However, the
relievers have been more consistent of late.
</P>
<P>
   Righthanders Mike Maddux and Cabrera weren't airtight Thursday,
combining to allow five hits and a run in 1 innings. But they
didn't surrender the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tough day to pitch,'' Bagwell said. ``To hold the
Cubs to just two runs on a day when pop-ups were going out of the
park, our pitchers did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton and Cubs starter Ismael Valdes, a couple of pitchers
battling back from injuries, matched up pretty evenly through the
first four innings, but that was as long as Valdes could keep it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, making his first start of the season, turned the game
over to the Cubs' bullpen after just 4 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had great, quality pitches,'' Valdes said. ``Overall, I
think it was a great outing for me. It's good to not feel pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton allowed just four hits and a run in the best of his
three starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really relaxed out there,'' Elarton said. ``In the first
two starts, I probably had a little doubt in my mind. But I felt
really good out there. I felt like I had better velocity, and my
curveball was better. The sixth inning was my best as far as
command. I wanted to go back out there in the worst way, but I'm
not one to argue.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting right fielders provided the early scoring, with the
Astros' Richard Hidalgo hitting a solo homer in the second and
Chicago's Sammy Sosa matching him in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi's seventh-inning homer off Maddux accounted for the
Cubs' other run.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's home run was his second in as many days and his eighth
of the season, tying Bagwell for the club lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking for a pitch to drive,'' Hidalgo said. ``I
don't really consider myself a home-run hitter. I'm just trying to
make good contact and hit line drives. I'm seeing the ball pretty
well right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell broke the game open in the fifth when Cubs manager Don
Baylor resorted to an interesting bit of strategy, lifting the
righthanded Valdes, against whom Bagwell is 3-for-22, in favor of
lefthander Mark Guthrie with the bases loaded and two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell foiled the move with a three-run double to put the
Astros on top for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to throw a sinker away, and I made a bad
pitch,'' Guthrie said. ``It wasn't the pitch. It was the execution
of the pitch that was bad. It was a horrible pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's bullpen was populated mostly by lefthanders, and he
said he was saving righthanders Kyle Farnsworth and Rick Aguilera
for later in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many people bring in a lefty to face me unless it's their
closer,'' said Bagwell, whose career average is about 30 points
higher against lefthanders. ``But (former Dodgers manager) Tommy
Lasorda used to bring him (Guthrie) in to face me because Guthrie's
got that good forkball, and I've been known to swing at pitches in
the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to come through in that situation because I've had
some opportunities lately to drive in some runs and I haven't been
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros padded their lead with Tim Bogar's sacrifice fly in
the eighth and an RBI double by Ken Caminiti in the ninth.

APOLOGY FOR SUBWAY KILLING, THEN THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew Goldstein, the schizophrenic man convicted of
pushing a young woman to her death in front of a speeding subway
train, stood in a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday, blamed a
``psychotic incident'' for the attack and apologized to the
victim's parents for the nightmare he created. He was then
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the murder, the maximum
possible sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein made his brief statement to the family of the victim,
Kendra Webdale, shortly after her mother, Patricia Webdale, said in
a tearful speech that Goldstein had learned over the years that
because he was mentally ill, he was never held accountable for 13
past assaults on doctors, medical staff and strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my contention,'' Webdale, speaking before Justice Carol
Berkman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said, ``that if Andrew
Goldstein had been held responsible many incidents ago, there would
not have been 13 assaults and one homicide committed by him. His
ongoing aggression was tolerated and deemed acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   During the sentencing hearing, Berkman and the prosecutor joined
Webdale in saying that the attack stemmed from the state mental
health system's failure to punish Goldstein for past assaults.
</P>
<P>
   That view stood in sharp contrast to the long-running contention
of defense lawyers and mental health advocates that Goldstein's
attack on Webdale in January 1999 happened because Goldstein had
received shoddy care from the state's underfinanced mental health
system. Goldstein's attack on Kendra Webdale focused intense
scrutiny on the state mental health system, which had repeatedly
sent him back to the streets despite his history of violence and
mental illness and his requests for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein admitted pushing Webdale to her death on Jan. 3, 1999,
but blamed his schizophrenia for his actions and pleaded not guilty
by reason of insanity. After his first trial ended in a hung jury
last November, a second jury convicted him of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the court on Thursday, Goldstein seemingly
dismissed the symbolism and political debate surrounding his case.
He said that it did not matter to him whether he served his
sentence in a mental institution or state prison, which is where he
will be sent because of his guilty conviction. ``Granted, you kill
somebody, you deserve punishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But moments later, Goldstein, 30, seemed to attribute the
killing to his failure to take his anti-psychotic medication. If he
had taken it the morning he killed Webdale, ``this thing would have
never happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor in the case, William Greenbaum, argued that the
meaning of the case had been twisted by defense lawyers. ``What a
slur on the mentally ill to have this individual made a poster
child for mental illness,'' Greenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum repeated his argument that Goldstein was a
manipulative, high-functioning schizophrenic who used his mental
illness as a crutch.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's lawyer, Kevin Canfield, scoffed at that account. He
said Goldstein was clinically insane and asked Berkman to sentence
him to the minimum sentence of 15 years to life in prison. ``He's
not a monster, judge, he never was,'' Canfield said.

MRS. CLINTON ATTACKS BUSH ON HIS PLANS TO CUT TAXES
</HEADLINE>
  By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton finished her tour
through each of the state's 62 counties Thursday with a sharp
attack on George W. Bush's tax cut proposals, leaving her mostly
Republican audience in silence.
</P>
<P>
   The last 10 months of campaign swings and listening tours have
taken Clinton from the farm of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the
retiring senator, in Delaware County, to the shore of Lake
Champlain in, of all places, Clinton County, which she chose as her
last stop. In many towns, Clinton has been treated more as a
celebrity and less as a political candidate. Even Republicans who
have no intention of voting for Clinton have come to get a glimpse
of her.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining her opposition to Bush's call for a $1.3 trillion
tax cut over 10 years, Clinton said his plan would hurt efforts to
win more federal money for New York because such broad-based tax
reductions would deplete the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support Governor Bush's large across-the-board tax
cut,'' Clinton said. ``I do not think that's right for New York or
our country. The last thing we need right now before we can
eliminate some of that deficit with Washington is a large
across-the-board tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's audience had been enthusiastically applauding her
speech until she broached smaller tax cuts than those favored by
Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. But many
in the audience stopped practically in midclap, in apparent
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Racette, a mortgage originator, said he counted no fewer
than 10 spending plans hidden in her speech. ``She said an
across-the-board tax cut doesn't make any sense,'' he said.
``Hopefully, we will beat her 54 to 36 in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the upstate region of New York is predominantly
Republican territory, it is considered potentially critical this
year because the Senate race has been viewed as an extremely close
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Clinton Community College, the first lady gave a
localized version of her standard stump speech, pledging to try to
improve the border crossing at Champlain, N.Y., and to try to win
federal subsidies for natural gas distribution systems, proposals
that were both greeted with sustained applause.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the speech, she said she recognized
that her audience might not be receptive to her views on tax cuts.
``I said I know there are a lot of Republicans in the audience,''
she said. ``I am well aware a lot of Republicans are sorting out
where they are on this issue, but I want people in the North
Country to know I support targeted tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   She criticized her likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for stating at a town hall meeting Wednesday that he would
vote for Sen. Jesse Helms to continue as chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. She said Helms' opposition to the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and to U.N. conventions on
women's and children's rights had hurt U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hoping that every New Yorker not only heard the mayor say
he would vote for Senator Helms to continue as chairman of that
critically important committee, but that is something I would not
do,'' she said.

NORTHRIDGE QUAKE VICTIMS WANT QUACKENBUSH IMPEACHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Victims of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake blamed
state Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush on Thursday for
their inability to collect on their 6-year-old damage claims and
called for his impeachment from office.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, under fire for letting insurers avoid $3 billion in
potential fines by donating $11.6 million to a foundation he set
up, flew to Los Angeles for a hastily called news conference to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of my record,'' Quackenbush said. ``Let me
emphatically say that I will not be run from office by my political
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's comments came just hours after a news conference
outside Devonshire Village, a 127-unit Northridge condominium
complex unrepaired from severe damage in the Jan. 17, 1994, quake.
About a dozen victims described the hardships they have suffered
because insurers low-balled settlements or tied them up in legal
cases while the Department of Insurance did nothing on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in devastation mode,'' said Rick Bennett,
president of the complex's board of directors. ``While Quackenbush
was in bed with the insurance companies, we were forced to get
lawyers to try and get the insurance company to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the complex is locked in a legal battle with
Farmers Insurance, which has offered $931,000, while damage to the
condos, he said, is between $5.5 million and $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lushly landscaped block of units has twisted structural
beams. Roofs leak and are covered by blue plastic sheeting. Water
damage has caused warped siding, rot and termite problems, Bennett
said. New roofing cannot be done because the condos lack money to
deal with problems of asbestos in the ceilings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quake victims and other critics claim Quackenbush's close ties
with the insurance companies he is supposed to regulate led him to
overrule his staff's recommendation to impose massive fines on the
insurers and to instead set up the foundation with their
contributions. The foundation was supposed to help quake victims
but none of the money has been spent to assist them.
</P>
<P>
   George Kehrer, executive director of the Community Assisting
Recovery group established after the temblor to help homeowners
file insurance claims, said instead of getting the help they needed
from Quackenbush, victims got the ``Quacken-brushoff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Quackenbush is that he favored the insurance
companies over the insured,'' Kehrer said. ``So far, I have seen no
effort by him to directly help the people in this area who were
devastated by the earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Kehrer said many policyholders who filed claims received letters
from Quackenbush's office that did not address the problem of slow
responses by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not have to turn to lawyers or consumer rights
groups to have their claims settled,'' he said. ``But,
unfortunately, that was the case with many homeowners in the
Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield, who helped draft the 1988
initiative that made the commissioner's post elective, estimates
that of the 350,000 claims stemming from the quake, there are still
``tens of thousands'' of cases that have not been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the claims that have been paid were only paid after
policyholders got private lawyers and took the insurance companies
to court,'' said Rosenfield. ``We need an insurance commissioner
who will get people what they deserve, and we need stronger laws in
Sacramento to crack down on companies that don't pay claims on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for impeachment comes just a day after a Senate panel
found that Quackenbush acted improperly by allowing companies to
avoid $3 billion in fines for mishandling Northridge claims by
contributing to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Insurance Committee voted 8-0 Wednesday to send the
full Senate a bill that would prohibit the commissioner from
waiving or reducing unfair-practice fines in the future in exchange
for donations to a nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will hold a public hearing in the San Fernando
Valley on Wednesday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his role of helping victims of the Northridge
Quake, Quackenbush said he allowed insurance companies to avoid
paying penalties by making contributions because it was ``common
practice'' in other parts of the country, and he was merely
following those precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes were made in foundation implementation,'' Quackenbush
said. ``There is room for improvement, no doubt, and we are
committed to achieving that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said a blue ribbon panel, to be headed by former
state Auditor Kurt Sjoberg, will include members of the state
Legislature to review the creation, oversight and accountability of
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Assembly Insurance Committee, Jack Scott,
D-Pasadena, has asked the Legislature's attorneys whether lawmakers
have the power to put a hold on the remaining $6 million to make
sure it is used to help Northridge victims.

   SAO-PAULO-MAYOR (SAO PAULO, Brazil) _ The drama that has been
unfolding here in recent weeks has all the ingredients of the
convoluted soap operas that Brazilians love to watch: a power
struggle, betrayal, sexual intrigue, jealousy, revenge. But most of
all it is money, lots and lots of money, that has brought about the

   SCI-TB-SCREENING (Undated) _ The National Academy of Medicine,
in a wide-ranging report, recommends that prospective immigrants
from countries with lots of tuberculosis get a skin test for latent
TB before they enter the country. Currently those immigrants must
only get a chest X-ray to check for active cases and get treated
before they come. The academy says that although the number of TB
cases is dropping in this country, action is needed because a
global epidemic remains a potential source of new infections and
the country has entered a ``dangerous'' phase in trying to keep the
disease at bay. The scientists also recommend that inmates be given
skin tests and that this country give money to countries with lots
of TB to help them get rid of it. By Kenneth Chang.

<P>
   GORE-STRATEGY (Washington) _ Analysis: It has become the daily
call-and-response of the presidential contest. Vice President Al
Gore brands Gov. George W. Bush as, take your pick: reckless,
irresponsible, profligate or arrogant. And Bush calmly replies that
the vice president is like an addict when it comes to distorting
the truth. If this acidic minuet seems vaguely familiar, it is.
Gore's aggressive strategy worked just fine in the primaries, but
he is now engaged in a very different race against a very different
opponent, and the question is, can it work again? By James Dao.

   BUSH-DAUGHTERS (Austin, Texas) _ The Bush family has been
remarkably successful in protecting the privacy of his two
18-year-old daughters, so much so that while Bush could become the
next president and while his extended family is beginning to look
an awful lot like a political dynasty, his two daughters are almost
invisible, their faces unknown to 99.9 percent of voters outside
Texas. By Frank Bruni.

   DEECEE-TAX-PROTEST _ Attitude, the gritty urban ingredient that
seemed to go missing with the fall of Mayor Marion Barry, is
threatening to return to the capital city's profile in the form of
a rebellious new license plate motto decrying the city's state of
``Taxation Without Representation.'' A proposal to proclaim that on
District of Columbia license tags plates has been unanimously
co-sponsored by the city council to protest the fact that city
residents pay $2 billion in annual federal taxes yet have failed in
repeated attempts to win voting rights in Congress. By Francis X.
Clines.

   AUTO-AIR-BAGS _ The Transportation Department is scheduled to
announce new standards for automobile air bags Friday, and people
involved in the decision say that the government will set the rules
to allow less-powerful bags, to reduce the risk to children and
small-statured adults, possibly at the expense of large men who

of corporations unhooked their computer systems from the Internet

Cliffs., N.J., which owns top-selling brands like Knorr soups,
Hellman's mayonnaise and Skippy peanut butter. Bestfoods said no.

<P>
   EUROPE-TECH-JOBS (Paris) _ Eric Perbos-Brinck gave up a
promising management career last year at Promodes, the big French
retailer, to start an Internet company called Bravonestor.com. He
began in November with just two people, but already has 10
employees, with plans to hire five more in the next few weeks. To
fill the jobs, Perbos-Brinck, 31, casts his net wide. One of his
programmers is Moroccan. The designer of search engines is
Senegalese. Perbos-Brinck's polyglot staff would not draw a second
glance in the United States, where the technology industry's
ravenous demand for skilled workers has created a multinational,
multicultural work force that includes many foreign nationals. But
in Europe, his effort to find qualified help has collided with one
of Europe's most divisive issues: immigration. By John Tagliabue.

   FUND-NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) _ A fund manager, Prudential
Insurance, announced a shake-up this week: A couple of its managers
who are known for buying deep value stocks _ stocks that look
cheap, by measures like price-earnings ratios _ were fired. It is
no secret what went wrong at Prudential: The ousted managers kept
buying value stocks even as they got cheaper. The fund's

``The Real World,'' however. This is theater, Acting Company style.
For 27 years the company has followed a deceptively simple
strategy: find good young actors, put them in good old plays and
take them to small towns from coast to coast. For those involved,
it is a mission that requires not just a deep love for the stage
but a boundless appreciation for fast-food, sleep deprivation and

   ALBERTINA-DRAWINGS (New York) _ Few art acquisitors of the 18th

Albert, duke of Saxe-Teschen (1738-1822), for whom the Albertina in
Vienna is named. A small but choice sampling of holdings from the

Joe Klein, John Lahr, V.S. Naipaul, Roger Angell, Roz Chast. But
what about the most prolific writer in New Yorker history, the
author of countless Talk of the Town pieces, the loyal, royal
``we''? Why wasn't ``we'' invited? By Sarah Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   NY-GALLERIES (New York) _ Maybe credit should go to the revived
art market, the arrival of spring or some kind of harmonic
convergence, but Madison Avenue from 69th to 79th Street is rife
with art. It's hard to recall a time in the last 20 years when so
many galleries on, or just off, the avenue offered such a diverse
range of high-quality viewing opportunities. On a recent Monday _ a
six-day week frequently prevails in these parts _ one resident art
dealer cheerfully described the neighborhood as ``the Chelsea you
can get to.'' By Roberta Smith.

J.C. PENNEY CHIEF TO STEP DOWN EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED
</HEADLINE>
  By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly a year after James E. Oesterreicher vowed to turn around
the troubled department store giant J &UR; . &LR; C. Penney, he announced
Thursday that he would retire as chairman and chief executive
earlier than expected and without fulfilling his promise.
</P>
<P>
   Oesterreicher, 58, who has been with the company since 1964,
said Penney had started a search for his replacement and that he
would stay until a successor was named.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his decision to step down almost a year before
Penney required was in part based on the fact that several
high-profile chief executive searches are under way in the retail
sector _ including one for a chief executive to replace Arthur
Martinez at Sears, Roebuck. In this brutally competitive
environment, he said he did not want Penney to miss out on top
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Oesterreicher has also felt pressure from investors
to move along because Penney's has continued to post dismal sales,
as customers desert its stores for more hip and better-priced
competitors like Kohl's and Old Navy. Since he took the helm in
1997, Penney's stock has lost 66 percent of its market value. Last
May at the annual shareholders' meeting, he predicted that sales
would pick up; they have not. Sales at stores open at least a year
have fallen for all but six of the last 23 months, according to
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered the news of his departure. The stock rose 8
percent, up $1.5625, to $17.4375, on a day when the Dow Jones
industrials fell 67.64 points. ``The company has clearly
underperformed expectations in recent years and an infusion of new
blood is likely to be regarded as positive by the Street,'' said
George Strachan, a Goldman, Sachs analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also expressed optimism because they said
Oesterreicher's eventual retirement was one of a series of changes
that indicated the company was serious about righting its course.
Since last year, Oesterreicher has made many moves to bolster the
share price and to refocus Penney on its core retailing business.
Last fall, he sold Penney's credit card business, and just recently
the company announced it would consider selling its direct
marketing arm as well. A year ago, the company created a tracking
stock for its fast-growing Eckerd's Drug Store division.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Oesterreicher broke with Penney's tradition of
promoting people to top jobs solely from within. He hired Vanessa
Castagna, executive vice president for merchandising and chief
operating officer, from Wal-Mart Stores six months ago. Castagna is
credited with having helped Wal-Mart turn its women's apparel
business from a poorly assorted afterthought to a powerful market
force. Although new in her job, Castagna is thought to be among the
contenders to replace Oesterreicher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement today is continued evidence of change at
Penney, and therefore is being seen from a positive standpoint,''
said Jeff Feiner, a Lehman Brothers analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Penney said it would consider candidates from outside the
company as well as within. ``This would be the first time that our
company has considered external candidates,'' Oesterreicher said.

NORTHRIDGE QUAKE VICTIMS WANT QUACKENBUSH IMPEACHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Victims of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake blamed
state Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush on Thursday for
their inability to collect on their 6-year-old damage claims and
called for his impeachment from office.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, under fire for letting insurers avoid $3 billion in
potential fines by donating $11.6 million to a foundation he set
up, flew to Los Angeles for a hastily called news conference to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of my record,'' Quackenbush said. ``Let me
emphatically say that I will not be run from office by my political
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's comments came just hours after a news conference
outside Devonshire Village, a 127-unit Northridge condominium
complex unrepaired from severe damage in the Jan. 17, 1994, quake.
About a dozen victims described the hardships they have suffered
because insurers low-balled settlements or tied them up in legal
cases while the Department of Insurance did nothing on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in devastation mode,'' said Rick Bennett,
president of the complex's board of directors. ``While Quackenbush
was in bed with the insurance companies, we were forced to get
lawyers to try and get the insurance company to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the complex is locked in a legal battle with
Farmers Insurance, which has offered $931,000, while damage to the
condos, he said, is between $5.5 million and $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lushly landscaped block of units has twisted structural
beams. Roofs leak and are covered by blue plastic sheeting. Water
damage has caused warped siding, rot and termite problems, Bennett
said. New roofing cannot be done because the condos lack money to
deal with problems of asbestos in the ceilings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quake victims and other critics claim Quackenbush's close ties
with the insurance companies he is supposed to regulate led him to
overrule his staff's recommendation to impose massive fines on the
insurers and to instead set up the foundation with their
contributions. The foundation was supposed to help quake victims
but none of the money has been spent to assist them.
</P>
<P>
   George Kehrer, executive director of the Community Assisting
Recovery group established after the temblor to help homeowners
file insurance claims, said instead of getting the help they needed
from Quackenbush, victims got the ``Quacken-brushoff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Quackenbush is that he favored the insurance
companies over the insured,'' Kehrer said. ``So far, I have seen no
effort by him to directly help the people in this area who were
devastated by the earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Kehrer said many policyholders who filed claims received letters
from Quackenbush's office that did not address the problem of slow
responses by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not have to turn to lawyers or consumer rights
groups to have their claims settled,'' he said. ``But,
unfortunately, that was the case with many homeowners in the
Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield, who helped draft the 1988
initiative that made the commissioner's post elective, estimates
that of the 350,000 claims stemming from the quake, there are still
``tens of thousands'' of cases that have not been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the claims that have been paid were only paid after
policyholders got private lawyers and took the insurance companies
to court,'' said Rosenfield. ``We need an insurance commissioner
who will get people what they deserve, and we need stronger laws in
Sacramento to crack down on companies that don't pay claims on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for impeachment comes just a day after a Senate panel
found that Quackenbush acted improperly by allowing companies to
avoid $3 billion in fines for mishandling Northridge claims by
contributing to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Insurance Committee voted 8-0 Wednesday to send the
full Senate a bill that would prohibit the commissioner from
waiving or reducing unfair-practice fines in the future in exchange
for donations to a nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will hold a public hearing in the San Fernando
Valley on Wednesday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his role of helping victims of the Northridge
Quake, Quackenbush said he allowed insurance companies to avoid
paying penalties by making contributions because it was ``common
practice'' in other parts of the country, and he was merely
following those precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes were made in foundation implementation,'' Quackenbush
said. ``There is room for improvement, no doubt, and we are
committed to achieving that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said a blue ribbon panel, to be headed by former
state Auditor Kurt Sjoberg, will include members of the state
Legislature to review the creation, oversight and accountability of
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Assembly Insurance Committee, Jack Scott,
D-Pasadena, has asked the Legislature's attorneys whether lawmakers
have the power to put a hold on the remaining $6 million to make
sure it is used to help Northridge victims.

`LOVE BUG` E-MAIL VIRUS DISRUPTS SYSTEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    (Editors: L.A. Daily News Staff Writers Chris Sieroty, Bill
Hillburg and Troy Anderson contributed to this report.)  
 
  
By JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A ``love letter'' virus infected computer e-mail systems across
the country Thursday, slamming hundreds of thousands of computers
at businesses, government agencies and in individual homes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the new virus with the subject line ``ILOVEYOU''
spread far more prolifically, and caused more destruction, than the
Melissa virus that hit computer systems last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley area, damage ranged from minor
inconveniences to serious problems after the virus attacked e-mail
systems at Warner Bros., Southern California Edison and others.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts with ICSA.net, a Reston, Va.-based Internet security
firm, estimated the virus could cost businesses across the world up
to $1 billion to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   The virus which also has the attributes of a ``worm'' because it
propels itself through computer networks primarily spreads when
computer users open an attachment on the ``ILOVEYOU'' e-mail.
Opening the attachment launches a virus that corrupts certain
computer files, including MP3 music files and JPEG graphic files.
</P>
<P>
   The virus also replicates itself by sending more ``ILOVEYOU''
e-mails to everyone on the address list of the original computer's
Microsoft Outlook e-mail program. Melissa targeted only the first
50 names on the Outlook program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relatively speaking this is a fairly damaging virus,'' said
Peter Reiher, a professor of computer science at the University of
California, Los Angeles. ``It doesn't just try to spread around.
This one is actually trying to do harm to people's computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus is designed to do more than just destroy files, said
Bruce Hughes, a senior lab analyst with ICSA.net. Unlike Melissa,
the love letter virus can also spread through popular Internet
Relay Chat programs that allow users to communicate instantly over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And the virus also was designed to give its author access to
infected computers' passwords and other confidential data, Hughes
said. That data was to be sent to an e-mail address in the
Philippines, but the e-mail address had been shut down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the virus began in East Asia and swept through
Europe and then the United States. Some anti-virus companies
updated their programs to deal with the virus by Thursday, but
analysts say some variants of the virus, including an e-mail called
``joke'' or ``Fwd: Joke,'' already are circulating.
</P>
<P>
   Several major San Fernando Valley companies had to deal with the
virus Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Brogliatti, spokeswoman for Burbank-based Warner Bros.,
said the virus closed down or slowed much of the company's e-mail
system. She said some workers received a dozen or more ``ILOVEYOU''
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   But Brogliatti said the virus has been mainly an inconvenience
thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all just got used to having our e-mail,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodland Hills-based Unova Corp., administrators temporarily
shut down the firm's e-mail system as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system never went down because of the virus,'' said David
Brooks, a company spokesman. ``We have a virus scanning program at
the server level so it deletes any virus as soon as it's
detected.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an early warning system, the House of Representatives
managed to escape the full wrath of the virus, although its massive
e-mail system was shut down for several hours Thursday afternoon as
technicians sought a cure.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, most Congress members and their staffs were
warned of the virus as early as 7 a.m. by local radio and TV
reports. When most reported for work at 9 a.m., they found signs on
their office doors and official warning messages on their phone
mail.
</P>
<P>
   The House phone mail system is designed so that users must
listen to warning announcements before they can access any
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Among Capitol Hill's scattered virus victims was Rich Mills, an
aide to Rep. David Dreier, R-Covina, who triggered a near-meltdown
in his PC by opening an ``ILOVEYOU'' e-mail. Mills said that damage
was limited to his computer and that there was no disruption of
Dreier's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get an e-mail that says 'I love you,' I'm going to open
it,'' explained Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Smith, aide to Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, said
two colleagues who came in early to work _ and prior to the
warnings _ were rewarded for their diligence by having their
computers lock up after they checked their e-mail. Damage was
limited to their workstations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also reported several computers hit by the
virus. By midday, technicians had reprogrammed the White House
e-mail system to automatically delete the lethal messages.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California Edison officials said proper training helped
employees spot the virus _ and warn network administrators _
shortly after it appeared in the company's e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Netta, information technologies manager for the company,
said the virus entered the company's e-mail system at 7 a.m. and
was detected by employees and an anti-virus program about 15
minutes later. He said the company immediately stopped incoming
e-mail and began cleaning out the 60 computers that had been
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Chief Information Officer Jon Fullinwider
said he heard about the virus on the radio on his way to work
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the e-mail when I got to work,'' he said. ``I deleted
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the virus was sent to numerous county employees and he
instructed department heads to notify their workers of the virus.
As of Thursday afternoon, there were no reports anyone had opened
the attachment, Fullinwider said.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy Hsia, director of engineering for the Clinic anti-virus
program for McAfee.com, said inadequate training about viruses had
contributed to the ``love bug's'' rapid spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a lack of awareness,'' Hsia said. ``You get
an e-mail from a friend that says 'I love you.' Are you going to
delete it or open it?''

COUNTDOWN TO DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION STARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 100-day countdown to the start of the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles was marked on Thursday with the city's
Republican mayor -- who has become the major source of fund raising
-- being snubbed by a stubborn donkey.
</P>
<P>
   At a Los Angeles Zoo news conference to announce the progress
and plans, Riordan was approached by Odie, a 17-year-old donkey
meant to symbolize the Democratic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Odie,'' Riordan shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Odie turned her back.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan walked toward her.
</P>
<P>
   Odie began to get skittish and buck against her reins.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan returned to the podium for the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Riordan was later able to pose with the donkey
once she calmed down, going so far as to kiss her head and whisper
``I love you'' to the donkey and urge her to turn Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In between the snub and the snuggle, it was an upbeat assessment
offered by Riordan, Host Committee chief Noelia Rodriguez and
convention chief Lydia Camarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, Riordan has raised more than $3.3 million from
various sources and has a pledge of an additional $1 million from a
donor who has asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, while we're about $4 million from our final goal of $35
million, we have pledges for all that money,'' Riordan said. ``All
it is now is following up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' presidential nominating convention will be held
Aug. 14-17 at Staples Center, the first time the party has gathered
in Los Angeles since 1960, when it nominated John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to raise money had been an early stumbling block
for the Host Committee as part of its effort to reach the guarantee
that was promised the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   However, that has turned around since Riordan installed
Rodriguez, his deputy mayor, to take over the Host Committee
operation. She, in turn, has been able to convince him to do the
fund raising needed as well as get city staffers involved in all
the other aspects of transportation and security around the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Camarillo said the convention committee also has
been moving ahead, with the assignment of hotels for all
delegations and a media logistics team in place, as well as
production work starting on the convention itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put on a show that will embody the spirit and unity
of the Democratic Party for the whole world to see,'' Camarillo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Camarillo said the convention is expected to bring in $135
million to the local economy and will help to boost tourism for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be 15,000 journalists here focusing on Los
Angeles,'' Riordan said. ``They will be able to show the world what
a great city this is. It is worth $1 billion in advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also announced the host committee has launched its own
Internet site at www.lahost2000.org that will provide information
on the convention planning, how people can volunteer and other
data.
</P>
<P>
   And if the convention is nothing else, since the selection of
Vice President Al Gore as the party nominee is decided, it is about
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the host committee will be sponsoring a community
rally outside Staples Center on Aug. 11, three days before the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug 12, it will host a media party at the Department of Water
and Power plaza and, on Aug. 13, there will be a series of
receptions held for the different state delegations.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, once the convention is over, the host committee will
hold a party at the Los Angeles Zoo for all its volunteers.

WHITE COULD BE OUT FOR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Devon White's diving attempt has possibly cost the
Dodgers center fielder the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI revealed White has a partial tear of the rotator cuff in
his left shoulder. He's slated to be placed on the 15-day disabled
list today. The plan is for White to rehab the shoulder and try to
become healthy so he can play the bulk of the season. But if
rehabilitating the shoulder doesn't work, surgery is the next
option.
</P>
<P>
   And surgery could knock White out for a minimum of a few months,
and potentially, the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Also, shortstop Kevin Elster had a cortisone shot in his pulled
right groin. He also is scheduled to go on the 15-day disabled list
before today's series opener against the Houston Astros. Alex Cora
is expected to be activated and become the starting shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth, whom the Dodgers elected not to trade for
this very reason when teams inquired about him during spring
training, moves into the starting center-field spot and will bat
leadoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Alex comes up, I'm going to play him,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``We couldn't (survive these injuries) last
year. The way things were, I couldn't explain it last year but now
I can. We have better depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone did not make himself
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a two-pronged type of depth. Not only do Hollandsworth
and Cora fit in to replace the injured White and Elster on the
field, but they won't force Johnson to restructure the lineup.
Hollandsworth will bat first and Cora will hit eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Osuna, who's pitched well during his rehab stints in
Single-A San Bernardino and Triple-A Albuquerque, is expected to
join the Dodgers this weekend to take up the other roster spot. The
right-hander is coming off elbow surgery but has thrown in the
mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'll say is I want to see where Osuna's at,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   White, in the second year of a three-year, 12.4 million
contract, hurt the shoulder in the ninth inning Tuesday when he
dived for a ball hit by Atlanta's Brian Jordan. Johnson said he
thought a contributing factor to White diving was his desire to
show Los Angeles fans he's willing to do so. He was roundly booed
last season for not doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Though White isn't the prototypical leadoff hitter, he was off
to a solid start. He walked four times in 87 plate appearances, and
his .326 on-base percentage was 10th among National League leadoff
hitters. But Johnson likes White's power and defense. White has
three homers and nine RBI, he's hitting .289 and playing a solid
center field.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth went 3 for 4 with a homer and three runs scored in
White's place Wednesday, and the Dodgers are hoping he brings
enthusiasm and energy to the top of the lineup, which is averaging
5.8 runs per game. Hollandsworth, a former NL Rookie of the Year,
has been slowed by injuries the past three seasons. He's hitting
.260 and has a .327 on-base percentage. He had his first two steals
of the season Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It will be White's fourth stint on the disabled list, and first
since he pulled his left calf muscle in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to try and rehab (the shoulder),'' Johnson said.
``If that doesn't work, they'll cut on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster was injured while running to first on a sixth-inning
groundout Wednesday. He provided the offense Johnson wanted at the
bottom of the order. His six homers 17 RBI and 15 runs scored
topped all No. 8 hitters in the NL, and there's little chance Cora
can match that.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Elster's offense that won him the starting
shortstop job ahead of Cora in spring training. But Elster also had
the knack for extending innings so pitchers didn't lead off the
following inning. He has 14 walks and a .378 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Cora was batting .394 with Albuquerque, but he didn't have any
homers. In two stints with the Dodgers in 1998 and 1999, the
24-year-old Cora hit .143 with three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg, I'm kind of like dragging it around,'' Elster said.
``I'm a little frustrated, but I'm not going to sit and dwell on
it. The way my career has been, at least it's not a broken wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope in the organization is that Osuna or right-hander Alan
Mills pitch well enough to increase their trade value before
right-hander Gregg Olson comes off the disabled list, a club
official said. Olson, on the disabled list with a pinched nerve in
his right forearm, is supposed to begin a rehab assignment today in
San Bernardino. He could be ready to come off the disabled list in
a week.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS vs. HOUSTON
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:10 p.m., at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net 2; 1150-AM, KWKW-AM (1330 Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: With Thursday's day off, the Dodgers staggered their
rotation to make sure right-hander Kevin Brown (2-1, 2.88 ERA)
remains on four days rest whenever possible. So he gets the start
in the opener of a three-game series against Houston righty Shane
Reynolds (4-0, 3.35). Since returning from his broken pinkie,
Brown's allowed one earned run in seven innings in both of his
starts. Last season Brown was 2-0 with a 1.06 ERA in two games
against Houston, and he's 3-2 with a 1.50 ERA in seven career
starts against the Astros. Reynolds beat the Dodgers 10-3 April 19
at Dodger Stadium. He allowed one run on four hits in six innings.
Saturday - Dodgers RH Darren Dreifort (1-1, 2.67) vs. Astros RH
Octavio Dotel (1-2, 4.20); Sunday - Dodgers RH Eric Gagne (0-2,
3.22) vs. Astros RH Jose Lima (1-5, 9.59).

BIBBY'S CONTRACT TALKS STALLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Contract talks between USC and basketball coach
Henry Bibby have stalled, and there are serious doubts whether he
will sign an extension before the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's current five-year contract expires after the 2001-2002
season, but he has sought a new deal that would offer more
security. During the past season, Bibby and USC verbally agreed on
a three-year extension, with salary details to be worked out later.
</P>
<P>
   But the negotiations have broken down in the past month, making
it less likely Bibby will sign a new deal this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I would get a new deal, but I can't really comment
on it,'' Bibby said. ``I have no comment on it. But their word has
been good.''
</P>
<P>
   USC associate athletic Daryl Gross, who has been negotiating an
extension with Bibby, remained optimistic that a new contract could
be signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we feel Henry's doing a great job building this
program up,'' Gross said. ``We saw where we could go before the
injuries last season. With that in mind, we expect Henry to be at
USC for many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Bibby is expected to earn about $375,000
in base salary next season. He would like a new deal to place him
in the upper echelon of Pacific-10 coaches, which would mean a
salary of at least $650,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby has also worried that without a contract extension,
recruiting would be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   But there was virtually no negotiating between the two sides in
April, when talks began to deteriorate, and neither side is sure
when talks could resume.
</P>
<P>
   This week, there have been no negotiations. The last time the
pair discussed contract matters was during the Final Four in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Even if negotiations begin again, there has also been some
question whether Bibby would actually sign a new contract. He might
wait to see if his stock goes up if the Trojans have a successful
season next year.
</P>
<P>
   USC returns all five starters from last year's 16-14 team, and
seven of their top eight players. USC also signed prep All-American
shooting guard Desmon Farmer of Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Trojans signed point guard Robert Hutchinson
and shooting guard Gennaro Busterna, and 7-foot-3 freshman center
Luke Minor will be eligible after redshirting last season.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable USC could be chosen to finish among the top
three teams in the Pac-10 next year. A top-three finish would raise
Bibby's value considerably, and it would hardly shock anyone if his
name came up regarding another position.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Bibby discussed the then-vacant Memphis opening
with school officials.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, there has also been speculation that he might be
a candidate for the Clippers job if the team fires Jim Todd. Bibby
was seen at the Clippers' final home game with team owner Donald
Sterling, but it is not believed the coaching position was
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Sam Williams, USC's director of basketball operations,
and a former NBA player with the Golden State Warriors and
Philadelphia 76ers, has resigned to pursue his degree at Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that will probably raise some eyebrows, Williams will
be replaced by Tim Farmer, the older brother of incoming freshman
guard Desmon Farmer.

AT NBC STUDIOS, LUNCH IS MORE THAN A MEAL, IT'S A CAUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By JENNIFER HAMM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK -- In a town where lunch is a tool to seal
multimillion-dollar movie deals, a few industry types at NBC
Studios are fighting for the people who serve it up.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 NBC employees signed petitions Thursday in support of
commissary workers who could lose their jobs when a new food
service provider takes over next month.
</P>
<P>
   Commissary employees change as often as the cook's special, but
few employee lunchrooms are as well-known or beloved by the
well-known as the eatery at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The commissary was made famous by years of Johnny Carson jabs on
``The Tonight Show.'' And among the 500 people who signed a
petition earlier this spring endorsing the status quo were cast
members from the soap opera ``Days of Our Lives,'' KNBC-TV news
talent and staff members of the ``Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation that affects all of us. These are the
people who make my lunch, who I talk to, who I know,'' said Carrie
Biggs-Adams, an NBC videotape engineer since 1976. ``Some of them
I've known for more than 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond and Elias, which runs Marks Restaurant in Los Angeles,
takes over as food service provider next month for Eurest Dining,
which ran the commissary for 23 years. The current commissary
employees can reapply for their jobs but aren't guaranteed they'll
get them, said Shirley Powell, executive vice president of
publicity for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Though the network picked a new company, NBC employees are still
trying to protect the 21 commissary workers. Biggs-Adams passed out
black and yellow ribbons and helped collect signatures during a
lunch-hour petition drive. The signatures will be sent to NBC West
Coast President Scott Sassa and Entertainment President Garth
Ancier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are at risk of losing their jobs,'' Biggs-Adams said.
``When you have to apply for your job back, that's usually a sign
that you aren't going to get your job back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kassner, a 21-year veteran at NBC, said she collected
signatures because the commissary employees are like co-workers.
``They'll do anything for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's decision to switch vendors is part of a ``normal standard
business procedure,'' Powell said. The company began considering a
number of other vendors when Eurest's contract come up for review,
and Diamond and Elias was chosen, Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   A one-year price freeze will be put in effect next month so
employees wouldn't blame the network for more costly lunches due to
the new vendor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar controversy erupted a decade ago when NBC considered
hiring Bon Appetit for its commissary. Petitions were circulated
then as well in an attempt to convince management that employees
were happy with the current company. Public forums on the lot were
held to give employees a chance to voice their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the outcry, NBC decided to stick with Eurest,
which was then known as Canteen Corp.

PENA: GALAXY DOESN'T NEED ANY HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Any time Galaxy defender Danny Pena talks, it's good
to have a tape recorder rolling, especially when he needs to clear
his head.
</P>
<P>
   With the Galaxy (5-0-2) playing host to Major League Soccer's
only other unbeaten team, Kansas City (6-0-1) on Saturday at the
Rose Bowl, Pena was asked about the lingering rumors that Mexican
standout Luis Hernandez will be allocated to the Galaxy for as many
as two quality players.
</P>
<P>
   Before the question was finished, the frustration on Pena's face
suggested what was coming next: Why does the Galaxy need to change
anything?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need anybody right now, we're happy with where we
are,'' Pena said. ``How can you ask a team that is undefeated to
make any changes? If were below .500, we could use a change but for
the league to tell us we need to give up two of our starting
players to get a player whose only going to be here a third of the
season is ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, I have no respect for the way this league is
run and the people on top of it. What they're trying to do is
unacceptable. All we can do is battle under the circumstances
because at the end of the day, the league is going to do what they
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis has issued a weekly
``no comment,'' response during MLS conference calls concerning
negotiations with Mexican players. With the speculation that
Hernandez is coming to the MLS from several publications, Gazidis
felt compelled to comment this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Luis Hernandez has never been mentioned by me,'' he
said. ``A lot of comments, rumors are about him and Tigres, but
that's not coming from the league office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at a number of different options for a Mexican
player in L.A. Any deal for Mexican players is difficult to do
financially. It involves a lot of different pieces and some
scheduling problems.''
</P>
<P>
   -Wizards goalkeeper Tony Meola was a featured player on the 1994
U.S. World Cup team. Despite many soccer experts having high
expectations for him after the '94 tournament, Meola left soccer
for a tryout with the New York Jets as a placekicker.
</P>
<P>
   Meola also tried acting and other things before returning to
soccer to join the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in 1996, MLS'
inaugural season. Meola struggled, and his reputation diminished.
He was traded to the Wizards last season and struggled again. But
now he's having his best MLS season, allowing a league-low four
goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, U.S. national team coach Bruce Arena has
noticed Meola's improved play, recalling him to the national team
on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid, an assistant on the U.S. team in '94,
said Meola is playing as well as he ever has.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the ups and downs that Tony has had, with the
changing of the careers and the return to soccer, what it has done
is made Tony stronger,'' said Schmid. ``It's made him more
dedicated.''

HERTA CLINGS TO INDY HOPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Racing in the Indianapolis 500 might be a tailpipe dream for
Bryan Herta, but the Valencia driver says returning to the
Brickyard is not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Herta, who finished his two-race deal with Derrick Walker with a
20th-place showing in the CART Fed/Ex Series Rio 200 on Sunday in
Brazil, said it's possible he will continue his relationship with
Walker Racing in the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has two entries for the 500, an Indy Racing League event,
and only one driver, Sarah Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no plans for the second car,'' Herta said. ``That's
mainly because there is no sponsor for it. But we've discussed it.
It's something I'd like to do, but there's less than two weeks to
prepare for it, so the chances are not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker also said the possibility exists that Herta could run his
second car in the Indy 500, but it's not likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some drivers and some sponsors interested,'' Walker
said. ``I am keeping the possibility open. The option is still
there and we have definitely talked about it. He's told me he'd
like to do it. The easy part is finding a driver. The hard part is
getting the rest of your ducks in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta, who finished fifth at Long Beach for Walker Racing, was
subbing in for Shinji Nakano, who injured his head during a
practice session in March. Now that his deal is up with Walker,
Herta, who was signed to drive for CART team owner Gerald Forsythe
at the start of the season, is back in limbo as he waits for CART
officials to decide the fate of Forsythe's request for a third
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Forsythe already has two CART teams, with Alex Tagliani and
Patrick Carpintier as drivers for the Player's/Forsythe Racing
team.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Herta said he plans to go to Motegi, Japan, for
the Firestone Firehawk 500 on May 13, but not as a driver. He will
serve as a representative for Honda.
</P>
<P>
   But if Nakano is unable to drive in Japan, Herta is ready to sub
in for the Japanese-born driver again. Nakano underwent medical
tests this week to gain clearance to compete. CART has also allowed
an extra practice session for Nakano to insure that he is medically
and physically ready to return. Walker said if Nakano suffers any
setbacks, Herta will be the replacement driver in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Runaway win: Greg Pursley of Sun Valley practically ran away
with the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series Home Depot 100 at
Irwindale Speedway on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pursley, a Canyon High graduate, started from the eighth spot
but quickly moved up to take the lead on lap 16. Aside from a late
charge by Granada Hills native M.K. Kanke, Pursley had few
challengers en route to his first win of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt my car was really good, but Kanke was real strong,
too,'' Pursley said. ``Kanke was trying to catch me underneath, and
he kept trying, but he couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pursley said because Kanke continued to try to pass him low on
the race track, Kanke was wearing down his tires more quickly.
Pursley was able to conserve his tires and maintain the lead, which
was the winning combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southwest tour has the best drivers around,'' Pursley
said. ``For me to be able to beat them is awesome. The top 10
drivers on the series - anybody can win. And you could have thrown
a blanket over the top three drivers on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Series continues at Tucson Raceway Park on
Saturday. Pursley, who hasn't competed in Tucson since winter heats
there in 1996, said he remembers the track being similar to the
half-mile oval at Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty close to Irwindale, just smaller,'' said Pursley,
who tested his Crown Motorsports Chevy Monte Carlo at Tucson in
January.
</P>
<P>
   In other action at Irwindale Speedway, Brandon Miller of Rancho
Santa Fe became the fifth different winner in as many events in the
NASCAR Super Late Model division. Vince Little of Clovis won the
Ultra Wheel Spec Trucks feature.
</P>
<P>
   Benson fined: NASCAR officials penalized Johnny Benson more than
$10,000 Tuesday for rules violations in the NASCAR Winston West
race at California Speedway on Saturday. Benson's car had an
illegal restrictor plate on the manifold.
</P>
<P>
   Benson was fined $10,440 and lost his 108 Winston West points he
scored in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sedgwick of Acton finished 15th in the Winston West race.
Jerry Cain of Canyon Country was 26th.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick is also 13th in points after four series races. Cain is
19th. The next race on the Winston West series will be the Salinas
250 at Laguna Seca Raceway on May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia bound: NASCAR Busch Grand National Series driver Ron
Hornaday Jr. finished 19th in the Auto Club 300 on Saturday at
California Speedway in Fontana. So, it's no wonder the Palmdale
driver of the NAPA Auto Parts Chevy Monte Carlo can't wait to get
to Virginia for tonight's Hardee's 250 at Richmond International
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday has had success in Richmond over the last few years. He
won a pole on the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series in 1997 and
finished second in a Truck race there in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He even has fond memories of his only Winston Cup experience at
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran the Winston Cup race at Richmond in the fall last year
and had a blast,'' he said. ``I got spun by one of my Truck buddies
on lap 242 and tore up my car a little, but I was still able to
keep up with the leaders as far as lap times were with a torn up
car. I think I just have a natural feel for this track.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with his 19th at Fontana, Hornaday leads the Busch rookie
points standings and is fifth overall in the series standings.

BODINE HASN'T LOST DESIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody would blame Geoffrey Bodine if he never climbed into a
race car again.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody except for Bodine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a burning desire to get behind the steering wheel
and go out there and compete,'' said Bodine, who resumes his NASCAR
Winston Cup career at this weekend's Pontiac Excitement 400 in
Richmond, Va. His comeback comes nearly three months after being
involved in a horrific crash at Daytona in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be stronger now then it was before. I love a
challenge. And this is one of the biggest challenges of my life to
deal with this accident and the injuries. I'm very anxious to get
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine escaped serious injury after being involved in a 10-truck
crash during the Daytona 250 Craftsman Truck series race. He
suffered broken bones in his right cheek, wrist, elbow and big tow.
His truck rolled over 11 times and flipped three down the front
straightaway before coming apart and bursting into flames.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's compartment and roll cage remained intact. The
crash, which delayed the conclusion of the first truck race at
Daytona for more then two hours, was started when three trucks
collided into each other in the tri-oval, setting off a chain
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bodine is ready to return, his outlook on racing, and
life has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back and do the best I've ever done,'' Bodine
said. ``I want to come back 110 percent. All those things are still
important, but through this accident, I've learned they are not the
most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not going to be a racer 10 more years. That's not
the end of the world. This wreck has put a lot of things in
perspective. Cars, houses, possessions don't mean anything when you
are laying in bed and can't move. When you are in the hospital and
don't know if you are going to survive, those things become
unimportant. Your health becomes very important, your family. Those
things are more important. That's what this experience has done for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Bodine has had to comeback from a
major crash.
</P>
<P>
   He was nearly killed during a single-car incident at Watkins
Glen, N.Y. in the late 1980s and responded by taking the pole at
Michigan the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day, I really thought I was going to kill myself,''
Bodine said. ``I had a few seconds to think about that. I didn't
kill myself. I got hurt and I survived. The following week we went
to Michigan. I had to tell myself that day, 'Depending what you do
today, is going to tell yourself that you have it, that you still
have your nerve and be able to continue driving.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This coming off a serious crash at Watkins Glen thinking I was
going to kill myself. Well, I went out and got the pole (at
Michigan). I proved to myself that I still had the nerve. I proved
that going through a bad accident didn't slow me down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that even though this accident(at Daytona) was
much more severe, I never had that feeling that I was going to get
hurt, or killed. I can see it, and how close I came to (being
dead). So when I get behind the wheel, I don't think I'm going to
have any problems going out there and going fast.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bodine is also not expecting any help from his Winston Cup
competitors when he rolls out his Chevrolet Monte Carlo on to the
Richmond three-quarter mile oval this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone's going to cut me any slack,'' Bodine
said. ``They never have. I don't expect them to just because I was
in that horrific wreck in Daytona and haven't been racing for a few
months. And I'm not going to ask them to. I don't want them to. . .
. If I feel there's any problem out there, I'll get someone else to
drive. But I don't expect that -- especially after (testing at
Richmond two weeks ago).''

DIXON EYES CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask most National Hot Rod Association enthusiasts before the
season who might win the Top Fuel championship, and you would get
the list of usual suspects - Joe Amato, Gary Scelzi and defending
champion Tony Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
   You can add Larry Dixon's name to that list.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 NHRA Rookie of the Year, who has struggled with
consistency since, has won the past two national events and is
second in points through six of 23 races. Dixon will get attempt to
add to that streak at this weekend's Southern Nationals near
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have won poles, won Indy (the U.S. Nationals), and set
national records,'' said Dixon, who won last weekend's Moto1.Net
Nationals near Richmond, Va. after defeating rival Kenny Bernstein
in the final. ``The one thing I haven't done is win the Winston
Championship and I would love to do that for Snake (NHRA legend Don
Prudhomme).''
</P>
<P>
   And Dixon, who has won three of the past eight national events
dating back to last season, appears to have a legitimate shot in
2000. New crew chief Dick LaHaie, who tuned Scott Kalitta to
back-to-back titles in the mid-1990s, is a big reason for his
sudden turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thanking Dick LaHaie, but you don't know how important
he is and how much of a great job all the crew guys (have done),''
Dixon said. ``LaHaie is everything to this team. He is a very sharp
guy and if I am lucky I will end my career with him as my crew
chief. I haven't been in a car this strong since 1995 (his rookie
of the year season).''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with John Force?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, if you judge the nine-time Funny Car champion by his
performance at last weekend's Moto1.Net Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell Gardens won for the 83rd time in his career and had the
quickest run of the season with a 4.823-second pass during
qualifying. It's quickest run since the NHRA adopted rules limiting
the nitromethane fuel mixture to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a long way from being dead and the season's a long way
from being over,'' said Force, who moved within 69 points of
first-place Jerry Toliver after winning a tire-smoking battle over
Ron Capps on Sunday. ``We may not dominate like we did last year,
but we're not going to just roll over the first time somebody
challenges us, either. This team has a lot of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Force to within two victories of Bob Glidden's
career record of 85 wins.
</P>
<P>
   -Is anybody going to stop Jeg Coughlin Jr.?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't appear so after the three-year Pro Stock driver won
for the fifth time in six nationals events last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin, who moved 211 points ahead of second-place Warren
Johnson, is the first driver to win five of the first six national
events since the late Lee Shepherd pulled the trick in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're held up to guys like Lee Shepherd you know
that's about as good as it gets,'' said Coughlin, who finished a
career-best second in points last season. ``Hopefully, we can win
championships like (Shepherd) did.''
</P>
<P>
   -Scotty Cannon, who is in his second season in Funny Car, is on
the verge of putting together a second-car for his Oakley-sponsored
operation. The second car will be piloted by Scotty Cannon Jr. and
is expected to debut in early July.

<P>
   ``Bogus asylum-seekers,'' bellows William Hague, the leader of
Britain's opposition Conservative Party, are ``flooding'' the
country, and Britain should lock them all up in detention centers
until they can be sorted.
</P>
<P>
   Germany ought to educate its own ``children instead of
(importing) Indians,'' roars his fellow conservative, Jurgen
Ruttgers, the Christian Democratic candidate for this month's
crunch election in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   The European popular imagination, it seems, is gripped by panic
about foreigners: that there are too many of them pouring in, that
there is certainly no need for any more. In short, that Europe is
``full up.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that view, however, with some rather different
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Because Europeans are not having enough babies and are living so
long, the European Union would need to import 1.6 million migrants
a year simply to keep its working-age population stable between now
and 2050.
</P>
<P>
   With Europe's unemployment now falling, and its people
increasingly sniffy about the sorts of jobs they are prepared to
do, or too ill-equipped to do the high-tech ones being created, the
continent's work force is in need of renewal as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants tend to inject into stale, aging countries fresh
vitality, fresh energy and an uncommon willingness to work hard at
unappealing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   How can Europe reconcile its economic need for more immigrants
with its apparent political distaste for them? In an ideal world,
there would be no barriers to the free movement of people, between
the various countries as within them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the curiosities of migration is that, even where
such barriers no longer exist, as within the EU, so few people
choose to pack up their belongings, uproot their families, and trek
off to settle in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   But human insecurities are not soothed by economic and
demographic logic alone, nor even much by clear evidence that
migrants are needed. Europeans seem to need reassurance that their
jobs, their culture, their sense of identity are not somehow under
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how to create a more liberal immigration regime
that can still be made politically palatable on a continent as
prone to xenophobia as Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Europe errs on the side of mean-mindedness. Since
the 1970s, it has more or less shut its doors to primary
immigration: that is, to economic migrants who might later bring
their relations too.
</P>
<P>
   These days, many of those who settle permanently in the EU are
the families of those who are already there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, just as Europe has been busy bolting up its front door, so
those seeking a better life in the rich countries of the Union have
increasingly resorted to finding ways in around the back.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, there has been an upsurge in the numbers of
people seeking political asylum, and _ though they are difficult to
measure _ in the numbers of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine refugees from persecution, as defined by the 1951 Geneva
Convention, should be welcomed in the EU without reservation. They
should be confident of this welcome, and Europeans should be proud
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, and though it is politically incorrect to say so, even a
cursory glance at the numbers of asylum claims judged to be false
suggests that many of those hoping to gain entry as political
refugees are economic migrants in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that asylum-seekers ``shop around'' for the
best deal: research shows clearly that the chief reason they, like
all migrants, head for one country rather than another is that they
know people already there.
</P>
<P>
   Even if EU countries were to harmonize their provision for
refugees, as they have promised to do, existing patterns would
probably change little: the networks that draw asylum-seekers to,
above all, Germany and Britain have taken on a life of their own.
</P>
<P>
   What the many asylum claims do suggest, however, is that a
clampdown on bogus refugees by itself is only a half-solution.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, economic migrants would not have to dress
themselves up as refugees, nor to make those hazardous journeys
crammed into the cargo holds of rickety boats or the containers of
long-distance trucks, if there were an alternative way of applying
to get in legally _ with some hope of success.
</P>
<P>
   If the EU were to install a more orderly system of admitting
economic migrants _ both the high-tech ones it needs to fashion its
software and the less skilled ones it needs to pick its lettuces
and gut its chickens _ would that really curb the numbers of
illegals getting ready to make their dash across the continent's
borders?
</P>
<P>
   That is one objection made by those who oppose the introduction
of a more generous policy towards immigrants. It may be, they say,
that today's image of Fortress Europe deters some of tomorrow's
would-be migrants, and that a more liberal system to admit
outsiders legally would only encourage yet others to slip in on the
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, however, it is a risk that Europe should be ready to
take. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A more persuasive objection is that any regime that concentrated
on luring the highly skilled would run the risk of robbing poorer
countries of the people they are least able to do without. Yet even
poor countries can benefit when emigres send home the remittances
they earn in the rich world.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians face a choice. They can either pander to the fears
of voters about being ``swamped'' by outsiders, or they can seek to
reassure them that those worries are only half-founded.
</P>
<P>
   As unemployment rates fall in most European countries, the task
of reassurance ought to become easier. For the moment, however,
Europe's politicians show little inclination to be brave.
</P>
<P>
   How many British politicians advertise the fact that, in terms
of the number of asylum-seekers it accepts per head of population,
Britain lies halfway down the EU table? How many German politicians
remind their voters that as many foreigners, including lots of
refugees, are now leaving Germany as are coming in?
</P>
<P>
   The greatest pity of all would be if the EU's governments at
last managed to agree to a more orderly joint system of
immigration, only to appeal to the lowest, most illiberal, common
denominator. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It has been a strange week in the playroom of American
presidential politics. Foreign policy has not just been mentioned,
but actually debated.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpectedly vicious attack on George W. Bush, Al Gore
accused his opponent of being an isolationist, fixated by Cold-War
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's camp has responded with jabs about the Clinton
administration's policy towards Russia. There is even something of
a debate going on about China's accession to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally nobody expects this to last. Why should the American
electorate consider anything so tedious as global security, free
trade or missile defense when there are serious things to campaign
about _ such as the Confederate flag flying in South Carolina, or
missing White House e-mails?
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is perhaps understandable: the last person to make
much noise about foreign policy was Bush's father, who lost to Bill
Clinton partly because the latter promised to concentrate on
domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still wrong and _ as President Bush might have put it
_ getting wronger.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, foreign policy is one of the few things where
being president matters. The next president's domestic economic
policy has in many ways already been ``outsourced'' to the Federal
Reserve: even Bill Clinton seems to have given up the fiction that
he, rather than Alan Greenspan, runs the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government supplies only seven cents in every dollar
spent in the country's schools. And the states have been acquiring
ever more power over various parts of social policy.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, defense _ only one part of the foreign policy
equation, but a vital one _ accounts for about half of
discretionary federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world has always presented presidents with
intractable problems. But, recently, it seems to have placed ever
more pressure on the president. Globalization is binding America's
economy ever more tightly into those of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War has in many ways made the job of running
the western alliance a much harder, subtler task. Allies are less
willing to accept the dictates of Washington, and it is often even
harder to convince congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism's triumph over communism has in a sense given every
American politician an excuse to break ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, Bill Clinton has proved a mildly
disappointing foreign-policy president. His poor first-term start
can perhaps be put down to his promise to focus on matters at home
_ and to the sheer novelty of the post-Cold-War world.
</P>
<P>
   He can also point to an increasingly obstructionist Congress.
But the overall impression has been of episodic and inconsistent
attention; his considerable diplomatic skills have been employed
only fitfully.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, this approach eventually muddled through (most
notably, in Bosnia); in other cases, the lack of any consistent
agenda has been startling (with China, there seem to have been
several successive policies).
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Republican Congress proves unexpectedly cooperative
or Clinton himself unusually decisive, the outgoing president will
leave behind a few outright successes, notably the North American
Free-Trade Agreement (though Bush senior had done some of the
spadework); a few outright failures, such as the defeat of the
Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty; plenty of currently unsolved cases
(Northern Ireland, Cuba, missiles, and, inevitably, the Middle
East); and unclear messages on everything from America's vision for
the United Nations and the World Trade Organization (WTO) to when
exactly the United States thinks that humanitarian intervention is
justified.
</P>
<P>
   This, it should be repeated, is not a disastrous bequest. But at
the very least it challenges the next occupant of the Oval Office
to do better.
</P>
<P>
   One unfortunate consequence of the sidelining of foreign policy
is that there is relatively little evidence available to assess the
capacity of either Gore or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Both would claim to be internationalists. Gore fought hard for
NAFTA, and his current attempts to rethink foreign policy show
enthusiasm for the subject.
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas, Bush can hardly be judged on his
foreign-policy achievements, but he has been a prominent supporter
of immigration (not a bad guide in Republican terms) and he has
inherited an experienced foreign-policy team from his father.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, also doubts about both men. In his attempt
to court the unions, Gore has added ``fair trade'' to his own
somewhat flaky ideas about green trade. These helped destroy the
serious side of the WTO's meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And it remains to be seen how the vice president's close
exposure to Clinton's modus operandi has affected his own strategy.
Letting a problem fester into a crisis and then using your
considerable diplomatic charm to solve it is almost excusable if
you possess Clinton's powers of persuasion; in other hands it would
be mad.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, there is nothing in his record to support Gore's
charge that he is an isolationist _ though there are some in the
Republican Party who plainly err in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has made unilateral noises _ about America intervening
abroad only when ``its interests'' are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on how those interests are defined. In some cases _
China perhaps _ a little hard-nosed realpolitik is called for. In
other cases, such as Kosovo and Bosnia, it is hard to see how the
United States' foreign policy could avoid having a humanitarian
edge.
</P>
<P>
   If the president did not put it there, American voters, watching
the ghastly events on CNN, soon would.
</P>
<P>
   Putting morality into foreign policy has been a card played
mostly by the Democrats _ but not exclusively so; former President
Ronald Reagan did it most successfully. The difficult thing is
deciding how much morality _ and making sure that the rest of the
world happens to agree with it.
</P>
<P>
   These are, in short, thorny problems. But they require
consistency, character and attention from the two men who want to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   The two both remain novices. Yet their new attention to worldly
matters is welcome _ if it is sustained. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It has been a strange week in the playroom of American
presidential politics. Foreign policy has not just been mentioned,
but actually debated.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpectedly vicious attack on George W. Bush, Al Gore
accused his opponent of being an isolationist, fixated by Cold-War
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's camp has responded with jabs about the Clinton
administration's policy towards Russia. There is even something of
a debate going on about China's accession to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally nobody expects this to last. Why should the American
electorate consider anything so tedious as global security, free
trade or missile defense when there are serious things to campaign
about _ such as the Confederate flag flying in South Carolina, or
missing White House e-mails?
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is perhaps understandable: the last person to make
much noise about foreign policy was Bush's father, who lost to Bill
Clinton partly because the latter promised to concentrate on
domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still wrong and _ as President Bush might have put it
_ getting wronger.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, foreign policy is one of the few things where
being president matters. The next president's domestic economic
policy has in many ways already been ``outsourced'' to the Federal
Reserve: even Bill Clinton seems to have given up the fiction that
he, rather than Alan Greenspan, runs the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government supplies only seven cents in every dollar
spent in the country's schools. And the states have been acquiring
ever more power over various parts of social policy.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, defense _ only one part of the foreign policy
equation, but a vital one _ accounts for about half of
discretionary federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world has always presented presidents with
intractable problems. But, recently, it seems to have placed ever
more pressure on the president. Globalization is binding America's
economy ever more tightly into those of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War has in many ways made the job of running
the western alliance a much harder, subtler task. Allies are less
willing to accept the dictates of Washington, and it is often even
harder to convince congressmen.

<P>
   The Anglo-Saxons are back. For nearly a thousand years, no one
gave them much thought.
</P>
<P>
   A few poor wretches had to study their poetry, but most people,
if they learned anything about them, discovered only that Bede was
venerable, Beowulf boring, Alfred burned some cakes and the good,
short words in English, notably those spelled with asterisks
instead of vowels, were coined by the heathen Germans who occupied
most of what is today called England between 449 and 1066.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the Anglo-Saxons are everywhere. They pop up in
the context of stock options, shareholder value and neo-American
capitalism, or rather (here's a clue) les stock options, la
shareholder value et le capitalisme neo-americain.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is the French who have restored the Anglo-Saxons to
prominence, though others _ even The Economist _ seem ready to
adopt their usage. Which is a bit odd really, because whatever the
Anglo-Saxons may have done for poetry, they were not noted for
groundbreaking work in macroeconomics and double-entry bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the early Germanic nations had an admirably free
trade in subjects for their epic poems. It is true that an early
editor of this newspaper noted that ``the religion of gold...is the
natural idol of the Anglo-Saxon.''
</P>
<P>
   But was Walter Bagehot an Anglo-Saxon? Was Adam Smith, come to
that, or Ricardo, or Rockefeller _ or even their latter-day
disciples such as Alan Greenspan, Warren Buffett, Jacob Rothschild,
George Soros and every other capitalist who happens to have English
as his native tongue?
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of the Anglo-Saxons' hegemony is even odder than
that. Readers may have noticed that their first run came to an end
in 1066. That was another clue: yes, it was the Normans _ aka,
nowadays, the French _ who knocked the poor old Anglo-Saxons off
their pedestal, once and for all, as most people thought.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the French squash the English, introducing fancy
words like mutton and pork and beef for the posh folk indoors,
while the downtrodden peasants stuck to good old sheep and pig and
cow, but, quite independently of 1066 and all that, they fizzed up
the entire intellectual scene, just as they did throughout western
Christendom.
</P>
<P>
   So why resurrect this vanquished enemy and turn it into a
bogeyman? A bogeyman it has certainly become.
</P>
<P>
   In France Anglo-Saxonism is held responsible not just for all
the wickedness of global capitalism, but also, to judge by a recent
trawl through the French press, for espionage (the Echelon
scandal), pragmatism (ugh), experimental empiricism (ugh, ugh), the
adversarial judicial system (far inferior to the French
alternative) and transparency (no, not ooh-la-la, alas).
</P>
<P>
   The current Paris jazz fair has prompted a critic to declare
that Anglo-Saxon jazz is ``not systematically better'' (was Louis
Armstrong really French, perhaps, coming from New Orleans, and not
Anglo-Saxon after all?).
</P>
<P>
   And not long ago a rugby match had Le Monde decrying
``Anglo-Saxon refereeing,'' under the headline ``Coup de sifflet:
facheuse tendance anglo-saxonne.'' Should Anglo-Saxophony really
get the blame for all this, or is there a better term?
American-British, English-speaking or plain liberal, perhaps,
depending on the context?

NORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR'S RACE TESTS BUSH AND GORE, TOO

Times Syndicate is for use by clients of The Economist.

<P>
   Over the past three decades, the Republican ticket has carried
North Carolina in every presidential election except one _ in 1976,
when Jimmy Carter of neighboring Georgia won.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period, however, Jim Hunt, a Democrat, won four
elections for governor. He lost a political race only once, in
1984, when Jesse Helms beat him for a seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His political strength has been a bulwark for his party against
a rising tide of Republicanism, and has put him on the (rather
long) shortlist of potential running-mates for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state constitution, Hunt cannot seek a third
consecutive term as governor this year. His absence from the ballot
touched off spirited races for both the Democratic and Republican
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In the primaries on May 2, Republican voters chose Richard
Vinroot, a lanky one-time college-basketball player and former
mayor of Charlotte, as their nominee.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the Republican nomination four years ago as a
relatively moderate Republican, Vinroot hired a former Helms
strategist to recast his image. He emerged as a more aggressive and
right-leaning candidate, defeating two veteran state legislators in
a campaign in which the candidates scrambled to prove who was most
ardently against abortion and gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot apologized for his ``mistake'' in having, as mayor, cut
the ribbon to open a Planned Parenthood facility in Charlotte.
Apparently, he didn't know that some clinics run by the nonprofit
agency performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would restrain the growth of state government,
promised not to raise taxes and advocated voucher programs to help
pupils attend private schools. He also proclaimed his opposition to
a state-run lottery, though he indicated that he would not object
to a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, chose Michael Easley as their nominee. The
telegenic attorney-general with a flair for political creativity
scored a landslide victory over the lieutenant-governor, Dennis
Wicker.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates promised to build on the education reforms of
Hunt (Easley, in particular, wants a state lottery to help pay for
education), and to attack the fouling of air and water by
industrial pig farms scattered across the state's coastal plain.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor in a coastal district in the 1980s, Easley
earned a reputation as a crime-fighter unafraid to take on illegal
drug merchants and corruption in public office.
</P>
<P>
   During his eight years as attorney-general, he raised his
visibility by appearing in TV commercials warning consumers against
fraudulent practices.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is America's largest tobacco-growing state, but,
even so, Easley helped negotiate the settlement that required
cigarette manufacturers to pay billions to state governments.
</P>
<P>
   He was also behind the scheme to put about $2 billion of North
Carolina's take from the tobacco settlement into a charitable
foundation to rebuild rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   In the November elections, there is likely to be some interplay
between the presidential contest and the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history suggests that George W. Bush, the Republican,
starts with an advantage in North Carolina, but the Gore campaign
has signalled that it plans to compete in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore fails to win there, the fact that he is campaigning
will force the Bush campaign to expend time and money _ and it will
give the Democrats a stronger chance of holding the governor's
office. &QL;

<P>
   Over the past three decades, the Republican ticket has carried
North Carolina in every presidential election except one _ in 1976,
when Jimmy Carter of neighboring Georgia won.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period, however, Jim Hunt, a Democrat, won four
elections for governor. He lost a political race only once, in
1984, when Jesse Helms beat him for a seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His political strength has been a bulwark for his party against
a rising tide of Republicanism, and has put him on the (rather
long) shortlist of potential running-mates for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state constitution, Hunt cannot seek a third
consecutive term as governor this year. His absence from the ballot
touched off spirited races for both the Democratic and Republican
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In the primaries on May 2, Republican voters chose Richard
Vinroot, a lanky one-time college-basketball player and former
mayor of Charlotte, as their nominee.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the Republican nomination four years ago as a
relatively moderate Republican, Vinroot hired a former Helms
strategist to recast his image. He emerged as a more aggressive and
right-leaning candidate, defeating two veteran state legislators in
a campaign in which the candidates scrambled to prove who was most
ardently against abortion and gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot apologized for his ``mistake'' in having, as mayor, cut
the ribbon to open a Planned Parenthood facility in Charlotte.
Apparently, he didn't know that some clinics run by the nonprofit
agency performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would restrain the growth of state government,
promised not to raise taxes and advocated voucher programs to help
pupils attend private schools. He also proclaimed his opposition to
a state-run lottery, though he indicated that he would not object
to a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, chose Michael Easley as their nominee. The
telegenic attorney-general with a flair for political creativity
scored a landslide victory over the lieutenant-governor, Dennis
Wicker.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates promised to build on the education reforms of
Hunt (Easley, in particular, wants a state lottery to help pay for
education), and to attack the fouling of air and water by
industrial pig farms scattered across the state's coastal plain.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor in a coastal district in the 1980s, Easley
earned a reputation as a crime-fighter unafraid to take on illegal
drug merchants and corruption in public office.
</P>
<P>
   During his eight years as attorney-general, he raised his
visibility by appearing in TV commercials warning consumers against
fraudulent practices.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is America's largest tobacco-growing state, but,
even so, Easley helped negotiate the settlement that required
cigarette manufacturers to pay billions to state governments.
</P>
<P>
   He was also behind the scheme to put about $2 billion of North
Carolina's take from the tobacco settlement into a charitable
foundation to rebuild rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   In the November elections, there is likely to be some interplay
between the presidential contest and the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history suggests that George W. Bush, the Republican,
starts with an advantage in North Carolina, but the Gore campaign
has signalled that it plans to compete in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore fails to win there, the fact that he is campaigning
will force the Bush campaign to expend time and money _ and it will
give the Democrats a stronger chance of holding the governor's
office. &QL;

<P>
   If you are looking for a demonstration of raw political power,
forget about the elder Daley's Chicago, Tammany Hall or any of
those strange shenanigans they get up to in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, consider Gray Davis's California.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom might say that party machines are a thing of
the past. But on the face of things, the mild-mannered governor has
amassed the sort of political clout that his more brutal
predecessors only dreamed about.
</P>
<P>
   The intriguing question is why he uses it so sparingly. Davis
won election in 1998 by a stunning 20 percentage points. He will
probably be reelected in 2002, unless Al Gore makes him his vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Davis's troops hold 25 of the 40 seats in the state Senate; 47
of the 80 seats in the state Assembly; both federal Senate seats;
and 28 of the 52 seats held by the California delegation to the
House of Representatives. All but two of the statewide elected
officials are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary in March, Al Gore beat George W. Bush by seven
percentage points, and in the latest polls the vice president looks
likely to carry California just as Bill Clinton did in the last two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   More telling, perhaps, is the complete shambles that the
Republicans find themselves in. Even the two state officers who
managed to win in the teeth of the Davis Democratic landslide are
in poor shape today.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jones, the state secretary, backed John McCain rather than
Bush in the primary in March this year, putting him out of favor
with the mass of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Charles Quackenbush, the centrist insurance
commissioner who briefly seemed the Republicans' last best hope, is
going down in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Were Davis a more Machiavellian type, it would be tempting to
imagine him plotting the hearing Quackenbush recently had to endure
in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the insurance commissioner admitted, it had not been wise
to forgive the large fines owed by insurance firms that had failed
to pay victims of the Northridge earthquake in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it had been a bad idea to let them make rather smaller
contributions to foundations he had set up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was not good that the foundations had given none of this
money to the earthquake victims but, instead _ among other things _
to a football camp that Quackenbush's sons attended.
</P>
<P>
   All that stands between California's Republicans and utter
collapse is the hope that Bush, at the top of the ticket in
November, will pull them through the election without losing any
more seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 425) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The only apparent constitutional brake on Democratic ambitions
is the requirement that the state budget pass by a two-thirds
majority; this ensures that as long as the Republicans retain their
seats in the state Senate, their views cannot be altogether
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are now praying that Bush does not follow his
father's example and in effect abandon California, giving the
Democrats a chance to increase their majority.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Davis's battalions will probably control the
redistricting process next year, giving them another chance to lock
in the party's advantages for the future. Big Business certainly
seems to have reached that conclusion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Davis has raised a record $1.2 million a month since taking
office at the beginning of 1999. Not only have habitual Democratic
supporters such as the unions and lawyers showered money on him,
but also the oil industry, agriculture, and such stalwart
Republican paymasters as Gallo, Fox and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   These defections are extremely pleasing for Democrats. But they
also reflect Davis's pitch to his corporate backers. He portrays
himself as a regulatory and fiscal conservative who offers
insurance against the wilder instincts of the left wing of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   The last two Democrats elected governor _ both members of the
Brown dynasty _ built up the state institutions California
Democrats cherish: Pat introduced grand educational and
infrastructure programs, while son Jerry expanded the state's green
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals who had hoped for more of the same from Davis have
watched in dismay as he has vetoed all but a small set of measures
creating performance indices for schools (and some would argue that
this is a Republican idea).
</P>
<P>
   A cautious soul who has devoted most of his life to crawling
slowly up the ladder of California Democratic Party politics (and
who has endured endless taunts about the aptness of his first
name), Davis seems convinced that the lesson of his own landslide
is that drawing away from the center in pursuit of a radical agenda
is to court disaster.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Pete Wilson, was a moderate Republican, but he
listened to the extremist wing of his party by endorsing an
anti-immigrant program. That helped secure Wilson's own reelection
in 1994, but it also stirred up a backlash among California's many
Latinos and Asians that wiped out Davis's Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A policy of clinging to the center is not without risks. A
warning shot, showing how the Democrats might be sunk, was fired in
March last year.
</P>
<P>
   A pocket of California that did appear truly one-party, where
the question was not ``Which party do you like?'' but ``Which
faction within the party do you like?'' _ a perpetually Democratic
assembly seat in Oakland where no Republican had even bothered to
run _ elected the first Green representative in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, a Californian, has promised a Green run at the
presidency this year, and could carve support away from the
Democrats' left flank.
</P>
<P>
   There is even the chance of Seattle-hardened rowdies disrupting
Davis's showpiece _ the Democratic Convention to be held in Los
Angeles in August.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the odds are that Davis has got it right. The truth is that
California is not a one-party state but a no-party state. Its
policies are increasingly dictated by ballot propositions voted on
directly by the people.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits have winnowed away the professional politicians and
knocked holes in the boilers of the party machines.
</P>
<P>
   Davis's paralysis is the fear of a politician who has lived
through tax revolts and has seen the punishment that voters mete
out to mainstream parties.
</P>
<P>
   He has achieved party dominance at precisely the time that the
country's fastest-evolving state is reaching beyond the party lines
that have defined American politics in the 20th century. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Having put in a magnificent performance as a
stand-up comic at last weekend's White House correspondents'
dinner, President Bill Clinton was back on deadly serious form on
May 2, tackling two of America's most worrying problems: the glass
ceiling that prevents parents from rising to the top at work, and
the difficulty of raising teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear that terrible ceiling crack as Clinton
issued his executive order banning federal employers from denying
people jobs or promotions because of their parental obligations.
</P>
<P>
   All those honest folk who once had to make a choice between
climbing the greasy pole or weaning their daughters off Black
Sabbath will now be able to get the best of both worlds _ and sue
if anybody tries to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send a clear signal to employers that there is
nothing wrong with being a parent,'' said Bruce Reed, the
president's chief domestic policy adviser, in one of the bravest
speeches of his career.
</P>
<P>
   There were nevertheless two big disappointments. First, the
private sector is still dead set against parental rights, on the
extraordinary grounds that it ``targets a nonexistent problem'' and
creates yet more opportunities for frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a little harsh to say that this is part of the
conspiracy of the childless to preserve their control of corporate
America. But it is worth noting that, in a recent survey of the
heads of America's biggest companies, exclusive to The Economist,
only 10 percent reported having any kids ``that they know of.''
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is an all-too-familiar one with the Clinton
White House: vagueness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his attack on discrimination at a conference
attended by many of the country's leading experts on raising
teenagers. The experts came up with some superb solutions to the
teenage problem, but the White House (recently free of its own
teenager) failed to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   The conference recommended that families should ``break bread
together.'' A Council of Economic Advisers report found that
teenagers who dine regularly with their parents are less likely to
become involved with alcohol, drugs, violence or sex (no, we are
not making that up).
</P>
<P>
   But what sort of bread should they break? What is the optimum
combination of foods to promote healthy teenage growth? Should they
eat fish on Friday and roast beef on Sunday? And, if so, what
options should be provided for the inevitable sulking vegetarians?
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also worryingly silent on how to prevent
women from bearing a disproportionate share of the burden of
preparing all these family meals.
</P>
<P>
   Should the government offer tax credits so that more men can
learn to cook? Or should it issue an executive order mandating that
men must do all the table-setting and dishwashing?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the conference recommended that parents should give
their children more chores, on the grounds that these help them be
``effective, contributing members of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   But parents should be careful how often they ask their teenagers
to take out the trash or pick up their clothes from the floor,
since federal regulations are strict about hours worked without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The last recommendation is the most dangerously vague of all:
that employers should provide flexitime for all parents who have
teenagers living at home.
</P>
<P>
   But how do we know that these parents will use their flexitime
wisely? There are grounds for thinking that at least some of them
will spend their time vegetating on the couch in front of ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' with or without their teenage progeny, rather
than offering counselling on the evils of sex, drink and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal solution, from all sorts of perspectives, might be to
recruit a corps of people who can report, discreetly of course, on
whether people are using their ``parenting time'' wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would make an ideal chief family monitor. &QL;

Sabbath will now be able to get the best of both worlds _ and sue
if anybody tries to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send a clear signal to employers that there is
nothing wrong with being a parent,'' said Bruce Reed, the
president's chief domestic policy adviser, in one of the bravest
speeches of his career.
</P>
<P>
   There were nevertheless two big disappointments. First, the
private sector is still dead set against parental rights, on the
extraordinary grounds that it ``targets a nonexistent problem'' and
creates yet more opportunities for frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a little harsh to say that this is part of the
conspiracy of the childless to preserve their control of corporate
America. But it is worth noting that, in a recent survey of the
heads of America's biggest companies, exclusive to The Economist,
only 10 percent reported having any kids ``that they know of.''
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is an all-too-familiar one with the Clinton
White House: vagueness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his attack on discrimination at a conference
attended by many of the country's leading experts on raising
teenagers. The experts came up with some superb solutions to the
teenage problem, but the White House (recently free of its own
teenager) failed to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   The conference recommended that families should ``break bread
together.'' A Council of Economic Advisers report found that
teenagers who dine regularly with their parents are less likely to
become involved with alcohol, drugs, violence or sex (no, we are
not making that up).
</P>
<P>
   But what sort of bread should they break? What is the optimum
combination of foods to promote healthy teenage growth? Should they
eat fish on Friday and roast beef on Sunday? And, if so, what
options should be provided for the inevitable sulking vegetarians?
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also worryingly silent on how to prevent
women from bearing a disproportionate share of the burden of
preparing all these family meals.
</P>
<P>
   Should the government offer tax credits so that more men can
learn to cook? Or should it issue an executive order mandating that
men must do all the table-setting and dishwashing?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the conference recommended that parents should give
their children more chores, on the grounds that these help them be
``effective, contributing members of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   But parents should be careful how often they ask their teenagers
to take out the trash or pick up their clothes from the floor,
since federal regulations are strict about hours worked without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The last recommendation is the most dangerously vague of all:
that employers should provide flexitime for all parents who have
teenagers living at home.
</P>
<P>
   But how do we know that these parents will use their flexitime
wisely? There are grounds for thinking that at least some of them
will spend their time vegetating on the couch in front of ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' with or without their teenage progeny, rather
than offering counselling on the evils of sex, drink and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal solution, from all sorts of perspectives, might be to
recruit a corps of people who can report, discreetly of course, on
whether people are using their ``parenting time'' wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would make an ideal chief family monitor. &QL;

   ANNAPOLIS, MD. _ Is the high-tech party over, as Nasdaq bucks
and slides? Not if messing about in boats is anything to go by.
</P>
<P>
   Buying something that needs a rudder has always been an
indicator of economic confidence (few people need a boat to take
the children to school).
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, yachting and power-boating have taken
off in a big way, especially among the techies of the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   James Denn, executive editor of Boating Industry International
magazine, reports that total sales in the American recreational
boating market were up more than 19 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plushest yachts actually come from Germany. But
Sailing/Cruising World magazine still reckons that sailing-boat
production in North America increased by 16 percent from 1998 to
1999, with strong growth in the large (over 36-foot) boat sector.
</P>
<P>
   Boating-accessory sales are booming, too. Don Durant, the owner
of Club Nautique/Cruising Specialists, a San Francisco firm, has
seen fresh demand for his products at close hand. Since March 1999
``it's been almost straight uphill.''
</P>
<P>
   Are his customers mostly the IT crowd? ``And how! We're close to
Silicon Valley so we're seeing a huge increase in buyers with cash
as opposed to credit. Lots of people with bonuses, options,
founder's stock, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand miles away in Annapolis, Md., Rob Emmet, the
owner of Performance Yacht Systems, a boating-accessory e-business
set up in 1997, noticed demand from areas such as Silicon Valley
and the Northwest almost immediately. Orders came from the Seattle
area ``even before we advertised.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology folk are not known for their love of natural light,
let alone the great outdoors. Boats seem to be an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of technology gurus such as Bill Gates
(Microsoft), Larry Ellison (Oracle) and Jim Clark (Netscape), all
owners of extremely sleek sail or power yachts, cannot be
discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Durant says he saw a flow diagram published recently showing the
steps to going public. One of the steps was ``Order new yacht.''
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of this watery enthusiasm has been sated on borrowed
money.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Bankers Association recorded a 25 percent
growth in marine loans booked for 1998, with similar figures
expected for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom in the industry holds that interest-rate
fluctuations have a great impact on the purchase of boats. Now
people are beginning to talk about there being so much credit
available that the old rules no longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   The link between boating and confidence in laptop land appears
to be a strong one. Despite the travails of Nasdaq, larger
purchases are still holding up.
</P>
<P>
   When the high-tech admirals start leaving their vessels at the
pier, it may be time to bail out. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All the talk in technology publishing is of the
``thud factor.'' Subscribers are said to prefer computer magazines
that make a loud slap when they hit the desk. If that is true,
American readers are certainly getting what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Technology magazines today are as thick as telephone books. The
current issues of the six leading technology publications _
Business 2.0, Fast Company, the Industry Standard, Red Herring,
Upside and Wired _ boast between 300 and 600 pages each.
</P>
<P>
   And soon there will be even more thuds. This week, Time Inc.'s
Fortune is launching a new magazine called eCompany Now, whose
first issue runs to more than 300 pages.
</P>
<P>
   And this autumn, Business 2.0 and the Industry Standard are
launching European editions.
</P>
<P>
   This is, to some extent, a media bubble inflated by the larger
Internet bubble. Hundreds of Internet start-ups need to advertise
to develop their brands.
</P>
<P>
   The six leading tech magazines _ all monthlies, except the
Industry Standard, which is a weekly _ increased their combined
number of advertising pages in January and February by 150 percent
on the same period last year, to 2,390, according to Adscope, a
market-research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy tech rags are nothing new. In the heyday of the PC,
computer publications offering everything but the kitchen sink to
computer hobbyists were over 1,000 pages thick.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of magazines, however, is different. They are
not about the nuts and bolts of computers: they are about how the
world is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Upside (205,000 circulation) and Red Herring (163,000) are the
granddaddies of the genre. Originally pure Silicon Valley
publications, they are now trying to broaden their base.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring, in particular, wants to spread the word about the
region's innovation model. Wired (469,000) and Fast Company
(403,000) added lifestyle to the mix in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Wired, now owned by Conde Nast after an aborted attempt at a
stock market flotation in 1996, has morphed from being a central
organ of the cyber-elite into an interesting read about
cutting-edge technologies. Fast Company is a sort of Cosmopolitan
for middle managers in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard (150,000) and Business 2.0 (210,000), both
founded in 1998, are the newest entrants. They are targeted at the
``transformers'' (Business 2.0) or ``e-strategists'' (Industry
Standard) _ senior managers who are involved in their company's
Internet strategy and yearn for guidance in these difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers love this crowd, which is why there are more and
more non-technology advertisements in these magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Their readers are youngish (on average about 38 years old),
highly educated (almost half have a postgraduate degree), affluent
(the average household income is well above $100,000) and
influential (more than 50 percent are in top management).
</P>
<P>
   The ad rates are correspondingly pricey. The Industry Standard,
for example, charges $139 per thousand copies in circulation,
compared with $86 for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two months of this year the San-Francisco-based
magazine, which had already increased its advertising pages by 440
percent in 1999, outpaced the mainstream magazines in advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Although their riches come from the new economy, these
publications are solidly old media. They use the Internet for
promotion _ the Industry Standard sends out more than 10 million
e-mail newsletters per month _ but their focus is on the
old-fashioned paper product.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, beginning to exploit their brand profitably
in new businesses. The Industry Standard, for example, is charging
an impressive $4,300 for its three-day Internet summit in July, and
has sold 400 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics predict that these streams of money will soon dry up,
once the Internet bubble bursts. Many dot.com ads will certainly go
away, but surely not the interest in technology news.
</P>
<P>
   A correction might even be a good thing: readers are starting to
complain about information overload and too many advertisements.
That is mainly why Business 2.0 and Red Herring will go biweekly _
and so a bit thinner _ some time this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger threat comes from the mainstream business titles.
They have moved into the tech magazines' territory, increasing
their technology coverage substantially and have launched
technology supplements. (The Economist, too, plans a quarterly
supplement for later this year.)
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the tech magazines is that they may fall victim
to exactly what they so often predict: as technology becomes
ubiquitous, magazines devoted solely to that field will find
themselves obsolete. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The new generation of magazines, however, is different. They are
not about the nuts and bolts of computers: they are about how the
world is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Upside (205,000 circulation) and Red Herring (163,000) are the
granddaddies of the genre. Originally pure Silicon Valley
publications, they are now trying to broaden their base.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring, in particular, wants to spread the word about the
region's innovation model. Wired (469,000) and Fast Company
(403,000) added lifestyle to the mix in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Wired, now owned by Conde Nast after an aborted attempt at a
stock market flotation in 1996, has morphed from being a central
organ of the cyber-elite into an interesting read about
cutting-edge technologies. Fast Company is a sort of Cosmopolitan
for middle managers in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard (150,000) and Business 2.0 (210,000), both
founded in 1998, are the newest entrants. They are targeted at the
``transformers'' (Business 2.0) or ``e-strategists'' (Industry
Standard) _ senior managers who are involved in their company's
Internet strategy and yearn for guidance in these difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers love this crowd, which is why there are more and
more non-technology advertisements in these magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Their readers are youngish (on average about 38 years old),
highly educated (almost half have a postgraduate degree), affluent
(the average household income is well above $100,000) and
influential (more than 50 percent are in top management).
</P>
<P>
   The ad rates are correspondingly pricey. The Industry Standard,
for example, charges $139 per thousand copies in circulation,
compared with $86 for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two months of this year the San-Francisco-based
magazine, which had already increased its advertising pages by 440
percent in 1999, outpaced the mainstream magazines in advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Although their riches come from the new economy, these
publications are solidly old media. They use the Internet for
promotion _ the Industry Standard sends out more than 10 million
e-mail newsletters per month _ but their focus is on the
old-fashioned paper product.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, beginning to exploit their brand profitably
in new businesses. The Industry Standard, for example, is charging
an impressive $4,300 for its three-day Internet summit in July, and
has sold 400 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics predict that these streams of money will soon dry up,
once the Internet bubble bursts. Many dot.com ads will certainly go
away, but surely not the interest in technology news.
</P>
<P>
   A correction might even be a good thing: readers are starting to
complain about information overload and too many advertisements.
That is mainly why Business 2.0 and Red Herring will go biweekly _
and so a bit thinner _ some time this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger threat comes from the mainstream business titles.
They have moved into the tech magazines' territory, increasing
their technology coverage substantially and have launched
technology supplements. (The Economist, too, plans a quarterly
supplement for later this year.)
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the tech magazines is that they may fall victim
to exactly what they so often predict: as technology becomes
ubiquitous, magazines devoted solely to that field will find
themselves obsolete. &QL;

<P>
   SAO PAULO _ The skies over South America are going to get
emptier.
</P>
<P>
   On April 28 a new rescue plan for Aerolineas Argentinas drawn up
by the Boston Consulting Group was leaked to La Nacion, an
Argentine newspaper. It involves big cuts in domestic and
international services, and the loss of perhaps 1,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, TAM and Transbrasil, two of Brazil's four big
airlines, said they were discussing an ``operational partnership''
to cut the overlap between their flights, a step widely seen as
leading to an eventual merger and thus significant cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, the deeply indebted Vasp, another of
Brazil's big four, had announced the ``temporary'' suspension of
its flights to North America and Europe from the middle of this
month, after Boeing had demanded some of its airplanes back because
Vasp was not keeping up its lease payments.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first hint that Vasp is in difficulties. Last
year, a check for part of its arrears in airport fees bounced; now
Infraero, the airports authority, insists on being paid weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian post office stopped using Vasp to carry letters,
claiming that the airline had faked a document to keep the
contract. Vasp denies this. Pilots and other staff took the firm to
court last month after they were not paid.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, many of the region's airlines expanded their
capacity, expecting demand to rise. But it shrank in the wake of
Brazil's devaluation crisis in early 1999, at the same time as the
airlines were facing ever more competition from airlines in the
United States, which enjoy bigger economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Aerolineas Argentinas, as well as being squeezed on
long-distance flights by North American competition, has faced
growing pressure on domestic and regional routes from LAPA and
other local airlines that set up after Argentina's deregulation of
services in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, just when the industry's prospects were looking
up, along came the surge in the price of oil _ and thus of aviation
fuel _ to add to the squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   New figures for Brazil's domestic flights in the first quarter
show that only 58 percent of seats were taken. That is a little
higher than the same period last year, but Bob Booth, president of
AvMan, a Miami-based airline consultancy, says that around 65
percent seat occupation is the industry's typical break-even point.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that some rationalization might make sense. But
how much? There are some, such as Francisco Gros, president of the
Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), who reckon that there might be
room for only one large local airline in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   LAPA's boss, Ronnie Boyd, has suggested that the same may be
true of Argentina. Gros points to Canada and Mexico, where in each
case the two big local airlines have merged.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Vasp suggested combining Brazil's big four into one,
but at the time it could not persuade the others to join.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Brazil's competition authorities have just approved a
monopolistic merger between the country's two biggest brewers with
only a few restrictions, it is perfectly possible to imagine them
waving through a domestic air monopoly, even though they are
currently investigating the airlines over allegations of a price
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   But Booth reckons that it is unduly pessimistic to argue that
there is room for only one local airline per country outside
America: Australia continues with two large local carriers, and
recent ticket-price rises are attracting foreign airlines to start
competing on domestic routes there.
</P>
<P>
   There is scope for some South American carriers to cut costs by
retiring older aircraft (which can guzzle up to 40 percent more
fuel than new ones) and standardizing fleets to cut training and
maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo Pereira, an analyst at Banco Pactual in Rio de Janeiro,
adds that in-flight service on some short routes is over-elaborate,
so a cheap no-frills airline could survive alongside one of the
existing operators.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, the business of cutting out travel agents and
selling tickets directly to customers over the Internet is saving
airlines money. But it is only just starting in South America.
</P>
<P>
   And Brazilian airlines are looking forward to the outcome of
their case against the government over a price freeze in 1986-92:
Transbrasil has already won compensation of 725 million reais ($400
million) over this (most of which went to paying off its
social-security debts), and the others hope for similar payouts.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, though, the region's economy is now back on
track for growth. Since air travel, per head of the population, is
still way below North American levels, the industry's long-term
prospects ought to be good.
</P>
<P>
   Projections for the next decade by America's Federal Aviation
Authority (FAA) say that the world's fastest growth rates are
likely to be in Latin America. And, as other parts of the world
have seen, airlines can come back from the dead. Lufthansa and
Iberia did it in Europe; so did Mexicana and Aeromexico in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   There may be space in South America's skies for more airlines
than the past year's terrible results suggest. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the condemned home of sleazy stockbroking
practices to the shining temple of cutting-edge technology-company
shares in only five years, Nasdaq's image has undergone quite a
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, allegations of price-fixing by brokers, and an
investigation by the Department of Justice, suggested that the
world's second-biggest stock market's days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Now, crowds gather most days to pay homage to the ``new
economy'' at Nasdaq's new giant multicolored share-price screen in
New York's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq is rapidly taking its technology gospel to the corners of
the earth. On May 3, it took a giant step towards its goal of
creating the ``first global digital stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal between the London and Frankfurt stock
exchanges, the new entity will create a joint venture with Nasdaq,
under the Nasdaq brand. This will replace its earlier planned
Nasdaq Europe, launched last November, and will combine with
Frankfurt's Neuer Markt for tech stocks and London's less
successful techMARK.
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredients of a 24-hour global Nasdaq stock market are
now in place. Last week it announced a deal with the government of
Quebec to launch Nasdaq Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999 it agreed to launch Nasdaq Japan with Softbank, an
Internet venture firm. This exchange is to go live later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq claims a ``special relationship'' with Sydney's stock
market, and says that negotiations are under way with South
Korea's.
</P>
<P>
   Already up and running, albeit on a modest scale, is a deal with
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that allows some of Nasdaq's main
shares to trade in Hong Kong, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, this global alliance will allow companies to gain
access to foreign capital more easily, says Frank Zarb, the chief
executive appointed to clean up Nasdaq after the price-fixing
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And it will make it easier for investors to trade in shares
listed abroad, as long as they meet the regulatory requirements of
the country in which the investor is located.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb expects shares in as many as 500 companies to change hands
around the clock throughout the world within three to five years.
Whether this is what investors want remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Since the merger of Daimler and Chrysler, almost all of the
trading in the new firm's shares has shifted to Frankfurt, during
German trading hours, even though the shares are listed around the
world, which is hardly encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Still, big institutional investors certainly want fewer
exchanges. And retail investors will welcome easier access to
foreign shares.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb can be well pleased with his success, particularly as his
exchange seems to offer little to its foreign partners. Few foreign
exchanges will want to import Nasdaq's strange market structure,
which reflects America's quirky system of stock market regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq is the automated share-price quotation system of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory body
for broker-dealers.
</P>
<P>
   It has an increasingly competitive relationship with those
broker-dealers that run their own electronic-trading systems, known
as ECNs. Yet order-handling rules introduced to stop price-fixing
in effect make Nasdaq subsidize some of these ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's foreign partners would be mad to copy that. And
questions still remain about how good a price investors get on the
Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, despite its popularity with technology companies, is
Nasdaq's own trading technology much cop. Problems with it are one
reason why it asked the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
main market watchdog, to delay the introduction of decimal pricing
of shares (instead of 16ths of a dollar) until next year _ to the
delight of the rival New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest,
which has its technology ready now.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasdaq has at least done a better job than the NYSE of
transforming itself into a for-profit, soon to be public, company.
This may have put it in a stronger position to form partnerships
with foreign exchanges, many of which are also going public, than
the Big Board, which says it is unlikely to become a public company
before late 2001, if then.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's biggest asset is its brand as the global byword for
technology stocks. In Argentina, locals have nicknamed Argentina's
aspiring new tech market the ``Nasdaquita.'' The Neuer Markt's
willingness to throw in its lot with a Nasdaq exchange is ample
proof of the brand's value.
</P>
<P>
   There will be rival global stock market alliances, but Nasdaq
will be the market of choice for many of the world's technology
companies. The biggest threat is that this brand may become a
wasting asset if technology-stock prices do not rediscover their
zip. &QL;

questions still remain about how good a price investors get on the
Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, despite its popularity with technology companies, is
Nasdaq's own trading technology much cop. Problems with it are one
reason why it asked the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
main market watchdog, to delay the introduction of decimal pricing
of shares (instead of 16ths of a dollar) until next year _ to the
delight of the rival New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest,
which has its technology ready now.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasdaq has at least done a better job than the NYSE of
transforming itself into a for-profit, soon to be public, company.
This may have put it in a stronger position to form partnerships
with foreign exchanges, many of which are also going public, than
the Big Board, which says it is unlikely to become a public company
before late 2001, if then.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's biggest asset is its brand as the global byword for
technology stocks. In Argentina, locals have nicknamed Argentina's
aspiring new tech market the ``Nasdaquita.'' The Neuer Markt's
willingness to throw in its lot with a Nasdaq exchange is ample
proof of the brand's value.
</P>
<P>
   There will be rival global stock market alliances, but Nasdaq
will be the market of choice for many of the world's technology
companies. The biggest threat is that this brand may become a
wasting asset if technology-stock prices do not rediscover their
zip. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ ``I am very happy to pull my money out of the
market,'' says George Soros, a hedge-fund investor who won fame and
notoriety in equal measure by helping to force sterling out of
Europe's exchange-rate mechanism in 1992, and was blamed by some
Southeast Asian countries for contributing to their crises in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and politicians around the world have long fretted
about the malign effects of big hedge funds on financial markets,
especially after the near-collapse in 1998 of Long-Term Capital
Management, another big hedge fund, threatened to damage the
world's financial system hugely.
</P>
<P>
   These worries were perhaps overdone. In March Julian Robertson,
a man almost as famous (and as self-important) as Soros, closed
down Tiger, the hedge fund that he ran.
</P>
<P>
   Now Soros, after a lifetime in the markets, has made his
biggest, and possibly last, investment decision: that he does not
understand what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   His two biggest funds, Quantum and Quota, have, in effect, been
shut down; and the two men who ran those funds _ respectively
Stanley Druckenmiller and Nicholas Roditi _ will retire.
</P>
<P>
   This might be dismissed as nothing more than a few rich people
quitting at a time when the markets are unusually volatile, with
reputations that can go nowhere but down and wealth beyond the
dreams of avarice. But their decisions carry greater significance.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, some of America's most accomplished investors are
stepping aside. Last weekend Warren Buffett told shareholders in
Berkshire Hathaway, his investment company, that share valuations
were too high and that Berkshire's exposure to equities, which has
already been cut sharply, would be reduced still further.
</P>
<P>
   And now the most famous and one of the most successful
financiers of the age has all but quit.
</P>
<P>
   All are leaving a market which, they think, has become
irrational, in which trusted ways of valuing shares no longer work,
and relationships between assets and economic variables no longer
apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is now crazy _ insane, unbelievably
dangerous,'' says Druckenmiller
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are important differences between these
investors. Buffett and Robertson have long made clear their refusal
to touch ``new economy'' shares.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett likens investing in Internet stocks to a ``chain
letter,'' in which early participants get rich at the expense of
later ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Soros and Druckenmiller did not eschew tech shares
completely. In part this is because Druckenmiller is a
half-believer in the new economy. But it is also because they were
burned when they tried to bet against such stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost $700 million in March 1999 by selling tech shares
short, and similar amounts the year before, they started to dabble
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum invested heavily in Qualcomm, Veritas and a number of
other technology shares in the second half of last year, turning
around what would otherwise have been a rotten 1999. But when
Nasdaq plunged in March and April, Quantum suffered such heavy
losses that Soros and Druckenmiller decided to call it a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the last in, we felt it incumbent to be the first out,''
says Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Although his funds lost some $2.5 billion in high-tech shares,
Druckenmiller reckons that buying was still a good strategy:
Quantum kept half the original $5 billion profits that it had made
_ more, by far, than it made betting against the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the two men do not want to punt either way. Yes,
tech stocks, in particular, are absurdly overvalued. But then they
also were last year.
</P>
<P>
   Soros says that, in these circumstances, ``it is too dangerous
and crazy to short. You could have shorted the market in March of
1929 and lost everything.'' If you cannot go long and cannot go
short, the only other place to go is away.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller had considered quitting ever since his record
began to deteriorate badly after 1996. Certainly, Quantum's recent
results have not lived up to previous glories.
</P>
<P>
   Its returns have lagged the S&AMP;P 500 by over six percentage
points a year for the past six years. A failure to read the markets
correctly in February proved the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw Robertson announce his retirement he was, he says,
``jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   The closure of Quantum and Tiger, at one time the world's two
biggest hedge funds, should calm the nerves of those politicians
who think that hedge funds are a danger to world markets and should
be reined in.
</P>
<P>
   America's Congress has been considering a bill that would force
the big funds to disclose more about themselves _ a move backed by
the Financial Stability Forum, an international committee of the
great and the good.
</P>
<P>
   The committee even considered whether hedge funds, unregulated
for now, should be brought under the regulatory umbrella. Although
the French and Germans were in favor, the committee rejected such a
move, at least for now. But hedge funds are clearly less scary than
they used to be. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850. UNCUT VERSION IS 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Regulators might still be interested to hear what Druckenmiller
has to say about risk-management models, especially the ubiquitous
value-at-risk (VAR) models, which purport to show how much an
institution might lose.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum was forced by its bankers to use such models after their
near-death experience with LTCM. ``VAR is extremely dangerous.
People look at their computer models and think they are safe. Much
better to have no models and watch your own net worth every day.''
Watching it crumble is what told him to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Will Quantum and Tiger take their particular style of hedge
fund, with its big, aggressive bets on all manner of financial
assets, with them into retirement?
</P>
<P>
   Of the big funds, only Moore Capital, with $12 billion of
assets, and Tudor Investments, with $2 billion, are left. Soros
does not rule out the possibility that opportunities remain for
others.
</P>
<P>
   If the hedge funds had only got it right, the euro's slide would
have been an attractive bet. Still, there may be reasons why they
did not.
</P>
<P>
   Both his funds and Tiger started life as equity hedge funds. As
they got bigger, they migrated into other investments in which they
had less expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The likes of Tudor and Moore Capital, on the other hand, started
in the futures markets and have long punted on all manner of
things.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these two seem better able to delegate responsibility
to those who know what they are doing: Tiger, at least, was run by
what one insider calls a ``back-seat driver,'' making it less able
to retain talented staff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, unlike other sorts of hedge fund, ``macro'' funds have in
general had a dismal time lately. Many have been wrong-footed.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger famously lost some $2 billion in September 1998, when the
yen rose sharply and unexpectedly. And last year many were caught
out by the rises in the prices of oil, of American Treasuries and
of the yen, and by the fall in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, financial markets have become less liquid (partly because
banks, their counterparties, are less willing to take risks),
making bets more expensive. And as they have got bigger, managers
gripe, those with whom they deal often try to do the same trades as
they do, queering their pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that macro funds are far less keen to take big
punts. All in all, says Nicola Meaden, who runs TASS, a research
firm, ``the era of the classic macro hedge fund is drawing to a
close.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the railings against them by regulators, that would be a
bad thing. Without the willingness of hedge funds to take risks and
bet against irrational trends, the markets would be more volatile,
not less.
</P>
<P>
   Have no fear. Investors, hedge funds included, wisely get out of
a market when it gets too bubbly to call, but when good
opportunities arise they'll be back. &QL;

   ULAN BATOR _ For the ten years since the end of communism in
Mongolia, the banking system has inflicted more costs than benefits
upon the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Governments have collapsed over the issue of banking reform, and
the outcome has been a financial system dominated by rotten state
banks and a welter of poorly supervised private ones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now a political consensus has emerged to get the state out
of banking, bring foreigners in, and improve supervision. That
should lay the foundations for serious economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   This ex-vassal of the Soviet Union might yet have one of the
best banking systems in developing Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Political shenanigans in the past ensured that bad state banks
were neither shut down nor privatized. ``Restructurings'' were
mainly a way to avoid pain. But, prodded by the Bank of Mongolia,
the central bank, the government now thinks that drastic action is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the central bank forced into liquidation the
two worst state-owned banks, the Investment and Technological
Innovation Bank, and the Reconstruction Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The latter possibly had the world's highest bad-loan ratio _
over 95 percent. This is the first time that any insolvent banks
have been forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   For those that remain open, minimum capital-adequacy
requirements have been doubled. New banks must immediately meet the
requirements; longer-established ones have until the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of banks in Mongolia has fallen from 18 to 12. As
well as the liquidations, a handful of private banks with
insufficient capital have closed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the country still looks over-banked: there are a mere 2.5
million people in Mongolia, with an annual per capita income of a
little over $400 a year. More mergers are on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   A third insolvent bank, the Agricultural Bank, merits closure by
any dispassionate measure. Yet its social importance is immense: in
Mongolia's vast rural areas, it is the only bank that most people
have ever walked into.
</P>
<P>
   Even though distant branches often have no money to dispense,
the bank's removal would destroy any stirrings of a money economy.
So the government will soon advertise for a foreign boss to turn
the bank around.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Mongolia's biggest bank, the state-owned Trade and
Development Bank. After general elections in July, parliament will
be asked to approve the bank's privatization.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have no hang-ups about foreign ownership:
international banks will be invited to bid. A Citigroup or an HSBC,
the authorities believe, would benefit the Trade and Development
Bank and the whole financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Jigjidiyn Unenbat, the central bank's governor, argues that
Mongolia is over the worst of its banking crisis. Now he wants the
level of financial intermediation in the economy to rise threefold.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of scope. Mongolia's ratio of M2 to GDP, a
measure of the role that money plays in the economy, has declined
over the past few years to only 18 percent, on a par with Africa's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   The multilateral institutions are betting on Mongolia. Late last
month the World Bank approved a $32 million soft loan for
financial-sector restructuring. The Asian Development Bank is
dispensing advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is
about to welcome Mongolia into the fold _ although Ulan Bator is
twice as close to the Pacific as it is to the North Sea. &QL;

banks and a welter of poorly supervised private ones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now a political consensus has emerged to get the state out
of banking, bring foreigners in, and improve supervision. That
should lay the foundations for serious economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   This ex-vassal of the Soviet Union might yet have one of the
best banking systems in developing Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Political shenanigans in the past ensured that bad state banks
were neither shut down nor privatized. ``Restructurings'' were
mainly a way to avoid pain. But, prodded by the Bank of Mongolia,
the central bank, the government now thinks that drastic action is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the central bank forced into liquidation the
two worst state-owned banks, the Investment and Technological
Innovation Bank, and the Reconstruction Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The latter possibly had the world's highest bad-loan ratio _
over 95 percent. This is the first time that any insolvent banks
have been forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   For those that remain open, minimum capital-adequacy
requirements have been doubled. New banks must immediately meet the
requirements; longer-established ones have until the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of banks in Mongolia has fallen from 18 to 12. As
well as the liquidations, a handful of private banks with
insufficient capital have closed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the country still looks over-banked: there are a mere 2.5
million people in Mongolia, with an annual per capita income of a
little over $400 a year. More mergers are on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   A third insolvent bank, the Agricultural Bank, merits closure by
any dispassionate measure. Yet its social importance is immense: in
Mongolia's vast rural areas, it is the only bank that most people
have ever walked into.
</P>
<P>
   Even though distant branches often have no money to dispense,
the bank's removal would destroy any stirrings of a money economy.
So the government will soon advertise for a foreign boss to turn
the bank around.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Mongolia's biggest bank, the state-owned Trade and
Development Bank. After general elections in July, parliament will
be asked to approve the bank's privatization.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have no hang-ups about foreign ownership:
international banks will be invited to bid. A Citigroup or an HSBC,
the authorities believe, would benefit the Trade and Development
Bank and the whole financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Jigjidiyn Unenbat, the central bank's governor, argues that
Mongolia is over the worst of its banking crisis. Now he wants the
level of financial intermediation in the economy to rise threefold.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of scope. Mongolia's ratio of M2 to GDP, a
measure of the role that money plays in the economy, has declined
over the past few years to only 18 percent, on a par with Africa's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   The multilateral institutions are betting on Mongolia. Late last
month the World Bank approved a $32 million soft loan for
financial-sector restructuring. The Asian Development Bank is
dispensing advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is
about to welcome Mongolia into the fold _ although Ulan Bator is
twice as close to the Pacific as it is to the North Sea. &QL;

<P>
   XAI-XAI _ The rivers that flooded Mozambique in February gained
pace and volume as they neared the sea. So a coastal town such as
Xai-Xai, at the mouth of the great Limpopo River, was a dangerous
place to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Limpopo, whose width swelled to over 100km (63 miles) in
places, hit the town so fast that locals had almost no time to
prepare, and so forcefully that most preparations proved useless.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of water roared over Xai-Xai's defensive dykes like a
herd of elephants over a speed bump. Residents who had prudently
placed their televisions and refrigerators on the roof watched
aghast as their whole houses were flushed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The flood crushed the slums, and drowned the commercial
district. Fields of maize were inundated. The road to the capital,
Maputo, was cut, along with the telephone and electricity cables
that run beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   The city was plunged into darkness. Food prices tripled. Only
those with mobile phones could call the outside world for help.
</P>
<P>
   It is less than two months since the world's cheeks were
dampened by news of a young Mozambican woman giving birth in a
tree, which she had climbed to escape the waters, and from which
mother and baby were plucked to safety by a South African
helicopter crew.
</P>
<P>
   Now that such rescue work is complete, the Mozambican government
is asking for $450 million to rebuild roads, homes and lives in
Xai-Xai and places like it.
</P>
<P>
   It held a joint summit with aid agencies in Rome on May 3 and 4
to extract pledges of outside help while memories remain fresh.
</P>
<P>
   It will be money well spent. Helped by the donations already
received, Mozambicans have been working hard to rebuild their
battered country.
</P>
<P>
   Take agriculture. The floods devastated a tenth of Mozambique's
land, and nine-tenths of its irrigated areas. Some 200,000 cattle
were washed away.
</P>
<P>
   Already, as the waters recede, Mozambican peasants have been
rushing back to plant beans and maize in the silt. Officials and
aid workers are handing out seeds and tools.
</P>
<P>
   If crops are sown before the southern winter arrives, a quick
harvest could be reaped in two months. Next year should be
bountiful: alluvial soil is rich in nitrates and phosphates.
</P>
<P>
   The government is even taking advantage of misrule in
neighboring Zimbabwe by inviting white farmers to bring in their
capital and skills.
</P>
<P>
   To guard against future floods, the government is trying to
resettle refugees on higher ground. In Xai-Xai, about 2,500
families, out of 40,000 displaced people, have so far been
allocated new plots to build homes and grow vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies offer free building materials to those who will
help clear up the dead conger eels, oil drums and concrete girders
that litter newly drained parts of the town.
</P>
<P>
   The work can be hazardous. Snakes lurk in damp heaps of maize
stalks, and land mines from the country's long civil war have been
exposed and scattered by the deluge: residents of one town found an
anti-tank mine lying in the main street.
</P>
<P>
   Despite official urging, however, most refugees want to return
to their old homes. About three-quarters of those who fled to
refugee camps have gone back to what is left of their dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   Many still turn up periodically at the camps to receive medical
care or to trade; but few want to live in tents any longer. Though
understandable, this makes it harder to get help to them.
</P>
<P>
   Those still stranded on islands are hungry and often sick. Drugs
and bandages are being dispensed at the camps, as well as soap,
buckets and lessons in sanitary hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools have reopened. Where classrooms have disappeared,
pupils sit beneath shady trees. After much heavy labor with trucks
and shovels, several severed roads have also been reconnected.
</P>
<P>
   It will take months to rebuild properly the tarmac route between
Maputo and Xai-Xai, but a bumpy dirt road reopened at the end of
April.
</P>
<P>
   Travel is not easy. The most popular vehicles are minivans that
failed their safety tests in Japan many years ago. They are
overladen with passengers and driven at axle-snapping speed. Many
break down, or sink into the mud, creating road blocks. But at
least people and goods are moving again.
</P>
<P>
   Food and fuel prices are coming down, as the markets where they
are sold migrate uphill.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation, there has been surprisingly little
unrest. Looters in boats stripped warehouses; and four people were
killed recently in a stampede for food in a refugee camp. But
otherwise calm has prevailed. This is not bad for a country torn by
civil war for most of the time since independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The government is far from flawless. Some aid supplies have been
stolen, and the ruling party cheekily flies its own flag, rather
than the national one, over refugee camps. But the abuses have been
few and minor.
</P>
<P>
   Aid to many of today's poor countries is usually ineffective
because the recipient has only a vague understanding of the sort of
prospering economy they are trying to create.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique, by contrast, was booming before the floods _ or at
least growing fast off a miserable base. A generous injection of
charitable liquidity could well restore it rapidly to health. &QL;

 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    I will miss John Cardinal O'Connor.
 &HT;    I haven't always felt that way, of course. Back during my 1984
campaign for vice president, in fact, there were plenty of times
when I wished fervently that he would simply go away.
 &HT;    But he didn't, and over the years I took the measure of a man
who, now that he has finally left us, leaves a void that will be
all but impossible to fill.
 &HT;    Then-Bishop O'Connor of New York burst into my consciousness
like a lion pouncing on its prey, and I don't mind admitting that I
was outraged by both the suddenness and the seriousness of his
attack.
 &HT;    As would be the case so often in years to come, the issue in
1984 was abortion. It was a battle of words, not substance, and it
was one that could never be resolved, because we had staked out our
positions and neither of us was going to be moved.
 &HT;    ``The Catholic Church's position opposing abortion is
monolithic,'' Bishop O'Connor asserted.
 &HT;    I agreed entirely, but felt that the Church didn't speak for all
Catholics on the issue. Many Catholics, including some lay Catholic
theologians, were pro-choice, I pointed out, myself among them.
 &HT;    ``The Catholic position regarding abortion is not monolithic,''
I summarized.
 &HT;    In the end, it was a disaster for all involved. We were talking
past each other, neither really trying to convince the other, and
the only winners were Ronald Reagan and George Bush, whose campaign
milked the argument between us for all it was worth, doing their
best to make it seem as if I were running against the bishop, not
Vice President Bush.
 &HT;    Needless to say, we didn't win the election.
 &HT;    It was several months before I had a chance to mend fences with
Bishop O'Connor. The occasion was his departure for Rome to be
invested as a cardinal, a prince of the Church.
 &HT;    I was genuinely happy for him, and wanted to congratulate him _
but I wasn't quite sure how to do it. Finally I decided to trust to
humor, and sent him a short note.
 &HT;    ``I want to add my congratulations to that of all your friends
on your elevation to cardinal,'' I wrote. ``I only wanted to be
vice president. You got to be a prince!''
 &HT;    I was a bit worried when I dropped that letter in the mail,
however. After all, I wasn't sure if O'Connor had a sense of humor
in the first place.
 &HT;    I was reassured when, several weeks later, I got a call from the
Archdiocese, inviting me to the Chancery for breakfast with the
cardinal. We talked for quite a while, but not about abortion _ we
both knew that was one of several issues on which we would never
agree.
 &HT;    But as we talked, it became clear that we agreed on so many
other things. I left the meeting that morning comfortable in the
knowledge that I had made a friend.
 &HT;    Over the next several years, on more than one occasion I found
my life in turmoil. Invariably, just when I needed it most, the
phone would ring and I would hear the cardinal's familiar voice
giving comfort, offering a prayer.
 &HT;    The fascinating thing about the man, I soon learned, was that
while he may have been a Prince of the Church in name, in spirit he
was very much a parish priest, always looking after his flock.
 &HT;    I guess that's what most defined him. He was a man of
contradictions, and most of them arose from conflicts between those
two roles.
 &HT;    He made headlines condemning abortion, but quietly provided
shelter for unwed mothers. He adamantly opposed gays marching in
the St. Patrick's Day Parade, but funded hospices for people with
AIDS.
 &HT;    He never pulled his punches in condemning what he believed to be
a sin, but he loved the ``sinners'' nonetheless, and quietly,
effectively, he made a difference in the lives of many of them.
 &HT;    His job required him to be a politician, and like many
politicians he engendered extreme emotional responses. Like no
Cardinal New York had known before, he seemed to splinter people
into opposing camps. People either loved him or hated him _ and
some of us did both at different times.
 &HT;    Maybe it was his military background that made him seem so rigid
on matters of faith, but maybe that also accounted for the ease he
felt with his brothers in arms in the political and business world.
 &HT;    But this soldier was also a television star, keenly aware of the
impact of television and deft in using it from the pulpit. His
sense of duty to Rome was traditional in the deepest sense, but he
was a man of the modern world when it came to using its media to
bring that message to his diocese and to the nation beyond.
 &HT;    His will be an extremely tough act to follow _ an activist
priest, a defender of dogma, a man of business acumen who was
politically knowledgeable and media-savvy, a prince of an ancient
church who left his mark on 20th-century New York and the United
States as a whole.
 &HT;    He came into my life as a lion and left it as a lamb. And I will
miss him.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Summer tomatoes in the spring? It
can be done
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A gaggle of good ol' boys had gathered for an
evening near Lake Sam Rayburn.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the main dish was smoked brisket. The main topic
of conversation was tomatoes. The main talker was Murphy George.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who has a hand in most everything that works for a good
purpose hereabouts, knows tomatoes, his main business being William
George Co., a food distribution operation that helps feed folks
halfway across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had provided the fresh tomatoes for that evening's
cookout. He didn't have to tell us what they'd taste like. They'd
taste like next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ol' Roy Blount Jr., the Southern writer, said it well, that
somewhere along the way tomatoes and fudgcicles got to tasting
about the same.
</P>
<P>
   These were hothouse tomatoes. They're not so hot.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows you can't get a good, vine-ripened Texas tomato
until the middle of summer. That's the way it is, always has been.
</P>
<P>
   But it may not be that way for much longer. Murphy was telling
us something about tomatoes none of the rest of us knew.
</P>
<P>
   He's planning on having good tomatoes as early as the end of
May. He planted early _ way early _ and in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   This is an experimental operation he has under way with a couple
of partners, trying to bring big-time produce production back to
this part of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It involves plastic sheeting to protect the young plants, drip
irrigation to keep them from drying up, the good red dirt of the
pineywoods, plenty of sun and, for good measure, Styrofoam cups and
old car tires.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Murphy was telling us, how he, personally, saved
this year's young crop of tomatoes from late freezes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I'm a gambler,'' Murphy likes to say. He was betting
that they could plant tomatoes earlier than ag experts say you
ought to. He had 4,000 tomato plants riding on his wager.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy likes to gamble. He doesn't like to lose.
</P>
<P>
   He got a call one day with the bad news. Freezing weather was
expected that night. The young tomato plants, just peeking up,
wouldn't survive. What could they do?
</P>
<P>
   Murphy told them to hold on, that he was coming.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't come alone. He brought 4,000 Styrofoam cups with him.
</P>
<P>
   He and his crew covered every tomato plant with a cup, each
topped with a clump of dirt to hold it in place against the north
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy grins when he tells you that they didn't lose one plant
that night. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later he got the same call. Another freeze was on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The plants were too big for cups. What could they do?
</P>
<P>
   Murphy told them to hold on. Here he comes again, this time
rounding up loads of old car tires.
</P>
<P>
   He and his crew lined the perimeter of the tomato beds with
tires, and then they waited. They waited until 2 a.m., just before
the thermometer was about to drop below freezing. That's when they
set fire to the tires.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature fell to 30 degrees overnight, but they didn't
lost a single plant.
</P>
<P>
   By the last week of April, they already had full green tomatoes
drooping on the vine. By the end of the month, they'll have
vine-ripened tomatoes on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a cash crop. What will folks pay for a good tomato
way early in the year? What won't they pay?
</P>
<P>
   Smart man, Murphy George. He knows tomatoes, and most anything
he puts his mind to. Maybe one of these days he'll give some
thought to fudgcicles.

ABC HAS A BIG PLAN FOR ITS DERBY FINALE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC survived its scare with Time Warner and plans to air the
Kentucky Derby for the 26th consecutive year, in time for the May
sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over transmission rights left an estimated 3.5
million cable viewers, including those in Houston, Los Angeles, and
New York, without ABC for 39 hours until Disney and Time Warner
agreed to a six-month truce. Regardless of the outcome, ABC
spokesman Mark Mandel said his network was planning to proceed
``full speed ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   This is marks the last time ABC will have the television rights
to the Kentucky Derby. NBC has acquired the rights to all Triple
Crown events and will show the Derby next year. ``We have just as
much passion and excitement as ever before,'' said ABC producer
Curt Gowdy Jr. ``It's been a wonderful ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Jim McKay and Al Michaels are ABC's co-anchors and Dave
Johnson will call the race. There will be a feature on the
favorite, Fusaichi Pegasus, a $4 million yearling trained by
Hall-of-Famer Neil Drysdale and ridden by Kent Desormeaux, who won
the Derby on Real Quiet in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also will employ ``On-Track,'' a three-dimensional virtual
animation graphic that details how the race will be run from start
to finish, and the network has placed 37 cameras around the track
and wireless microphones on jockeys.

   Turner Sports commentator Mike Fratello has heard nothing but
good reactions to the NBA playoff schedule. The former NBA coach
said the two- and three-day rest periods have helped teams with
banged-up players recover and enabled coaches to fine tune game
strategies. ``I have not received a single negative reaction from
any of the coaches or players,'' Fratello said. ``With the

criticism from columnists throughout the country.

   Fratello said the playoffs have proven disappointing for young
stars Kevin Garnett and Vince Carter. ``It's a learning
experience,'' said Fratello. ``When Michael Jordan was in his first
playoff games, he didn't win either. He didn't have enough weapons
to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Fratello has been the subject of several rumors that he would
soon leave the broadcast booth for another head coaching job. ``I
don't know,'' Fratello said. ``We have to wait and see if anyone
wants me.''

   Ozzie Smith, CNN/SI's baseball analyst, said that he agreed with
Pedro Martinez when the Red Sox pitcher told reporters he was only

``Pitchers are going to have to regain their dominance of the
plate,'' Smith said. ``Right now batters own the plate _ the
inside, outside, everywhere. And it shows, because baseballs are
flying out of the park at record speeds this year. If I'm a pitcher
standing on that mound, I don't want that batter digging in and
owning the plate. You've got to throw inside and shave the inside
plate. If not, the batters will continue their slugfest.''

A FIRST IN WINNER'S CIRCLE? 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ No horse trained by a woman has ever won the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Jenine Sahadi knows this, just as she knows the times. Gender
politics is an issue, ``and I knew that it was going to be a big
issue even before I stepped off the plane in Louisville. It was an
issue when I was up at Woodbine (racetrack in Toronto) and when I
was at Belmont (Park in New York) for the Breeders' Cups there.
I've always said, until I win these races, it's always going to be
an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   She won those Breeders' Cup races. Twice. The first woman to win
a Breeders' Cup race on the dirt. (A French woman, Cricket Head,
has trained a Breeders' Cup grass champion.) So Sahadi's expertise
is beyond dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But Sahadi, a 37-year-old woman who knew as a little girl she
always wanted to be around horses, also says ``I'm no Gloria
Steinem'' and ``I'm not going to burn my bra if I win the Derby.''
Seemingly, a more personal passion burns within her.
</P>
<P>
   Namely: no horse trained by Jenine Sahadi has ever won the
Kentucky Derby. And Saturday her colt, The Deputy, most likely will
be the second choice to win the 126th Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have not had the opportunity to play (in racing's major
races),'' said Sahadi, matter-of-factly. ``If you want to play
you've got to have the stock. Luckily, for me, I've had the stock
and I've been in situations where I've been the first (woman to
win). But wherever I go, I see it's still going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1875, 712 trainers have entered horses in the Kentucky
Derby. Only nine have been women. The closest a woman came to
winning was in 1992, when Shelley Riley's Casual Lies finished
second. Horse racing is a male-dominated business, especially at
the top.
</P>
<P>
   If scores and scores of exercise riders, those near the bottom,
are women, very, very few women are either jockeys or trainers at
the top levels of racing. Horse racing keeps no gender statistics
on its trainers, but 5 percent might seem a plausible estimate of
women trainers at the top tracks, even if women trainers might
number as many as 10 or 20 percent at smaller tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know women who work very, very hard and do a fantastic job
and just are never given a chance,'' said Sahadi. ``A trainer is
only as good as his or her stock. Some women I know are training
low-level claiming horses, and maiden claimers, and that sort of
thing. It's really difficult to make a living at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue is that until recently it has been men
who have had the millions and millions of dollars to play with, to
throw at horses, to buy a baby horse for $400,000 or $4 million.
These men with money are likely to choose men as trainers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not until women become independently wealthy, said Sahadi,
and want to enter the racing game that women trainers will be
trusted with the care of the best racehorses. Society is changing
in that regard, as more and more women become wealthy, but horse
racing still entices many more men than women at all levels, from
fans to gamblers to trainers and jockeys; the road to hoe is very
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a break-even situation (for trainers who train
average horses) and you never do really well until you compete in
the big races and participate in the big pots,'' said Sahadi. ``But
you know, there are not even a lot of female assistant trainers. I
know Todd Fletcher (who has four horses entered in the Derby) has
his gal and April Mayberry (an assistant to Sahadi-nemesis Bob
Baffert) is an assistant, but there aren't that many.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi said one of her best friends is Summer Mayberry, April's
sister, ``and here's a gal who absolutely loves horses and her last
name is Mayberry so I don't know how much more I need to say about
how she was involved in the barn (of Brian Mayberry, a California
trainer and father of April and Summer). Here's a girl who gets on
all her horses every day and she . . . she . . . she just
struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   But the personal and the political are so difficult to separate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the personal and the political clashed and crashed
and exploded for Sahadi. During a press conference prior to the
Santa Anita Derby, Sahadi stormed off the dais when the
wise-cracking Baffert asked jockey Chris McCarron, who'll ride The
Deputy for Sahadi in the Kentucky Derby, ``Are you training the
horse or is Jenine?''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert later would say he was only joking. Sahadi later would
say this was the latest in a long list of slights and barbs she has
heard ever since she left the Hollywood Park publicity office 10
years ago and began training horses.
</P>
<P>
   Typical: Sahadi's boyfriend at the time she began training was
Julio Canani, a California trainer, and she'd hear barbs that asked
whether it was she or Canani who was training the horses. More
recently, Sahadi married Ben Cecil, another California trainer, and
again the whispers whether it was she or her husband doing the work
that has paid off so well.
</P>
<P>
   (Gender politics can slide into sexual politics; the first
``Who's training the horses?'' whispers reportedly came from
Canani's ex-wife, and Baffert is best friends with Canani, the man
Sahadi did not marry. Baffert, for his part, said his
``relationship with Sahadi is the same as ever; we're still not
speaking.'' Baffert's barbs, of course, have hit men as well and
women; Baffert and top trainer D. Wayne Lukas are bitter enemies
and seldom speak.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I'd read something about myself, it was like a
historical registry of who I dated and who I slept with,'' she said
with a laugh. ``You do that with Lukas and his four wives, and I
told him that the other day, and you'd never write about a horse of
his. He's been married four times and I love the guy to death, but
you'd never hear about his horses if you did that with him. You'd
run out of column space.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for Sahadi than the barbs was what happened to her
after she won her two Breeders' Cup races, the pinnacle of success.
``I thought my phone'd be ringing off the hook (with new
business),'' she said, ``but instead the opposite happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Her main owners, Evergreen Farms, dropped out of the business
and Sahadi was left to scramble. Things went so poorly a year ago
that she thought of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I interviewed with TVG (the new horse racing cable network)
and I talked to Amy Zimmerman at the Santa Anita publicity office
about doing some stuff there,'' said Sahadi. ``I'd gone the whole
year without winning a graded stakes (race) . . . whatever we try
to forget, you guys always remember to bring up.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. Sahadi had majored in communications at the
University of Southern California, and started out in publicity,
handing out media credentials and typing up press releases at
Hollywood Park. With Marje Everett running Hollywood Park, Sahadi
seemed to have a future there. But Hollywood Park was sold, Sahadi
saw little future with the new owners and decided to follow her
first love, first engendered by her father _ horses.
</P>
<P>
   But when life on the track looked bleakest, Barry Irwin and the
Team Valor thoroughbred consotium gave Sahadi ``some stock'' as she
puts it; namely, some good horses to train. And the best may be The
Deputy, an obscurely-bred horse from Ireland that Team Valor bought
for $400,000 six months ago and sent to Sahadi. The horse's future
seemed to be with grass racing, but Sahadi switched him to the dirt
and The Deputy has been spectacular since.

 LOUISVILLE, Ky.: ... spectacular since.

<P>
   ``I had known Barry since my press box days and we had claimed a
filly together, Barry and I, and I've actually had a great
relationship with him,'' said Sahadi. ``He has great knowledge of
horses and has a great eye for them. I'm a person who's brutally
honest with my clients and I want to be able to call them and say,
`Hey, this is the deal with this horse,' and good, bad or
indifferent I want to be able to cut to the chase. And Barry
appreciates that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Irwin (``Jenine is an oustanding trainer'') may appreciate
that bluntness, many other horse owners do not. Owners may spend
millions on horses for millions of reasons but, for many, one of
the primary reasons is to seen at the race track at the big race
and (hopefully) to be seen in the winner's circle. Many owners do
not like to hear from their trainers that their horse is not ready
for the big race. Yet, Sahadi has retained her bluntness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, also another side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clothes and jewelry,'' said Sahadi of her loves for diamonds
and garb, not mentioning a third, her ever-present sunglasses.
``When my husband went to get my ring, I told him, 'I'm a big girl
. . . I'm 5-10 . . . so get me a big ring.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was inside the dimly-lit Kentucky Derby Museum Wednesday
evening, just after the post-position draw for the Kentucky Derby.
Jenine Sahadi, making the rarest of public appearances without her
sunglasses, was pronouncing herself pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't want to be inside,'' said Sahadi,
ever-cooperative as always with the media; her job once was to
serve the media's needs and the old training persists. ``I always
wanted to be further out (in the starting gate) than further in.
I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Was she surprised that fellow-California trainer Neil Drysdale
chose to place his tempermental Fusaichi Pegasus, the Derby
favorite and petulance horsified, out in stall 16 when he could
have been more inside, such as Post 11, where Sahadi had been able
to place her colt, The Deputy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhhhhhhhh . . . '' replied Sahadi, thinking out loud, ``Not
really. You know, with his horse's running style, the idea was to
get a very clean trip. And then he wouldn't be in the gate that
much from out there. And, you know, (Drysdale's) concerns with his
horse are a lot different from mine. Having said that, my horse may
lose it on Saturday, too. I mean, I don't think he will, but you
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   You never do. Not on the first Saturday in May at Churchill
Downs. Never.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kentucky Derby,'' John Steinbeck wrote back in 1956,
``whatever it is _ a race, an emotion, an explosion _ is one of the
most beautiful and violent and satisfying things I have ever
experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Saturday afternoon experience. Ah, but this was
Wednesday evening, Jenine Sahadi had been alone, away from her
California home for three weeks, away from her husband, away from
her 14 other horses, bored silly here in faraway Kentucky with
pressure building and building and building, her months of
preparation now only hours away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fellas,'' Sahadi said, ``will you please apologize (to Derby
officials) for me?'' She was tired, could not do more interviews
with the other Derby trainers in a formal press conference, just
had to leave. ``I've got a big day tomorrow . . . I've tried to be
as helpful as possible. I'm exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Her horse is absolutely ready. Her twin battles are near their
final moments. One battle for her gender, the woman who has endured
slight after slight despite her successes. The other for herself,
for the Jenine Sahadi who fell in love with horses as a little girl
as she hung around with Charlie Whittingham, the legendary
California trainer who cared so deeply about each of his horses;
for the Jenine Sahadi who came close to quitting a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, it would be a step forward for a woman trainer to win
the Derby. But that would be political. So much more personal,
though, it would be if Jenine Sahadi is that first woman trainer to
step into a Derby winner's circle. No whispers could be heard amid
the tumult.

DOGGED `DEPUTY' EXCITES MCCARRON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Chris McCarron has ridden in the Kentucky
Derby 16 times and won twice, with Alysheba in 1987 and Go For Gin
in 1994. The 45-year-old Dorchester native was elected to the Hall
of Fame in 1989 and remains one of the best money riders in the
game. McCarron has a legitimate chance to complete a personal Derby
trifecta Saturday aboard The Deputy, the second choice in the
morning line for the Rose Run at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron flew in from California last Monday night, worked The
Deputy (five furlongs in a minute) Tuesday morning, and stayed in
the Louisville area to socialize and ride some mounts to get a feel
for Churchill Downs strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Deputy gets over the ground here beautifully,'' said
McCarron. ``He's very competitive. He's definitely talented, and
he's very generous with that talent. He's a very professional
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, owned by the Team Valor Stable and Gary Barber, who
heads a film production company, began his career in Europe in
modest fashion. The son of Petardia, who was bred in Great Britain
out of Manfaith, who was bred in Ireland, The Deputy ran five times
on grass as a 2-year-old in England, winning only once. He did not
race past seven furlongs. Purchased by Barry Irwin, president of
Team Valor, and turned over to trainer Jenine Sahadi, The Deputy
won his first race in America in his 3-year-old debut, taking the
Hill Rise Stakes on the Santa Anita turf Jan. 2. Sahadi then
switched him to dirt because he trained well on it, and The Deputy
won the Santa Catalina, finished second in the San Felipe to Derby
favorite Fusaichi Pegasus, and proved he could cover the distance
when he captured the $1 million Santa Anita Derby at a mile and
one-eighth April 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's by a sprinter, out of a sprinter,'' said McCarron, who
has ridden The Deputy in every US race. ``But I think he'll hold
his own at a mile and one-quarter (for the Derby). He's already
proven he can run up to a mile and one-eighth. His style is very
adaptable. In Europe, he came from way back. Here, he closed in his
first race. In the next race, he went to the lead. It just depends
on the way he gets away from the starting gate. He's got natural
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus is regarded as the second coming of Secretariat
by some, but he beat The Deputy by only three-quarters of a length
in the San Felipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him a little scare, but The Deputy hung in the
stretch'' said McCarron. ``He was very game, he was just in need of
a race. He had't run in seven weeks (from the Jan. 30 Santa
Catalina to the March 19 San Felipe). Also, we gave Fusaichi
Pegasus six pounds (122-116). The Deputy has every right to move
forward the next time he meets Fusaichi Pegasus. The Deputy is just
a good competitor. He's going to be tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi will become just the 10th woman to saddle a Derby starter
in 126 races. The Run for the Roses has never been won by a female
trainer or jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jenine is one of the most conscientious horsemen I've ever
dealt with,'' said McCarron. ``She cares about her horses, she
treats them like you'd treat kids. She puts in lots and lots of
hours at the barn. A rider can't ask for more than that from a
trainer. She cares, and puts in the time and effort. I know when I
get on one of her horses, I'm going to get on one that's ready, and
likely to do well. That's a good feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can do something special (helping Sahadi become
the first woman to win the race), it's good. And this is the Derby,
so it's automatically special.''

THE REVERSAL OF RUSSIA'S BRAIN DRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Pilot Software had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass., company's customers urgently needed
support and maintenance work on their copies of a popular software
package Pilot no longer produces. But Pilot's engineers were too
busy developing new software to spend time on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot found the solution in an unexpected place _ the run-down
laboratories that make up the campus of Moscow State University.
Even more unlikely, perhaps, is that it got the help it needed from
a New Hampshire-based software company that has set up a subsidiary
on the Moscow campus, where it is doing its small part to help stem
the Russian brain drain.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawled out in the shadow of the Stalinesque skyscraper that
once served as a towering monument to Russia's proud scientific
legacy, this campus has come to symbolize everything about the
post-Soviet era _ declining prestige, outdated equipment, and
plummeting living standards _ that has made Moscow's best and
brightest leave in droves for better opportunities abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But lodged in one of the buildings is the Moscow subsidiary of
Auriga, an Amherst, N.H.-based company that is bucking that trend.
</P>
<P>
   The company is attracting some of Russia's most talented
software designers to work in Moscow. Its 65 Russian programmers
sell their expertise in software and applications design and
development to US software companies via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Known as offshore programmers, these specialists are disproving
a popular myth about Russian computer experts _ that anyone worth
his pirated copy of Windows 98 would bolt from Russia the minute he
got a job offer abroad.
</P>
<P>
   From Moscow to Siberia, Russian programmers are taking on jobs
without leaving home and making their American clients happy. The
Russian programmers work just as well as their American
counterparts, but the jobs cost up to 40 percent less because the
Russians work for less, said Scott Livermore, engineering manager
at Pilot Software.
</P>
<P>
   Livermore turned to Auriga after offshore programmers in India
did not work out. He was very pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the future,'' Livermore said of working
with Russian programmers. ``There is a lot of work that needs to be
done, especially when you're working in an area that is as tight on
labor as Boston's high-tech labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   Auriga's lead programmer on the Pilot job, Muscovite Alexander
Belyakov, 47, said he enjoyed working for a firm in Boston area.
But he would never want to live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too old to move around,'' he said. ``I like it where I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the refrain sounded by a number of engineers ensconced
amid the state-of-the-art machinery in Auriga's basement lab. All
of them have experience working with US companies; many are fluent
in English; some have been offered jobs with companies in
California's Silicon Valley where they could earn up to $100,000 a
year _ more than three times the highest salaries at Auriga. But
now that they have good jobs here, no one wants to leave Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, I liked San Francisco. It was the most
beautiful city in the world,'' said Anton Kuzmin, who ran a virtual
laboratory at Lynx Software in San Jose, Calif. ``But I can do well
here, and my wife and family feel better here.''
</P>
<P>
   All this does not mean Auriga has ignored the market for Russian
programmers in the United States, where demand for highly skilled
programmers far outstrips supply. Auriga's Web site contains an
advertisement offering qualified applicants ``a quality of life far
above the average in the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Sukharev, a former professor of computer science at
Moscow State University who left Russia to found Auriga in the
early 1990s, said his company has 30 Russian programmers working in
its Amherst officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not everyone wants to live abroad,'' Sukharev said.
``Offshore programming allows them to do frontline work with top
companies. They are all well-fed, the all have cars, they are happy
in their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In bustling Moscow and St. Petersburg, offshore programmers are
just one small slice of the action. In Siberia, the stakes are
higher: Officials hope they are the vanguard of a whole new economy
_ the makings of a Silicon Steppe.
</P>
<P>
   CommonInterests.com, a Web site that aims to connect people
across the Boston area, took shape on a computer in a ramshackle
Soviet-style apartment block in Tomsk, a western Siberian city.
</P>
<P>
   The site was designed in part by Pavel Khristolyubov, 23, a
Russian programmer who works in hometown of Tomsk, working for
Double Decker Studios, a South Boston company whose clients include
Bell Atlantic and Boston.com.
</P>
<P>
   While on an internship program in Boston in 1998, Khristolyubov
met Dmitry Gurevich, who emigrated from St. Petersburg in 1990 and
later founded Double Decker.
</P>
<P>
   Now Khristolyubov spends about half his time programming for
Double Decker and half managing other Tomsk programmers who do the
same. He makes less than the $45,000 a year he thinks he would
fetch on the US market, but far more than the $160 a month that
would be considered an excellent salary for a programmer working
solely for Tomsk-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't name the exact sum but says it allows him to live
better than he would in America on an American salary. He can make
mortgage payments, save for a car, support his wife, Lena, 21, in
taking classes, vacation in the Caucasus Mountains, and even take
his mother-in-law out for sturgeon shish kebab. Those are rare
amenities in Russia, where most couples the Khristolyubovs' age
live with relatives and have little spare cash.
</P>
<P>
   Khristolyubov is one of hundreds of offshore programmers in
Tomsk, say local officials. Yevgeny Gayevoi, head of foreign
relations for the regional government, envisions them being
followed by translators, physicists, chemists, construction
engineers, anyone who can export brain work via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're betting on the Internet for our future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. Tomsk is isolated even by Siberian
standards. The three-day train ride from Moscow, crossing four time
zones, is lengthened by historical bad luck: In the 19th century,
the city was bypassed by the Trans-Siberian railroad, and in Soviet
times, it was declared closed to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   But Tomsk also has six universities and 60,000 students among
its population of 500,000. The computer science departments draw
students from across Siberia, the Far East, and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brains are the raw material for our industry,'' said Igor
Itkin, whose firm, Stack Ltd., made the Russian version of Novell
GroupWise and trains Microsoft-certified systems engineers in
Russia. He was also named director of a bankrupt state factory that
now, with Stack's help, is making computers that work in arctic
conditions for oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Seryodkin, 39, says his firm, Exoft, was chosen by his
American partners, Montana-based Commodity Software, over groups
from Moscow and St. Petersburg to help design software for the US
commodities market.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guys are so brilliant that the Americans got very
excited,'' said Seryodkin. One day last month, in their office that
looks out at an Orthodox Church, Seryodkin's ``guys'' were working
away to Led Zeppelin and chatting online with an American partner,
who was logged on at an Ohio laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   All of them said it wasn't just the money that attracted them _
it was the chance to work in the field they loved without leaving
home. Though they all want to travel and work temporarily in the
West, they don't see themselves emigrating.
</P>
<P>
   Khristolyubov agreed. He enjoys showing off his city _ from the
snowy birch woods overlooking the frozen Tom River to the latest
hot night club, Millennium, which features Siberian Crown beer,
pool tables, dancers dressed like robot aliens, and, if you stay
late enough, an amateur striptease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the provinces,'' Khristolyubov said. ``I want to be
mobile and cosmopolitan, but I want to stick to Russian culture. I
don't feel comfortable living in the US. I'm at home here, and I
know my worth.''

CEOS GOT MORE, EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T EARN IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We develop a case of CEO envy this time every year.
</P>
<P>
   By now, most of the state's largest public companies have filed
their annual proxies detailing how much chief executives were paid
in 1999. That means salary, bonus and selected perks, but more
importantly it includes restricted stock awards and options.
</P>
<P>
   The results of our informal survey: more, more, more, and not
necessarily in proportion with the joy or pain distributed to
stockholders last year.
</P>
<P>
   That is consistent with national surveys, in direction if not
details. There's enough methodology in a real compensation study to
spin a wonk's head.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of chief executives at the 350 largest US companies by
consultants William M. Mercer Inc. found that short- and long-term
direct compensation rose 24.5 percent to an average $4.9 million
last year. Another national survey in the current issue of Forbes,
measuring compensation at 800 companies, concluded CEO pay was up a
more modest 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, almost every Massachusetts CEO was better off in
1999, at least when it came to the compensation basics. Divining
the real value of stock and option kickers and comparing them is a
much tougher call. (We declined to look at past restricted stock or
option awards granted in past years that took effect in 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston Financial Corp. chief Terry Murray was the state's
king of cash compensation by our list of public big-company execs.
His combined salary and bonus rose a relatively tame 11 percent to
$5 million, surely a balance sufficient for no-fee banking.
</P>
<P>
   There's more: Murray was awarded restricted stock worth another
$14.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FleetBoston's stock was slumping 19.9 percent, though
that can be a misleading statistic. All financial stocks were
clobbered last year and Murray did manage to pull off the
BankBoston megamerger in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Only one chief executive in our crowd received less cash
compensation in 1999. Before you cry for Raytheon Co. chief Daniel
Burnham, whose bonus got cut 40 percent to $900,000 last year,
recall that shareholders took a 51 percent haircut on their
investment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also was awarded 300,000 stock options, which have a
potential value of roughly $6.5 million over time. In the corporate
world, that's called alignment of interests of management with
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Buck, a consultant with Mercer in Boston, points out that
long-term incentives, which were 49 percent of a CEO's pay package
in 1995, now amount to 63 percent of their compensation. ``That
highlights a significant trend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly signifies something. The option trend is generating
long-term compensation that has the potential of becoming worth
five to 10 times a CEO's cash compensation in the year of the
award.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette chief executive Michael Hawley earned $1.5 million in
cash last year, while the company's stock was slipping 12 percent.
But Hawley was also awarded 750,000 options that could eventually
be worth nearly $11 million, using a common option pricing model
that Gillette included in its proxy.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing generated options like James Tobin's career moves of
1999. Tobin, who had been chief execuitve of Biogen Inc. of
Cambridge, quit and resurfaced as the new CEO of Boston Scientific
Inc. in Natick.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin won the mother of all golden handshakes when he walked in
the door at Boston Scientific, a million stock options that could
be worth $54.2 million if you assume 10 percent compounded stock
value increases over the 10-year life of the option agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Biogen, chairman James Vincent stepped into the void
left by Tobin's exit and served as a temporary chief executive in
1999. The payoff: a $1.5 million cash bonus and 740,000 options
with a potential value of $63.3 million using the same 10 percent,
10-year calcualtion.
</P>
<P>
   With all this cash and stock flying in the executive offices of
Greater Boston, is there a shareholder-friendly compensation story
out there? We found at least one.
</P>
<P>
   Our Bang For the Buck CEO award of 1999 goes to George
Chamillard of Teradyne.
</P>
<P>
   Chamillard was paid about $1.3 million in cash last year and
received 105,000 Teradyne options potentially worth about $2.1
million in the future.
</P>
<P>
   We liked his option deal for two reasons: it didn't seem
excessive by the standards of other CEOs and his share of all
company options granted last year appeared fairer than most.
</P>
<P>
   Chamillard was awarded 1.86 percent of all Teradyne options last
year and four other company executives each received at least half
as many as his. Most CEOs in our group got 5 percent or more of the
option pie and several examples were much worse (Vincent took
nearly 25 percent of the 1999 Biogen options).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, earnigns per share at Teradyne increased 55 percent
last year. The stock, which more than tripled in 1999, is up
another 52 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Teradyne is enjoying a rising tide benefitting all
semiconductor companiens. But shareholders have seen their
investment rise 515 percent since Chamillard became Teradyne's
chief executive three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's getting value for your money.

BARBARA E. LUEDTKE, 51; AUTHORITY ON NATIVE SETTLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara E. Luedtke, an authority on Native American settlements
who was a professor of anthropology at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston, died of cancer Tuesday in Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center. She was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luedtke was born in Milwaukee and raised in the San Diego
area. Her interest in archeology began as a junior high school
student, when she took a ferry from her family's home on Coronado
Island each weekend to participate in local digs. A semester in
Australia as an undergraduate at Pomona College sparked her
interest in aboriginal populations.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Pomona, she earned a doctorate at the
University of Michigan, where her research focused on the stone
working technology and prehistoric communities in the Eastern
woodlands. Her later research focused on Native American
settlements in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in the Globe on Nov. 7, 1986, she said,
``We have great descriptions from the Pilgrims of what the Indian
villages were like, but we can't find them archeologically.''
</P>
<P>
   She said sites dating from early periods are very common, but
those dating from just before the Europeans arrived are very rare.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luedtke conducted an archeological survey of Boston Harbor,
ferrying groups of students each summer to excavations at Thompson,
Long, and Calf islands.
</P>
<P>
   She lectured widely on her findings and often opened her digs to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 she conducted a week-long open dig at the Wampanoag
Indian homesite at Plimoth Plantation. While the dig was in
progress, she and her students interpreted their findings to
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   She was associate director of the Center for Materials Research
in Archaeology and Ethnology at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where she taught lithic analysis to graduate students.
She was also a member of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society
and editor of its bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her parents, Charles and Margaret Luedtke, and a
brother, Tom, all of Coronado Island, Calif.

   CYBERSEX _ There's nothing sexy about a computer, unless people

   HOT-CHEF _ COMMERCE, Ga. _ Sue and Jeg Coughlin of Columbus,
Ohio have six race cars on the National Hot Rod racing circuit.
With crew, friends and an expanding family traveling the circuit,
the Coughlins soon grew tired of the tacky track food. So they
hired a chef. Not just any chef, but Ian Rough, a brand new
graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, the most prestigious
cooking school in America. Rough customized a trailer to meet his

 &HT;    What you think often depends on just which house you live in
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ The guy on the other end of the line said:
``I'm so-and-so at the white house,'' and, right away, I figured
there was trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. I was just sure that my dogs had found freedom again and
been practicing their evil ways on the lawn of the white house down
the street. It wouldn't have been the first time and the squatty
one likes to dig for oil.
</P>
<P>
   I was worried about what the damage might be when the guy starts
talking about China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on, buddy, I know that dog can dig deep, but don't you
think you're exaggerating just a bit?''
</P>
<P>
   Then I figured it all out. This guy wasn't from the white house
down the street but The White House. That's the problem with
telephones, you don't see capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I wanted to ask him exactly where he was in The White
House: The Oval Office? The Lincoln Bedroom? The Rose Garden? My
guess is this guy was probably closer to The Utility Room, which is
one of those that isn't on the tour. But, hey, every room in The
White House is important, isn't it? Even if he was just calling
from a hallway, I suppose I should have been impressed.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to talk to me about some matter which he insisted
was important, but I wasn't really listening. No, I wanted to know
if there was any funny business going on. You know what I mean, any
Chief Executive telling an intern to sit on his knee so he could
take a deposition?
</P>
<P>
   But apparently this guy wasn't close enough to the action which,
I suppose, is really a good thing for him. Seeing no evil may be
difficult at The White House (as opposed to the white house down
the street), but it sure keeps you out of testifying before a
congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I decided that he wasn't going to shut up until I
listened to him (I'll happily hang up on most telemarketers, but
not one from The White House. I have a patriotic streak.).
</P>
<P>
   It became clear that he was, indeed, talking about China, home
of billions of future customers for the United States and most
likely home of future campaign contributions for presidential
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that someone very important in the administration
had written a column about just how important it was for the United
States to Permanant Normal Trade Relations and it was absolutely
vital to the survival of the Republic that this be printed in the
Marshall News Messenger. I guess my patriotism isn't all it should
be because it isn't going to run.
</P>
<P>
   Then White House guy said a piercing bit of truth, though he
didn't catch it (otherwise, he probably wouldn't have said it). He
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about Marshall, Texas, but this subject is what
everyone is talking about. It is the most important topic right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The bit of truth he told was, ``I don't know about Marshall,
Texas....''
</P>
<P>
   Because not only do most people in Washington not know about
Marshall, Texas, they don't know much about anywhere outside the
District of Columbia. Things there aren't like anywhere else on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him that China wasn't the first thing on our
minds here in Marshall, that we were more consumed with cleaning up
after a tornado, and protests over the police chief, and, for that
matter, how the youth baseball leagues were going or how tomato
plants were growing.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that trade status for China isn't important, but I
can't help but wonder what America would be like if most
politicians in Washington really did think the people in the white
house instead of the people in The White House.

 &HT;    Baby Sophie arrives with ready-made honors
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Jena Roytman still doesn't know what came over
her, that day in the hospital last summer when she told her
grandmother she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   She had taken the home pregnancy test only the night before, and
wasn't scheduled to see her obstetrician until the following week.
``Normally, I wouldn't tell anyone that early,'' Roytman said.
</P>
<P>
   But when she walked into Sophia Litvak's room at Good Samaritan
Hospital, Roytman did the last thing she had expected to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you're just glowing today,'' her grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pregnant, grandma,'' Roytman blurted.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sophia Litvak asked something she had never before asked of
her granddaughter _ a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the baby is a girl, would you name her after me?''
</P>
<P>
   As Russian Jews, it was not traditional for the family to name a
baby after a living person. ``Oh, Grandma, don't talk like that,''
Roytman protested. ``You're going to live another 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Litvak was, in fact, recovering nicely from a bout with
pneumonia, and scheduled to be released over the weekend. But she
extracted her promise anyway: ``Just in case I don't live another
100 years, will you name the baby after me?''
</P>
<P>
   Roytman promised.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, July 24, Sophia Litvak died of a heart attack. She
was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Roytman learned the baby was a girl _ a
little sister for son Eric, 3 _ due on her grandmother's birthday,
March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Roytman was devastated by the loss of a woman who was ``the
backbone of the family.'' Her grandmother, who worked as a
pediatrician in Russia for more than 30 years, had retired to take
care of her first granddaughter, a sickly child. Litvak became an
``extra mom'' for the only child, who already had an exceptionally
close relationship with her parents, Bella and Vladimir
Futoryansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was there for me when I came home from school,'' Roytman
recalled. ``She was there to share school stuff, grades. She was
there when I was upset or happy. She knew what my life was about
and what I dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   At 18, Jena married high school sweetheart Mikhail Roytman.
Shortly afterward, her new husband and his family attained
political refugee status and emigrated to the United States, where
they were sponsored by the Dayton Jewish Community Center. A year
later, in 1991, Jena emigrated with her parents and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Life was good in Dayton. The Roytmans established their own
computer consulting and recruiting business, Roytman Information
Services. And Sophia Litvak achieved a lifelong goal: Living in her
own home.
</P>
<P>
   Litvak continued to be an inspiration, as she studied, at 83, to
become an American citizen along with the rest of her family. ``She
had never known English before coming here, yet she took the exam,
passed it _ and did it in English.''
</P>
<P>
   After her grandmother's death, there was no question, for Jena,
that she would honor the only request her grandmother had ever made
of her. Mikhail initially had misgivings, as the couple had always
dreamed of having a little boy named Eric and a little girl named
Emily.
</P>
<P>
   For their 10th anniversary in November, Mikhail presented Jena
with an enormous Pier 1 gift bag with boxes stacked inside boxes
like Russian nesting dolls. Inside the smallest box she found an
envelope containing a slip of paper with a single word: ``Sophie.''
</P>
<P>
   Roytman doesn't think he could have given their daughter, born
March 18, a better gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be half the person my grandmother was, to have
the common sense that she had, to have the ability to hold the
whole family together,'' Roytman said. ``And that is what I wish
for Sophie.''
</P>
<P>
   She understands, too, why her grandmother wanted a namesake.
``She didn't do it in a selfish sense. It was because she didn't
want me to be sad for her being gone. She wanted still to be part
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Jena holds baby Sophie, she has no doubt that Sophia
Litvak is still a part of all of them.

 &HT;    Singing to the congregation
 &HT;    By Khalid Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Before gospel and Christian music became the
burgeoning industries that they are, standard procedure in most
churches was that ministers preached and choirs sang.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   As the line between singing gospels and preaching the gospel
becomes less defined, a new breed of musical ministers _ Kirk
Franklin, Shirley Murdoch, Michael W. Smith and Andre Crouch to
name a few _ intermingle their spoken messages with elaborate
musical praises.
</P>
<P>
   Pop crooner-turned-minister and ex-Daytonian Derek Floyd is a
disciple of this trend.
</P>
<P>
   While living in the Gem City, Floyd fronted his own group, Derek
and Cyndy, and was lead singer for the popular R&AMP;B band Cliche. His
national work includes sessions with vocalist Bobby Womack and
Philadelphia International's Gamble and Huff. After the death of
his first wife, television personality Audrey Moore, Floyd
abandoned secular music, moved to North Carolina and channeled his
energies into the church. In 1982 he was invited to join the
Inspirational Network as featured vocalist. Since then, Floyd has
been nominated for two Dove Awards and his song, ``Hero For
Today,'' was heard on Bob Hope's 1991 NBC special ``A Salute to
America.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Floyd graduated from East Coast Bible College and soon
after, launched his musical ministry.

 &HT;    Novice woodworker's shoes on well-trodden path
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here, from the Internet, is probably the most common
dilemma that any untrained, novice woodworker faces:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a planer, jointer, or even any planes yet, so
now's the time to start fresh. I'm also on a low budget. I've been
building small projects such as stepstool, two-shelf bookracks,
etc. and they never quite come out right. My table saw is aligned
just right and ... people tell me it's probably because the boards
I'm working with aren't perfectly true. (flat on all sides) I've
done all my projects with S4S red oak and they've come out pretty
well, considering. But they always have annoying little gaps and
never stand on all four legs until I sand them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think the time has come to buy some flattening equipment.
One other complication: If the choice is hand planes (good for the
budget) how do I fasten the wood down? I have a Workmate and an
aluminum workbench with no provisions for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planer and jointer wouldn't be a bad idea, but it would
take a while to afford them. As I see it, here are my options:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1. ``Buy a portable planer (that's what I have room for) on my
Mastercard and a jointer plane.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  2. ``Buy a few planes (jointer, jack, and block) and try to
rig something up to hold the board steady.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3. ``Try to find room and build a real workbench with dogs and
use planes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4. ``Don't build anything else really precise until I can
afford a planer and jointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there any options I'm missing? Anyone else been in my
shoes? What would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people have been in your shoes, my friend. You have
narrowed your options wisely, except for No. 4, which is not good
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option isn't going to work out well either, because a
planer only removes wood and cannot be depended on to flatten a
bowed board, and you still have to have a means of holding the wood
for the jointer plane.
</P>
<P>
   What you want to do is combine options 3 and 4. Build yourself a
good workbench. It doesn't have to be fancy, and it doesn't have to
use expensive wood. It only has to have a very flat top and be very
heavy and rock-steady. As for dogs, it doesn't have to have those
either, although they're useful and if you're going to build a
bench you might as well put in a couple of holes for dogs. Make
your dogs of wood, though. Don't buy those metal ones. Then buy
good planes and learn to tune them and use them properly.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, keep your projects small. It's a lot easier
to flatten a two-foot board than a four-foot one.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you limited yourself to things like jewelry boxes,
and picked your stock carefully, you probably wouldn't have to
exert yourself too much at all. And you'll save a lot of money if
you can stay away from the S4S stock.
</P>
<P>
   These are compromises, certainly, but they'll keep you working,
and learning, while you save money for the big investments.
Investment in a workbench and hand planes will never be wasted,
either. You'll always need them.

   CYBERSEX _ There's nothing sexy about a computer, unless people

With crew, friends and an expanding family traveling the circuit,
the Coughlins soon grew tired of the tacky track food. So they
hired a chef. Not just any chef, but Ian Rough, a brand new
graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, the most prestigious
cooking school in America. Rough customized a trailer to meet his
gourmet cooking needs and now he's on the road with the Coughlin

   TV-SEASON _ There have been better TV seasons than the one about

the credit goes to ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' It was as if
once a gameshow was unloosed in primetime to became the most
successful program on TV, everything was up for grabs. (Jubera,

   TV-POST _ A review of the TV show Cupid &AMP; Cate. Sometimes, TV
critics are wrong. It doesn't happen often. OK, you can stop
laughing now. But it does occur. Case in point: when I received the
tape of the CBS movie Cupid &AMP; Cate, I thought I had the film
pegged. Before watching it, I skimmed the press notes. I thought
they told me everything I needed to know. Cate De Angelo
(Mary-Louis Parker) is a woman in a tiresome relationship with her
boring fiance (David Lansbury). Cate's life, however, gets a
much-needed jump-start after her sister introduces her to Harry
(Peter Gallagher), a funny guy who makes Cate laugh and tingle.

 &HT;    Novice woodworker's shoes on well-trodden path
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here, from the Internet, is probably the most common
dilemma that any untrained, novice woodworker faces:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a planer, jointer, or even any planes yet, so
now's the time to start fresh. I'm also on a low budget. I've been
building small projects such as stepstool, two-shelf bookracks,
etc. and they never quite come out right. My table saw is aligned
just right and ... people tell me it's probably because the boards
I'm working with aren't perfectly true. (flat on all sides) I've
done all my projects with S4S red oak and they've come out pretty
well, considering. But they always have annoying little gaps and
never stand on all four legs until I sand them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think the time has come to buy some flattening equipment.
One other complication: If the choice is hand planes (good for the
budget) how do I fasten the wood down? I have a Workmate and an
aluminum workbench with no provisions for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planer and jointer wouldn't be a bad idea, but it would
take a while to afford them. As I see it, here are my options:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1. ``Buy a portable planer (that's what I have room for) on my
Mastercard and a jointer plane.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  2. ``Buy a few planes (jointer, jack, and block) and try to
rig something up to hold the board steady.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3. ``Try to find room and build a real workbench with dogs and
use planes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4. ``Don't build anything else really precise until I can
afford a planer and jointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there any options I'm missing? Anyone else been in my
shoes? What would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people have been in your shoes, my friend. You have
narrowed your options wisely, except for No. 4, which is not good
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option isn't going to work out well either, because a
planer only removes wood and cannot be depended on to flatten a
bowed board, and you still have to have a means of holding the wood
for the jointer plane.
</P>
<P>
   What you want to do is combine options 3 and 4. Build yourself a
good workbench. It doesn't have to be fancy, and it doesn't have to
use expensive wood. It only has to have a very flat top and be very
heavy and rock-steady. As for dogs, it doesn't have to have those
either, although they're useful and if you're going to build a
bench you might as well put in a couple of holes for dogs. Make
your dogs of wood, though. Don't buy those metal ones. Then buy
good planes and learn to tune them and use them properly.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, keep your projects small. It's a lot easier
to flatten a two-foot board than a four-foot one.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you limited yourself to things like jewelry boxes,
and picked your stock carefully, you probably wouldn't have to
exert yourself too much at all. And you'll save a lot of money if
you can stay away from the S4S stock.
</P>
<P>
   These are compromises, certainly, but they'll keep you working,
and learning, while you save money for the big investments.
Investment in a workbench and hand planes will never be wasted,
either. You'll always need them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China's saber-rattling to quell Taiwan's talk of
independence spotlights one of Washington's best-kept secrets: The
United States would be hard-pressed to protect the island against
any Chinese attack.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials are hopeful that their warnings
to Beijing will prompt China to halt threatening rhetoric and
military movements before Taiwan's inauguration of a
pro-independence president on May 20.
</P>
<P>
   China's psychological warfare stems from concern that
President-elect Chen Shui-bian is the first leader in 51 years to
urge independence for Taiwan rather than eventual reunification
with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. officials, keenly aware of the limits of U.S. power in
the distant region, are appealing to Taiwan as well to avoid
needless provocations of China, such as the declaration of
independence that China vows to crush by force.
</P>
<P>
   CIA Director George J. Tenet warned Congress even before
Taiwan's March 18 presidential election that Chen's
pro-independence agenda would prompt China to stage ``a show of
force'' that would create a ``high potential for another military
flare-up across the Taiwan Strait this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The People's Liberation Daily, China's official military
newspaper, has raised the specter of nuclear war if the United
States stands in the way of China's reunification with Taiwan,
reminding Washington that Beijing has ``certain long-distance
strike capabilities'' capable of delivering nuclear-armed missiles
against U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   With talk like that, Harvey Sicherman, a foreign policy analyst
with the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, says
U.S. war planners are focusing anew on threatened conflict with
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big problem _ bigger than it has been before,'' says
Sicherman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet any Chinese aggression against Taiwan would pose a tough
political decision for a U.S. president. The United States has an
ambiguous defense commitment to Taiwan, stemming from 1979 when
Washington broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan, switched
diplomatic recognition to China and adopting Beijing's policy that
Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ended its mutual defense treaty with Taiwan
and Congress substituted domestic legislation known as the Taiwan
Relations Act to govern unofficial U.S. ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The law falls far short of security guarantees once provided
Taiwan by treaty, merely obligating the United States to provide
``arms of a defensive character'' to Taiwan and to ``maintain the
(U.S.) capacity'' to ``resist any resort to force'' by China.
</P>
<P>
   The law leaves wide leeway for any U.S. response to a Chinese
attack on Taiwan, only stipulating ``that any effort to determine
the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means _ including by
boycotts or embargoes _ is considered a threat to the peace and
security of the western Pacific area and of grave concern to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts and U.S. war planners caution that the
United States would face immense difficulties defeating a
determined effort by China's 2.9 million-member armed forces to
terrorize, dominate or seize control of Taiwan, an island of 22.1
million that is one-third the size of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Every aspect of Taiwan's defense poses problems for the United
States, which relies on 300,000 U.S. military personnel to protect
U.S. Pacific interests, including nearly $600 billion in annual
two-way trade with three dozen countries. Much of the U.S. effort
in the Pacific is devoted to protecting South Korea and Japan,
rather than positioning for a possible defense of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Any likely combat scenario for China to dominate Taiwan _
whether a naval blockade, a missile attack, domination from the air
or an outright invasion _ would pose a huge challenge the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fisher, a senior fellow and China expert with the
Jamestown Foundation, a conservative think tank, says China would
``move too quickly for the U.S. to respond,'' crushing Taiwan's air
force and navy within a day and seizing air superiority and control
the sea lanes within two to three days.''
</P>
<P>
   War planners are weighing the consequences of U.S. responses to
at least four possible scenarios for a Chinese military move
against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chinese naval blockade of Taiwan:
</P>
<P>
   The far-flung U.S. Pacific Fleet would be forced to operate
warships from its 190-ship armada more than 1,000 miles from ports
in Japan and 2,000 miles from facilities in Singapore, where the
Navy signed an agreement on April 20 to enable U.S. warships to
resupply at state-of-the-art pier facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range U.S. air operations staged from U.S. bases in Japan
or South Korea would face marauding forays by China's air corps of
4,970 combat aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chinese missile attack:
</P>
<P>
   The United States would face difficulties thwarting a Chinese
campaign to inflict terror and destruction with nuclear-capable
surface-to-surface missiles fired from coastal batteries.
</P>
<P>
   China's arsenal of 200 missiles is expected to swell to 800 by
2005, posing a challenge for U.S. anti-missile weapons such as the
Army's mobile Patriot anti-aircraft system that had difficulty
knocking down supersonic Iraqi warheads during the Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kagan, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
says a Chinese missile onslaught could effectively ``force Taiwan's
capitulation without an invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Seizing Taiwan airspace:
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon admits the difficulties of combating the Chinese
air force if Beijing launched an all-out bid to seize air
superiority over Taiwan. The sheer numerical advantage of China's
4,970 combat aircraft over Taiwan's paltry fleet of 392 combat
warplanes would enable China to wear down Taiwan's air defenses,
the Pentagon told Congress in a report last year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has six aircraft carriers assigned to the
Pacific region capable of carrying almost 500 combat aircraft.
There are nearly 400 Air Force combat aircraft in Japan, South
Korea, Alaska, Guam and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   _ Normandy-style amphibious invasion:
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials take comfort that China currently lacks the
amphibious capability to carry out a successful amphibious landing
on Taiwan against opposing forces. But China's planned acquisition
of aircraft carriers and modernization of naval amphibious forces,
in addition to the acquisition of two modern Russian-built
destroyers this year, would Beijing the ability to carry out such
an operation by 2005, the Pentagon told Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the challenges posed by each scenario, the United States
faces the wider frustration of being unable to rely on Taiwan as an
equal partner in a joint defense. The island's 376,000-member armed
forces lack high-tech weaponry and extensive military-to-military
integration with U.S. forces, according to a secret 40-page
Pentagon report.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Taiwan have nothing like the close
military relationships, joint exercises and compatible weapons that
enabled U.S. forces to mobilize with allies to defend Persian Gulf
oil fields and expel Iraqi occupation forces from Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan _ technically a province of China _ is not permitted to
take part in U.S. exercises, such as a six-week allied naval
exercise off the coast of Hawaii beginning May 30 that involves 50
ships, 200 aircraft, and 22,000 personnel drawn from seven nations.
</P>
<P>
   Political impediments also imperil the U.S. commitment to sell
defensive weapons to Taiwan. In April, the White House deferred
Taiwan's request to buy four sophisticated $1.1 billion Aegis-radar
equipped destroyers capable of tracking 100 airborne targets nearly
300 miles over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Americans' staunch, Cold War-era support for the
defense of Taiwan has gradually ebbed in favor of broadening U.S.
commercial ties with China, a promising, fast-growing market of 1.2
billion people that does almost $100 billion a year in two-way
trade with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll released March 22 showed Americans regarded China
and Taiwan in roughly the same terms: 26 percent called Taiwan
friendly but not an ally and 24 percent ranked China that way.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. appetite for increased trade with China has tempered
Americans' once ardent anti-communism and stalwart support for
non-communist Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate under Republican leadership since 1994 have
been every bit as supportive of expanding trade ties with China as
the Democratic-led House and Senate in earlier years. The GOP
Senate leadership is shelving action on House-passed legislation to
require the United States to forge military-to-military ties with
Taiwan. ``I just don't see the need for it,'' Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska, said after returning from a visit to Taiwan in late
April.
</P>
<P>
   The ambiguous U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan _ far short of
the mutual defense treaty obligations that the United States has
undertaken with six nearby Asian nations _ leaves Washington plenty
of wiggle room when it comes to aiding Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   James Lilley, a former U.S. ambassador to China, says the
provision of U.S. law requiring defense aid to Taiwan ``gives you
the language to move in _ and it gives you the language to stay
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambiguity fosters flexibility _ and uncertainty about what
the United States would do if China carried out its threats against
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Eric McVadon, a retired Navy rear admiral who served as U.S.
naval attache at the U.S. embassy in Beijing in the early 1990s,
says an American president would face ``a really tough call'' about
whether to intervene to protect Taiwan against Chinese aggression,
adding: ``Even the question of whether we respond is one we don't
have great assurance on.''

 By ORLANDO PATTERSON 
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Of the many contradictions that make American life so endlessly
fascinating, few are more curious than those pertaining to money
and success.
 &HT;    The zeal to make money drives America's globally dominant
economy. It has long been observed that in the absence of an
aristocracy and the other insidious obfuscations of too much
history, money has been the chief maker and marker of status and
power. And if my profession is certain of one thing, it is the fact
that a family's income matters greatly for the welfare and
development of its children.
 &HT;    It is odd, then, that so many Americans have always held money
in suspicion. The Puritans were certain that it was the root of all
evil, even as they flagellated themselves for making more and more
of it. Leaders from Benjamin Franklin to Martin Luther King Jr.
have warned of the dangers of materialism.
 &HT;    Today, a substantial majority of Americans insist that they do
not overvalue money as a measure of their success. What's more,
they also deny the influence of money in the way they or their
children turn out. The puzzle deepens when we observe that even
African-Americans, as well as poorer and older people, are among
those most inclined to deny such influences.
 &HT;    What's going on? Are these people simply in denial? Or are they
just misinformed? Perhaps it's a little of both. But I think
something more complex is at play, having to do with the need to
reconcile our deeply held beliefs about equality with the realities
of inequality in America.
 &HT;    America justified its declaration of independence with the
startling principle that all people are self-evidently equal.
Nonetheless, in the more than two centuries since this declaration,
income inequality has grown, except for the period that began with
the mid-1930s and ended with the late 1960s.
 &HT;    This growth in inequality has been accompanied by an extension
of democracy far beyond what prevailed in Jefferson's day. And yet,
contrary to the fears of postrevolutionary leaders that a tyrannous
majority would inevitably soak the rich, for most periods of
American history, including our own, political power has rarely
been used to reduce inequality. Why is that?
 &HT;    There is little support for the cynical view that Americans
don't really take their egalitarian ideal seriously. They do, and
what's more, nearly half consider present economic inequalities
morally wrong.
 &HT;    As someone who has known or lived with the invidious injuries of
the British class system, the ostentatious iniquities of Caribbean
color-class hierarchies with their ``one people'' cant, not to
mention Brazilian apartheid with its Orwellian double-speak of
``racial democracy,'' I'll take the dilemmas of American
egalitarianism any day, racist warts and all.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, while most Americans genuinely endorse equality in
principle, they seem unable to embrace the political means
necessary to achieve it. Jennifer Hochschild, a political
scientist, thinks that Americans are highly egalitarian in the
domains of home, school and community, but that they reject
egalitarianism in the workplace. They are uncomfortable using
politics to redistribute wealth because they feel it mixes up
domains.
 &HT;    I doubt it. Working people do not use politics to repair income
inequality because they believe that the democratic process has
been corrupted and that politicians are beholden to vested
interests. Working- and middle-class Americans certainly desire
more money. But having long given up on politicians to do anything
about inequality, they have by necessity developed attitudes toward
money that enable them to live with it.
 &HT;    Religion is one buttress. In this most religious of
industrialized nations, it is religious Americans, among whom
African-Americans are disproportionately numbered, who are among
the most inclined to deny money's impact or its role as a measure
of success.
 &HT;    But a majority of the less devout among us also disclaim the
influence of money. They imagine that anyone can make it if they
really want to. Becoming rich is a matter of choice, and if there
is any virtue left, it lies in the road not taken. Many still share
Emerson's view that ``money often costs too much,'' added to which
are recent developments indicating that it buys less and less
status.
 &HT;    One effect of the vast growth of wealth in contemporary America
is that the rich are no longer exalted: too many millionaires have
socially degraded wealth. This is all the more true in the strange
roller-coaster world of the new economy, where millionaires are
daily made from market ether and traditional economic values are
upended. The rich can no longer claim to earn their status the
old-fashioned way. Like lottery winners, it could happen to anyone.
 &HT;    It may be, too, that people invest money with different symbolic
meanings. Viviana Zelizer, a sociologist, has argued that money has
cultural significance beyond its wholly instrumental uses. People
earmark and valorize money differently, depending on how it is
acquired.
 &HT;    The same person who scrupulously saves a portion of her income
for the down payment on a home will blow $1,000 won from the
lottery on a fancy dress or a party. In this cultural recoinage,
money ceases to be fungible. There is earned money and welfare
money; clean, laundered and dirty money; breadwinner's money and
pin money. And, one surmises, there is the funny money of the rich,
and the real, honest money of working people.
 &HT;    In fact, I would contend that the willingness of many Americans
to accept the widening income gap, despite their moral reservations
about it, grows out of a deep and abiding national conviction:
whatever differences fortune may have dictated between people,
where it really matters all of us are of truly equal worth.

 AMERICAN MORALITY: THE GOOD LIE
</HEADLINE>

 By JANE SMILEY 
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    After reading the results of this poll, you'd have to say that
lying to protect someone's feelings is as American as enriching
your life by having children, almost as American as not ever having
done yoga, and more American than thinking you are too fat or
feeling guilty about a thing or two you did when you were younger.
 &HT;    On the other hand, lying to protect someone's feelings is not
nearly as American as thinking that being American is a big part of
who you are.
 &HT;    Myself, I would have to say that lying is not nearly as big a
part of who I am as writing fiction, and in fact, I almost never
lie, even to avoid hurting someone's feelings. What I do to avoid
hurting someone's feelings is just keep my opinion to myself.
 &HT;    Even so, my occasional forays into lying have made me something
of a theorist of lying. (Here are the lies I told: 1. I sold a car
knowing it needed new valve rings, but I really did not know that
it needed a new transmission until the buyer told me about it five
days after the sale. 2. I told one of my husbands that I still
loved him even though I didn't know whether I did or not.)
 &HT;    There are several forms of what you might call lying. One is
misrepresenting the truth. Another is keeping a secret. A third is
presenting as true what you wish were true, or perhaps hope is
true, but don't know for sure is true. A fourth form of lying is
shorthand _ the truth is changing so quickly that to detail every
shift would in fact present something as true that could very
quickly become false. A fifth is being mistaken, which sometimes
looks like a lie.
 &HT;    Let's begin with being mistaken. Everyone is mistaken almost all
the time, and so almost everything that everyone says will
eventually be proved wrong, and so almost everything that everyone
says is untrue.
 &HT;    The best answer to any question is, ``I don't know,'' even to so
simple a question as ``How do you like these shoes I bought?'' ``I
don't know'' is a real commitment to the larger truth, because it
recognizes that the passage of time makes every judgment
provisional.
 &HT;    However, people who always say ``I don't know'' find themselves
in a double bind _ either they are considered too bland to have
opinions or, if they explain why they don't know, they are told
that they think too much, and thinking too much is not very
American at all. So, logically, there is no truth telling, but
people persuade themselves that they more or less tell the truth
anyway.
 &HT;    A recognition of complexity makes truth telling that much more
difficult. Government officials or unfaithful spouses involved in
some quickly developing crisis, for example, are often subsequently
accused of either withholding information or misrepresenting the
partial information already available.
 &HT;    But the supposition that the truth is known almost always leads
to action, and most actions, of course, turn out to be unreasoned,
wrongheaded ones. Best to put off action as long as possible, and
lying to achieve this goal is a perfectly wise decision.
 &HT;    If the truth is almost always misrepresented, then the real
moral distinctions with regard to lying have to do with motive.
Most of those polled seem to feel that lying to save someone else
pain is moral. I suspect, though, that they would have had a
different response to the statement ``Lying is sometimes necessary
to protect oneself.'' Let us say that 60 percent might have
disagreed with this statement, and yet we all know that lying is
sometimes necessary to protect oneself, even when we choose not to,
and fail to protect ourselves.
 &HT;    In fact, one of the main tasks of raising children is to
convince them that telling a lie does not protect them; that it in
fact endangers them even more than the misbehavior that gave rise
to the lie. Children understand that to tell the truth is sometimes
counterintuitive, which is why teaching them to tell the truth
depends very much on how much power they think Mom and Dad really
possess. In my experience, oldest children hardly ever lie, but
second children, well aware of the disparity between what parents
think is going on and what is really going on, lie rather easily.
 &HT;    What constitutes self-protection? I wish the pollsters had asked
a final question: ``Although this is an anonymous questionnaire, I
have misrepresented the truth, exaggerated things and held
information back on one or more questions. Do you agree or
disagree?'' (See question No. 8, ``Have you ever cheated just a
little on your taxes or an office expense account, or haven't
you?'')
 &HT;    Obviously, of the 84 percent who say they have never exaggerated
their business mileage, never failed to report even a penny of cash
income, never filled in the wrong amount on a blank taxi receipt,
at least some are protecting their own opinion of themselves.
 &HT;    And how about if the pollsters had asked the question, ``Lying
is sometimes necessary for personal gain?'' How American would it
be to agree with that one? In what area of our booming economy do
the sellers of goods advertise them truthfully? In what area do the
buyers expect them to? In what political arena do the candidates
come clean? In what political arena do the voters expect them to,
or even want them to?
 &HT;    I remember when President Carter's attempt to rescue the
hostages in Iran failed. He spoke to the American people of his
sense that the hostage taking posed something of a dilemma, not
easily solved. As a result of his honesty and understanding of
complexity, he was widely perceived as weak and summarily replaced
in office by a simple man who seems never to have found himself in
a dilemma.
 &HT;    Is it more American to keep a secret or to tell it? The person
doing the choosing often has to consider the motives of the person
seeking the information. Almost all Americans, for example, would
have considered it extremely un-American for those hiding Jews
during World War II to divulge their whereabouts. In fact, many
Americans would consider it highly American for those living under
tyrannical regimes in faraway places to keep and bear arms, even
unlawful, secret arms.
 &HT;    My own feeling is that even in America, there are some to whom
it is obligatory to lie. When you are going through a serious
crisis, and a casual acquaintance or your mother asks how you are,
it is a very bad idea to actually tell them. ``Fine'' is fine.
 &HT;    It is also OK to lie to unsolicited telephone callers, guys who
make passes and friends who like to retail gossip or offer
unasked-for advice.
 &HT;    In this category I would have to include the press too: there is
never any moral opprobrium to be suffered by those who lie to the
press. Reporters are in the business of selling secrets for money.
They do not, therefore, have your best interests at heart. I have
always admired the efforts of every single celebrity or politician
who lied to the press. Just as the role of the press is to be a
watchdog upon the government, the role of celebrities and
politicians is to frustrate the all-seeing eye of the press and
remind everyone that there are questions that should never be asked
if a civil society is to be maintained.

Magazine is for use by clients of the ``Centerpiece'' package.

 By ALAN WOLFE 
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    America, no longer a nation of sheep, has entered the age of
autonomy. People are pretty much on their own when it comes to
finding a mate, rearing children, choosing a career or planning
retirement.
 &HT;    Deep inside, Americans are exploring a new frontier. Though they
still believe in God, uphold the family and love their country,
they increasingly decide which God best suits their temperament,
which family structure works for them and whether their country's
government is worthy of their trust.
 &HT;    In March, The New York Times Magazine conducted a poll that
asked Americans not about their party affiliations but about their
beliefs, fears, anxieties, fantasies and opinions. The results of
the poll demonstrate the degree to which Americans find themselves
falling back on their own resources when it comes to thinking about
the conditions for a good and meaningful life.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Inner God
 &HT;    No one should ever underestimate Americans' faith in faith.
Despite a widely perceived trend toward secularization, 49 percent
of the respondents to the Times survey said they were about as
religious as their parents; 21 percent said they were more
religious.
 &HT;    But doctrinal disputes leave most people cold. Americans want a
capacious God who smiles on everyone, not a jealous God protective
of one particular version of his teachings.
 &HT;    Paradoxically, Americans have a specific distaste for the
theological doctrine that has informed our national morality from
the beginning: Puritanism. The Puritans believed in an inherent
human depravity that could be countered only by God's willingness
to extend, even arbitrarily, his grace.
 &HT;    Americans, though, are inveterate optimists; 75 percent believe
in the intrinsic goodness of people, which suggests, whether they
fully realize it or not, that they no longer subscribe to the
Judeo-Christian notion of original sin. Americans are simply too
nice to see Satan everywhere around them.
 &HT;    The niceness of Americans can drive thoughtful people to
distraction. Allan Bloom, the political philosopher whose life is
more or less at the center of Saul Bellow's new novel,
``Ravelstein,'' believed that the willingness of his students to
see good in everyone rendered them ``spiritually unclad,
unconnected, isolated, with no inherited or unconditional
connection with anything or anyone.''
 &HT;    Bloom was right to see a connection between a sunny temperament
and rootlessness. When people are responsible for shaping their
world, they learn that, since no one can credibly claim to have all
life's answers, it pays to treat everyone with respect.
 &HT;    But Bloom's observation also brings up the question: Would
America really be better off if its citizens were meaner? After
all, when we were more tightly connected by region, race and
religion, our conflicts were bloodier, our words harsher, our
politics more vituperative. Greater autonomy has not produced a war
of all against all. If niceness is the price we have to pay for
autonomy, we should consider ourselves doubly blessed.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Right and Wrong
 &HT;    Those who believe that we need a strong God fear that a people
unwilling to abide by his Commandments will live in a state of
moral relativism. If religious Commandments are understood to be
absolutes, their concerns would be justified. Fully 60 percent of
the survey's respondents said that lying is sometimes necessary to
protect another person's feelings, thereby contravening the
complete prohibition against lying laid down by the great Christian
theologian St. Augustine and the equally great Enlightenment
philosopher Immanuel Kant.
 &HT;    Just because Americans are suspicious of moral absolutes,
however, does not mean that they find no difference between right
and wrong. Ninety percent of those surveyed say they believe that
adults have a moral responsibility to care for their parents, and
84 percent claim that they have never cheated on their taxes.
 &HT;    That government collects enough money to function _ and that
elderly people are not sent out into the cold _ is because most
Americans believe in moral principles like paying one's fair share
or assuming the obligation to help those who once helped you.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Their Bodies, Themselves
 &HT;    There is a moral majority in America; it just happens to be
unwilling to follow anyone's party line about what morality ought
to be. Attitudes about sex confirm this. The efforts of novelists,
filmmakers and pharmaceutical companies notwithstanding, the poll's
respondents seem clear on this point: sex is not all that
interesting.
 &HT;    Ever since the 1960s, cultural radicals have argued that
political freedom leads to sexual freedom. At some level they are
correct, for autonomy will be taken by many to mean that their
bodies really are their own. Yet if America has become freer with
its sexuality, it also remains stubbornly conventional. In America,
the joys of family life outweigh the joys of sex; 63 percent of
those surveyed say they believe that people who have children lead
richer lives than those who do not.
 &HT;    In their own way, conservative attitudes toward sex and marriage
underscore, rather than undermine, the emergence of the age of
autonomy. An autonomous people unwilling to accept God's
Commandments as absolute is just as unwilling to accept the
libidinous definitions of sexuality offered on television.
 &HT;    Imagination seemed to be the domain of sexual freedom; 46
percent of the poll's respondents believe that it is OK to
fantasize about having sex with someone other than one's partner.
Infidelity of the mind compared with infidelity of the flesh, is
the kind of pragmatic compromise that makes sense to people who
respect autonomy while fearing unregulated sexuality.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Place of Work
 &HT;    For all the talk of dot-com millionaires, Americans do not
understand themselves as workaholics. If they were suddenly given
three extra hours a day, most of them would spend it with their
families and friends rather than at work.
 &HT;    Money, to no one's surprise, does matter. Still, people do not
attribute their achievements to the money their parents had; they
also do not think that their money will be a significant
determinant of who their children will turn out to be.
 &HT;    The Times survey gives little support to the argument that
Americans, frustrated by the demands of family life, have turned to
the world of work for satisfaction. Time, career and financial
pressures cause far more stress than one's love life or family
demands.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Public and Private
 &HT;    Americans tend to be cynical about politicians, distrustful of
institutions and civically disengaged. Yet they trust their
spouses, love their children and feel good about themselves.
 &HT;    The public and the private constitute two entirely different
realms of life, one driven by suspicion, the other informed by
love. The same Americans who give to charity are more likely to
support welfare reform. People who disapprove of homosexuality will
respond with compassion when someone they know becomes
HIV-positive.
 &HT;    Let an issue be defined as a cause, and Americans, wary of the
impersonal and abstract, will turn their backs. Let it be defined
as a matter of friendship, family or faith, and they will act
generously.
 &HT;    What matters is whether the issue is viewed as public or
private. The public is what you have to do; the private is what you
want to do. To make the personal the political is to sacrifice the
very autonomy that makes personal life the refuge Americans believe
it has become.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Inner Differences
 &HT;    Autonomy means different things to different people. Black
Americans, the survey demonstrates, show less confidence that they
can be anything they want to be; are more likely than whites to
conclude that those who get to the top of American society are less
moral than others; and are more inclined than whites to believe
that race played a big role in making them who they are.
 &HT;    The wealthiest and most educated of the respondents find less
fault with unequal income distribution than the poorer and least
educated.
 &HT;    Women are more likely than men to think that cheating on taxes
is wrong, that taking care of elderly parents is right and that
there is something morally problematic about income inequality.
Thus, to the degree that there is a moral gap in America, it can
also be described as a gender gap.
 &HT;    On matters related to sex, America has a genuine two-party
system: one group of Americans thinks it is wrong to fantasize
about having sex with someone besides your partner, while another
group does not. What differentiates these groups is not religion
but religiosity.
 &HT;    On nearly all the questions asked by the Times survey, no
appreciable differences existed between Catholics and Protestants.
Yet major differences did exist between people who described
themselves as frequent church attendees and those who did not. It
is whether you believe, not what you believe, that counts. Though
both agree that people are inherently good.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Risks of Autonomy
 &HT;    America is a harder country to govern in an age of autonomy. Its
inhabitants are increasingly unwilling to do things just because
someone in authority tells them they should. Everyone seems to have
an opinion on truths that were once considered self-evident. The
resulting turbulence is often too much for those who worry that
Americans, preoccupied with their own selfish concerns, do not
worry enough.
 &HT;    They fear that, especially during this golden age of prosperity,
people are paying too little attention to the poverty around them
or to the responsibilities the country must exercise toward the
world. Only when we face such catastrophes as depression and war,
the argument goes, do we seem capable of keeping our narcissistic
inclinations in check, as if worthy public lives were dependent on
tragic private ones.
 &HT;    Of those surveyed, 90 percent say that being an American is a
big part of who they are. That may well be because being an
American enables them to discover who they are.
 &HT;    People in Puritan America or Victorian England were instructed
in the proper way to live, often by those who could not live by the
rules they designed for others. Compared with those eras, the age
of autonomy is worth celebrating for the sense of freedom it
offers.
 &HT;    The age of autonomy should be embraced for another reason: its
optimistic theory of human nature makes more sense than the one it
replaced. Earlier worldviews in America argued that a strong God,
like a strong state, was necessary to keep weak people in line. But
Americans see themselves as capable of making their way in the
world without firm guidance from their moral superiors.
 &HT;    If the results of the Times survey are any indication, the age
of autonomy is not an age of anarchy. Americans are not out to
destroy the institutions and practices that make it possible for
them to live together in relative peace. Rather, they are engaged
in a process of rethinking what properly ought to be the concern of
others and what properly belongs to themselves.
 &HT;    In the mid-1800s, America was an overwhelmingly Christian
society in which morality was public while work and family were
private. Today, people choose their religions and shape their
moralities even as they can no longer shield their incomes, family
sizes or consumer preferences from inquisitive eyes. The less
privacy we have over the things that matter relatively little, the
more privacy we crave over the things that matter most.
 &HT;    Americans seem to recognize that the things that matter most
ought to matter to us all; 61 percent think that America was a
better place when people had stronger attachments and did not move
around so much. But they do seem to have gotten used to living less
confined lives.
 &HT;    Autonomy does raise the prospect of people too preoccupied with
their private selves to care much about the common good. But it
also challenges those who emphasize the importance of the common
good to take heed of what Americans find valuable about their way
of life.
 &HT;    The question is whether Americans can learn to use the autonomy
they have gained to strengthen the institutions that make civil
society possible. If they do not, this new age promises to be
unstable. But if they do, it will produce institutions from which
people will feel less need to escape _ in large measure because
institutions will not escape from them.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 1970 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GAFFEN   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level in
more than 30 years in April and wages pushed higher, even as
employers' pace of hiring slowed from its strong March clip, the
Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. unemployment rate, a statistic that is closely watched
by the financial markets and the Federal Reserve for signs of
inflation, dropped to 3.9 percent in April, its lowest level since
January 1970, while non-farm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted
340,000 in April after rising at an upwardly revised 458,000 pace
in March. Those numbers were in part increased by government hiring
of temporary census workers, which accounted for about 73,000 of
those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The average hourly wage of the U.S. worker rose 6 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $13.64, leading the annual pace of wage increases to
rise 3.8 percent, the largest gain in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in payrolls was slightly below a Reuters consensus
forecast of economists, which called for a 358,000 increase in
payrolls. But the data highlight the intense shortage of workers
that the U.S. is experiencing as it storms toward its record 10th
year of economic expansion. It also supports anecdotal evidence
from around the country seen in the Federal Reserve's so-called
Beige Book, released earlier this week, which found that businesses
all over the nation are having a tough time finding and keeping
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that if the economy sustains the hiring momentum
seen so far this year, the shortage of workers might intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far this year, ex-census, payrolls are up 250,000 a
month,'' said Josh Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset
Management. ``If the economy continues to generate 250,000 on
average, the unemployment rate is going to continue to ratchet
lower.''
</P>
<P>
   And while available workers are getting harder to find, wage
growth has started to accelerate. That has worried economists and
Federal Reserve officials alike that higher wages could spell
inflation as businesses pass the higher cost of workers into the
prices of their finished goods.
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly expressed concern
over the decline in the pool of available workers, and the
inflationary implications it carries. After remaining largely in
check during the last couple of years, wage pressures are beginning
to intensify, as evidenced by other gauges such as the Labor's
employment cost index, which rose 1.4 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has been able to dodge a significant rise in
inflation, largely because of gains in worker productivity. Rising
productivity has allowed businesses to increase their output
without significant rises in the labor cost per unit of production.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan has also warned that the economy is vulnerable to
inflation should productivity gains start to wane. A Labor
Department productivity report on Thursday might have signaled that
the tables are starting to turn on the anti-inflationary influence
of productivity.
</P>
<P>
   While productivity rose a still-strong 2.4 percent in the first
quarter, it was a sharp drop from 6.9 percent in the fourth
quarter, and was accompanied by higher unit labor costs, which rose
for the first time in nearly a year at 1.8 percent. Additionally,
consumer prices have started to accelerate. The core consumer price
index rose 0.4 percent in March, the largest gain in more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to head off such inflationary pressures, the Fed
has raised interest rates five times in 0.25 percentage point
increments since last June. In theory, higher interest rates slow
economic growth by making it harder for businesses to borrow and
spend. But the increases thus far have had little effect in
important areas of the economy, such as the job market, stock
markets, housing and construction, and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   That has led many to surmise that the Fed might step up its
efforts to slow growth by increasing the magnitude of its rate
increases. A growing number of economists is expecting the Fed to
raise interest rates by 0.5 percentage point when it meets May 16,
and the strength seen in the labor market from Friday's report
might add to their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the temporary government hiring for the 2000 census,
census workers actually were less important to the overall increase
in jobs last month than had been expected; excluding census
workers, nonfarm payrolls increased a still-strong 267,000, the
Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction workers fell 55,000, while manufacturing jobs
increased 11,000. The overall gain in payrolls showed that labor
markets remained extremely tight and job creation continues to be
strong. Service-producing jobs added 380,000, including 107,000 in
government workers.
</P>
<P>
   The average employee's workweek was 34.6 hours, compared with
March's 34.5 hours, indicating that existing workers are putting in
more hours to make up for the shortage of new workers.

 &HT;    Never trust anything that doesn't have shoulders
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Snakes alive. That's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   One of my long-gone predecessors at the newspaper often referred
to himself in his column as the ``Dead Snake Editor,'' because so
many readers would bring by snakes they had killed and ask to have
their photo made holding the dead snake. I have occasionally been
asked to do the same, especially while working at small weekly
newspapers. Some good ol' boy would bring a 7-foot rattlesnake to
the office and request his photo be made holding up the dead
creature as if he had bagged a trophy deer. Being as how most of
these men were built like brick outhouses, I would dutifully take
the photo and stick it in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Then I started following editor Sam Malone's way of handling
this whole snake scenario. He told readers he was the ``Live Snake
Editor,'' and if you wanted your picture made with a snake, it had
to be brought in alive. This drastically cut the number of photo
requests. There aren't many people besides zookeepers and the
occasional member of one of those serpent-handling churches who are
willing to hold a live snake long enough for a photographer to get
the camera focused and the picture made.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not really scared of snakes, but I don't like them. I don't
trust any creature that doesn't have shoulders. I have had close
encounters with poisonous snakes: nearly stepping on a rattlesnake
once, having a water moccasin fall in a boat from a branch above as
we floated down a river, and finding a coral snake curled up on the
back porch. In all three cases, the snake lived and so did I.
</P>
<P>
   The rattlesnake slipped away, the water moccasin was pitched
into the water with the barrel of a shotgun, and the coral snake
was captured and set loose far in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like killing stuff. It's messy. That's why I don't hunt.
It's not a moral issue. I just like my meat pre-wrapped in
cellophane, and I am willing to pay someone else to do the dirty
work.
</P>
<P>
   But I will commit violence if I have to, and the other day a
snake left me no choice. My step-daughter and I were returning from
softball practice about dark. I pulled into the garage. As she
walked ahead, I grabbed her shoulder about two steps before she
would have stepped on a 6-foot-long snake curled up at the door
into the house.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing I know, the stepdaughter is perched on the roof of
the car, and I'm trying to herd the snake out of the garage and
head it in the direction of the woods.The snake did not appreciate
my prodding it with the handle of garden hoe and kept striking at
it and returning to the doormat. The kid had escaped out the garage
and through the front door, and now the entire family was gathered
on the safe side of the door into the house, listening to my
progress.
</P>
<P>
   I'm fairly certain this wasn't a poisonous snake, though the
light was bad and I couldn't remember the rhyme: Was it ``black and
yellow, kill a fellow?'' Or ``flat head, you're dead?'' The snake's
head seemed flat to me, and its coloring was brown and black, near
as I could tell in the dim light of the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I tried to scoot the snake out the garage door, it
would hiss, strike at the hoe handle and get back in the corner. I
realized a hard truth. This snake was claiming the garage as its
new home, and even if he finally slithered out, he'd be back. (All
snakes are male, at least in print.) If I didn't kill him, I would
have to worry about stepping on a snake every time I walked out in
the garage. Worse, I would have to put up with paranoid children
and womenfolk worried about the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   So I dispatched the snake quickly with a machete. I'll spare the
gory details. Suffice it to say there was clean-up involved, which
further confirmed for me why I have no desire to kill things as a
pastime. Everyone is treading a bit cautiously outside, including
me.This snake may have a buddy who could return to the scene of the
crime. I'm wearing shoes outside all the time, just in case.

REYNOLDS SEEN AS POSSIBLE SUITOR FOR NABISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Item from the Write-Your-Own-Barbarians-Back-At-The-Gate joke
file:
</P>
<P>
   Possible bidders for Nabisco Group Holdings (NGH:NYSE) could
include R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings (RJR:NYSE), the company's
one-time subsidiary, according to speculation by one analyst and
The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group Holdings, whose sole asset is an 80.6 percent
stake in Nabisco Holdings (NA:NYSE), the maker of Oreo cookies and
Ritz crackers, said last month that it is exploring a sale of
either itself or its subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   No strangers to boardroom drama, R.J. Reynolds and Nabisco have
led intertwined corporate lives since 1985, when the tobacco
company first bought the food company. The maker of Winston and
Camel cigarettes, spun off last year, might take an interest in the
holding company if it first gets a decent price for its stake in
the cracker maker, according to a theory forwarded Thursday in a
report by Martin Feldman, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would work like this: First, the holding company sells
its stake in the food company for at least $45 a share, equivalent
to around $30 a share because each NGH share is worth around 0.655
per Nabisco share. This would make the holding company a ``PURE
CASH POOL.'' (Caps are Feldman's.)
</P>
<P>
   But, Feldman noted, this pure cash pool would be marred by
tobacco stains. The holding company may still trade at a discount
because investors fear that tobacco litigants might try to tap the
former parent's assets should R.J. Reynolds ever go bankrupt from
adverse rulings.
</P>
<P>
   So, Feldman concluded, R.J. Reynolds would then be the most
likely buyer. After all, it can't get any more liable for judgments
against itself.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is just one possibility, though perhaps the most fun.
The fight for ownership of RJR Nabisco led to the largest leveraged
buyout ever, chronicled in the book Barbarians at the Gate. People
made movies about this.
</P>
<P>
   After explaining his headline-grabbing RJR theory, Feldman also
named other tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris (MO:NYSE)
and Brooke Group (BGL:NYSE), the owner of Liggett, as possible
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   And there's always Carl Icahn. The corporate raider who never
ever ever ever gives up has offered $16 a share, or around $5.2
billion, for the holding company in his fourth buyout attempt since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Anything's possible. The Journal, citing people familiar with
the matter, said RJR might just make a bid for the holding company,
food subsidiary and all. The fear that legions of hacking, wheezing
litigants could take the holding company's assets has depressed the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its severance from R.J. Reynolds, NGH has a market
capitalization of $4.7 billion, or less than half the $10.3 billion
market value of the food company, even though it owns 80.6 percent
of the food company.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal said that ``one scenario being floated'' would have
the tobacco company buy the holding company and flip ownership of
the food company to some other food company. That way, the paper
wrote, R.J. Reynolds could profit from the arbitrage and
essentially scrub off the tobacco stains, sparing the acquiring
food company the attendant liability.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Journal likes Feldman's theory better, though the paper
conceded that another scenario also seems possible: Reynolds could
just do nothing.

&HT;     EXQUISITE CINEMATOGRAPHY SAVES THIS DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many films based on autobiography, ``I Dreamed of Africa''
leans hard on circumstance. This happens. That happens. She gets in
a car crash. He gets hurt in a hunting accident. They get tracked
by lions. People die. People weep. Life goes on. And on. And on.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't all bad: The folks in Hugh Hudson's beautiful,
stilted film lead an existence full of wild animals and wilder
vistas, and the fact that their travails are based in fact lends a
measure of dignity to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   That Kuki Gallmann's memoir of making it in the highlands of
Kenya never gets much beyond a photogenic travelogue isn't her
fault; life is episodic, and most of us don't find closure until we
croak. Gallmann didn't. Her story doesn't. It just ... winds ...
down.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, ``I Dreamed of Africa'' offers bursts of beauty
and emotion: Sections of it are actually quite touching, not to say
lachrymose, and Bernard Lutic's exquisite cinematography provides
visual drama on its own. At the very least, movies set in Africa
don't need bad guys: Any film in which pythons rank as harmless
pets has zoological menace to spare. Snakes are the least of their
worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Dreamed of Africa'' stars Kim Basinger in her first role
since winning the Oscar for ``L.A. Confidential,'' and she returns
to the screen with a stripped-down, tough-mother assurance. She
plays Kuki, the divorced Italian mom of 7-year-old Emanuele who
remarries following a horrific car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Her new husband, Paolo (Vincent Perez, ``Queen Margot''), is a
restless sort who longs to live in Africa. So off they go in their
bouncing Land Rover, navigating dirt tracks and herds of wildlife
(zebras, giraffes, et al) on the road to a dilapidated ranch amid
the soaring views of the jagged Kenyan landscape.
</P>
<P>
   After that, you can guess the plot. Kuki adjusts. Kuki gets
spooked by animals. Kuki learns that life ``has a different
rhythm'' here in Africa. Paolo, that restless guy, goes off on too
many hunting trips. Emanuele (played by two actors, Liam Aiken and
Garrett Strommen) collects snakes and gambols around the grounds
and grows up. Kuki speaks Swahili with a nearby chief. Stuff
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Basinger carries the film as well as she can, giving Kuki plenty
of smarts and pluck. Perez, the Swiss-born heartthrob best known
for his work in French films, adds his runway-chic brand of
virility; their scenes together are believably warm.
</P>
<P>
   The enduring Eva Marie Saint materializes now and then as Kuki's
mom, though her role never gets beyond the standard-issue
Perpetually Worried Mother. Her presence is one of many omens that
some characters are doomed to die. And we know which characters.
And we know how.
</P>
<P>
   Too much is telegraphed; too much of the film follows a
pedestrian course. Yet Hudson, whose small, pearl-like output began
with the radiant ``Chariots of Fire'' and yielded (most recently)
the compassionate and quirky ``My Life So Far,'' isn't a director
to play with narrative structure. His tales unfold with regularity
and emotion, captured in comely mise-en-scenes. None is comelier,
or more stubbornly incidental, than ``I Dreamed of Africa.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a word, wow.
</P>
<P>
   One word, one syllable, one slightly numb expression of
amazement mixed with awe. Wow. I could say more: I could (and will)
go on about the artistic vision, the grand scope, the spectacular
war scenes, the gut-churning gladiatorial combat, the molten star
turn by Russell Crowe, the computer-generated vistas of ancient
Rome and the moving, intelligent script.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, just one word will do in describing ``Gladiator,''
an epic of such emotive power and raw, thrashy action that it may
go down in history as the world's first bona-fide
bloodbath-tearjerker. ``Braveheart,'' another raucous war film,
offered up the hero as avenging husband; in ``Gladiator,'' the
avenging husband breaks down and sobs (snot, drool, saline, sweat,
the works) on the naked feet of his murdered son. Then he goes on
to slay one heavily armored behemoth after another.
</P>
<P>
   Wow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' was directed by Ridley Scott, a renowned visual
stylist who knows how to make a movie look slick. His great films
(``Blade Runner''), his good films (``Thelma and Louise''), even
his lousy ones (``1492: Conquest of Paradise'') all bear the vivid
detail and composition of a trained painter's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Less often do his stories live up to his visuals, as though
Scott were more comfortable with the frou-frou of setting than he
is with character and plot. There are exceptions, ``Alien''
included. Count ``Gladiator'' among them.
</P>
<P>
   The action opens in 180 A.D., upon the final Germanic campaign
of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris, who has
the same wispy mien as Alec Guinness' Marcus Aurelius in 1964's
``The Fall of the Roman Empire''). Leading the charge against the
Barbarians is General Maximus (Crowe), a stout-hearted soldier who
longs to rejoin his wife and son after three long years waging war.
</P>
<P>
   The gory opening battle sequence smacks of ``Braveheart'' _ big
bloody men with broadswords _ and establishes up front both Scott's
artistry and the breakneck pacing of the movie's action setpieces.
Much as Steven Spielberg did in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Scott
plays with exposure and film speed to exaggerate the crashing mania
of men in mortal combat. The result wracks nerves and limbs in
equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   Maximus, played by Crowe with the brooding resolve (but not the
beer belly) he brought to ``The Insider,'' is a hero forged from
tragedy. When the ailing Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus he has
decided to appoint the general heir to the throne, Maximus freezes
_ Marcus Aurelius already has a son, the spooky, conniving Commodus
(Joaquin Phoenix). But the emperor persists: He wants Maximus to
use the powers of Caesar to dissolve the dictatorship and return
Rome to the Senate. Of Commodus, Marcus Aurelius says, ``He cannot
rule. He must not rule. You are the son I should have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Commodus himself isn't pleased with the arrangement, and after a
painful confrontation with dad _ one of the film's most
extraordinary and touching scenes _ he ensures that the transfer of
power to Maximus will never occur. Commodus' first acts as Emperor
are an order to kill the general, which fails miserably, and
another to kill the general's family, which doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Maximus, clawing his way home after a dramatic escape from the
woods of Germania, discovers his dead wife and boy. He collapses.
He's caught and chained as a slave. He's sold to Proximo (the late
Oliver Reed), a gladiator trainer. And so begins his new life in
the human cockfights of ancient Rome, a literal and figurative
arena in which Maximus hopes to enact his revenge upon the Emperor
Commodus.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, not much of this is new _ Roman-epic territory has been
covered often and well in ``Spartacus'' (1960), ``Ben-Hur'' (1959)
and sundry others, including the previously mentioned ``Fall of the
Roman Empire.'' Nor is Crowe's taciturn warrior much of a novelty:
the Man With No Name meets Mad Max in an iron breastplate. But the
brilliance of Scott's film is its epic ambition, its desire to go
beyond the big wows of spectacle and swordplay into much trickier
human ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' never pretends to be history (the real Commodus
ruled for 12 years and wasn't quite the same ogre), but it does use
history to powerful effect. It's easy to imagine gladiators as
desperate and proud as these. It's easy to imagine an emperor as
scheming and starved for love.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe will probably get kicked straight to the A-list for his
work here, as well he should: Few actors can handle unironic
heroism with such gravity and slow-burn fire. But the rest of the
cast impresses as well, from Phoenix's shifty, immature, deeply
wounded Commodus to Connie Nielsen as Commodus' terrified sister,
Lucilla. Djimon Hounsou, unforgettable as the rebellious slave in
``Amistad,'' has a small part as a wise gladiator. And Derek Jacobi
pops up in full robes as a senator. (Rumor has it that DreamWorks
``grafted'' Reed's head onto a stand-in's body after the actor died
mid-shoot. If so, I saw no obvious evidence of it, but I will say
this: Oliver Reed's head delivers a terrific performance.)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its first-rank thespians, perhaps the film's most welcome
element is its script, one of those rare committee screenplays (by
David ``Amistad'' Franzoni, John ``Any Given Sunday'' Logan and
William ``Shadowlands'' Nicholson) that doesn't wind up as a muddle
of bonehead-action cliches. When Commodus tells his father, ``I
would butcher the whole world if thou wouldst love me,'' you have
to admire his poetic urge. But worry thou not: Olde Englishe doth
not dominateth the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, of course, ``Gladiator'' is a banquet. Anyone who can
stomach the gore ought to keep their eyes open (but their ears
shut: Hans Zimmer's blowhard score is the movie's only irritant),
and not only to best admire the gladiatorial pas-de-deux.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about artistic limitations in
computer-generated imagery, the film's sweeping shots of the great,
walled city and its thrumming inhabitants are cause enough for
slack-jaw. As Hounsou says upon seeing the Colosseum, ``I didn't
know men could build such things.'' Frankly, neither did we.

&HT;     DEAR SENATOR: NO MORE RERUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While you are quietly wondering how you'll live without
``Beverly Hills 90210'' or secretly hoping that ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' will go to seven days a week, there's been some
serious squabbling about television among lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   This happens quite a bit, actually. People get upset about
television in one way or another and they go cry to Congress.
Because it's not politically wise to be pro-choice when it comes to
letting people watch what they want _ this country has always been
about censoring television and movies, no matter what those famous
declarations say _ most politicians take these complaints
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. It's a win-win situation for either party:
``Violence on TV is bad! Racy TV shows are bad! Kids are killing
kids because of TV!'' On and on. Won't pass a handgun bill to save
their lives, but TV? That's a no-brainer for a crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   The current series of dust-ups in the Senate were started by the
Parents Television Council, an extremely conservative group with
former funnyman and current censorship goon Steve Allen as their
poster boy. They released a report last month that said sex,
violence and profanity have tripled on television in the last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   And they want it stopped. Wah!
</P>
<P>
   What they have conveniently ignored is that their efforts _ and
those of religious and conservative groups before _ have already
resulted in the creation of the V-chip and ratings for TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that's not good enough. It seems that parents aren't
really taking the time or showing an interest in checking out what
ratings shows get, then using the guidelines (as intended) to
shield the shows from their children (or themselves, who knows).
And the V-chip, mandatory in all new televisions and capable of
blocking out shows, is either too complicated to learn how to use
or the fight to get them installed took all their energy and now
they're simply too tired to screen anything, and that damned ``WWF
Smackdown!'' is ruining their family.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget that modern cable boxes are also capable of
channel-blocking. And then there's that foolproof innovation for
stopping unwanted programming: the off button on the remote. Or,
more extreme measures are available, like unplugging the TV set,
not putting a TV in a child's room or simply not owning one.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fairly exhaustive and effective list of ways to stop TV
from tainting families and rotting them to the core. But apparently
it's not enough. According to groups such as the Parents Television
Council, the government has way too much time on its hands and
needs to set up even more laws, more governmental controls, to keep
``smut'' from entering our living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God for the government. With any luck, one day you'll be
able to actually send your kid to them at age 2, and Uncle Sam and
all the congressional godmothers and fathers will watch over and
protect Little Billy until he's ready to come back home, at 18,
completely free of all that blue language on ``The Sopranos'' or
the sleazy content of Ricki Lake and her ilk.
</P>
<P>
   Until that program _ Raise Our Kids For Us _ is implemented,
apparently there will be much squawking from people who blame
television for everything. Frankly, this is exhausting for anyone
with a brain or good parenting skills. Here we are trying to figure
out those tricky tech stocks, working to improve local schools and
wondering how we'll get through gridlock traffic in time for that
lovely 9 p.m. dinner, and now there's an added worry that masses of
freedom-squelching fearmongers have invited a Big Brother mentality
to prevail upon us and ruin next season's ``Sex and the City''
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, these censorship flare-ups seem to happen more and more
frequently, necessitating a return rant that ultimately stops at
the same place, with the same argument: If you don't want your kids
watching ``bad'' television, then be a better parent. Vote with the
remote. Don't expect the government to raise your offspring. Use
the multitude of blocking techniques to censor your own family, not
your neighbor's family. Throw your TV out the window if you must,
but let us decide for ourselves what to watch.
</P>
<P>
   What's even more annoying than the utterly unsurprising,
repetitive nature of these calls for censorship, is the fact that
anyone in Congress even listens anymore. Why should the Parents
Television Council and other conservative pot-bangers get all the
attention and force all the stupid, ineffectual laws that now
control TV?
</P>
<P>
   Why can't ordinary people who love television make some changes
of their own?
</P>
<P>
   Why can't we bend the ears of people like Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, the Democrat from Connecticut who is always ranting
about TV content, or even Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican
who spent much of his time battling the TV industry before running
for president?
</P>
<P>
   Let's go to them with the same kind of moral outrage as the
conservative watchdogs who want to tell us what we can or can't see
on TV. Let's work up some anger and demand action on a number of
things that we think stink about TV.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a short list:
</P>
<P>
   _ No more wacky neighbors! That's such a hackneyed premise,
let's mandate it out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   _ We want 22 or 24 straight episodes _ no reruns!
</P>
<P>
   _ We've seen a dramatic increase in the last 10 years of
smart-ass kids and we've had enough. We want laws that say children
on television can't have all the answers, can't be smarmy and can't
act like they're 35.
</P>
<P>
   _ Commercials are too loud! We want a mandatory device in all
televisions that automatically lowers the grating voice of TV
announcers when hawking products.
</P>
<P>
   _ We will go to advertisers and demand that they pull
advertising from networks that don't send us free popcorn!
</P>
<P>
   Righteous indignation shouldn't be reserved for those people
with closed minds and petty First Amendment objections. Maybe this
is the answer. Fight stupidity with equal, but more amusing,
stupidity. And perhaps politicians used to knee-jerk reactions
meant to mollify the very loud will feel abused, as they should,
and tell everyone to go home and get a life.
</P>
<P>
   And once there, watch TV if they so desire.

&HT;     FAT IS ONLY IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just when people start telling me I'm losing
weight, I find out I also may lose my protected status. San
Francisco is banning discrimination against fat people, and I don't
know if I'm one of them.
</P>
<P>
   According to my wife, I'm fat. Maybe I'll hire that Sock
Puppet's lawyer and sue her skinny butt.
</P>
<P>
   According to my mirror, I'm average, middle-sized and not all
that bad looking in the right light. I can't sue anybody looking
like this, so there's only one thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   I'm forming the California Association of the Not So Bad,
Average and Mediocre (CANSBAM), and we're putting on our Hush
Puppies and tassel loafers and marching on the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   We demand our right to remain the way we are, and we're not just
talking about our weight _ which isn't all that much with our shoes
off.
</P>
<P>
   The average rule. Mediocrity is a way of fitting in. Ordinary is
underrated. The median is the message.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Roman Hruska said when Nixon wanted to appoint Harold
Carswell to the Supreme Court, ``The mediocre deserve
representation too.''
</P>
<P>
   They sure get it on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, but
somehow the board hasn't voted to protect its own interests.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to trivialize the problems of fat people, because
they're my problems too, at least according to the one nearest and
dearest to my cholesterol-speckled heart.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you expect? As an average San Francisco scribbler
feeling a little below average this week, the Board of Supervisors
presented me with a topic too hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the supervisors have voted to protect tropical
hardwoods, the Burmese people and San Francisco's two daily
newspapers, and look at all the good that's done.
</P>
<P>
   Now the supervisors want to protect the fat, but if I were fat
(and my wife thinks I am) I wouldn't expect much.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still be treated poorly at work, if you can get a job.
But nobody will tell you that you're overweight, just that you're
underqualified.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still get lousy tables in restaurants. You'll still be
jammed into airline seats that are too small for you.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we average people are jammed into airline seats that
are too small for us, so we know what you're up against. When you
sit next to us, we really know what you're up against. Us. And it
isn't your fault.
</P>
<P>
   My larger friends and relatives have told me about the reproving
or disgusted looks they get from the thin. I know thin people even
say rude things about heavy people's weight.
</P>
<P>
   I know a little about how that hurts, because I get those
comments from a thin person who lives in my own home, and I'm not
even chunkily challenged, when I suck it in.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you'll still be ridiculed, and with fake politically
correct phrases like ``the big and proud'' or ``the
other-metabolismed.'' Language reform hasn't led to thought reform,
just more ways to insult people.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with ``fat,'' and don't worry about the idiots who stare
or call you names. Just worry about your health.
</P>
<P>
   Being average and ignored has its down sides, too, although
nobody listens when you protest about it.
</P>
<P>
   Stigma has a way of sticking around, and human resources
departments find new ways to tell you they're sorry, but you're not
the right fit for the job. What liberation movements do first is
change the attitudes of those being liberated, and that eventually
starts changing others' attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   No, wait. What happens first is that the Board of Supervisors
passes a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The time will come when making jokes about fat people will be
just as unacceptable as making jokes about women, gays, people of
other races, blondes, priests and rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't all that encouraging a thought, is it? The
supervisors aren't making as much headway against intolerance as
they'd like.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco already bans discrimination in housing, employment
and accommodations on the basis of race, religion, age, gender
identity, disability and place of birth.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good thing, but most of those are readily defined
categories. If the city ends up banning discrimination against the
fat, someone is going to have to pull out those depressing ideal
height and weight charts you always see in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   They're always so different, and they always tell me that at my
weight I'm 7 feet tall. So maybe it's good that height also is
being added to the list of protected characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   But I know what I am, average, ordinary and not so bad. In San
Francisco, people like that are often treated as if they are
subhuman, or from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   We need protection from discrimination, too, even if we are an
unspecial interest group.
</P>

LOVE BUG TRANSMOGRIFIES INTO MOTHER'S DAY MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN MAX   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The love letter computer virus that ravaged email systems around
the world on Thursday morphed into a phony Mother's Day gift order
message on Friday, complicating efforts to control the latest
Internet communications scourge.
</P>
<P>
   F-Secure, a Finland-based computer antivirus company that helped
to identify the ILOVEYOU virus on Thursday, said it was now
appearing on email systems as a Mothers Day order confirmation for
diamonds, and would continue to generate offspring under different
email subjects until completely eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   Mikko Hypponnen, manager of antivirus research at F-Secure, said
there are already four versions of the virus in circulation and
that he doesn't see an end to the rampage in the near term. The two
other versions include a Lithuanian version of the love letter
virus, and an email with the subject ``Joke'' and an attachment
``Very Funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mother's Day version of this worm is quite cunning,''
Hypponnen said. The Mother's Day virus is similar to the love
letter virus in the way it operates but deletes files that allow
users to reboot their computers.
</P>
<P>
   All versions of the virus can erase files, steal email addresses
and passwords, and replicate themselves. The speed of its spread on
Thursday stunned computer virus experts and debilitated major
corporations by forcing them to restrict email communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of clever social engineering,'' said Roger
Thompson, technical director of malicious code research ICSA.net, a
computer security firm. ``People will say, `By god, I didn't spend
that much on my gift' and click on the link.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson thinks that whoever wrote the virus got lucky by
hitting a large corporation with a large address book to use for
replication early in the bug's life.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who is involved in the hunt for the originator of the
bug believed to be in the Philippines, said he is closing in and
hopes to find the cyber-terrorist soon.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that installed an antivirus line of defense yesterday,
he said, will be protected against the new strains.
</P>
<P>
   When a user clicks on the email message, from Microsoft's email
software, Microsoft Outlook, the robbery begins. The Internet
browser is then directed to steal passwords for Windows log-in and
remote access for Windows then sends the passwords to an account in
the Philippines. The perpetrators can later use those passwords to
get back into the organization from which they came.
</P>
<P>
   The virus isn't finished yet. Next it sends copies of the
passwords to everybody in the company's stolen email address book
so that all users within the organization have access.
</P>
<P>
   Then it goes to the hard drive and overwrites copies of files
with the virus. In particular, graphics files called JPGs and music
files called MP2s are overwritten and the originals are lost.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it infests itself in Internet relay chat software
called MIRC 32, one of the most popular chat applications, so that
anyone who communicates with the person affected will themselves
become infected.

ROCKET ATTACKS CONTINUE ALONG ISRAEL-LEBANON BORDER

   Lebanese guerrillas and the Israeli military traded rocket fire
and air strikes Friday in their worst fighting in nearly a year,
prompting immediate concern and calls for calm from Britain, France
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sounded defiant. But later in the day, the Israeli
Cabinet decided against further retaliatory strikes because no one
had died or been seriously injured in Friday's attacks, Israeli
television reported.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which have escalated since Wednesday, have jarred
the region as Israel's July 7 deadline for a withdrawal from its
self-declared buffer zone in south Lebanon approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was the worst since June, when Israeli strikes
caused severe damage in Lebanon and killed eight civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest attack, the Shiite Muslim guerrillas of Hezbollah
fired a barrage of rockets at the northern Israeli border town of
Kiryat Shemona. Residents had just begun emerging from shelters
after another barrage on Thursday, and the streets were crowded
with shoppers for the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli soldier was wounded by shrapnel, Israel Radio said,
raising the toll in the two days of rocket attacks to one soldier
killed and five people wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is trying to dislodge
Israeli troops and their allies from southern Lebanon, launched its
hour-long attack on Kiryat Shemona and another settlement in
response to Israeli air strikes on Lebanon early Friday morning.
Those Israeli strikes, in turn, were retaliation for a guerrilla
attack on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli warplanes bombarded two power stations and a guerrilla
arms depot. Large areas were plunged into darkness, and power was
cut to Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city. The blasts rattled a
northern suburb of Beirut, where a major power substation is
located. A strike also blew open a crater in the Beirut-Damascus
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, after visiting Kiryat Shemona
Friday, justified the attack, telling reporters, ``No country can
accept its residents being targeted by bombs and make no
response.'' Barak has been under pressure from right-wing leaders
and some northern Israeli community leaders to order an immediate,
large-scale bombardment of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement about its attacks released in Beirut, Hezbollah
said: ``We are firm today to defend our people, our country and the
infrastructure. So we fired barrages on Kiryat Shemona and Shlomi
settlements. We warn the Zionist enemy against continuing in the
rape of Lebanon, because we are going to respond and confront it.''
</P>
<P>
   A special envoy of the U.N. secretary-general, Terje
Roed-Larsen, was in Lebanon to discuss Israel's promised pull-out
after 22 years in southern Lebanon. ``Any attacks against any
civilians are unacceptable,'' he said. ``Such actions are
particularly unhelpful at the present time.''
</P>
<P>
   France called for an early meeting of an international
monitoring committee for south Lebanon, which it and the United
States chair. The British foreign office appealed for restraint on
both sides.

&HT;     REPORTS SAYS HOMES LESS AFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RICHARD PAOLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco is the least affordable county in
California for homebuyers, according to a real estate association
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly affordability index, released by the California
Association of Realtors, compares median household income with
median home prices. Its percentile results show what portion of
wage earners at the median income level can afford to buy a home in
various counties.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, where the median income is $72,400 and the
median home price is $420,000, the affordability index is 12
percent, according to the survey. A year ago, it was 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide level of 31 percent is the lowest in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time housing affordability was this low was in June
1992, when it was 30 percent,'' said Richard F. Gaylord,
association president. ``The median price of a home, which rose to
an all-time high of $238,870 in March, coupled with rising mortgage
interest rates, is putting home ownership out of reach for many
families in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the bottom of the affordability index are two other Bay
Area counties _ Contra Costa and San Mateo _ both ranked at 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, San Diego County was the least
affordable, at 25 percent, followed by Orange County at 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, affordability was 37 percent. Ventura
County had an affordability index of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance of affording a house is in the state's high
desert region, northeast of Los Angeles, where the affordability
index was 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Mabel Teng, who heads the Board of
Supervisors' housing and social policy committee, said creating
more ways for first-time buyers to be able to afford mortgages and
finding ways to build moderate-rent apartments, are vital to
maintaining housing stock in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to preserve housing and rental stock because we
can't stop the increase in real estate prices. At the same time, we
have to expand the opportunities for affordable housing for the
first time buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   What Teng proposes is using a $100 million bond measure ``to
leverage even more money'' from the city and banks for first-time
buyers to tap for mortgages and to finance construction or
rehabilitation of buildings for rentals.

&HT;     HANDS-ON FARMERS' MUSEUM OFFERS ESCAPE FROM THE WIRED WORLD

   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ High-speed computers and electronics can
bring the world to your fingertips. But a visit to the Farmers'
Museum in Cooperstown can take you back in time to rural
19th-century America, where life was a hands-on experience. Here
you can discover the tradespeople who practice crafts of the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Paper-Staining Manufactory, master wallpaper
printer Wendy Weeks makes wallpaper by hand on the only working
press of its kind in North America, dating to the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Farmers' Museum became the first
manufacturer of documented reproduction early 19th-century
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   The wallpapers, featuring patterns borrowed from the collections
of American museums and historic sites, are thoroughly researched
and are made using authentic distemper paint formulated by hand at
the manufactory from chalk, pigment, water and historic tools.
</P>
<P>
   Color variations are made only for documented colors, Weeks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part of the job is the research, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records were not often kept back then, like they are today,''
Weeks said. ``Also, a lot of craftsmen keep what they did a trade
secret, keeping it all in their heads and never writing any of it
down. This is a constant process of trial-and-error and dedicated
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks went to France for much of the research. She said Chris
Ohrstrom, a paint and wallpaper researcher, and Don Carpentier, a
craftsman and architectural historian, were the driving forces
behind the Farmers' Museum program.
</P>
<P>
   A pagoda pattern found at the Marblehead Historical Society in
Massachusetts that came from the Jeremiah Lee mansion in Marblehead
was reproduced by Weeks for an upstairs bedroom in the Payton
Randolph House at Colonial Williamsburg. Weeks has also made
wallpaper for the Carlyle House Historical Park in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commissions take about 18 months to complete,'' Weeks said
during a recent demonstration. ``Although we don't have the ability
to mass-produce historic wallpapers for sale, we will do our best
to replicate a damaged pattern or for a specific historic
commission. In this way, we also learn about the printing process
for yet another historic pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   The 23-inch-wide wallpapers made at the manufactory are made in
18-foot lengths of handmade cotton fiber paper, half the length of
the standard English papers. The room in a converted creamery on
the museum property where the paper is made is only 20 feet long,
so the length of the rolls is limited.
</P>
<P>
   A two-color roll costs $160 and will cover 34.5 square feet.
Weeks said the price is based on the printing design block, which
costs about $1,000 to make, plus materials and labor.
</P>
<P>
   In the labor-intensive process, the lengths of the handmade
cotton rag paper are first joined by animal hide glue and polished
with a smooth stone to seal the seams, to form a roll of wallpaper,
standard practice in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The roll of paper is then placed on a long table to be painted
with a base color of distemper. For health and safety reasons, the
museum uses substitutions for highly toxic compounds used in early
American pigments, while maintaining accurate color.
</P>
<P>
   Base color is applied in a traditional manner using a two-knot
natural bristle brush, which looks like two mid-size brushes
clamped together side-by-side in one grip. This creates the same
hand-rendered irregularity characteristic of the work of early
paper.
</P>
<P>
   After the base color is dry, the papers are imprinted with
hand-held pattern blocks on a facsimile press and water-box inking
sieve that are accurate scale copies of the originals.
</P>
<P>
   An artist draws the patterns for the blocks from the original
paper design, Weeks said. ``We use end grain for delicate work,
because when the design is carved that way, it doesn't chip as
easily,'' she said. The face of the block is then soaked in water
so that the paint isn't absorbed and will release onto the paper
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Every engraved pattern block is made from two to three layers of
hardwood, that are glued in a crisscrossed fashion, to prevent
warping and to hold up under the pressure of the printing process.
When printing the design repeat, the block is precisely placed on
the paper, matching it up to registration marks. A large, long
wooden lever is lowered on the block to ensure an even transfer of
paint from the block's surface.
</P>
<P>
   This process is repeated along the length and width of the paper
for as many colors and design elements as required, with a drying
time in between each new color.
</P>
<P>
   Because the distemper paint is water-based, the papers cannot be
washed. Sealer can be used over the paper once it is installed.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult reproduction to date for the Farmers' Museum
was a French pattern featuring 10 colors and 27 blocks. Weeks and
her assistants made 65 rolls for a private historic home in
Virginia.

</P>
<P>
   Historic reproduction handmade papers dating from 1790 to 1835
are also used to cover handmade one-of-a-kind bandboxes, which are
sold in the museum's General Store.
</P>
<P>
   The bandboxes, which are made in the manufactory, come in five
different patterns (using four-block patterns and four-block border
patterns) and five oval sizes ranging in price from $25 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   Bandboxes were very popular in the United States between 1820
and 1845, when travelers used them to carry accessories such as
hats, trinkets and shirt collars.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days prior to cardboard boxes and plastic containers,
these decorative boxes were also used to store items at home,''
said Weeks. ``These colorful containers were produced in a variety
of shapes and sizes and were often sold in `nests' of three or
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Early bandboxes were made by individual craftsmen and women, as
well as wallpaper manufacturers and hangers, to use up wallpaper
remnants.
</P>
<P>
   Historic bandboxes were covered with trimmed repeating sidewall
or wide border papers, Weeks explained. Single, repeating scenes
were developed specifically for use on bandboxes by 1830. Popular
themes included mythology, patriotism and national or natural
history.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the stacking set of five bandboxes, the
manufactory has begun a Special Series Collector's Box, featuring a
single repeat scene. The Squirrel Box, a scene pattern set on a
blue or yellow background, is from the collection of the New York
State Historical Association dating from 1830.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the museum will launch the second bandbox in the
series,
</P>
<P>
   ``Clayton's Ascent.'' The scene commemorates the record-breaking
350-mile hot-air balloon ride, from Cincinnati to western Virginia,
made by Richard Clayton on April 8, 1835. It has been reproduced in
its original colors. Clayton's balloon was elaborately decorated by
Jean-Baptiste Reveillon, an unrivaled French paper-stainer.
</P>
<P>
   Each bandbox begins with a wooden template, which is used for
cutting pieces of acid-free rag board. The acid-free boxboard
ensures that the handmade wallpaper will not discolor or be
degraded by wood fiber acid. The pre-cut sections of rag board are
hand sewn into their oval shape with linen thread, then precisely
fitted with a finished wallpaper, which is glued in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boxes are lined with newspaper hand-printed on foolscap (a
forerunner of today's newsprint) on an early 19th-century
letterpress in the print shop building here on the grounds of the
Farmers' Museum,'' Weeks said. The newspaper lining is a
reproduction of broadsheets from Cooperstown's local weekly
newspaper, The Freeman's Journal. Each box is finished with an
American Paper-Staining Manufactory label.

&HT;     `BASKET' LACKS A FULL-COURT PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its mild anti-war/anti-discrimination message and upbeat
David-and-Goliath climax, ``The Basket'' scores a few points as a
well-intentioned, nicely shot family film. As a history lesson
about rural America during World War I, it's earnest and
kid-friendly _ also simplistic and dramatically creaky.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers were likely inspired by Michael Anspaugh's
``Hoosiers,'' with its theme of an outsider using basketball to
bring needed change to a close-knit and troubled community. In
``The Basket,'' the setting is the wheat-farming town of
Waterville, Wash., in 1918. The outsider is teacher Martin Conlon
(Peter Coyote), a Bostonian with cosmopolitan views and a working
knowledge of the then-young game of basketball, which he learned
directly from its inventor, James Naismith.
</P>
<P>
   Also newly arrived are two young German orphans (Robert Karl
Burke and Amber Willenborg). It's a scary time for them: America is
at war with their homeland, and a local boy has returned badly
wounded from the conflict. Tensions are also high because the town
is struggling economically. The Germans become targets for bullying
and general ill will.
</P>
<P>
   The town is clearly in need of spiritual doctoring, so the
teacher begins punctuating classroom lessons with opera excerpts
that pique the interest of all but the most biased _ it's a German
opera (created for the film, by the way). Director Rich Cowan
offers a running joke in which the townspeople catch each other up
on plot developments of this elaborate work, which has violence and
sexual intrigue but also an unsubtle message. ``It's a story about
what war does to all of us,'' Conlon says.
</P>
<P>
   He also tries to build esprit de corps by introducing his
students to basketball. The game is new enough that players are
called ``goal-tossers'' and the hoop is a fruit basket. His methods
earn the hostility of the wounded boy's father (Jock MacDonald), an
angry, rigid farmer, but win sympathy from the farmer's wife (Karen
Allen, a welcome presence who deserves a more complex role).
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Conlon wins everyone's support by offering to coach
the local hoopsters in a match against an experienced team from
Spokane, in hopes of winning funds for a new harvester to be shared
by the hard-pressed farmers. Late in the day, a few surprises are
tossed in about Conlon's background, but they finally feel like
heavy-handed attempts to flesh out the character.
</P>
<P>
   The story is worked out schematically in the style of television
movies and Saturday-afternoon specials, but the sincerity of the
filmmakers, the generosity of their message and the overall decent
performances make partial amends for the hokiness and shortcomings
in the plot and characterizations.
</P>
<P>
   Cinematographer Dan Heigh does a creditable job of capturing the
isolation and stark beauty of the wheat fields, creating images of
hard-times farm life that are haunting enough to give the picture
some illusion of depth.

   QUINCY, Mass. _ It is time for Judi Vankevich's manners class,
and the students file in and take their seats. Vankevich, who
believes in setting a good example, is making eye contact with
every student and saying thank you to everyone for coming.
</P>
<P>
   On today's schedule is how to behave at your own birthday party.
Vankevich poses a hypothetical question. What if you open a present
and discover you have the exact same toy already?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you say, `This is dumb, I have one?' '' she asks the 11
students, ages 3 to 11, in mock horror.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't. ``You say, `This is soooo great, I love
it.' '' Next lesson: How to clap your hands the right way and
return things after you've borrowed them.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, a class like this would have been
unimaginable. But that was before the concept of dignified behavior
became hopelessly retro, before the days of children neglecting to
thank their grandparents for Christmas gifts and showing up in
school in belly shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in response to a growing sense of horror among parents and
educators over the pervasive boorishness of young people in public
settings, classes like Vankevich's are springing up around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum goes far beyond table settings and thank-yous and
takes a page out of the old schools of decorum and comportment,
extending even into the self-esteem movement. The classes stress
such values as respect, empathy, and self-confidence. They
emphasize life skills not measurable by any MCAS tests, but vital,
the instructors maintain, if America isn't going to unravel in the
next generation into a sort of social anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Vankevich's four-week class in her living room, are
no-frills grass-roots efforts aimed, she says, at redressing the
fact that ``social IQ is very low today.'' A vivacious mother of
three and a former Paris fashion model, Vankevich, 38, teaches what
she thinks of as ``survival skills'' to children and teens because
of her concern about proper character development of American
children.
</P>
<P>
   At its most mundane manifestation, she says, poor manners mean
not bothering to take a phone message for Mom and Dad. At its most
troublesome, it's the trend toward violence in public schools. But
the common denominator is the decline in ``honesty and respect''
among youth today.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the keyword in her class _ repeated in Vankevich-written
rap songs and printed on handwritten laminated posters _ is
``honor,'' which she always enunciates as ``awe-ner,'' ``so they
feel a sense of awe in the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Honor your parents by coming when they call you. Honor your
friends by looking them in the eye when you thank them for the
birthday gift. Honor your table companions by not eating mashed
potatoes with your fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the more subtle, finer points. Never shake hands
like a ``dead fish.'' Look the person in the eye and shake hands
firmly. When you are thanking a relative for a gift of money,
``never say how much she sent you, because it's not important.
What's important is that she gave it to you with lots of love.''
There is a right way and a wrong way to interrupt your mother when
she's talking to someone else. (The right way is to put your hand
in her lap or on her arm to get her attention, and wait until she's
done.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this to be like an old-fashioned finishing school,''
Vankevich says.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Jojin, an elementary school principal in Connecticut,
emphasizes etiquette and manners because she wants it to be more
like an old-fashioned classical school.
</P>
<P>
   Jojin, who oversees the Norfeldt Classical Magnet School in West
Hartford, brings in guest speakers who discuss civility, lectures
students and staff on the importance of basic etiquette, and
sponsors a monthly musical ``classical cafe,'' where she stands at
the door in white gloves, greeting students in a receiving line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect good eye focus and a good handshake,'' she says. ``It
sounds so mundane, but it is really forgotten in so many homes. I
think these are life skills, and we need to bring them back. This
is so important for children's development. It directly reflects
back on their self-esteem and gives them the feedback that we are a
civilized world. When you read in magazines that there are
high-level executives who have to learn how to eat properly and the
art of conversation, it is scary to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Fox, author of ``Etiquette for Dummies'' (IDG Books
Worldwide, 1999) and president of the California-based Etiquette
Survival Inc., oversees consultants who run social etiquette
workshops in schools and other venues. Etiquette expert Dana May
Casperson of Santa Rosa, Calif., author of ``Power Etiquette: What
You Don't Know Can Kill Your Career,'' (Amacom, 1999) has developed
a program for Brownies troops culminating in a manners badge for
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   She has also taught manners courses in public schools and has
had ``teachers pay me out of their own salaries'' because they are
so desperate to have children improve their manners. ``They see
these kids every day,'' she says. ``Things have deteriorated
terribly. We have parents who don't know the rules either. They
were the '60s `me' generation that rebelled against tradition. Now
they're trying to establish authority with their children.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question is: Is it too late for things to change,
especially in a world where human contact is minimized by answering
machines and computers, where social decorum is considered alien,
if not out-and-out geeky, or where children address grown-ups by
their first names and using ``Mr.'' and ``Mrs.'' seems like a
peculiar anachronism?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is optimistic, including James B. Twitchell, author
of ``For Shame: The Loss of Common Decency in America'' (St.
Martin's Press, 1997) and a professor of English at the University
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any redressing of it,'' he says. ``Look at what
adults are inflicting on each other, such as using the cellphone
while we are on the train sitting next to someone. That's as
egregious a violation as when junior refuses to acknowledge an
elder.''
</P>
<P>
   But many parents are hopeful, including the ones bringing their
children to Judi Vankevich's class. ``I'm so excited about the
concept,'' says Debbie Toomey, a nurse whose 6-year-old son,
Phillip, comes to manners class. ``My husband and I feel it's
important for our boys to be healthy and into academics and sports,
but it is also important for them to have manners because, these
days, it is those people who stand out in a crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son ``loves the class,'' she says. ``He practices at home
and corrects me, at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Murphy, 11, loves it, too. She thinks her manners are
pretty good, in general, but the class ``reinforced'' some of the
basics, such as how to set a table.
</P>

NO SHORTAGE OF GOSSIP AT YALE REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World's Second Greatest University is much on my mind as I
prepare for my 25th Yale reunion later this month. I wonder if true
Blue Henry Becton, top dog at WGBH, will be with his class? I'd
like to congratulate him on surviving Monicagate. I refer to Boston
Herald writer Monica Collins' revelations of trumpery and fraud in
'GBH's wildly successful ``Antiques Roadshow'' program. This is the
third time in two years Henry has weathered a major public
relations debacle _ good show! But I digress.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, all is not well at W2GU. President Richard Levin has
announced the first convocation of the University Tribunal for the
purpose of stripping a faculty member's tenure. The teacher in
question is Antonio Lasaga, a geochemist and the former master of
Saybrook College. Lasaga will be sentenced later this month on
federal child pornography charges, and is also facing trial for
sexual assault in state court. He has been on leave _ Yale won't
say if he's being paid _ ever since his arrest in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it's a big deal when a major university moves
to strip a faculty member of tenure. Lasaga has the right to choose
a Yale Law School professor to mount a defense before the tribunal,
and I'm told that he will do so. But losing his livelihood is less
important than losing his freedom, which will probably happen on
May 22. Sentencing guidelines for his crime call for a minimum 11
years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In a less somber case, Yale students have been rallying to
protest the firing of popular history professor Lee Blackwood,
whose contract was not renewed. The reasons given, according to the
Yale Daily News, were faculty ``concern over his dissertation's
lack of promise as a book and over his professional service to the
department and the University.'' But even Blackwood allows that his
irreverent, occasionally bizarre behavior contributed to his
downfall.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of hostilities between himself and the history
department graybeards, he delivered a lecture on decolonization as
``Leeanne Blackwood,'' while wearing lipstick and a dress. ``Some
of my colleagues insist in calling me a wacko,'' he told his
students. ``I think that this will give them something more
substantive to address.'' ``People had started to question my
sanity in a very vicious way,'' is how Blackwood explained his
action to me. While he is pursuing an appeal of his contract
termination, he is also considering alternative employment. ``This
whole affair has made me reconsider whether I want to be an
academic,'' he says.

   The hilarious but unreliable Taki Theodoracopulos contributes an
amusing account of his recent visit to Boston in the April 22
London Spectator. (An issue also distinguished by scientific proof
of Jesus' ascension into heaven, attributed to unusual combinations
of thermal updrafts in the Middle East 2000 years ago.) Taki was a
guest of Boston University's Claudio Veliz, who organizes the
unintentionially comic ``Conversazioni,'' ponderous group
discussions peopled by self-styled illuminati, like _ gasp _
Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   No trip to Veliz-land is complete without an homage to the Great
Dictator, Augusto Pinochet, whom the courtly Chilean expat has
saluted at previous meetings. (TGIF, Dec. 4, 1998) So Taki was
treated to ``a video of the Chilean armed forces parading on 19
September, the national day, and saluting the greatest of them all,
General Augusto Pinochet.'' What fun! Taki then heaps praise on the
BU wine cellars and his hosts: ``The chancellor, John Silber, and
the president, Jon Westling, were delightful fellows, and they've
done a hell of a job recruiting some very good people.'' The only
example Taki comes up with is right-wing crackpot Joachim Maitre,
whose name the peripatetic hack misspells, a mistake perhaps
attributable to weekly deadline pressure.

   Even though he went to Yale _ and played football, no less _ I
love Elisha Cooper's watercolor travel books. He's an old-fashioned
writer/painter/explorer who sketches and comments on the
new-fashioned world. He did ``A Year in New York,'' moved to
Berkeley, and has now produced ``California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a year driving around the state and went to some
pretty cool places,'' Cooper reports on his Web site,
elishacooper.com, including ``Yahoo, the Castro, Chez Panisse, a
Fresno cattle ranch, a Silicon Valley startup, the big wave spot
Mavericks.'' He looks in on the West's Greatest University _ ``At
first I mistake Stanford for a corporate headquarters . . . you can
almost smell the endowment'' _ and even attends a Jerry Brown
morning clergy breakfast. Oakland mayor Brown on the subject of
change: ``It's no time to cool off. It's no time for `the
intoxicating drug of gradualism.'''

`UP AT THE VILLA' EVOKES '30S ITALY WITH STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
UP AT THE VILLA 
Directed by: Philip Haas 
Screenplay by: Belinda Haas (novella: W. Somerset Maugham) 
Starring: Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James
Fox, Jeremy Davies, Derek Jacobi, Massimo Ghini 
Running time: 115 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Up at the Villa,'' which traverses the same shaky upper-crust
ground as ``Tea with Mussolini,'' has a rueful worldliness that the
earlier film, entertaining as it was, lacked. Which is another way
of saying that the husband-and-wife filmmaking team of Philip and
Belinda Haas has succeeded in transferring to the screen the
brittle, acerbic tone of W. Somerset Maugham. More important, they
also nail the more elusive romanticism beneath Maugham's world
view, heavy-laden with experience, more familiar than it wanted to
be about betrayals.
</P>
<P>
   As a genteel but impoverished British widow residing at a
borrowed villa on the outskirts of Florence in 1938, Kristin Scott
Thomas rights herself nicely after the faltering ``Random Hearts.''
Which is to say she projects an almost gallant poise as a woman
betwixt and between. Hers is a life up for grabs, as, indeed, she
herself is. The question is whether she'll do the sensible thing
and opt for security by marrying James Fox's career diplomat, who
has known her for many years, or take a flyer with Sean Penn's idle
but appealingly dangerous ne'er-do-well.
</P>
<P>
   While Scott Thomas delivers the kind of idiomatic performance we
expect of her, and Anne Bancroft has a field day with the role of
an imperious American principessa by marriage, sending wave after
wave of charm and shrewdness curling over the film like surf, it's
Penn who proves the bonus here. Although he remains the best actor
of his generation, and nothing he encompasses is surprising, it's
just that we've never seen him do one of these between-the-wars
dinner-jacket roles. Projecting savvy and a confidence that always
stays controlled, his disreputable American here is Bogart-worthy _
cynical yet capable of generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Thomas convinces us she feels an inner turmoil at doing
the sensible thing. It's almost as if we can hear heavy iron gates
clang shut in her mind at the thought of marrying the kindly but
dull diplomat. Maugham had a way of keeping the possibility of
romance alive even though he also made clear that he was convinced
it usually would lead to disaster. It's a conflict kept very much
alive here, nudged in the direction of romance, intensified by
collective uneasiness arising from the political storm about to
break.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst here is a desperate Austrian refugee (Jeremy
Davies) who mistakes a night of charity sex with Scott Thomas as
something more and commits suicide in her bedroom after returning
the next night and being told he has no future with her. Since she
can't call on any of her respectable friends for help, she calls
upon Penn's suave lounge lizard, who she turned down the night
before in the film's best scene. The offhandedness with which he
implicates himself by becoming an accessory impresses her as none
of his smooth moves did.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the romantic in Maugham assumes that getting rid of a
corpse is the sort of thing that brings people closer, especially
as the fascist blackshirts are beginning to crack down on hitherto
cossetted foreigners. Massimo Ghini is the fascist heavy here,
leaning ever more crudely on all of them. And Derek Jacobi's
remittance man, known _ and ostracized _ by all, neatly personifies
the effeteness of the English who were about to find out just how
powerless they were.
</P>
<P>
   There's no tea here, but plenty of Mussolini, at least as an
ominous presence in Rome. ``Up at the Villa'' is a chamber romance,
in that there's nothing grand or sweeping about it, but it's got
all the style it needs to go with those glorious Tuscan settings.
The latter, incidentally, are more than backdrops. Between the
imposing classical structures and the steamrolling designs of the
fascist buildings, you can almost see why the Axis powers thought
they couldn't lose World War II. How could they? They had the
architecture, didn't they?

THROWN FOR A LOSS AT FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is a moment both simple and glorious. Rob Barry
cocks his legendary right arm. He makes his throw. The bag of
peanuts soars purposefully through the perfumed air of Fenway Park,
the plastic wrapper glinting in the stadium lights above.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughts, conversations, indeed, all of life, seem suspended
during this splendid flight. Fans, their mouths agape, stare upward
in shock. Grown men point toward the heavens. Children in Red Sox
jerseys shriek in unabashed delight.
</P>
<P>
   And as suddenly as it begins, it ends. The bag nestles into the
hands of a wanting spectator. The murmur of the ballpark resumes _
the crack of the bat, the strains of the organ, Barry's voice
barking out, ``Peanuts. Grab your peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Barry, in the very best sense, is Nuts, which is his
nickname as well as anything else. If you've been over to Fenway in
the last decade, if you've scored some good seats, you've seen him
ply his trade on a route he calls ``dugout to dugout'' as arguably
the best peanut hawker in these United States.
</P>
<P>
   But his glory days are at risk of coming to a premature end, and
not by his choosing. It's a predicament, in short, that should
shell shock (sorry) his legion of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have a gift. I have a cousin who can wiggle his ears
without moving another muscle in his face, and a college roommate
who could fit more than 40 grapes in his mouth at once.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Barry can throw peanuts. Good God, can he throw peanuts. He
can take a 7-ounce bag of those salted, dry-roasted beauties, fully
in the shell, and toss them 20, 30, even 40 rows up, hitting a
14-year-old fan square in the hands.
</P>
<P>
   He can stand below and toss a bag of nuts up into the roof
boxes, then catch the payment in his hat. He can hit a spectator
two sections away. Once, on July 10, 1994, he threw a bag across
the field, from the stands near one on-deck circle to the stands
near the other, in a bomb that caused an umpire's timeout and was
captured in a signed photograph that to this day adorns a wall of
the Baseball Tavern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll throw them as far as they want them,'' he says without
even a hint of cumbersome modesty. ``I make 200 to 250 throws a
night, and I'm in the lineup every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost. On Tuesday night, Rob Barry was pulled from the
game in the fifth inning. A boss who had shadowed his every pivot
and toss yanked him aside and sent him to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy stalks me,'' Barry, 33, says. ``He'll be hiding in
the stands. He'll say, `I don't want you throwing this stuff.' I
say to him, `Talk to me when I hit someone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It ends up, Aramark, the company that provides you remarkably
mediocre hot dogs and $4.50 cups of beer, has a rule, and that rule
prohibits vendors from throwing food around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no throwing of food products,'' says Deborah Albert,
an Aramark spokeswoman at the Philadelphia headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cups of Coke or boxes of Crackerjack, it's not
a bad idea, but some nitwit supervisor has decided it should extend
to Barry and his pillowy bags of peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lyons, Aramark's general manager at Fenway, is one of the
good guys in a city that doesn't have nearly enough of them and, in
that light, offered precisely no comment when asked why one of his
minions was trying to push Barry off his game.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons privately fears if he lets it continue, all his vendors
will mimic Barry, and soon enough you'll have a cotton candy spear
sticking through some young fan's eye and a cash settlement that
could cost the Red Sox Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he knows Barry's accuracy, knows what the fans
want, and knows there are no recorded cases of catastrophic injury
caused by a bag of peanuts. With Barry, he wants to look the other
way, but some of his overeager underlings won't.
</P>
<P>
   So Barry will continue making his tosses, glancing over his
shoulder, prepared at any minute to be jerked from the game. If it
happens much more, he says he'll retire.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years he's been a vendor, hustling to Fenway Park from
his job with the Department of Correction. His father worked at
Fenway for 45 years. Two sisters, beer servers, have given a total
of 44 years. Minor league and semipro baseball teams honor him on
special nights. He is featured on a NESN promotional tape. Men in
suits beg for his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I can't even do what I do best in my own park,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   All of which seems, of course, to be absolutely nuts.

QUESTION IN EUROLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That dull, distant, but unmistakable ``ka-boooom'' that echoed
across the Atlantic this week was not a sonic boom laid down by a
stray Concorde but the sound of the euro cratering.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 months old, the euro _ a currency introduced with much
backscratching and hand-clapping _ has encountered all of the
ailments associated with the newborn: colic, crankiness, inability
to digest its diet, and the sort of all-round weakness that is the
despair of the immediate, sleep-deprived relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Since inching up to $1.18 against the Almighty Bucko in its
first days as the currency designated to replace the gravel-voiced
German mark, the fractious French franc, the lollygagging Italian
lira, and eight more member nations' money, the euro has slid down
the piano keys to the far lefthand side of the keyboard, dipping
Thursday to a moody and meandering 88.45 cents against the
benchmark buck before burping up again a hair or two.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is still a virtual currency; the actual coins and paper
money won't start circulating till 2002. But the invention intended
to smooth out all the glitches and inefficiences in mainland
Europe's welter of currencies and exchange rates is used now to
settle business debts, contracts, stock trades, and most anything
else that can be done on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's slide makes the stuff Europe sells to America
cheaper, so in the long run, market share for the Europeans may
inch up in the United States. But when Europeans travel here, their
money is marked down by that 23 percent decline in the euro's worth
since it came into being with much fanfare on New Year's weekend 16
months ago. So all those German, French, and Italian tourists who
traipse over here for commencement season at Harvard, MIT, and BU
may be on shorter rations than usual.
</P>
<P>
   It's not ``sinking,'' claimed one German economist, it's
``floating.'' Of course, the difference between sinking and
floating can be important if you're on an inner tube in Boston's
Outer Harbor. But if you're buying stuff with dollars and only have
euros to pay, you're swallowing a lot of seawater.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-euro argument remains the same as it always was: In the
long run, the elimination of money-changing fees and commissions
and the efficiencies of creating a Europewide trading bloc larger
than the US market will win out. No doubt that will eventually come
to pass. Trends bottom out eventually. There is always solid
ground, even at the bottom of a very high cliff, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro can recover,'' Britain's ambassador to the United
States asserts. And Sir Christopher Meyer was undoubtedly on solid
ground when he maintained in a Globe interview Wednesday that ``we
should not regard this as a terminal condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Britain decided not to join the euro conversion on the
first round, and Britain's pound has waxed as the euro wanes, Meyer
said for his government that ``we genuinely support the euro in
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blair government made the decision two years ago to refrain
from jumping into the euro pool till Britain's economic cycle
coincided more decorously with mainland Europe's. The pound has
been rock-steady against the dollar, and Blair, who does not have
to call an election in Britain until May of 2002, has promised his
electorate there will be a referendum before John Bull scraps
sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair has never been euro-hostile in anywhere near the
fashion of Britain's Conservative Party, which has been rent badly
by its euroskeptic wing, which denounces any notion of cozying up
to the continent of Bonaparte, the Kaiser, and the Spanish dons.
With his opposition party fractured over the issue and some of the
big British papers controlled by Australian and Canadian
euroskeptics who try to be more British than the British, Blair
tiptoed away from the gaping euro manhole and decided to wait out
the initial birth pangs.
</P>
<P>
   Right now that looks like a shrewd move. Britain's economy is
going gangbusters, just like ours. The economic relationships
between the United States and the United Kingdom, Meyer recounted
accurately, ``are in an absolute golden boom period.''
</P>
<P>
   We are Britain's biggest foreign investor nation, just as they
are ours. ``And the money just keeps coming in from both
directions,'' Meyer said. In Massachusetts alone, ``the UK is
responsible for 30 percent of the foreign money invested.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part it has been economic progress, a big drop in
unemployment, and foreign investment in job-producing ventures that
have improved the prospects for peace in Northern Ireland despite
the current whiff of discord over the IRA's refusal to give up any
of its weapons cache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unemployment and poverty are the recruiting sergeants of
terrorism,'' Meyer said, but the traditionally high unemployment
rate in Northern Ireland is only 6 percent _ 3 percent less than
that of France. The big European economies are laboring under high
welfare costs, high taxes, and high unemployment rates relative to
the United States and Britain. Interest rate drops decreed by the
European Central Bank have been ``a great inflation stoker,'' said
Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   There are other clouds on the European horizon. Pulling US or
NATO troops out of Bosnia would be a mistake, he counseled, because
in the Balkans ``we are reasonably confident things will revert to
their previously barbarous state.'' But for Britain, as for the
United States, if not for Euroland, this is the economic golden
age.

MODERATES FEAR GORE COULD LOSE THE MIDDLE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat, is a
key supporter of Vice President Al Gore. But Breaux and some other
moderate Democrats are growing increasingly concerned about the way
Gore has rejected their views on Social Security reform, Medicare
and other major issues, while George W. Bush has been more
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's concern shines a spotlight on a little-noticed but
growing rift between Gore and some members of the moderate
Democratic Leadership Council, a group that Gore helped create. The
rift could be crucial because it centers on what many believe will
be the decisive factor of Campaign 2000: the candidates' ability to
attract support from the vast middle of the electorate that is
undecided about the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems Bush has tried to articulate the ideas on Medicare,
Social Security and education that the DLC has put out,'' said
Breaux, a member and former chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said he fears Gore could lose the presidential election
``if you can't somehow embrace these concepts. These ideas are
going to be the ideas that affect the outcome of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideas promoted by the DLC include a proposal by Breaux and
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska to partially privatize Social
Security, which has been backed in concept by Bush, but which Gore
this week called a ``risky scheme.'' Similarly, Gore has so far
declined to embrace the leadership council's proposal on Medicare
and parts of an education program. Bush, meanwhile, has viewed all
of those measures favorably.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, Gore wasn't nearly as concerned about the
so-called New Democrat agenda because he was locked in a fight for
more liberal party activists against former senator Bill Bradley.
Now the moderates are concerned that Gore is reflexively rejecting
ideas that are designed to appeal specifically to the wavering
center of the American voting public.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to the dismay of some leadership council leaders, Bush
has become a bigger proponent than Gore of parts of the group's
agenda. ``My take on it is that imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery,'' Breaux said. Asked whether Gore should back some the
measures, he replied, ``It depends on how much he wants to be
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, who met last week with Bush to discuss his Social
Security proposal, said that Gore has been too quick to dismiss the
plan to allow younger workers to put two percentage points worth of
the 12.4 percent Social Security tax into private investment
accounts. Bush has backed the Kerrey concept but so far has not
made his own specific proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the political rhetoric'' by Gore, ``this is the
progressive approach,'' Kerrey said. ``It would irresponsible not
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the New Democrats said they are still inclined to
back Gore because he is in tune with them on a greater number of
issues than Bush. But they stressed that they got involved with
organizations such as the Democratic Leadership Council because
they believe the party has been too solicitous of its liberal wing
and cannot win presidential elections unless it moves more
dramatically to the middle. The DLC played a major role in
providing ideas that were adopted by Bill Clinton and Gore when
they ran for the presidency and vice presidency in 1992, and again
in 1996. Many of the major programs advanced by the Clinton-Gore
administration came from the DLC agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway, while acknowledging that the vice
president has not signed on to some of the DLC's proposals, said
that Gore supports the organization's central goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DLC's fundamental issue is and has been fiscal
responsibility and Gore beats Bush on that hands down,'' Hattaway
said, noting that Gore plans to use some of the surplus to pay off
the national debt while Bush backs a major tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Gore adviser Elaine Kamarck, a co-founder of a DLC think tank,
disputed that the DLC and Gore are at odds. Instead, she said that
some DLC members are at odds with each other, especially on issues
such as Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Al From, the DLC president, wrote in the organization's magazine
recently that he was concerned that Gore would rely too heavily on
attacking Bush, instead of stressing his alternative vision. From
said that Gore couldn't assume that his roots as a moderate ``New
Democrat'' would be enough to win over moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that Gore will not be able to win the vital center by
pushing Bush to the right with a negative campaign,'' From wrote.
``He will need to affirmatively occupy the center himself. To do
that, he'll have to go beyond the New Democrat status quo and offer
a new generation of New Democrat ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has distanced himself from the DLC's proposal on
reforming Medicare, which Breaux says would encourage more
competition among private insurance companies. Bush, meanwhile, has
embraced the measure. Breaux, who chaired a commission on Medicare,
said that the issue is another example of how Bush has latched on
to a DLC idea.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, after the DLC published an education reform plan last
year, Bush announced a proposal that was ``remarkably similar,''
according to Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who
chairs the DLC. The proposal relied heavily on providing more aid
to localities, but with many strings attached to ensure that
schools were accountable for making progress. Just last week, after
much internal debate, Gore announced his own education
accountability plan, but he has stopped well short of backing the
DLC's full plan, a version of which is expected to be voted on by
the Senate next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, while stressing that he believes that Gore is ``the
real New Democrat,'' said: ``I suppose New Democrats should be
flattered that Governor Bush has reached out for the New Democratic
life preserveer as he tries to swimg back to the mainstream. Since
the primaries are over, he has obviously been trying to move back
to the center and are either ours exactly or are like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Blanche L. Lincoln, the moderate Arkansas Democrat who
is a member of the DLC, said she was heartened when Gore last week
began to talk about the need for accountability at schools that
receive federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had talked early about a revolution in education, but there
weren't really any of the words we needed to hear,'' Lincoln said.
``When he came out stressing accountability, that defintely
encouraged me to know he is not just going to walk that status quo
line in terms of education.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln said she hopes Gore will be a little more flexible on
Social Security as well. While Lincoln does not support the
Kerrey-Breaux plan, she does not rule out allowing a smaller
percentage of savings to be privately invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In negotiating something like Social Security, to ensure its
future, you have to be open-minded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, a central topic of the presidential campaign has
been whether Bush would be able to move to the middle, especially
after his move to the right during the primaries and his appearance
at the conservative Bob Jones University. Since securing the
nomination, Bush has spent week after week solidifying his moderate
credentials, highlighting his plans to improve education and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy appears to be working, according to an NBC-TV/Wall
Street Journal poll released this week. The survey showed Bush is
leading Gore by 50 percent to 35 percent among suburbanites and 43
percent to 37 percent among independents. Significantly, the poll
showed that Gore's lead among women has evaporated to only a
two-point edge, while Bush leads among men by 51 percent to 39
percent.
</P>
<P>
   To Breaux, those figures are danger signs that Gore should
interpret as a call to action on a moderate agenda. Referring to
the way Clinton criticized a controversial rap singer in 1992 in an
effort to appeal to moderate, Breaux said of Gore: ``He needs a
Sister Souljah moment.''

THOUGH LIGHTWEIGHT, YOU'LL STICK WITH `COMMITTED'

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
COMMITTED 
Written and directed by: Lisa Krueger 
Starring: Heather Graham, Casey Affleck, Luke Wilson, Goran
Visnjic, Alfonso Arau, Patricia Velasquez 
Running time: 92 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Krueger's ``Committed'' proves that Heather Graham can
carry a film, even when it stops pulling its own weight. How
committed is the dishy Graham's high-powered kewpie doll, Joline?
She's so committed to her marriage that she not only wears a ring,
but has one tattooed as well on her ring finger. Joline looks as
innocent as candy, but she's a coper. She doesn't bat an eye as one
thing after another threatens to unravel at the rock club she
manages. She sails through problems, so when her unworthy newspaper
photog husband (Luke Wilson) takes off after 597 days of marriage
in order to, as he so charmlessly puts it, ``find some space to get
out of the fog,'' she hits the road in search of him.
</P>
<P>
   So singleminded is Joline, and so capable, that she drives from
SoHo to El Paso to track him down. Never dreaming that her very
capability is what threatened the jerk and caused him to bolt, she
tempers her effectiveness with a saucer-eyed innocence that disarms
us into overlooking the fact that she's a stalker. When she catches
up with him, she's sensitive enough to hang back, content to be a
protective presence until he comes to his senses. That doesn't seem
likely to happen anytime soon. Still, it's such a sheer pleasure to
watch her cartwheel through various difficulties, including a
larcenous couple who think they can beat her up, that you forgive
the film for thinning out as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Lisa Krueger picks up some of the slack by
parading a string of eccentrics through the stalled action. These
include Alfonso Arau's Mexican medicine man and Patricia Velasquez
as the local woman on whom Joline's husband had been hitting in his
weaselly way. Even here, Joline comes through, bonding with
Velasquez's waitress and clobbering the waitress's jealous
truck-driver boyfriend, who tries to beat Joline's husband to a
pulp. Wilson is funny as the spectacularly unworthy husband. Casey
Affleck not only is funny in his way as Joline's vacant kid
brother, he's likable, too. After ``Drowning Mona,'' and now this
film, he could find himself cornering the market on sweet airhead
roles if he's not careful. Meanwhile, there's no escaping the fact
that ``Committed'' runs dry amid the cactus and sagebrush, but
Graham's cartoony take on angelic unstoppableness makes us not mind
so much.

`BOSSA NOVA' A BUOYANT TALE OF LOVE IN RIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BOSSA NOVA 
Directed by: Bruno Barreto 
Screenplay by: Alexandre Machado, Fernanda Young (novel: Sergio
Sant'Anna) 
Starring: Amy Irving, Antonio Fagundes, Alexandre Borges, Debora
Bloch, Kazuo Matsui, Alberto de Mendoza, Drica Moraes, Sergio
Loroza, Giovanna Antonelli, Pedro Cardoso, Stephen Tobolowsky 
Running time: 95 minutes 
Rated: R (language and some sexual content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's the bossa nova rhythms, maybe it's the buoyant
atmosphere of Rio de Janeiro, maybe it's the screenful of sunny
pilgrims clawing their way out of love limbo. Maybe it's all three.
Either way, ``Bossa Nova'' is one of the most warmly beguiling
romantic comedies the Southern Hemisphere has sent our way in ages.
Brazilian filmmaker Bruno Barreto has clicked before in this genre,
with ``Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands.'' That film was a sexy
fantasy. This film is sexy, too, but it's very much of this world.
The women characters here, most of them anyway, would be happy with
one husband, while the men are, if anything, even more eager to
change their single state.
</P>
<P>
   The film is radical in spotlighting as its main couple a pair of
over-40s. It's awfully easy to root for them. Maturity sits well on
Amy Irving (Barreto's wife) as a widowed teacher of English. Irving
has in the past seemed contained, even a little cold. But here
she's poised and savvy, projecting a becoming generosity and
openness to life as an English-language instructor named Mary Ann.
Her opposite number, Brazilian actor Antonio Fagundes, is a charmer
_ suave, dapper, courtly, in every way disarming, rendered doubly
appealing by being unafraid to project vulnerability. In the film,
he's figuratively licking his wounds after being dumped by his
wife, who has fallen for her much younger tai chi instructor.
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason Fagundes' Pedro Paulo looks pained. He's
slightly guilty about not following in the footsteps of his father,
a master tailor, especially as Pedro had displayed a youthful
talent for tailoring. But that makes it all the more sensual when
at one point he ends his self-exile from the scissors, runs his
hand lovingly across a piece of wine-colored material, and fashions
a garment for the pretty teacher who has caught his eye. He's able
to bring to his pothole-strewn pursuit of Irving a quality all but
unknown in Hollywood comedies _ namely, graciousness. To her
credit, Irving's character, who is interested and a little lonely
but not at all desperate, responds to his delicacy and
gentlemanliness.
</P>
<P>
   These happen to be precisely the qualities lacking in one of her
private pupils, Alexandre Borges' soccer star, who has to learn
English in a hurry because he's been traded to a British team. His
considerable love for himself is shared by Giovanna Antonelli's
pretty lawyer, which means Pedro Paulo's law office may be left a
little disheveled, to say nothing of Pedro Paulo's brother, who has
a crush on her. Adding to the amatory mixups is Drica Moraes as
Mary Ann's pal, a travel agent who has embellished the truth in
fostering an internet romance with a wild SoHo artist. When she
gets an e-mail announcing his imminent arrival in Rio, she goes
ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   With all those romantic strands flailing around, it doesn't seem
likely that they'll all be tied into a neat package by the end, but
most of them do. The sorting out of the various couples never gets
tedious and the bounce and sway of the movie's footwork is upbeat
and enticing. Barreto, Irving, Fagundes and the rest know what
they're doing. Besides, they've got the sun-drenched beachfront
streets of Rio itself, to say nothing of a Jobim soundtrack, on
their side. You've probably fallen in love before with Rio and its
vivaciousness at the movies. ``Bossa Nova'' will smile away your
defenses and make you fall in love with it all over again. It's a
spring vacation for the eyes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cotton Mary,'' the scary new Ismail Merchant, movie has a
pristine veneer for a few of its 123 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian nurse (Madhur Jaffrey) ingratiates herself into the
home of a visiting British family and cares for their newborn. When
mommy can't bring herself to feed her infant, the nanny's
handicapped sister secretly (Neena Gupta) plays wet nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The film has the kind of nonplused mein that Merchant's usual
partners, James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, can pull out of a
top hat while sleepwalking. But when Merchant is not producing
their joint ventures _ as his three solo features testify _ he
thinks beyond Victorian sexual repression and tidy class angst.
</P>
<P>
   Merchant is like the experimental guy in a supergroup who has
that one idea for a record that's just not right for the band.
``Cotton Mary,'' with its grotesquerie and post-colonial
nightmarishness, is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Alexandra Viets' from her play, the film is about a
British family living in India as some kind of poisoned paradise,
indulgent, hypocritical, lusting after that which is not like
itself. Merchant, though, turns the story into a freaky, campy
musing about an Indian nanny wreaking havoc on a household.
</P>
<P>
   The tag lines in the trailer could make this sound juicy: They
thought she looked like the perfect servant to watch their children
while they frolicked and fretted, cheated and idled, slurping up
all the spicy nectar in this scenic utopia. They were wrong. Terror
has a new name this spring. Say hello to ``Cotton Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   If the family in Curtis Hanson's ``The Hand That Rocked the
Cradle'' had half a mind to hire Whoopi Goldberg to help around the
house instead of Rebecca DeMornay, it may have come out something
like this: less sensational, but far more carnivalesque. Set in the
1950s, a few years after India reclaimed its independence from
Britain, the film purports to be a set piece about how tainted
Anglo-Indian relations warped both cultures. But it's really just a
lurid potboiler.
</P>
<P>
   John Mackintosh (James Wilby) is a multitasking aesthete who
transplants his pregnant wife Lily (Greta Scacchi), his daughter,
and loyal butler, Abraham (Prayag Raj), to India where he works as
a journalist and stage actor, flirting with whatever chicky happens
to be starring opposite him. Lily is in no condition to be a
sterling mother to her new daughter, and you're not sure whether
she's dismayed by her jolly husband's benign neglect or the
suspicion that the overly polite Indian midwife cast some kind of
spell on her during labor. She called herself Cotton Mary; she told
the annoyingly passive Lily about her white soldier father whose
picture she carries in a locket, and she kept insisting that this
new baby ``is a child of God, madam.'' Soon, she's in the
Mackintosh home, trying to get Abraham fired so she can hire her
temptress niece (Sakina Jaffrey).
</P>
<P>
   What lends ``Mary'' it's off-kilter sense of the bizarre is
Merchant's two-dimensional staging. The camera peers in on a scene,
then recoils, often clinically, to the other side of a room, as
though filming a play or as if reluctant to get terribly involved
with the proceedings for fear of contamination, either by Mary or
by Viets' very rudimentary story. But Mary's demons are the
province of her collapsing psyche and engorged aspirations of
becoming white, Lily white, no less. Jaffrey plays it like Anna
Magnani in a David Lynch telefilm. Her Mary is the cracked portrait
of deranged post-colonial dementia, hung in the biggest, broadest
frame you put on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   But did Merchant have to make her madness seem so illogically
soapy? It's as though, in documenting cultural queerness afoot, he
skipped the institution and went straight for the loony bin.

A HISTORY OF OUR EXPERIMENTS WITH CELIBACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN CLEGG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
A History of Celibacy 
Elizabeth Abbott 
Scribner, 493 pp., $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celibacy is a long dry season that comes by choice, chance, or
coercion. Laced with spirituality or sorrow, it has had many
adherents through time: Mary, Joan of Arc, Leonardo da Vinci,
Gandhi. It has linked mystics to God, kept women in their place and
allowed them to serve the exalted Oracle of Delphi. In the hands of
Elizabeth Abbott, a Canadian writer and academic dean at the
University of Toronto, it is the basis for a tart romp through
history that lets no one off the hook _ not even Abbott herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the world and the ages, celibacy has been a key
element of human existence,'' Abbott writes. ``In all its various
forms, it has shaped religious lives, as well as the lives of
laity, and its embrace has included the very young and the very
old. It has haunted widows and prisoners, and conditioned athletes
and shamans. It has pulsated throughout classical poetry and camp
literature, throughout canon and civil law.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than six years of research, Abbott found that if
celibacy is the flip side of lust, it is no less complex. She
abandoned her tongue-in-cheek working title (``The Kama Sutra of
Celibacy'') when she realized the overwhelming scope of her
project. Tossing aside traditional hair-splitting distinctions
between chastity, celibacy, and virginity, she organized her book
around patterns in ``humankind's celibacy experiments.'' From Greek
mythology to modernity, she finds, celibates are defined by what
they aren't; with deft wit and a slew of footnotes, she navigates
this universe of nots.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that the struggle with an elemental human drive
is central to the core of ritual and religion. Although Greek gods
were rapacious by nature, the three main goddesses _ Athena
(wisdom), Artemis (the hunt), and Hestia (the hearth) _ were
virgins. Celibacy was also a requirement for the earthly women who
served the oracle of Apollo's temple at Delphi. Urgent questions
about war and peace were submitted to a priestess, who responded in
verse.
</P>
<P>
   Pagan and Jewish asceticism were precursors to the Christian
institutionalization of celibacy, Abbott notes. It's clear that
she's ripping mad at her own Christian faith and its ``deadly logic
unleavened by the demographic concern that celibate Christians
cannot reproduce themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   She scrupulously documents the role of the celibate in Buddhism,
Jainism, and Hinduism, but returns to settle her own scores with
Christianity in a bitter-sounding epilogue. ``Celibacy's long
history cuts to the core of Christian doctrine, and its pernicious
portrayal of women and its fundamental misogyny caused me great
personal pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Abbott can employ nuance when she wants to do so.
Historically, she finds, celibacy has provided shelter for people
who didn't want to express outlawed sexuality. Da Vinci, the
Renaissance inventor with the millennial mind, hid much of his
personal life. In 1476, he and three other young men were charged
with sodomizing a male prostitute. After hearings and a long wait,
da Vinci was acquitted. But the gossip tormented him, and Abbott
believes that ``it is quite likely he actually earned his
reputation for perpetual chastity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Isaac Newton was probably a lifelong celibate, she writes,
who never consummated his great love affair with his longtime
companion, a male mathematician some 20 years younger. Newton's
thwarted love exerted its own gravitational pull on his scientific
creativity, and he lapsed into a grouchy depression.
</P>
<P>
   Celibacy has a modern face, as well, Abbott finds. Prompted by
personal ethics or frightened by the prospect of sexually
transmitted disease, some teenagers choose chastity. Anorexic girls
achieve chastity and a measure of control by starving off any
tantalizing curves.
</P>
<P>
   In her epilogue, Abbott comes clean. `` `So, are you for it or
against it?' people continually ask me. . . . I find this question
disconcerting.'' But she answers it, honestly and without excess
drama. When she began the book, she was not in a relationship. At
some point, however, circumstance got transmuted into choice. And
that, she concludes, is the point. ``As for so many others, in
history and in the present, the element of choice made all the
difference in how I experienced celibacy. Instead of burdensome and
frustrating, it now felt joyous and liberating.''

MASTERFUL `VIRGIN SUICIDES' A HAUNTING STUDY OF ADOLESCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE VIRGIN SUICIDES 
Written and directed by: Sofia Coppola 
Starring: James Woods, Kathleen Turner, Kirsten Dunst, Josh
Hartnett, Hanna Hall, Chelse Swain, A.J. Cook, Leslie Hayman, Danny
DeVito, Michael Pare, Jonathan Tucker, Robert Schwartzman 
Running time: 97 minutes 
Rated: R (strong thematic elements involving teens) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sofia Coppola's ``The Virgin Suicides'' is easily the filmmaking
debut of the year so far. It's an impressive, haunting, layered
work that's several things at once. It uses teen suicides as an
evocation of the acuteness of the outwardly circumscribed but
internally stormy lives of adolescent girls. It's also a metaphor
for the lifelong tug of adolescence well into adulthood, as we're
reminded by Coppola's way of framing the story as the recollection
of one of the boys transfixed by the girls then and now. Although
Coppola nominally tells the story from a male perspective, she
avoids the usual dumbness that goes with this vantage point in this
film that emerges as a triumph of tone. From start to finish
there's a shimmer of discovery about it _ our discovery of it,
Coppola's discovery of how much she can do.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's a feast of superrealist detail, it's anything but
realistic. Rather it's a fabulist reinvention of adolescence, with
everything heightened and much remaining mysterious. The film could
have gone the purely satirical route in examining something that
went terribly wrong in a Detroit suburb in the '70s. Looking back,
a grown male narrator revisits the year when he and his buddies
were fixated by five blond sisters whose parents, played by James
Woods and Kathleen Turner, are rigidly controlling and pitifully
obtuse. Each is an icon of disconnectedness. She's ferociously
protective. Her reaction to her daughters' vulnerability is barely
contained hysteria. He's simply beaten down, in full denial, hiding
behind the non-controversy of the laws of science, asking only to
be left alone as he passively fills his days as the nerdy high
school math teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is at her fire-breathing best, and we've never seen this
side of Woods in what I predict will stand as one of the year's
memorable supporting roles. He's the best castrated father since
Jim Backus' apron-wearing eunuch in ``Rebel Without a Cause.'' The
voyeuristic boys all are inscribed with remarkable rightness,
especially Jonathan Tucker as the one for whom the mythologized
connection to the girls becomes a piece of lifelong detective work,
Josh Hartnett as the high-school's self-aware babe magnet drolly
riding his coolness, and Jonathan Schwartzman as the group's
would-be stud, forever practicing his moves, most hilariously on
Turner's mom.
</P>
<P>
   But of course ``The Virgin Suicides'' must rise or fall on its
girls, and in this case it rises high. To those who haven't been
there, ``The Virgin Suicides'' is like a keenly observed dispatch
from a foreign country. The film wastes no time letting us know
that the 13-year-old (Leslie Hayman) is the first to go. When her
doctor (Danny DeVito) tells her that she isn't old enough to know
how bad life can get, she replies: ``Obviously, doctor, you've
never been a 13-year-old girl.'' She's not being ironic, this
summery little calla lily of a girl with a wiser-than-her-years
look in her eyes. She's serious. Which, of course, is part of the
problem _ and part of the film's rightness: Coppola never minimizes
the sisters' shared angst. Essentially, they're repressed into
excess, especially after their first tentative, exhilarating, yet
painfully self-conscious forays into sex and boys result in their
being yanked out of school and being placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Until mountains are moved and they make it to the prom, with
disastrous results for one of them, the pain and anxiety are mostly
felt by their mother, especially at the thought that she's going to
have to give up some control over them. When their mother reverses
herself and locks the girls in the house after making them get rid
of their record collections, they start devising ways of
communicating with the boys they know are watching them through
binoculars. The story, unfolding with dreamy inevitability, is
sophisticated and compassionate _ a mix of humor, dread, and rage
turned inward. One vignette, when Coppola's camera fixes on the
girls draped passively yet sullenly across the bed of one of them,
is as potent, as loaded with something about to break through its
frozen surface, as any superreal painting of the '70s or '80s. Like
her father, Coppola is an often painterly filmmaker. But she goes
places stylistically and emotionally that none of his films ever
got anywhere near.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst is the standout as the one who has most of the
lines and dimension in this exercise that deepens its impact and
its reverberations by avoiding facile explanations. Lux is the name
of her character. She seems partly composed of light _ an airy,
golden apparition, yet heavy with thwartedness until her yearning
and rage and confusion boil over. Coppola loads the screen with
vivid, pungent detail. Black humor explodes from her screenplay
like a string of little land mines, erupting from the film's pall
of unmade connections snuffing out all. When Turner's shattered,
blinkered mom says, ``There was always plenty of love in our
house,'' the line all but impales her as the unerringly assured
Coppola cuts between the self-obliterating girls and the
neighborhood's vanishing elm trees, power-sawed, one by one, into
stumps.

AFRICA `DREAMED' TEEMS WITH LIFE, YET FEELS TAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
I DREAMED OF AFRICA 
Directed by: Hugh Hudson 
Screenplay by: Paula Milne and Susan Shilladay (based on Kuki
Gallmann's book) 
Starring: Kim Basinger, Vincent Perez, Eva Marie Saint, Liam Aiken,
Garrett Strommen, Winston Ntshona, Daniel Craig, Lance Reddick 
Running time: 115 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (a scene of nudity/sensuality and some
violent/traumatic episodes) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like ``Out of Africa,'' with which it will inevitably be
compared, ``I Dreamed of Africa'' is based on the true story of a
European woman who learned how to fit into Africa. The story of
Kuki Gallmann could more accurately be called ``Into Africa.'' It
stars Kim Basinger in a visually arresting and at times involvingly
primal education in rewriting the rules of life. One character
after another keeps telling the new arrival from Venice that Africa
moves to its own rhythms and that she had better get used to it.
Something similar can be said of the film. It treats some powerful
experiences in refreshingly unromantic fashion, yet remains
frustratingly tepid.
</P>
<P>
   A number of grandly dramatic things happen to Basinger's
Gallmann, a single mom, after she marries a fellow survivor of a
car crash in the Italian countryside and journeys with him and her
young son to a magnificent but harsh new world in Kenya. Like Karen
Blixen's white lover in ``Out of Africa,'' Gallmann's husband,
played by Vincent Perez, is a decent fellow, but an often absent
one, trapped in macho patterns. This means that she's left to mind
the ranch and cope for weeks at a time with storms, wild animals,
poachers, and other incursions while he's off playing great white
hunter with his pals.
</P>
<P>
   What's good about Basinger's portrayal is her way of showing
hurt feelings and anger with her eyes, then determination with the
set of her jaw as she goes about fixing the generator or chasing an
elephant out of her vegetable garden. The film begins as a
meditation on her life in Africa, ushered in with an overhead shot
of Basinger's Kuki lying in bed, free-associating about the events
of her life. What's too often lacking, though, is the kind of
interior dimension promised by the image of her reflectiveness. ``I
Dreamed of Africa'' depicts its characters, but almost never seems
to really penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Kuki's story does not lack for eventfulness as her own
straightforward honesty wins her the respect of the Kenyan locals.
Proving her mettle again and again, she's easily the equal of her
husband in every way that counts and she wins as well the respect
of her mother, an aristocratic museum curator played by Eva Marie
Saint, who convincingly finds ways to allow maternal and
grandmotherly feeling to break through her exterior. Perez isn't
exactly a recessive presence, but he's clearly a secondary one in
this film, which knows enough to avoid seeming myopically
Eurocentric by respectfully portraying the Kenyans, ranging from
Winston Ntshona's old tribal chief to Lance Reddick's major-domo.
</P>
<P>
   There's passion here, and an engaging performance by young Liam
Aiken as the boy who plunges in and embraces his new life.
Basinger's longtime activism on behalf of animals makes for a
committed link to the real Kuki Gallmann's anti-poaching campaigns,
which have saved elephants and rhinos hunted for their ivory
throughout Africa, but no longer in her vicinity. The film about a
white family falling in love with Africa, and the corner of it they
bought and turned into a home, would appear to be out of step with
the times. Still, these lives were lived, and honorably, and this
film depicts them with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it never becomes the kind of cinematic experience you keep
hoping it will be. It's got magnitude, but little amplitude. One
can overlook the film's slow pace, but not its opacity or
disjointedness. While it's true that life isn't lived as a neatly
strung series of plot points, and while this film unflinchingly
faces some cruel parts of the story it depicts, it seems to
perversely resist all attempts to turn it into a cohesive dramatic
whole with a satisfying cumulative impact. ``I Dreamed of Africa''
plays like a string of journal entries waiting to be assembled into
the fully involving narrative you're convinced it can be, but isn't
here.

`GLADIATOR' FIRST BIG BLOODLETTING OF BLOCKBUSTER SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
GLADIATOR 
Directed by: Ridley Scott 
Screenplay by: David Franzoni, John Logan, William Nicholson 
Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver
Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Richard Harris, David
Schofield, John Shrapnel 
Running time: 150 minutes 
Rated: R (intense graphic combat) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as ``Jurassic Park'' dissolved the line between movies and
theme parks, ``Gladiator'' eliminates what may have been any
lingering boundary between movies and the World Wrestling
Federation. It's ``Spartacus'' on steroids. For all its lip service
to the principle of restoring Rome to the people after a twisted
son kills his emperor father and takes over, ``Gladiator'' is about
Russell Crowe and his good guys whacking away at the bad guys in
the Roman death pit known as the Colosseum. It's a joltfest that
showers upon us all the rolling heads, gushing blood and shattered
chariot parts you could hope for. In short, it epitomizes the kind
of high-profile bloodshed we now expect to herald the hazy, lazy,
blockbuster-fixated days of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Words like ``Gladiator,'' ``Battleship'' and ``Dinosaur'' in
their titles probably tell you all you need to know about this
summer's movies, with what to some is their reassuring suggestion
of big, heavy objects dropped on one's head from a great height.
``Gladiator'' plays like a wrestler being dumped in your lap as a
bonus for buying a ringside seat. Obviously, the bread-and-circuses
thing hasn't changed that much in a couple of millennia. Crowe,
director Ridley Scott and their legions throw themselves at the
spectacle thing with gusto and a generous budget, filling the
screen with countless togaed extras screaming their heads off, too
busy tracking the carnage to be bothered with boring details like
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' is more pumped up than ``Spartacus,'' but less
earnest. There was idealism in ``Spartacus,'' whereas the only
passion in ``Gladiator'' has to do with registering on the Richter
scale. Which, to give the film its due, it does, despite a
second-half dropoff in its energy level. I suppose it would be too
much to expect one of these sword-and-sandal epics to feel anything
like a human experience. Still, it's going to be huge despite its
old-style Hollywood solemnity between fights. The bouts are
frequent enough and brutal enough to keep kickass-minded audiences
in a thumbs-up mode, right from the start, when Crowe's general and
his army wipes out a Germanic tribe. While Kirk Douglas's Spartacus
starts at the bottom and works his way up, Crowe's general starts
at the top and works his way down.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's character is named Maximus. (What else would they call
him? Minimus?) His demotion is sudden. He promises the old emperor
_ Richard Harris cannily milking a juicy cameo _ that he'll
re-establish a Roman Republic. But the king's bratty son, Commodus,
who's jealous of Maximus because he knows his father considers
Maxiumus the son he wishes he could have fathered, murders the old
emperor and gets rid of Maximus when the latter refuses to go along
with the coup. ``Gladiator'' also makes a half-hearted effort to
get a little incest going between Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus and
his sister, Connie Nielsen's Lucilla. These scenes _ in fact, all
the non-combat scenes _ are bathed in such gloom that they'd sink
like stones if not for Phoenix's smirk.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he's smirking about is his death by torture of
Maximus's family. Like Spartacus, Maximus would have preferred to
live the life of a simple farmer. As it is, he's motivated by
revenge after being sold into slavery. Crowe isn't asked to do much
beyond staying focused and looking vengeful. This he does as he
efficiently works his way up the food chain to the big time _ Rome.
The late Oliver Reed _ ``Gladiator'' was his swan song _ would have
stolen the movie if his slave dealer and gladiator vendor weren't
so noble. Better he should have been given some comic relief to
play, as Peter Ustinov did in such unctuous fashion in
``Spartacus,'' playing a similar role, greeting his fighters on the
eve of their deadly games by saying, ``Good luck. . . to most of
you.'' As it is, the film must settle for such faint ironies as
casting Derek Jacobi, of ``I, Claudius'' fame, as a potentially
honorable senator.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix comes off relatively unscathed in a role that's all but
self-immolating, requiring him to speak such lines as ``I'm
terribly vexed,'' as he throws a hissy fit. ``Gladiator'' doesn't
so much represent a reinvention of ``Spartacus'' as a revisiting
and italicizing of its tabloid side. Character is scanted or
perfunctory, although Crowe fills the film's big canvas with
commanding presence. Still, there's no getting around the fact that
``Gladiator'' can't drape dignity and righteousness over the
slaughter that's its reason for being. ``Gladiator'' is
red-blooded, but only in a titillating way. Predictably, with its
conspicuous display of pre-fascist trappings. it says more about
our time than about Rome. Its message, insofar as it has one, is
that the only thing bigger than a corrupt ruler is a celebrity
gladiator.

TREATING A NEW RUSH CHAIR SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 07, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a very nice old Windsor chair that was my
grandmother's. I had a new rush seat applied, and while it looks
good, it is very light in color, nothing like the brown the old
rush was. Is there any way to darken it?
</P>
<P>
   ETHEL HANNABURY, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. Wait 10 years. The rush will darken naturally over
time. There is no need to finish, but if you want to darken it
instantly, apply two coats of an oil-based polyurethane varnish.
The rush will continue to darken under the varnish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it OK for a husband and wife to submit questions on the
same day? I understand my wife called you earlier. If it is OK,
here is my question: The houses in my neighborhood occasionally get
water in the basement; mine gets less. A couple bought the big
Victorian next door and they talked of putting on an addition near
a huge maple tree. They were warned that the maple may have to go
if the addition is built as planned. That tree is huge, and must be
taking up a lot of water when it rains. My question is: If the tree
goes, would that raise the water table significantly or at all,
aggravating the flooding?
</P>
<P>
   RALPH HANNABURY, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Husbands and wives can ask all the questions they want. The
handyman welcomes all and is impressed by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   And, a short answer to a long question: No, taking the tree down
will not affect the water table much, if at all; the area is too
big to be affected by one tree.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are better reasons to keep the tree: Shade and
generation of oxygen all summer, and good looks all year long. I
suggest you see if you can get the neighbor to consider another
spot for the addition.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I lugged up an old utility sink from my basement. It was
wicked heavy. Does it contain asbestos?
</P>
<P>
   GINA DiROCCO, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No. It is probably soapstone (nothing, not even cast iron is
heavier than soapstone). The sink may have some value. Advertise in
your local used-goods flyer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The floor of my deck is made of Trex. I spilled some oil on
the floor. How can I remove it? It has been on the Trex for five
days.
</P>
<P>
   LOUIS D'AMBROSIA, Hampton, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no deck that will not stain from oil, except maybe
PVC boards, and they will stain too, but at least it is easier to
remove stains from vinyl, using paint thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Wood is very tender to oil stains. Trex, a combo of ground
plastic bottles and ground wood, also is absorbent, but not as much
as wood. To remove, if the oil has hardened, scrape with a putty
knife. Then apply lots of baking soda, Speedy-Dry or cat litter,
leave it for an hour, then sweep up and throw it away. All these
are absorbents and will suck up the oil, given time. Speedy-Dry,
sold in hardware stores, is normally used to pick up oil (!) in
service stations. If the oil is rather hard, but does not scrape up
easily, apply paint thinner to dissolve it, then apply the
absorbent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My smoke detectors are hard-wired into the electricity. They
have been up for a while, and seem to work OK, but now they make a
snapping sound when any switch is turned on. How can I correct
that?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD NEWBERG, Carver, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Check with an electrician, or a small appliance repair
person. It sounds as if the detectors have worn from old age and
may need replacing. If you dust them or vacuum them lightly to
clear out dust, that might help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have 40 vinyl chaise lounges around a resort pool, and
every one is stained with suntan lotion. Regular cleaner does not
remove it. What will?
</P>
<P>
   S.B., Cape Cod, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a lot of things to clean vinyl, so you may have to
try one at a time for suntan lotion stains. Here are some cleaners
for vinyl, in no preferential order:
</P>
<P>
   1. Zap, sold from a catalog called Solutions, 800-987-6564.
</P>
<P>
   2. Soap Scum Remover sold in hardware stores. It took a while to
work, but after it came clean, subsequent treatments were easy and
quick.
</P>
<P>
   3. Simple Green.
</P>
<P>
   4. Armorall, the spray cleaner used to clean vinyl dashboards
and auto tiles.
</P>
<P>
   5. Tackle, a cleaner for vinyl siding that has been on the
market for some years.
</P>
<P>
   6. Rub with a cloth dipped in dry-cleaning fluid.
</P>
<P>
   7. And finally, a mix of one part household bleach and three
parts water. If it works, rinse thoroughly; we don't want all that
tender skin affected by bleach. When working with bleach or any
other cleaner, wear skin and eye protection.
</P>
<P>
   8. Finally, pressure-washing might help, if you can keep from
blowing the chaises all over the Cape.
</P>
<P>

NAPSTER STRIKES DISSONANT CHORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle lines are drawn. The target is Napster, the software
company that allows computer users to swap music files with other
users for free, whether the music is by unknown bands or
superstars. Either way, the artists don't get royalties _ and this
issue has ignited a firestorm of debate among musicians, record
labels, and increasingly, the courts, which have been asked to rule
on copyright questions regarding online piracy.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner stands Metallica and Dr. Dre _ the heavy metal and
rap titans, respectively, who recently filed separate suits against
Napster for copyright infringement. Other artists from Don Henley
to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails are defending their position,
with Henley saying that Napster is engaged in outright ``stealing''
from songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner is Limp Bizkit, the rap-rock act that has
become Napster's lobbying arm and is taking $1.7 million in Napster
sponsorship to tour this summer. The Offspring and Chuck D of
Public Enemy are among the acts standing beside Bizkit in support
of Napster, saying that Napster helps expose new music and anyone
who thinks otherwise is old school.
</P>
<P>
   All of which comes just a week after the Recording Industry
Association of America (on behalf of major labels such as Sony and
Arista) won a lawsuit against MP3.com _ a music database service.
MP3.com was found guilty of copyright infringement for its
my.mp3.com branch, which allows users to create a digital locker
from MP3's database of 80,000 CDs. The RIAA is now asking for
damages that could run in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The subplots to the digital battle are many, and are being
played out in light of increased sales of compact discs. For one,
Metallica has been pitted against some of its fans, one of whom
went on Napster's Web site this week to write that Metallica was a
bunch of ``sellouts.'' He added: ``The (Metallica) song `Master of
Puppets' is fitting, only this time, Metallica is on the wrong end
of the strings.'' Metallica's response was to hire a British firm,
NetPD, to monitor three days of Napster activity earlier this week,
which turned up 333,082 screen names of users who traded 1.4
million Metallica songs _ an average of nearly five songs per
person _ during that time, said Gayle Fine of the band's management
company, Q Prime. Metallica has asked that Napster drop those names
from its files. As of Thursday, Napster had not removed the names.
One fan posted an angry parody site, www.paylars.com, which asks
fans to send money to the band to pay for songs they downloaded on
Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Another subplot features Limp Bizkit's singer-rapper, Fred
Durst, who also is a senior vice president of Interscope Records,
whose parent label, Universal Music, joined the RIAA in a separate
lawsuit against Napster. Interscope has not commented on what it
thinks of Durst's actions.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger issue has nothing to do with opposing rock
personalities. It has to do with whether 200 years of copyright law
will be thrown out the window by the digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recording industry is not anti-Napster,'' says Jayson
Maloni, a spokesman for the RIAA. ``Nobody is trying to keep an
unsigned band from getting its music heard. But the RIAA is
concerned with signed artists who record for labels that do not
want to give away their music for free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the artist. You're messing with the record
companies now and they don't want to lose that money,'' adds J.C.
Chasez of the band 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   The record labels have remained quiet and are letting the RIAA
fight its battles, though more and more artists are speaking out.
The lesser-known ones tend to defend Napster, for as Bill Janovitz
of Buffalo Tom says, ``For artists that nobody has heard of,
Napster may help them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger the act, the more likely it is to bash Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I create my music; it's mine,'' said Reznor of Nine Inch Nails
in a recent phone interview. ``It's not your right to give it away
or exchange it with your friends, just as it's not right to copy
software or photocopy books to give away. It represents the
artist's work. Just because a technology exists where you can
duplicate something, that doesn't give you the right to steal.
There's nothing wrong with giving some tracks away, or bits of
stuff, that's fine. But it's not everybody's right. Once I record
something, it's not public domain to give it away freely. So I
stand behind Dr. Dre and Metallica and support them. And that's not
trying to be the outdated musician who is trying to stop
technology. I love technology. Technology is here to stay and I'm
the first one downloading the newest update to software that I
don't need and that makes my machine not work.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bizkit's Durst, Reznor blasted him by saying, ``Durst is
the brain trust of all that is wrong with music. He supports
(Napster) because they gave him $2 million to tour. He forgot to
mention that in his press release.'' (Bizkit was unavailable for
comment since he's in the studio, said publicist Jenny Bodi.)
</P>
<P>
   Singer Don Henley is equally outspoken. ``The bottom line is
this: The works of recording artists are being stolen and
disseminated over the Internet without fair and just compensation
for those artists,'' he said. ``This is the way songwriters and
singers make their living, and stealing that music and giving it
away for free is not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's the absurd argument that `Well, rock stars are
wealthy, and therefore, it's all right to steal from them,' '' said
Henley. ``But the majority of singers and songwriters and recording
artists in this business are not wealthy. They're struggling hand
to mouth, day to day, and they need fair and just compensation for
their work. I'm deeply concerned, as are all artists about these
issues, particularly Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster was founded last year by Shawn Fanning, a 19-year-old
then-Northeastern University student who dropped out after his
freshman year to move to San Mateo, Calif., where the company is
based. Napster is growing dramatically _ spokeswoman Deborah Orr
won't put a figure on the number of users, but cites ``millions,
with a 5 to 25 percent increase every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm refers to itself as the ``embattled MP3 file-swapping
software company.'' Clearly, there's a martyrdom complex here,
though Fanning and other Napster executives weren't available to
discuss it for this article. Orr said, ``they can't comment on
anything touching on the lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers say that the major record labels have been slow
in climbing aboard the digital revolution, hence the
fill-the-breach mentality of services like Napster and my.mp3.com.
Earlier this week Sony and Universal Music announced plans to
launch a joint music download subscription service.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new company, myplay.com, has been working with
labels on a ``totally legal basis,'' says founder David Pakman, who
worked with Apple computer and is also a rock drummer. His company
enables users to have a digital locker of songs, but royalties are
paid on them and other listeners can listen to them for two weeks
but can't copy them. Myplay will launch a partnership with aol.com
in two weeks, so the timing is perfect for this new startup, now
that Napster and my.mp3.com have been scarred by lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   While most artists have chosen sides in the Napster dispute,
some artists are still sitting on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can argue on both sides, but not hard enough to do anything
about it,'' said solo and Throwing Muses singer Kristin Hersh. ``I
want music to get to more ears than just through MTV, Top 40 radio,
and Rolling Stone. So something that opens things up and makes
people more musically educated can be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A wait-and-see policy was voiced by Billy Corgan of the Smashing
Pumpkins. ``It's a waste of time to go after (Napster) because
you're not going to be able to stop free trade on the Internet.
Everybody should stop wringing their hands about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take two or three years to sort itself out,''
said Corgan. ``It's going to be the future, but we'll eventually
have to figure out a system that gives the artist some copyright
payment. I believe it's hurting record sales, but it's also doing
what it's supposed to do _ building new fans.''

<P>
   NAVY-SPY (Washington) _ A sailor accused of giving the Russians
secrets about the U.S. submarine fleet has encountered a unique
obstacle in his efforts to mount a defense: The Navy won't let him
meet privately with his lawyers out of fear that he might reveal
classified information. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Daniel King,
an intelligence analyst being held in the U.S. Marine Corps brig at
Quantico, Va., is facing one count of espionage for passing
submarine secrets to Moscow and one count of disclosing classified
information improperly. He could face the death penalty if
convicted. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

   EDUCATION-CONGRESS (Washington) _ For 35 years, Congress and the
White House have joined in bipartisan harmony to dole out federal
money for education. But election year politics have thrust the
program into turbulence this year. One veteran senator says he's
never seen anything like the political storm swirling around
education. By JUDY HOLLAND.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENDING-TAIWAN (Washington) _ China's efforts to squash
Taiwan's talk of independence with fresh saber rattling spotlights
one of the best-kept secrets in Washington: The United States would
be hard-pressed to defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion of the
craggy, remote island. U.S. forces would face huge handicaps in any
likely combat scenario adopted by China to terrorize, dominate or
occupy Taiwan _ from a naval blockade or missile attack to seizing
Taiwan's airspace or launching an invasion. By STEWART M. POWELL
And ERIC ROSENBERG. (1STLD-WRITETHRU filed Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE-ELECTIONS (Washington) _ Beneath the hoopla of the
presidential race is another important national electoral conflict:
Control of the House of Representatives. Having battled back from
their 1994 debacle, House Democrats are six seats away from taking
back control. Republicans say they can hold the line, and if Texas
Gov. George W. Bush wins, it will be 1952 all over again _ the last
time Republicans controlled Capitol Hill and the White House. By
DAN FREEDMAN. (Filed Thursday.)

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ Those who abhor isolationism and
fear the consequences of protectionism can draw some solace from
the foreign policy declarations of Al Gore and George W. Bush. The
Democratic and Republican presidential hopefuls have stated quite
firmly their intentions of adhering to the centrist and
internationalist foreign policy principles that have guided every
president since World War II. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Filed

<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The nation's unemployment rate dipped
below 4 percent, to 3.9 percent, for the first time in 30 years in
April, as 340,000 workers found jobs. The payrolls number was
inflated by the hiring of 73,000 workers for the Census and by the
late Easter holiday, which pushed some hiring in retail in April.
Still, the report was much stronger than what economists had
expected. The April report also showed that average hourly wages
rose 6 cents, or 0.4 percent to $13.64. The annual wage increase
was 3.8 percent, the biggest in 10 months. The data will probably

Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr. could rattle world markets are
passing as an increasingly volatile economy has made their
investing style fall out of favor. The twilight of the giants has
obscured a recent shift in the industry toward smaller, more nimble
funds that focus on specific sectors or large firms that offer
collections of smaller funds. Even as some prominent investors
suffer, it is evident the hedge fund industry has continued to
flourish. By Danny Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-RAIL (St. Augustine, Fla.) _ Henry Flagler came to Florida
in 1883 to build grand hotels in what was sparsely populated
coastal scrub. He began cobbling together a railroad, and by 1896
he had built 350 miles of track from Jacksonville to Miami. Now
Florida East Coast Industries, the holding company controlling the
Flagler railroad, is using the right of way to establish itself in
the new economy. A subsidiary has been selling capacity to move
digital information through fiber-optic cables that run alongside
chugging train cars. The experience of Florida East Coast provides
a glimpse into some of the swaps and barters used to create a glass
network for the streams of digital bits and bytes cycling around
the globe. It also suggests how some transportation and power
companies may find prosperity in a cyber age. By Jane Tanner. (1700

 &HT;    
 &HT;    PUERTO MONTT, Chile _ After 15 years of living in balmy Miami,
aeronautical engineer and Chilean native Felix Oyarzo was ready to
return home to Puerto Montt, his hometown.
 &HT;    The Pacific port town in Chile's southern 10th region is the
gateway to the luxuriously forested ``deep south'' of the country,
a breathtaking topography of snow-capped volcanoes, crystalline
fjords and temperate rain forests jammed with some of South
America's most spectacular native trees. Every year, more than
100,000 international tourists use Puerto Montt as the starting
point for all sorts of nature expeditions, so Oyarzo decided a
hotel was the best investment.
 &HT;    Oyarzo says he's now seeing less visitors as agriculture and
forestry grow in the region. ``If you drive along the highways
here, you can see the destruction,'' the 50-year-old hotelier says.
``I used to be able to leave my house to go motorcycling and head
straight into the trees. Now it takes me half an hour cross country
to reach the woods.''
 &HT;    Oyarzo is not alone in his concern. Chile's green movement has
for years tried to sound the alarm, decrying what they consider
weak forestry policies coupled with unchecked greed. To their
chorus the unlikely bedfellow of business has been added recently:
Joining the hotel owners and tour operators, southern Chile's
salmon growers are up in arms about plans for forestry projects
they say could wreak havoc on the region's supply of clean water,
tampering with a US$1 billion export industry dependent on delicate
environmental factors.
 &HT;    Fast-running water from the Andes needs the trees to keep
streams from becoming gullies of mud, says Hans Kossmann, chief
executive of Patagonia Salmon Farming in Puerto Montt. The runoff
also contributes to massive algae blooms that literally choke
salmon in their ocean pens by consuming all the oxygen in the
water. ``We're not against forestry,'' Kossmann says. ``But once
the damage is done, it will be a long time in recovering. Water
quality should be the basis of any environmental impact studies
that are done.''
 &HT;    As is usually the case in arguments over resources, balancing
economic interests is tricky at best. Chile's most recent forestry
census shows just one fifth of the country is forested, and the
vast majority of the almost 16 million hectares is located in the
three southernmost regions of the country, which are ground zero
for tourism, the salmon industry and Chile's saw mills.
 &HT;    The forestry business is still modest and almost entirely made
up of Monterey pine and eucalyptus stands to feed sawmills. But
there's still great risk, critics claim. That's because private
landowners control most of the virgin forest and they have little
economic reason to leave native trees alone.
 &HT;    In fact, Chile's forestry laws heavily subsidize cutting,
according to Mauricio Fierro, a Chilean forestry and tourism
consultant. He says landowners who take out slow-growing native
trees can recoup up to 75 percent and, in some cases, 90 percent of
the cutting costs _ although a separate subsidy encourages native
replanting.
 &HT;    Such payments have helped establish Chile's burgeoning pulp and
board factories at the expense of taxpayers, Fierro charges,
leading to massive planting of fast-growing monocultures such as
Monterey pine over native hardwoods. With that change go the
variety and splendor of Chilean hardwoods such as alerce, araucaria
and coihue, which take decades, even a century, to mature.
Development, too, has brought unintended consequences. ``What
protected the coastal forests in the past was the lack of roads,''
Fierro says. ``All that is changing.''
 &HT;    Less than a third of the native forests currently fall under
government oversight through Chile's National System of Protected
Natural Areas, which was established in 1994. ``Most of the
national parks are protecting nothing but stones,'' Fierro says.
 &HT;    Regulators contend that the case made by environmentalists is
overstated and doesn't consider the seriousness with which Chile's
Corporacion Nacional Forestal (Conaf) takes the government's role
in protecting resources. Carlos Ritter, Conaf's technical director
in the hotly disputed 10th region, says his office has 2,000 case
files tracking each landowner's plans for forest management.
Cutting is allowed, he says, but under carefully monitored
conditions that do not allow for clear cutting.
 &HT;    In addition, Conaf has 40 technicians on a staff of 220 just to
follow private lands and a healthy annual budget of $500,000. ``We
have the people. We have the vehicles. We have the software,''
Ritter asserts. ``It's not as if we have forestry anarchy here.
It's organized and under control.''
 &HT;    Government forestry experts add that Chile's tree industry is
undersized and should be encouraged. ``Countries like Finland and
New Zealand have forestry as 40 percent to 50 percent of their GDP
[gross domestic product,'' Forestry Institute Director Ignacio
Cerda says. ``In Chile, it's 3 percent to 4 percent. That's low.''
 &HT;    Investment has not been lacking. Private forestry firms, both
foreign and domestic, have dumped $3 billion into Chile to develop
particleboard, plywood, fiberboard and veneers for export. As a
result, the export value of Chilean wood is predicted to top $4
billion between 2000 and 2010. Pulp for paper is now more than half
of the export value of Chilean wood, but value-added products such
as doors and finished boards are picking up steam.
 &HT;    The sticking point: native trees versus plantations. Cerda says
attempts to harvest native wood in Chile _ as elsewhere in the
world _ are simply, and unfortunately, bad economics. He'd like to
see either very strong management programs that would allow for
more plantations or some kind of tax on salmon and tourism to pay
landowners directly not to cut, as has been done successfully in
Costa Rica.
 &HT;    But, says Cerda: ``The first assumption you have to make is that
if people are poor and hungry, they are going to cut down trees.''

Corporacion Nacional Forestal (Conaf) takes the government's role
in protecting resources. Carlos Ritter, Conaf's technical director
in the hotly disputed 10th region, says his office has 2,000 case
files tracking each landowner's plans for forest management.
Cutting is allowed, he says, but under carefully monitored
conditions that do not allow for clear cutting.
 &HT;    In addition, Conaf has 40 technicians on a staff of 220 just to
follow private lands and a healthy annual budget of $500,000. ``We
have the people. We have the vehicles. We have the software,''
Ritter asserts. ``It's not as if we have forestry anarchy here.
It's organized and under control.''
 &HT;    Government forestry experts add that Chile's tree industry is
undersized and should be encouraged. ``Countries like Finland and
New Zealand have forestry as 40 percent to 50 percent of their GDP
[gross domestic product,'' Forestry Institute Director Ignacio
Cerda says. ``In Chile, it's 3 percent to 4 percent. That's low.''
 &HT;    Investment has not been lacking. Private forestry firms, both
foreign and domestic, have dumped $3 billion into Chile to develop
particleboard, plywood, fiberboard and veneers for export. As a
result, the export value of Chilean wood is predicted to top $4
billion between 2000 and 2010. Pulp for paper is now more than half
of the export value of Chilean wood, but value-added products such
as doors and finished boards are picking up steam.
 &HT;    The sticking point: native trees versus plantations. Cerda says
attempts to harvest native wood in Chile _ as elsewhere in the
world _ are simply, and unfortunately, bad economics. He'd like to
see either very strong management programs that would allow for
more plantations or some kind of tax on salmon and tourism to pay
landowners directly not to cut, as has been done successfully in
Costa Rica.
 &HT;    But, says Cerda: ``The first assumption you have to make is that
if people are poor and hungry, they are going to cut down trees.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    PUERTO MONTT, Chile _ Despues de vivir en Miami durante 15 anos,
el ingeniero aeronautico chileno Felix Oyarzo estaba listo para
regresar a su pueblo natal, Puerto Montt.
 &HT;    El puerto es la via de acceso al boscoso sur del pais, una
pasmosa topografia de volcanes de cumbres nevadas, fiordos
cristalinos y bosques templados donde abundan espectaculares
arboles autoctonos. Cada ano, mas de 100.000 turistas salen de
Puerto Montt en todo tipo de expediciones, asi que Oyarzo decidio
que un hotel seria la mejor inversion.
 &HT;    Oyarzo dice que ahora ve menos visitantes, a medida que aumentan
las actividades de agricultura y silvicultura en la region.
``Cuando uno va por las autopistas, se ve la destruccion,'' dice
este hotelero de 50 anos. ``Antes salia de mi casa en motocicleta y
enseguida estaba entre los arboles. Ahora me demoro media hora para
llegar al bosque.''
 &HT;    Y Oyarzo no es el unico preocupado. El movimiento ecologista
chileno lleva anos dando la voz de alarma y denunciando lo que
considera una debil politica forestal unida a una ambicion
desmedida. Y el coro ya cuenta con mas voces: los duenos de
hoteles, los operadores turisticos y los que se dedican a la cria
del salmon se oponen energicamente a los planes forestales, que
segun ellos podrian devastar el suministro de agua potable de la
region y afectar una industria exportadora de US$1.000 millones que
depende de delicados factores ambientales.
 &HT;    Sin los arboles, las corrientes rapidas que bajan de los Andes
formarian lagunas de lodo, afirma Hans Kossmann, director ejecutivo
de Patagonia Salmon Farming en Puerto Montt. Tambien causarian la
formacion de barreras de algas que literalmente asfixiarian a los
salmones en sus corrales marinos al consumir todo el oxigeno del
agua. ``No estamos contra la silvicultura,'' dice Kossmann. ``Pero
una vez que el dano este hecho, la recuperacion demorara mucho
tiempo. La calidad del agua debe ser la base de cualquier estudio
ambiental.''
 &HT;    Como suele ocurrir en los debates sobre recursos naturales,
equilibrar los intereses economicos es sumamente dificil. El censo
forestal mas reciente de Chile muestra que los bosques solo abarcan
la quinta parte del pais, y la gran mayoria de los casi 16 millones
de hectareas esta en las tres regiones mas meridionales, que son
centros del turismo, la industria del salmon y la industria
maderera.
 &HT;    El negocio de la explotacion forestal aun es modesto y se
compone basicamente de eucaliptos y pinos de Monterey para suplir
los aserraderos. Pero segun los que se oponen a la actividad, la
mayor parte de la selva virgen esta en manos de propietarios
privados con pocas razones economicas para proteger los arboles
autoctonos.
 &HT;    Las leyes forestales de Chile contemplan grandes subsidios a la
tala, segun Mauricio Fierro, consultor chileno de turismo y
silvicultura. Fierro dice que los terratenientes que talan los
arboles autoctonos, que demoran mucho en crecer, pueden recuperar
el 75 por ciento y, en algunos casos, el 90 por ciento del costo de
la tala, aunque hay otro subsidio para alentar la reforestacion.
 &HT;    Esos subsidios han contribuido al establecimiento de fabricas de
pulpa y carton a expensas de los contribuyentes, denuncia Fierro, y
al monocultivo de arboles de rapido crecimiento como el pino de
Monterey, en detrimento de las variedades autoctonas. Con el cambio
esta en peligro de desaparecer el esplendor de variedades como el
alerce, la araucaria y el coihue, que tardan decadas y hasta un
siglo en madurar. El desarrollo tambien tiene consecuencias
imprevistas. ``Antes, la falta de carreteras protegia a los bosques
costeros,'' apunta Fierro. ``Todo eso esta cambiando.''
 &HT;    El gobierno supervisa menos de una tercera parte de los bosques
autoctonos a traves del Sistema Nacional de Areas Naturales
Protegidas, creado en 1994. ``La mayoria de los parques nacionales
no protegen mas que rocas,'' afirma Fierro.
 &HT;    Las autoridades sostienen que las denuncias de los
ambientalistas son exageradas y que no consideran la seriedad con
que la Corporacion Nacional Forestal (Conaf) se ocupa de proteger
los recursos. Carlos Ritter, director tecnico de Conaf en la zona
en cuestion, dice que su oficina tiene 2.000 documentos con los
planes forestales de cada terrateniente. Talar esta permitido,
senala, pero bajo condiciones muy supervisadas que no permiten el
desmonte. Ademas, entre sus 220 empleados Conaf tiene 40 tecnicos
dedicados exclusivamente a supervisar los terrenos privados y un
presupuesto anual de US$500.000. ``Tenemos la gente. Tenemos los
vehiculos. Tenemos el software,'' indica Ritter. ``No hay una
anarquia forestal. Todo esta organizado.''
 &HT;    Los especialistas en silvicultura del gobierno anaden que la
industria maderera de Chile aun es pequena y deberia alentarse.
``En paises como Finlandia y Nueva Zelanda la silvicultura
constituye del 40 por ciento al 50 por ciento del PIB,'' dice
Ignacio Cerda, director del Instituto de Silvicultura. ``En Chile,
es del 3 por ciento al 4 por ciento.''
 &HT;    Empresas privadas de silvicultura han invertido US$3.000
millones en Chile para producir madera prensada, madera
contrachapada y chapas de madera para la exportacion. Como
consecuencia, se pronostica que el valor de la exportacion de
madera chilena superara los US$4.000 millones entre el 2000 y el
2010. La pulpa de papel es hoy mas de la mitad del valor de
exportacion de la madera chilena, pero estan cobrando fuerza
productos de valor agregado como puertas y tablas terminadas.
 &HT;    El problema esencial: arboles autoctonos contra plantaciones.
Cerda dice que, desafortunadamente, los intentos de producir madera
de arboles autoctonos en Chile (y en cualquier parte del mundo) no
son rentables. Le gustaria ver fuertes programas de administracion
que permitieran plantar mas arboles, o algun tipo de impuesto sobre
el salmon y el turismo para pagarles a los terratenientes con el
fin de que no talen, como se ha hecho con exito en Costa Rica.
 &HT;    Pero Cerda observa: ``Lo primero que hay que entender es que si
la gente es pobre y tiene hambre, va a cortar los arboles.''

&HT;     ANTI-LOGGING PROTESTERS GET ANOTHER TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An appellate court has ruled that nine
anti-logging protesters whose eyes were swabbed with pepper spray
by sheriff's deputies in Northern California are entitled to a
second jury trial to attempt to prove that they were subjected to
excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing a decision by U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn R.
Walker, a three-judge 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel on
Thursday ruled that a jury might well decide in the demonstrators'
favor.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Walker dismissed the plaintiffs' civil
lawsuit, saying no reasonable jury would find the deputies' actions
improper. The case generated national publicity when network
television showed footage of the Humboldt County deputies applying
pepper spray to the plaintiffs' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Harry Pregerson, writing for the circuit court panel, said
``a rational person could easily conclude that there was sufficient
evidence for a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deadlocked 4-4 in the first trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strong ruling,'' said Brendan Cummings, a Berkeley
lawyer who represents the plaintiffs. ``This is an issue for a
jury, not a judge to decide. It's an issue of community standards.
So much of the world was outraged and horrified by what police did
to these protesters.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit arose from an Oct. 16, 1997, sit-in at the Eureka
office of then-Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., and on Sept. 25 and Oct.
3, 1997, at forest demonstrations by protesters against logging in
the pristine Headwaters Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters in Riggs' office had chained themselves together
using metal sleeves, which made them hard to separate. They refused
to budge, despite warnings from deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies then rubbed cotton swabs dipped in pepper spray on the
protesters' eyelids and sprayed some of them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Slametz of Oakland, one of the plaintiffs, said she now
feels ``relieved and hopeful that we have a jury that feels as we
do that deputies should not be able to use torture on nonviolent
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the lawsuit, Walker found that ``the balance of
hardship'' in the case tipped toward law enforcement. Prohibiting
the practice of direct application to the eyes of nonviolent
demonstrators ``would impair their ability to enforce the law and
impose a significant hardship,'' he said. ``Limiting the officers
options to a cumbersome alternative restricts their ability to
effect arrests.''

WHEN THE PARTNER IS MICROSOFT, YOU DO BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds like every executive's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   On April 24, Robert Levitan, chief executive of the online gift
service Flooz.com, announced he had signed a deal with a software
company. This expensive deal, which he had negotiated for more than
a month, offered Flooz promotion through the software company's
wildly popular e-mail service and network of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, three newspapers said a federal judge would soon
be asked to split Levitan's new partner apart. The software
company's stock plunged 16 percent .
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not even on our radar,'' Levitan says.
</P>
<P>
   But this was little surprise, and even now he is not worried.
The software company is, of course, Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq), and
there is nothing unique or even nightmarish about Levitan's
situation. Though dire news from the courts has spooked the
software giant's investors and sliced its historic market
capitalization by 41 percent, or $256 billion, hardware, software
and Internet companies of all sizes are locking arms with Microsoft
at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Microsoft signed deals with a financial software
company, an online storage company, a broadband service outfit and
a computer security firm. Partners like Xerox (XRX:NYSE), Tandy
(TAN:NYSE), Dell (DELL:Nasdaq) and the Web-hosting company Exodus
(EXDS:Nasdaq), which have signed agreements with Microsoft in the
months intervening the harsh initial antitrust ruling and
prosecutors' request to sever the operating system business from
the applications business, express an almost Zen-like appraisal of
the developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at that the same way as any news spectator,'' says
Chris Arisian, vice president for alliances at Exodus, which last
month announced a deal to market Microsoft's Windows DNA 2000
platform alongside its Web hosting services. ``Even if they broke
the company up, we would still be aligned with the entity making
the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies that have signed agreements with Microsoft
say the predominance of Windows makes Microsoft an attractive, even
necessary partner. That includes hardware maker Dell, whose sales
force is in the middle of a 16-city tour demonstrating how well its
rack-based servers work with Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're known for is responding to what
customers actually want as opposed to telling them what they want,
and most people want Windows,'' says John Thompson, a spokesman for
Dell.
</P>
<P>
   This consistent view of Microsoft's market position, antitrust
experts say, should interest investors for several reasons. Not
only does it speak to the company's strength in all areas of the
computing industry, it forebodes possible outcomes of the legal
battle in appellate courts. The choices these companies make shed
light on Microsoft's current behavior after its alleged bullying in
the browser market half a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're seeing Microsoft is going to continue to be a
strong player, whether it's one number or two or three in your
Rolodex,'' says William F. Causey, an antitrust litigator at the
Washington firm Nixon Peabody LP.
</P>
<P>
   There is a catch. The extent of Microsoft's market strength, of
course, is the linchpin of the government's case. If Microsoft
controls the market for operating systems (Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson ruled it does) and uses that monopoly to create what
Jackson called the ``dangerous probability'' of a monopoly in a
second market, the software giant is breaking the law and should
arguably be severed.
</P>
<P>
   For CAIS Internet (CAIS:Nasdaq), which uses software and
proprietary devices to deliver broadband Internet access to hotels
and other buildings with tricky architecture, the attraction to
Microsoft spanned the two new companies proposed by prosecutors. In
a deal announced Wednesday, CAIS accepted a $40 million equity
investment from Microsoft. The deal grants CAIS extended discounts
on Microsoft operating platforms. In exchange, CAIS agreed to
exclusively deliver MSN to hotel guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not important whether Microsoft is broken up or not,''
says Gary Rabin, the company's chief strategy officer. ``We went
into business with a company that had two major things we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   This would seem to indicate that the end of the browser wars was
not the last of Microsoft's attempts to extend Windows dominance to
other markets. But that alone is not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust principles say the person that's got the favored
product should win,'' says Joseph Angland, a partner in the
antitrust group of the law firm Dewey Ballantine. ``Even
monopolists are encouraged to compete vigorously, and that includes
finding the right joint ventures.''
</P>
<P>
   The government ``would become concerned if partnerships locked
up resources from competitors,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For that, the closest case may be Tandy, owner of the Radio
Shack chain of home electronics stores. Through a joint promotion
agreement announced Nov. 11 and expanded on Monday, the company has
agreed to create Microsoft ``store within a store'' arrangements.
The deal's extensive terms range from the retailer's offer of $400
rebates on its own products when customers sign up for MSN service
to Microsoft's development of the radioshack.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kay Jackson, a Radio Shack spokeswoman, the only
other company in the running was America Online (AOL:NYSE).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful ISP and it's got great market share,''
Jackson said. ``While content is important, our strategy is home
connectivity. Microsoft has navigation software. Through Microsoft,
we give the entire World Wide Web to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Microsoft cited AOL's purchase of Netscape as
evidence that it faces viable competition in browser and software
markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a friend of the court brief filed in support of the
government, the Software and Information Industry Association
countered that ``AOL's merger with Time Warner reinforces AOL's
focus on the entertainment industry rather than on software, which
remains Microsoft's domain. AOL is not an actual or potential rival
in the markets for operating systems or for Microsoft's other key
software technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   But even RadioShack.com sells some software products based in
Linux, an operating system that is routinely cited as a Windows
rival despite its dismal market share and the fact it is available
for free.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances that make Microsoft irresistible to Tandy
reflect market realities that antitrust laws seek to encourage,
says Angland. He views Windows as a so-called natural monopoly, an
opinion that seems validated by Thompson, the Dell spokesman, who
said the operating system is ``baked into'' the hardware maker's
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the fuss and bother of this trial, when you look at
Microsoft's market share, it's going to be a two-digit number and
the first digit is going to be a nine,'' Angland says.
</P>
<P>
   For executives like Levitan, the Flooz chief, that fact is no
more worrisome than the possibility of a Microsoft breakup. Rather,
it is simply the way the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft partnership ``is a test of our functionality to
e-mail platforms, but it is also a test of working with
Microsoft,'' Levitan said. ``If the litigation has the effect of
having Microsoft appreciate their partnership more and be more
collaborative, we would certainly appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman, said the company will
prevail in the antitrust case on appeal. To the companies with
which it does business, he said, ``we're trying to be the best
partner we can.''

NO END IN SIGHT SEEN IN ACTORS' STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By By Carolyn Koo   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celebrity pitchman Tiger Woods makes more per swing on the golf
course than journeyman commercial actor Dave Gibson makes in a
year. Yet both men are on strike against a common enemy: the
advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Gibson are part of a militant unionized actors
coalition making a stand against what it calls sheer greed by
advertising companies that want to share less of their profits. The
walkout began May 1 and looks increasingly like it will last for
weeks or even months.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, whose wealth is ranked by Forbes as more than $28
million, turned his back on the advertising industry by canceling
an appearance in a commercial for Nike (NKE:NYSE) that had been
scheduled for May 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``By withholding his services to commercial producers at this
time, he is standing together with the thousands of working-class
Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists performers who depend on a fair commercials contract to
maintain a decent standard of life,'' said Greg Krizman, a
spokesperson for SAG.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, who has done ads for products like Jell-O no-bake
cheesecake, refuses to even audition for any more commercials
during the strike because he believes so strongly in the necessity
of expanding the payment pie. ``I did a commercial that ran 250
times in a 13-week cycle. Every 13 weeks, I would get $8,000 to
$10,000. Now the advertisers are offering $2,500 for a 13-week
cycle,'' explained Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   With a total membership of 135,000, the combined SAG and AFTRA
is 35 percent bigger than 12 years ago, the last time actors went
on strike against the advertising industry. Strike leaders are also
more intent on winning greater concessions this time.
</P>
<P>
   The previous strike by commercial actors lasted for three weeks
in March and April 1988 and focused on establishing payment
guidelines for cable television, then in its infancy, and
maintaining existing guidelines for network commercials. That
strike was ratified by both unions and deemed a successful one,
according to John Sucke, the New York executive director of SAG.
Since then, contracts have been negotiated every three years, with
relatively little upheaval. But ``this time we are wider apart,''
said Krizman.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the pay-per-play formula long used for paying actors
in network commercials, where performers are recompensed based on
how many times a commercial airs in an advertising cycle. The
advertisers, represented by the Association of National Advertisers
and the American Association of Advertising Agencies, want to scrap
that formula and institute a fixed-fee formula, where actors are
paid one rate for each commercial, no matter how many times it
airs.
</P>
<P>
   Far from scrapping that formula, the actors say the advertising
industry, which has benefited enormously from the vibrant U.S.
economy, should be more generous, not less. The unions seek to
extend the pay-per-play formula to commercials on cable television,
to devise a payment structure for commercials that appear on the
Internet, and to create a system to monitor the use and frequency
of television and radio commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Both unions have moved to mobilize their memberships since the
last commercial contract was negotiated, after some contention, in
1997, culminating in the November 1999 election of a SAG leadership
ripe for agitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fair degree of membership dissatisfaction with
that contract,'' Krizman said, referring to the 1997 negotiations.
``The seeds of this have been brewing for three years.'' Sucke said
payment for cable was the source of dissent last time, with a
``quite loud and insistent'' minority insisting that the fixed-fee
for cable should have been even higher than negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   In the election, William Daniels, the two-time Emmy Award winner
for his turn as Dr. Mark Craig on the classic television drama St.
Elsewhere, garnered 47.5 percent of the vote to upset the
incumbent, character actor Richard Masur, for the two-year
presidency of SAG. The election was an acrimonious one, with
Daniels vowing to take a harder line with the advertising industry
and calling the existing leadership ``pussycats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for cover when I heard that,'' said John McGuinn of law
firm Schmeltzer, Aptaker &AMP; Shepard, who is the chief negotiator for
the joint professional committee of the advertising and advertising
agency bodies. Involved with entertainment-related negotiations
since 1976, McGuinn characterized the guild leadership in 1988,
under the presidency then of Oscar- and Emmy-winning actress Patty
Duke, as ``more moderate. It's harder to get my message across to
them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Another person close to the negotiations on the advertisers'
side said the strikers are ``harder to deal with now because they
have such strong stands. Those stands are creating resolution among
the advertisers as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Strike leaders say the level of union solidarity and awareness
over what's at stake has been building in the weeks leading up to
the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely certain that we are better educated than we
have been,'' Krizman said. ``The members know what we're proposing
and what the advertisers are proposing.''

&HT;     HEARST EXECUTIVE SAYS FANG CLOUT WAS A FACTOR IN EXAMINER
SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Hearst Corp. executive has testified that the
Fang family's offer to wield political clout to help Hearst buy the
San Francisco Chronicle was a consideration in Hearst's decision to
give the Fangs its San Francisco Examiner along with a $66 million
publishing subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Asher, Hearst's senior vice president, confirmed in
testimony Thursday that the Fangs in December offered to ``use
their extensive political connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Asher said of the Fangs' offer, ``I believe it's fair to say it
was a consideration, but not a very significant one.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came in the fourth day of trial, before U.S.
District Judge Vaughn R. Walker, on former political consultant and
1999 mayoral candidate Clint Reilly's antitrust suit to block
Hearst's $660 million purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper broker also testified, saying she believed Hearst
was paying a fair price for the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Hearst lawyer said he did not tell Hearst
executives that Examiner Publisher Timothy O. White had testified
to the U.S. Department of Justice in December that he offered Mayor
Willie Brown favorable editorial treatment in return for Brown
backing Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle. The Hearst lawyer said
he thought White's testimony was irrelevant to antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst indefinitely suspended White on Tuesday, saying it
learned of his comments to Brown only in court testimony Monday,
and was investigating whether he breached journalistic ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's suit contends Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle and
sell The Examiner will result in Hearst owning the only
metropolitan daily newspaper in town, a situation it claims is an
illegal monopoly. He claims the sale of The Examiner to the Fangs
is a sham and that the paper will fail. Hearst, Chronicle
Publishing Co. and the Fangs have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's testimony shed light on the intense negotiations
around the Fangs' effort to buy The Examiner and Hearst's effort to
buy the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's lawyer, filed as evidence Thursday a
Dec. 14, 1999, memo on the Fang proposal that Asher wrote and sent
to Jonathan E. Thackeray, Hearst's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal had been presented by David Balabanian, a lawyer
for the Fangs, who publish the free, three-times-a-week San
Francisco Independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs also are political allies of Brown and other local
politicians who had opposed Hearst's initial plans to buy the
Chronicle and shut The Examiner if it could not sell it. The
politicians said they wanted San Francisco to have at least two
daily papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fang proposal had four main points, Asher wrote:
</P>
<P>
   Hearst would settle a lawsuit in which the Fangs claimed Hearst
had harmed them by making an illegal, below-cost bid for a city
publishing contract. Hearst later won the suit on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs would ``take The Examiner off our hands,'' but because
they believed it ``was not viable on its own . . . a cash subsidy
would be required for them to be able to operate the Examiner as a
daily newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs ``would want to explore obtaining some assurance from
Hearst that it would not engage in the business of distributing
free circulation newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ``Assuming we reached agreement on all matters, the Fangs
would use their extensive political connections to assist us in
completing our purchase of the Chronicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Alioto, Asher testified that Hearst never
agreed not to publish a free paper that competed with the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Asher also said he concluded that the Fangs' request for $35
million a year for five years was exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he determined that, separated from its
profit-sharing agreement with the Chronicle, The Examiner would
lose tens of millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   And after Hearst could find no paying takers for The Examiner,
Asher said he figured it would be better to sell it for a
``negative purchase price,'' meaning Hearst would pay the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Hearst had encountered not only local political
opposition, but unexpected scrutiny from the U.S. Department of
Justice's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   According to Asher's memo, Balabanian insisted that Ted Fang,
publisher of the Independent, ``would be a preferred buyer of the
Examiner from the DOJ's (Department of Justice's) perspective,''
and could continue to publish the daily ``at the lowest cost'' to
Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Hearst announced it would sell The Examiner to the
Fangs and give them a subsidy of up to $66 million over 32 months
to defray publishing costs.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of The Examiner sale contract, filed in court Thursday,
shows the Fangs paid $100 cash for the paper and the subsidy. They
will get The Examiner's name, office equipment, archives, trucks
and news racks, but no staff and no buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As previously disclosed, the contract says the Fangs may bill
Hearst a maximum of $25 million per year for publishing costs, but
may keep half of each dollar that they don't spend beyond $15
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Asher confirmed, the Fangs could pocket $5 million
a year that they don't spend on The Examiner. ``There are no
strings attached to it,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``So is it correct,'' Alioto asked, ``that the less they spend
on the paper, the more they personally make?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not necessarily,'' Asher replied.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Balabanian denied Alioto's contention that the
Fang deal was designed to doom The Examiner. He noted that the
contract allows the Fangs to keep all the paper's advertising and
circulation revenue, saying that's an incentive to invest the
maximum subsidy in it.
</P>
<P>
   Balabanian said Justice Department officials likely considered
Ted Fang a ``preferred buyer'' because he had publishing experience
in San Francisco and the best chance of succeeding with The
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But Balabanian declined to comment on the Fangs' offer to put
their political power behind Hearst's buying the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Fang will testify fully about the entire negotiating
process'' next week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, The Examiner and Chronicle have had a joint
operating agreement in which they share printing, circulation and
marketing costs, pay for them from combined revenue for both
papers, and split the remainder evenly. Each paper then pays the
costs of its independent editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto contends Hearst misused its position in the agreement to
ward off other potential buyers for the Chronicle by insisting any
buyer split profits with The Examiner until the agreement expires
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that violated the intent of the Newspaper Preservation
Act and antitrust laws, and has argued that if the Chronicle was
put up for bid without that obligation, it would have drawn $1
billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman who brokered the Chronicle's proposed sale to
Hearst for $660 million last year testified that the Chronicle's
owners are getting a fair price.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Greenthal, a managing director of investment banker
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette's Boston office, said the three
next-best bids for the Chronicle were one of about $500 million
from Gannett Co., owner of USA Today; one in the low-to-mid $400
million range from Knight-Ridder, owner of the San Jose Mercury
News, and one of about $500 million from Times-Mirror, owner of the
Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by Chronicle lawyer Greg Lindstrom, Greenthal said
these offers reflected that the buyer would have to pay Hearst its
share of revenue under the joint operating agreement. She estimated
that would come to about $15 million a year from 1999 to 2005, or
about $90 million total.
</P>
<P>
   Because buyers would get only half of the printing presses that
the Chronicle jointly owns with Hearst, they faced having to spend
more money for new presses.
</P>
<P>
   When Hearst offered $660 million, Greenthal testified, ``I
believed that it is the highest price they were going to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenthal also testified that a Hearst attempt to publish The
Examiner as an independent morning paper that economically competed
against the Chronicle would be irrational, and that The Examiner
would lose $160 million and close within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Alioto, Greenthal said that in such a
newspaper war, the papers' advertising and subscription rates would
drop 10 to 15 percent. And if the Chronicle were the only daily
paper in San Francisco, she said, advertising rates would increase
by about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Gary Halling, a San Francisco lawyer for the
Hearst Corp., gave an explanation about why Hearst executives did
not know earlier about Examiner Publisher White's December
deposition that he had offered San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
support in The Examiner's editorial pages in exchange for his
backing Hearst's bid for the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Halling said Thackeray, Hearst's general counsel, was initially
at the deposition, taken by Justice Department lawyers at Hearst's
New York offices in their review of the company's proposed purchase
of the Chronicle. But Thackeray was not present for White's
testimony, said Halling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was alone in the deposition at the time,'' Halling said. ``I
saw no antitrust significance at all to that comment, and I passed
on to senior management simply that the deposition had gone very
well.''

BMW RAISES NEW DOUBTS ABOUT DEAL ON ROVER UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Germany's Bayerische Motorenwerke AG raised new doubts
Friday about the likelihood of a deal with a British consortium to
rescue its loss-making Rover Cars operations at one of Britain's
biggest auto plants.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has been talking this week with the so-called Phoenix
Consortium, which is supported by labor unions and the British
government, after earlier negotiations with Alchemy Partners, a
British venture capital firm, collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The myth-laden names of BMW's successive negotiating partners,
Alchemy and Phoenix, have come to reinforce a sense among analysts
that Rover will need something close to a miracle to survive.
</P>
<P>
   In developments Friday, a BMW spokesman in Munich, Germany, said
the Phoenix bid, led by former Rover chief executive John Towers,
was still under consideration but ``the financial backing is not
yet in place.'' The consortium, which is also supported by Rover
dealers, has given no indication of how it will finance its plans
to maintain Rover as a mass volume car-producer.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jon Moulton, the head of Alchemy Partners,
told British radio that there was a ``fair chance'' that BMW would
return to a deal with Alchemy, which wants to scrap the Rover brand
and produce niche sports cars under a new MG Car Co.
</P>
<P>
   Moulton said BMW must have concluded ``that mass production of
cars at Longbridge is economic suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   But British government officials who met Friday with
representatives of Phoenix said the consortium's talks with BMW
were continuing. The government officials said Phoenix had not
asked for state aid in purchasing Rover.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy's plan for Rover foresaw niche production of less than
100,000 cars a year, which would bring far greater lay-offs among
the 9,000 workers at Rover's main Longbridge plant near Birmingham
than the Phoenix proposal.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has said that it is losing over $3 million a day at the
Longbridge plant and that it will close the plant if it does not
find a buyer by the end of this month. The uncertainty has already
extracted a political price: The governing Labor party lost heavily
in the Longbridge area in local elections Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The gloom over the plant's prospects has spread to some labor
unionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't get our hopes up unnecessarily, but we shouldn't
panic either,'' said Ken Jackson, the head of Britain's largest
manufacturing union. He accused BMW of sending mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we followed every nuance from Munich, we'd believe about 10
different stories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BMW blames its losses at Rover in part on the strength of the
British pound, which makes Rover cars expensive to export. At the
same time, cheap imported vehicles from continental Europe undercut
Britain's domestic market, which the British government says is on
average 10 percent to 12 percent more expensive than continental
European equivalents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet Rover's troubles have produced the very effect that eluded
BMW's six-year, multibillion-dollar investment in the British
company.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released Friday, Rover's car sales in April
bucked the market trend and almost doubled compared to April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said Rover sold
22,665 vehicles in April, just behind top-selling Ford's 24,307 and
ahead of General Motors Corp.'s Vauxhall with 21,908. Overall, new
car sales fell 8.1 percent in April because purchasers rushed in
March to buy cars with new license plates issued every six months
to indicate a vehicle's age. But Rover sales surged because of
discounts of up to $3,200 on the top-of-the-range Rover 75, despite
worries about their resale value if Rover collapses.

<P>
   COURTING-BOUQUETS (New York) _ An unsuspecting woman received a
bouquet of flowers recently at her Fifth Avenue home. Set in a
silver-plated urn, the $350 arrangement was lush with romantic pink
roses, Italian poppies, deep-purple sweet peas, calla lillies and a
card that read, ``We'd be a good match.'' Her secret admirer? A
floral designer named David Beahm, whose intentions were not
particularly romantic. The object of his attentions is a member of
the organizing committee for a fall fund-raising gala for the
Metropolitan Opera, with the unofficial position of flower
chairwoman: she picks the florist who picks the flowers. The
unsolicited arrangement was ``a courting bouquet.''By Monique P.
Yazigi.
</P>
<P>
   MOTHER-BRIDE-FASHIONS (Undated) _ Fretting over what to wear to
her daughter's wedding, Ilene Beckerman experienced an instant of
panic. ``Everybody remembers Princess Diana's wedding dress,'' she
told herself soothingly, ``but who remembers what her mother wore?
Nobody pays attention to the mother of the bride.'' Mrs. Beckerman
knows better, of course. Taut as a snare drum, smooth and polished
as an apple, these days the mother of the bride is apt to be as
raptly scrutinized and cooed over as the bride herself. By Ruth
LaFarla.
</P>
<P>
   FRAGRANCE-BOUTIQUES (Undated) _ While customization has proved
popular recently in everything from suits to ice cream, it is
taking off in the top tiers of the fragrance industry. Creed, the
very upscale European fragrance house, whose perfumer is the
sixth-generation Oliver Creed, offers custom scents. There are also
Creed master blenders at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman and
Neiman Marcus, who can blend five or six of the existing 100 Creed
scents for customers in an hour, for the more affordable fee of
$400 to $1,000. On the West Coast there are a growing number of
fragrance boutiques like Lather in Pasadena and Homebody in Los
Angeles that blend custom scents for clients like K.D. Lang. By
Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-OSCAR-JOKE-WRITER (New York) _ The packed house at last
Wednesday night's preview of ``Bruce Vilanch: Almost Famous''
seemed to like everything about the one-man show playing at the
Westbeth Theatre Center except the title. ``Take out the Almost,''
said one audience member, sensing that Bruce Vilanch, the show's
author and star, has already crossed the threshold from wannabe to
being there. Vilanch, the New Jersey-born quipmeister who has
written for Bette Midler and Robin Williams, currently pens
one-liners for stars to deliver at the Oscars. He also writes witty
bits for celebrity appearances, including his own, on ``The
Hollywood Squares.'' By Michael Musto.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Anne Raver: I know I'm supposed to
curb my dog, but occasionally she squats when I'm not paying
attention, and it seems cruel to yank her away in midstream. Well,
I'm not going to feel sorry for her anymore. And you shouldn't feel
sorry for your dog. Because that urine kills plants and trees.
</P>
<P>
   FASHION-COPY-EDITORS (New York) _ Being a copy editor at a
women's fashion magazine _ and a male to boot _ is a little like
being the designated driver: you're around people having a lot of
fun, but you're not allowed to imbibe. Your job is to make sure the
semicolons are right; you don't get to pick up the phone and trill
``Daaahling'' or air-kiss the French photographers when they come
in with their portfolios. By Ethan Hauser.

   WASHINGTON _ Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on Friday
engaged yet another matter of great international importance:
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger joined Brazilian soccer great Pele and Latin singer _
and soccer fan _ Enrique Iglesias at a news conference held by the
Inter-American Development Bank to promote the world's favorite
sport to North and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger said he expects the game will become popular in the
United States soon because it is simpler than other American games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need too much equipment, you don't necessarily have
to have 11 players on a team, you don't need as much coaching,'' he
said. ``It has not yet penetrated into the minority groups in the
inner cities. It's still more a middle-class environment, but that
is only a question of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger said the men's World Cup in 1994 and women's World Cup
in 1999, which took place in the United States, failed to spark
widespread interest in the sport among Americans because of
low-scoring final games.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Brazil beat Italy on penalty kicks after tying 0-0
through regulation and overtime. In 1999, the U.S. women defeated
China on penalty kicks after another scoreless tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans will never understand a nothing-to-nothing game,''
he said. But he predicted that soccer will enjoy great success once
there is a publicized game in the United States that ends with a
high score.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger reported that he has not missed attending a World Cup
since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The former diplomat praised the career of Pele, who is generally
regarded as the greatest soccer player in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Pele for the first time in the 1970 World Cup and it was
really a level of football that had never been reached,'' Kissinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare anyone to Pele,'' he added, comparing Pele's
professional statistics to hitting ``80 homeruns in baseball for 15
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger explained that his own interest in soccer began at a
young age, though he was a better spectator than a participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started my career as a goalie, and believe me, those were
not low scoring games,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   He said the professional team in his hometown of Fuerth,
Germany, won several national soccer championships when he was
young.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, who immigrated to the United States in 1938, recalled
that ``the spectators were so fanatical that (the team) never lost
a home game because it was dangerous for the referee'' to make
unfavorable calls.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger said he became infatuated with the game, even lying to
his parents so he could attend matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, who thought I needed cultural elevation, would give
me tickets to the opera. I'd take the tickets and I'd go to the
football game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, 76, served as secretary of state in the Nixon and
Ford administrations and now heads the international consulting
company he founded in New York, Kissinger Associates.

&HT;     WOMAN TRAINER HOPEFUL FOR DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT GRAVES

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ A year ago, Jenine Sahadi was considering a
new line of work. Only an unwavering loyalty to her co-workers and
an unflappable passion for the game kept her marching toward a
possible rendezvous with racing history.
</P>
<P>
   No woman trainer ever has won the Kentucky Derby, but in The
Deputy, Sahadi arguably has the best chance ever to bridge the
largest gender gap associated with America's premier horse race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about quitting,'' Sahadi told reporters who swarmed
around her Thursday outside Barn 41 at Churchill Downs. ``I didn't
have anything of any consequence, but I took a look down the
shedrow one day and saw all these guys who have worked for me for
seven or eight years, and realized I'm responsible for them.''
</P>
<P>
   So she pressed on, still perplexed about having to prove herself
to owners despite winning back-to-back Breeders' Cup races in 1996
and '97 with Lit de Justice and Elmhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Racing always has been a men's club, and a couple of
million-dollar winners on racing's championship day couldn't remove
the blinders that have been worn for more than a century. A win in
the Kentucky Derby might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more a case of being in the right place at the
right time, because I know too many women that do just as much as I
do,'' said the 37-year-old Sahadi, who is among six trainers
saddling their first Derby horses. ``All it takes is one good horse
to motivate you to get up in the morning and get going.''
</P>
<P>
   She found that motivation when Team Valor's Barry Irwin and
co-owner Gary Barber entrusted her with The Deputy, an Irish-bred
who was unraced on dirt until this year, when Sahadi took over the
training from Englishman John Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare him to other horses you've had in the
past,'' said Irwin, whose Captain Bodgit finished a valiant second
in the 1997 Derby. ``You've got to treat each horse like an
individual. A lot of people can't do that. (Sahadi) can. She's very
creative and extremely talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi will have to be that and more to end this unspoken bias
and historical void in Triple Crown events. That Sahadi even has a
horse in the field is nearly history in itself. Only nine of the
712 trainers who have started horses in the Derby since 1875 were
women. Shelley Riley came closest to winning in 1992, when 29-1
long shot Casual Lies finished second behind Lil E Tee. Three have
tried since, but none had horses that finished in the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know there's nothing that precludes a woman
from doing this,'' Sahadi said. ``This is a common-sense thing.
This is taking the best possible care of your horse. Women don't
get the attention they maybe deserve because they don't get the
good horses. Nobody pays attention to bad horses.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, The Deputy has been a very good horse, winning three of
his four starts in this country after a six-horse campaign on grass
in England as a 2-year-old. He won a minor turf stake in January at
Santa Anita, then Sahadi made the move to the dirt. He won the
Santa Catalina over High Yield and Captain Steve, and Sahadi knew
she had a runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been working well on the dirt, so we decided to give
him a chance,'' she said. ``He has a lot of turf in his breeding,
but he's done pretty well on the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he has improved his performance each time out of the
gate. He lost by three-quarters of a length to Derby favorite
Fusaichi Pegasus in the San Felipe, then won the Grade I Santa
Anita Derby on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi is known as a trainer who is close to all of her horses,
and acknowledges she's a bit unconventional at times. Putting a
quarter-cup of wine in The Deputy's oats every day is a ritual not
many of her contemporaries would subscribe to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a calming effect on him,'' said Sahadi, whose
individuality has not been lost on the local fans. ``It's been
amazing. Women have brought wine to the barn. One gentleman came by
who is Lebanese, and he had his mother make some homemade Lebanese
food. I've never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sahadi sounds relaxed, it's because she is. She isn't
allowing the Derby distractions to derail her from the task at
hand, knowing it's an opportunity that might never come again. She
said she believes in her horse, though she certainly hasn't been
above taking advice from colleagues such as D. Wayne Lukas, a
four-time Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sought advice from him because I knew he would offer,'' she
said. ``He was very supportive and very helpful. I was picking his
brain before we left (California).''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi didn't have quite the same rapport with fellow trainer
Bob Baffert, who asked jockey Chris McCarron who was really
training The Deputy in a news conference before the Santa Anita
Derby. Sahadi stormed off the podium moments later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over and behind us now,'' Baffert said. ``I was joking
with McCarron. I didn't mean anything by it toward her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the exchange left a bad taste, reminiscent as it was of
the stereotyping Sahadi had seen before. She had the last word when
The Deputy won by three lengths over Baffert's Captain Steve.
</P>
<P>
   Now the big prize dangles before Sahadi, and a chance to make
previously unreachable inroads for her gender. She prefers to see
it not as a crusade, but as a chance to put another feather in her
professional cap, and a big one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to win the Derby; it would be wonderful, but I don't
spend every waking moment thinking about it,'' she said. ``I know
it's the biggest race in the world. It's sort of like the World
Cup, the World Series and the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   And certainly more exciting than whatever world she might have
entered had she walked away.

   &QL;  CORRECTED VOTE CHART WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions
regarding this transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100,
ext. 230. NOTE: TWO SENATE VOTES ON THURSDAY WERE UNAVAILABLE FOR
THIS WEEK'S CHART. THEY WILL BE INCLUDED IN NEXT WEEK'S VOTE CHART.
WASHINGTON, May 5 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: NUKE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to reach a two-thirds margin to
override President Clinton's veto of a bill to create a nuclear
waste disposal site in Nevada. Senators voted 64 to 35. The bill
would transfer more than 40,000 tons of highly radioactive waste
now held in nuclear storage facilities around the country to Yucca
Mountain in 2007. Supporters of overriding the veto said a quick
solution is needed to dispose of waste. Opponents of an override
said the location was environmentally unsound. A ``yes'' vote
favors the override.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: VOUCHERS
</P>

&HT;     TRAINER OF CAPTAIN STEVE SAYS DON'T PEAK TOO SOON _ BUT PEAK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The $4 million monster known as Fusaichi
Pegasus swaggered down the track, causing trainer/comedian Bob
Baffert to cock his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how he's going to feel,'' Baffert said, ``when my
little ol' $70,000 horse runs right past him on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert likes to poke fun at anything and everyone, including
himself. But what he's said lately about Captain Steve, his latest
Kentucky Derby sensation, doesn't qualify as humor.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert might chuckle when he says it. But he's neck deep in
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Captain Steve just couldn't be any more ready to go,'' he
said. ``I've never had a horse as ready to go in Kentucky as this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the talk sweeping this town is of Fusaichi Pegasus,
who is fueling hopes of a Triple Crown championship even before
setting hoof in the starting gate at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   He is the most physically developed 3-year-old to pass in front
of these eyes since Secretariat. He is also the ``crazy horse,''
the one who bucked more than a rodeo bronco a couple of days ago
before a morning workout.
</P>
<P>
   But if Baffert is writing the story line here on Saturday, it
will be Rich Horse-Poor Horse. Baffert began spreading that word
the moment the media army dug in its heels outside of Barn 33 a few
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golly, I've never had the kind of money to buy a horse like
that,'' Baffert said of Fusaichi Pegasus. ``I sure hope he is worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Baffert can put his money where his mouth is. Silver
Charm, his 1997 Kentucky Derby champion, was bought at a sale for
$80,000.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Baffert's Real Quiet won the Derby, the Preakness
and came within a nose of taking the Triple Crown. And he cost the
grand sum of $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   You can barely buy a Honda with that kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Baffert's owners love him. Not only has he won
two of the last three Derbys with relatively cheap horses, he came
within a breath of taking the 1996 roses when Cavonnier fell to
Grindstone by a nostril.
</P>
<P>
   The man has a formula, and it's quite simple. Don't peak too
soon. But make sure you peak.
</P>
<P>
   For example, his last two Kentucky Derby winners finished second
in their final tuneup, the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Almost following suit, Captain Steve finished third at the Santa
Anita Derby four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then something quite Baffert-like happened. The horse started to
train better, eat more, cruise without blinkers and, as the trainer
said, ``his feet stopped hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Voila! It's Baffert magic. His horses simply run their best on
the first Saturday of each May.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the wand he waves, Baffert isn't the most popular guy
on the back side of the track, where trainers don't wear $200
shades, or have flowing silver hair.
</P>
<P>
   They wear hats and boots and spit a stream of Red Man between
broken sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all of them. But most are blue collar compared to
Baffert's California cool.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing that Baffert has going for him is a warm-hearted
human interest story.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve is named for Captain Steve Thompson, commander of
the criminal investigations unit with the Louisville Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   When horse owner Mike Pegram was arrested at the Louisville
Airport for unwittingly packing a .357 in his carry-on bag in 1997,
it was Thompson who convinced airport officials not to file
charges.
</P>
<P>
   As gratitude, Pegram named one of his top 3-year olds after
Captain Steve. And wouldn't you know it? The horse would be good
enough to play in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, Baffert and Pegram have been soaking up the media
spotlight this week, and that is good for business.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of D. Wayne Lukas, there is no one close to Baffert when
it comes to media friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Bob Baffert, it seems the rich get richer.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. He's the guy with the poor-man's horse, isn't he?

 &HT;    HOUSE REPUBLICANS ACCUSE CENSUS HEAD OF PLAYING POLITICS
 &HT;    460&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stoking the issue of privacy rights, House
Republicans on Friday accused the Census Bureau director of playing
politics by criticizing GOP leaders who suggested that Americans
need not fill out their census questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee on
the census, said the census long form and its probing questions,
not Republican comments about it, sparked the public controversy
that prompted some Americans to decline to answer some questions or
refuse to return the form altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Kenneth Prewitt, a career scholar and White House
appointee as census director, was ``attempting to politicize the
census at this crucial period in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, among others, suggested last month that
Americans should not have to answer questions they believe violate
their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials said Prewitt's recent remarks have been
directed at both congressional leaders and the White House for
failing to join voices in a bipartisan effort to trumpet what
should be regarded as a patriotic duty.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance Friday before the House subcommittee, Prewitt
challenged Miller to produce evidence that he had ever directly
criticized Republican leaders. ``I don't believe that such a quote
exists,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt repeated his contention, though, that ``national public
voices'' picked an inappropriate time _ with the public's attention
focused on the census through an extensive ad campaign _ to suggest
that the questionnaire, which is mandated by the Constitution, was
optional.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not a good moment to talk about the census as a
'pick-and-choose' opportunity,'' Prewitt told the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Miller's criticism of Prewitt, Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y., said Republican leaders were trying to ``pander to
talk shows and right-wing fringe groups'' in an effort to ``trash''
the census for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Most of America's 120 million households received the short
form, with eight basic questions. One in six received the long
form, with 53 questions, including details about income, lifestyle
and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the climate of public resistance, Census Bureau officials
said there was no evidence thus far to suggest that census takers,
known as enumerators, are being rebuffed at a greater rate as they
go door to door compared to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The 500,000 census-takers have run into problems, though. Census
Bureau officials have recorded 212 incidents of dog bites, a bad
bee sting and four episodes in Alaska where the enumerators were
met at the door by a homeowner with a gun. None of the gun
incidents resulted in violence.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Census-takers so far have canvassed about 8 percent of the 42
million households that did not return questionnaires, roughly
matching the agency's expectations to date. The door-to-door effort
to reach the remainder of homes continues through mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials believe that if the controversy had not
erupted the agency would have come closer to reaching its national
goal of a 70 percent response rate.
</P>
<P>
   With a mail-back response rate nearing 66 percent, the Census
Bureau managed to halt a three-decade slide in the share of
American households that return the form. The slight gain from
1990's 65 percent response rate came largely on a strong response
from Hispanics and African-Americans, who were targeted among other
minority groups by the Census Bureau's promotional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in the census, as in other civic acts like voting,
has been in decline. In 1980, 75 percent of households returned
their census forms compared with 83 percent in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The rate is an important factor is producing an accurate census
and in reducing the cost of the once-a-decade national count. The
Government Accounting Office estimates a savings of $34 million for
each percentage point above 61 percent, the level used as a
benchmark for planning the census.

&HT;     EDUCATION BECOMES AN EXPLOSIVE ISSUE FOR SENATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, May 7)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For 35 years, Congress and the White House have
joined in bipartisan harmony to dole out federal money for
education. But election year politics have thrust the program into
turbulence this year, and one veteran senator says he has never
seen anything like the political storm swirling around education.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers traditionally have had differences over how to spend
billions of federal education dollars, with Republicans wanting to
cede more control to local governments and Democrats favoring more
spending for federally designated programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the senators charged with updating the
five-year Elementary and Secondary Education Act were especially
unyielding over how to spend $14 billion that pays for more than 50
educational programs, most of which are aimed helping disadvantaged
students. The debate resumes this week, with little chance for
quick resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government provides just 7 percent of the money for
public schools, but the policy set by Congress often guides
spending decisions on the state and local levels.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a leader on education issues,
said he has never seen such partisan ``edge'' over the
reauthorization of the major education legislation. The law was
first signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has never been a
partisan issue before this year,'' Kennedy said in an interview.
``This is the first time in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he detects ``very little indication of a
willingness'' to compromise on the part of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the Republicans, who are pushing block grants that
would give more local control over the federal spending, want ``a
radical departure'' from the current formula. He added he would be
enthusiastic about changing the funding formula when Congress has
more time, but said it won't work now, with 45 days left in the
session.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the partisan rancor is the presidential race, with
Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore touting education
proposals almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Democrats are floating volatile gun amendments they
want to add to the education measure that could cause a stalemate
in the Senate and prompt Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to
remove the bill from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress fails to reauthorize the five-year education bill,
congressional appropriators would allocate money for the existing
programs year by year. But House Education and Workforce Chairman
Bill Goodling, R-Pa., a former school superintendent, said that
would be a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll go on appropriating for programs that don't work,''
Goodling said. If that happens, ``you haven't improved anything,
you just hand out a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling said the $130 billion spent on programs for
disadvantaged students since the program began in 1965 has done
little to close the achievement gap because schools have not been
held responsible for getting better results. That federal money has
gone mainly for hiring aides to instruct children on reading and
math, but Goodling said many of them are not well qualified because
of low hiring standards.
</P>
<P>
   Goodling said he feared election-year politics ``unfortunately''
may derail the Senate bill. ``If you don't get things done in the
first year, it's very hard to get them done,'' Goodling said.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the education bill is split into seven pieces,
which would have to be merged with a Senate bill, if the Senate
passes a bill. So far four of the seven components of the House
legislation have been approved and two are expected to come up in
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious issues in the Senate bill are proposals
pushed by Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. One provision under fire from
Senate Democrats, known as the ``Straight A's'' proposal, would set
up a pilot program to allow 15 states to spend their share of the
federal money as they choose, as long as they get good academic
results.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal under attack _ known as ``portability'' _ would
allow states to let parents of disadvantaged children to remove
their child from existing programs and spend their child's share of
the money (an average of $500 per year) to enroll in another public
school, in an after-school program or to hire a tutor.
</P>
<P>
   A third GOP proposal would let states allow parents to take any
child out of a failing public school and enroll in a better one if
the school has been designated as failing by the state for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said his proposals would let states and school districts
try new approaches to help children learn. ``Local people know what
works best for educating their kids,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said the Republican approach is ``like a cafeteria line''
that allows states to choose.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said the Republican proposals
would strip money away from the schools that are most in need.
``Great schools will get a windfall of money that comes to them at
the expense of schools that need it more,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic leader Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota
slammed the Republican approach as equivalent to writing a ``blank
check.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and a large bloc of Democrats have their own
plans for public education.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic proposals would provide $1.3 billion in grants and
loans to fix deteriorating schools; to shrink class sizes by hiring
100,000 teachers; invest $2 billion next year to help states
recruit and train teachers; and provide $1 billion next year to pay
for an after-school program.
</P>
<P>
   But there is even dissension among Democrats. Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the moderate Democratic leadership
council, and Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., seek to broker a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan would boost funding by $35 billion over five years,
rewarding states that exceed their academic performance goals,
while cutting funds to states that don't meet them.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Democrats' plan would condense all of the federal
programs into five grants aimed at general goals: closing the
achievement gap between minorities and white students; helping
immigrants with academics; improving teacher quality; providing
more choices among public schools; and testing new teaching ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said the proposal would keep federal spending focused
on broad goals while eliminating many of the programs that have
multiplied over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said Republicans are listening to the
Democrats who are trying to reach a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are forces out there that are truly looking for another
approach,'' Mack said. ``But the forces of gridlock are always out
there lurking.''

</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the question of how to improve public education
arises almost daily on the presidential campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Republican campaign is calling for more flexibility for
states and local governments in spending money from Washington and
wants vouchers to pull children out of failing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore echoes many of his fellow Democrats in calling for
universal preschool, teacher testing and programs to repair school
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last week embarked on a two-day tour of public schools
in Kentucky, Iowa, Minnesota and Ohio to draw attention to his
proposals to hold failing schools more accountable, boost school
construction, open more charter schools and improve teacher
quality. Clinton, who hopes to burnish his legacy as the education
president, has threatened to veto the initiatives contained in the
Republican bill.

REBELS IN SIERRA LEONE HOLDING MORE THAN 300 U.N. PERSONNEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

   UNITED NATIONS _ In their most audacious baiting of the U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone so far, rebel fighters
disarmed an entire convoy of Zambian peacekeepers, took the 208
soldiers hostage and appeared to be driving 13 hijacked armored
personnel carriers toward the capital, U.N. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The convoy, which was dispatched from Lungi, a port town, to
reinforce other peacekeeping troops at Makeni in central Sierra
Leone, lost radio contact on Thursday with the U.N. mission in
Freetown, the capital of the battered West African country. That
prompted concern about their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the chief spokesman of the United Nations, Fred Eckhard,
said the 208 Zambians had been detained, bringing to 318 the number
of U.N. peacekeepers believed to be held by the Revolutionary
United Front, as the insurgents call themselves.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``While there has been no word of fighting in Sierra Leone
today,'' Eckhard said, ``we have received as of yet unconfirmed
information of military movement by the Revolutionary United Front,
possibly involving the use of U.N. armored personnel carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another U.N. official said the distinctive troop carriers, which
are white with the bold black identifying letters ``U.N.,'' had
been sighted by helicopter surveillance flights. The armored
personnel carriers, he said, had changed direction and were last
seen heading back toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the rebels were driving the vehicles or
forcing Zambians to do it. It also remained unclear how an armored
convoy could have been overwhelmed without a fight by guerrillas
who normally carry light weapons.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration of the precarious peace achieved in Sierra
Leone has increased pressure on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to achieve a solution to the United Nations' newest crisis in
Africa. Annan expressed concern in Paris on Thursday that the
setbacks could give member countries second thoughts about
contributing troops to a peacekeeping operation being assembled in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels on Friday released a four-man Russian helicopter crew
and two passengers who had been detained Tuesday in eastern Sierra
Leone. They were permitted to fly back to Freetown after the
Liberian president, Charles Taylor, who has been sympathetic to the
rebels, called their leader, Foday Sankoh, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Taylor told the secretary-general yesterday that he
had been tough with Sankoh in the phone conversation he had with
him,'' Eckhard said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has requested help from the leaders of Algeria, Burkina
Faso, Libya, Mali, Nigeria and Togo in interceding with the rebel
leader, who has denied that his fighters are holding any U.N.
peacekeepers hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The efforts right now are political in nature,'' Eckhard said,
and attempt to induce leaders with influence over Sankoh to make
him comply with the terms of the peace agreement he accepted last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 208 Zambian soldiers, an estimated 110 other
U.N. peacekeepers, military observers and civilian workers are
being held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Another 100 or so soldiers from a Nigerian unit near Kambia, in
northwestern Sierra Leone, were detained by the rebels and released
without their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the clashes that erupted early this week, four
Kenyan soldiers are missing and presumed dead, and 12 peacekeepers
are wounded.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Monday was Decision Day for many high school
seniors choosing colleges, but it came and went without so much as
a peep from the Bush campaign about the destinations of Gov. George
W. Bush's twin 18-year-old daughters, Barbara and Jenna.
</P>
<P>
   How far from home would they be straying? The Texas governor's
aides were silent. What factors had the girls' final selection
hinged on? Mum was the word. Aides acknowledged that the
information would probably trickle out soon enough, through an
unguarded utterance by Bush or an offhand comment by an official at
one of the schools. But for just a bit longer, the family wanted to
try to preserve the girls' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family has been remarkably successful at that, so much
so that while Bush could become the next president and while his
extended family is beginning to look an awful lot like a political
dynasty, his two daughters are almost invisible, their faces
unknown to 99.9 percent of voters outside Texas and their public
sightings only slightly more frequent than Bigfoot's.
</P>
<P>
   They have appeared only a few times on the campaign trail, and
they have not shown up in their father's commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time he was elected governor, we've had a policy that
the girls are not interviewed and not photographed,'' said Karen
Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign and a
senior adviser to Bush since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being out of the ordinary, the daughters' anonymity
immediately recalls that of Chelsea Clinton during her father's
first presidential campaign, in 1992, and is shared to a degree by
the three younger Gore children. (The oldest, Karenna Gore Schiff,
26, has a public role as an adviser to her father's presidential
campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   And it proves that even in an age when politicians will use most
facets of their biographies to market themselves and the press
shines a spotlight into many corners of a politician's private
life, there remains at least one largely unexploited, scrutiny-free
zone. The children are spared.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have often
been portrayed as indiscriminately ambitious, Tom Rosenstiel,
director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism in Washington,
noted that ``for the most part, the Clintons have not used Chelsea
as a campaign tool.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Rosenstiel said, ``for all of the controversy and
invasiveness of the press coverage concerning Bill Clinton, with a
handful of exceptions, the press has respected the Clintons' wish
to leave Chelsea alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has similarly benefited from news organizations' voluntary
restraint. Austin is not so big a place, and there are reporters
whose children _ or whose friends' children _ attend the same
public high school from which Barbara and Jenna Bush will be
graduating this month. But the fruits of that familiarity have not
found their way onto television or into newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush trusts reporters on his campaign plane to be
cognizant of, and to respect, his wishes that his daughters remain
journalistically off-limits, and he thus talks somewhat freely
about them on occasion and even mentioned, several times, the kinds
of colleges each daughter was considering.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara, named for her paternal grandmother, actually hopped
aboard the campaign plane on Saturday and used it as her
transportation from Austin to New York City to take a last look at
one of the colleges near the top of her list. But she kept a
careful distance from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstiel and several political press secretaries said there
seemed to be an unspoken covenant between politicians and
journalists: If a politician does not press his or her children
into sustained service as political props, journalists have little
rationale for examining in detail the children's lives, at least
when the children are still school-age.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts noted that while most candidates and elected
officials undoubtedly keep their children offstage to protect them,
there may be political benefit as well, in that voters are likely
to take note of, and admire, that course of action.
</P>
<P>
   The personal-biography section of Bush's Web site digresses to
mention, ``Governor and Mrs. Bush have worked hard to protect their
daughters' privacy. They attend public school in Austin but do not
give interviews and only appear at public events if they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, Bush walks a carefully but not always consistently
drawn line. He sporadically delights audiences with a fleeting,
vague riff on the agonies and ecstasies of fatherhood and
repeatedly mentions that Barbara and Jenna go to a public high
school. But he generally furnishes no more specifics about them
than about the family's six-toed cat, Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions to this reticence, the most conspicuous one
being a chapter of his autobiography, ``A Charge to Keep'' (William
Morrow &AMP; Co., 1999), in which Bush discusses his support for the
death penalty. He divulges that one daughter _ he does not say
which _ told him over the dinner table that she disagrees with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, have said repeatedly that they want
Barbara and Jenna, fraternal twins who are the couple's only
children, to be affected by their father's political celebrity as
little as possible.
</P>
<P>
   From what little has been published or broadcast in Texas about
the girls, they have managed to maintain relatively normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   When the family first moved to Austin, the girls attended the
St. Andrews Episcopal School here, but they transferred to Austin
High School in the ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   And they behaved as teen-agers typically do, bowing to the
latest pop-cultural fashions and sometimes remarking on how
unfashionable their father was. In interviews with Texas
journalists in the past, Bush bemoaned that the girls'
television-watching habits, at least a few years ago, included
``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Melrose Place,'' and noted that they
would sometimes stop their father before he walked out the door,
questioning his choice of attire.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a governor's children, they were not constantly escorted
or monitored by guards, but security around the entire family
tightened earlier this year with the arrival of the Secret Service,
much to the girls chagrin, an aide to Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their friends can no longer pull in the back driveway of the
governor's mansion or just drop in and out,'' the aide said.
``That's no fun for teen-age girls, and that's been a big change
for them.
</P>
<P>
   According to the aide and several of Bush's friends, the girls'
low public profile reflects their own desires as much as their
parents' efforts. For example, Barbara and Jenna Bush briefly
considered accompanying their parents to the polls in Texas for the
Republican primary; it was, after all, the first election cycle in
which the girls were old enough to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But when they found out that photographers would be chronicling
their father's movements, they decided not to go. Similarly,
Barbara and Jenna appeared on stage with their father only twice in
the primaries: once in New Hampshire, on the night that he lost to
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and once in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's advisers said Barbara and Jenna Bush had learned
early on that even the most seemingly harmless exposure could yield
accidental humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   About six years ago, when a television crew shot footage of the
Bushes decorating their Christmas tree, the telephone rang and Bush
joked that it might be a boy who liked Jenna. When the story was
broadcast, it included both that comment and Jenna's mortified
reaction.

 &HT;    Bard of medicine
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jacques Hyppolite Guiteau did not hesitate
when he reached the great fork in life's road, the one that leads
cool and logical left brainers to calculus class and dreamy right
brainers to a writer's garret.
</P>
<P>
   He went both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Guiteau began writing poetry at age 12 in his native Haiti and
was buoyed by the warm response from his family, friends and
teachers, but he already had medical school in mind. He managed to
fuse both interests throughout his school years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, I majored in French, Greek and Latin,'' he says.
``It made medical school easier. I understood the roots of many
medical terms. They immediately made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   As a student, he carried the works of Jean-Baptiste Rousseau,
Alphonse de Lamartine and other French poets along with his medical
texts. As a doctor, he carries their inspiration along with the
stress of his family practice in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with suffering on a daily basis,'' he says. ``If I see
30 patients, that means 30 problems I have to solve. The mind is
always busy. It needs a diversion. That is what poetry does for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Guiteau, 50, has drawn emotional balm from the role of bard
throughout his medical career. In Haiti, he wrote love poems to his
wife, Frantz, while interning at a tuberculosis hospital in
Port-au-Prince. Later, as the only Haitian-born physician in Palm
Beach County, he shouldered a heavy load from West Palm Beach to
Belle Glade.
</P>
<P>
   His community health work won him the honor of Palm Beach County
Doctor of the Year from the state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services in 1992. But it challenged his spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was treating AIDS patients for four years, and I got burned
out,'' he says. ``There was very little you could do for people
with AIDS in those days. I had one entire family _ mom, dad and the
kids, all with AIDS. It was devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Guiteau found comfort by conjuring images of his own wife and
three children and of his childhood in Haiti. He still does.
Between raging fevers and broken arms, between failing hearts and
aching stomachs, Guiteau steals a little time for his own soul. He
retreats to his office, closes the door and picks up a pen.
</P>
<P>
   DREAMING WITH OPEN EYES
</P>
<P>
   Seated in my office watching the
</P>
<P>
   rooftops
</P>
<P>
   Your image appears before me
</P>
<P>
   What can I do
</P>
<P>
   to stop the phantom
</P>
<P>
   which follows me
</P>
<P>
   like a shadow
</P>
<P>
   And does nothing but persist
</P>
<P>
   as time passes?
</P>
<P>
   Day and night blend together
</P>
<P>
   to enfold you in me infinitely
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for his patients, Guiteau is blessed with a
compliant muse. ``I never spend more than 15 minutes on a poem,''
he says. ``It just comes to me.'' So he can be serious about poetry
and medicine without choosing between them.
</P>
<P>
   It's a luxury few others have enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   John Keats was apprenticed to a surgeon as a teenager but quit
medicine after a year of formal study. He barely had time to share
his own daydream about a Grecian urn before he died at age 26 in
1824.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Conan Doyle had a family practice in Scotland but wrote
stories and poems on the side to make ends meet. Doyle's poetry is
not nearly as well-remembered as his tales of a detective named
Sherlock Holmes. He quit medicine at the height of Holmes'
popularity, then returned years later to become an army surgeon. He
died in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   William Carlos Williams is probably the best-known doctor-poet
of the 20th century. Williams, who died in 1963, won acclaim for
evocative images of such unlikely subjects as plums, wheelbarrows
and Paterson, N.J. He kept up his medical practice throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those predecessors, Guiteau has not had to deal with the
distraction of literary fame. He wouldn't mind trying. He took his
first big step in 1994 when he released a French-language poetry
CD, ``Les Sons Du Coeur, Poemes en Musique.'' It was an ambitious
project: Guiteau hired a narrator and commissioned an original
background score. It cost him $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something different,'' he says. ``Sometimes, when you
read poetry, it gets tiring. But if you listen, and you have nice
music to go along with it, that may keep you interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Guiteau says he shipped some to France and Canada and sold
others locally. Some were bought by patients _ posters advertising
his CDs are interspersed with awards and framed poems along the
walls of his waiting room _ and others by the Haitian community,
where Guiteau is well known as longtime host of a radio show and
for his community activities, including an annual health fair.
</P>
<P>
   How many copies was that in all? He smiles at the question. ``I
still have a few,'' he says. ``It's something the public is not
used to.''
</P>
<P>
   He has enough faith in the form to keep trying. He released a
``Happy Millennium'' CD to celebrate the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   LOVE, BE THE MOTIVATOR OF THIS NEW YEAR
</P>
<P>
   In order that all become loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Not to forget as well the unfortunate ones.
</P>
<P>
   They also merit our kindness
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, for Valentine's Day, he released an English-language
version of the first collection, ``Sounds of the Heart.'' Both
English releases are available through Internet vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Guiteau will waste no time watching the Billboard charts, or
waiting for a call from the Pulitzer Prize committee. His
satisfaction comes from within, and from the certainty that at
least some of the people who hear his poetry will be touched by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to make a new CD every year,'' he says, adding that he
is unlikely to change his theme. ``I tell people: Love makes life
easier for everybody.''

NEW YORK COLUMN: CHAPTER ONE: A MURDER MOST JUICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Bold type should be set in italics.)  
 By CLYDE HABERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
 &UR; She was standing outside my office, her long blond hair cascading
like Niagara Falls down her shoulder. One look at those legs, and I
knew this one would be trouble.  &LR;  Hang on, hang on, hang on. That
doesn't sound right. Let's start over.
 &UR; Ruby Slade had done an awful lot of living for someone on the near
side of 20. Not much of it was good.  &LR;  No, that doesn't make it,
either. Dang, this business of writing a mystery story is harder
than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a swing by the Grand Hyatt Hotel the other day to
realize just how difficult making a go of it can be. Really hard.
But doable.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the message of a symposium held at the hotel
for the benefit of hopeful men and women with visions of becoming
the next Grisham or Cornwell. Some had already been published, and
more than once. But they were still in search of the big kahuna,
the book that could bring megadeals and a one-way ticket to La-La
Land.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was organized by the Mystery Writers of America,
and was one of several events leading to the group's presentation
of its annual Edgar Allan Poe Awards Thursday night. What happened
at the awards dinner is itself a mystery to us, though. We never
made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dress to kill,'' the invitation said. But nothing in the
closet remotely worked. You try living with clothes that can't even
wound, let alone kill. So we stuck with the symposium, which
offered hints from writers, editors and publishers on how to go
about shaping suspense tales to die for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has a really good mystery could be tomorrow's
millionaire,'' said Walter Wager, who has not done badly for
himself at this craft. One of his books, ``58 Minutes,'' was the
basis for the movie ``Die Hard 2.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned that he has a new novel called ``Tunnel''
(Forge/Tom Doherty and Associates), about former East German agents
who, Wager said, ``go for a big heist and hijack the Lincoln
Tunnel.'' Frankly, we thought that had been done, by the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey. But why not try a variation?
</P>
<P>
   The good news at this symposium was that the mystery novel _ or
``crime fiction,'' as the writer Lawrence Block preferred _ remains
a vibrant form.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have fretted that it may be done in by today's lower
homicide rates. You may recall that similar concerns were expressed
about the suspense thriller soon after the Cold War ended. But
there are always fresh villains in need of a good throttling. If
not the Soviets, then the Iraqis. If not Iraqis, then Serbs. After
the Serbs, who knows? Why not the dot-com geeks?
</P>
<P>
   And all a mystery writer needs, after all, is one good juicy
murder.
</P>
<P>
   That and an agent, cautioned John Baker, editorial director of
Publishers Weekly. Mary Higgins Clark, the best-selling author,
agreed. Without an agent, she said, ``it's almost impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with one, life for a writer today can be an ordeal, said
John Feldcamp, chief executive officer of Xlibris, an online
publishing services company in Philadelphia. The major publishing
houses are taking on fewer new mystery writers, he and others said.
Their focus seems to be more on brand-name authors who will land on
best-seller lists as surely as Leonardo DiCaprio will wind up
bold-faced in gossip columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're holding a first novel in your hand right now,''
Feldcamp said, ``your chances of being published are one in 400.''
</P>
<P>
   A collective gasp of surprise and dismay arose from some in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there are ways to improve the odds, speakers advised.
</P>
<P>
   Like giving your sleuth an interesting specialty. (No reason why
someone who goes antiquing couldn't find himself wrapped in a
mystery, Baker said.) Or like writing in depth about a place. Or
maybe putting a child in danger. ``A missing child is a grabber,''
Clark said. ``I've left kids alone for a while, but if things get
tough, you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   No one argued with Baker when he said that even more than a good
plot, a mystery writer must have a strong voice. OK, we can do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``Editors seem to be looking for a sassy female
voice these days.'' Gulp! Where does that leave us Y chromosome
types?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the answer is to take Clark's advice, maybe with a
ripped-from-the-headlines twist. That's it! Forget the blonde.
 &UR; Elian Gonzalez had done an awful lot of living for someone on the
near side of 7. Not much of it was good.  &LR;  It sings.

BUSH-MCCAIN MEETING A MATTER OF CHEMISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The difference between running for president and getting picked
as a vice presidential nominee is the difference between physics
and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush and John McCain were dueling banjos, racing
around from primary to primary yanking all the levers of publicity
and politicking, that was physics, the science of matter in motion.
</P>
<P>
   But when the pair meet Tuesday in Pittsburgh for their
long-delayed bury-the-hatchet session, the outcome depends upon
chemistry, where the interaction of different substances relies on
totally different laws.
</P>
<P>
   It's the difference between wholesale and retail, selling
yourself to millions of anonymous voters, on the one hand, and
selling one other politician on yourself as No. 1, or him or
herself as No. 2. It requires a different set of skills.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said umpteen times he's not interested in being vice
president, never-never-never-cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die. Bush
has said he'll only pick a running mate who likes him. You can toss
both those claims in the trashcan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain could be persuaded, I believe, if it was done in the
right way. How's that? Putting it to him as a matter of patriotism,
honor, duty, all the stuff that's crammed into McCain's speeches,
his autobiography, his Victory Lap tour of booksignings.
</P>
<P>
   But I am yet to be persuaded that Bush wants McCain, or feels he
needs McCain, to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In the early going, when Bush was way ahead, and had all the
money anyone could conceivably need, and nearly the whole of the
Republican establishment was whispering sweet nothings in the Texas
governor's ear, the Bush body language toward McCain was confident,
matey, jocular.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's mah buddy,'' Bush would chirp at every photo op. ``We
get along fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But then McCain's numbers started zooming up, and Bush's numbers
got all weak in the knees in New Hampshire and then New England,
and Bush lost a few, and got rattled. Like his father did in 1988,
Bush Jr. went negative, and it worked, like it almost always works.
McCain got rolled up, and since the March primaries that ended the
war, each man has gone his own way.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has kept his distance artfully, setting up his Straight
Talk America political action committee, re-visiting the Hanoi
Hilton on a lavishly-documented Vietnam War anniversary tour, and
promising McCainiacs he'll never go in the tank on the gut issue of
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   We'll get to know Bush's choice before Al Gore's because the
Republican convention comes at the end of July in Philadelphia, and
Gore has another two weeks before his convention in Los Angeles. It
is a commonplace assumption within the political crowd that McCain
would be the strongest choice Bush could make. But that view is by
no means unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's pluses are that he is popular with moderates and
Democrats, the people who can be moved to vote for you in November;
that the Arizona flyboy has demigod status with a lot of the media;
and that his well-honed stump skills will maximize his potential
to, as he so deftly put it in a thousand stump speeches, ``beat Al
Gore like a drum.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   McCain is a maverick. Though he survived in the military, a
heirarchal system at least as straight-jacketed as the vice
presidential role, he was always a rebel, a rock-and-roll
wave-maker and apple-cart-upsetter.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if Bush can feel secure and serene with
McCain bouncing around the playing field. Presidents like to have
their vice presidents shut up for long stretches. Bush Sr. bit his
tongue for Reagan for eight long years. And Al Gore's seven long
and lean years of apprenticeship under Clinton cemented him in the
role of Clinton's understudy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has to think long and hard about what happens if a
Bush-McCain ticket loses to the Democrats. Does that set McCain up
to be a lusty rival for the GOP presidential nomination in 2004?
And what does a McCain selection as running mate portend for the
other Republicans who'd like to take a crack running against
President Gore next time, if it comes to that?
</P>
<P>
   Presidential nominees look at running mates with a whole new set
of spectacles. You have to set aside the microscope and pick up the
telescope: how far can I go with this person?
</P>
<P>
   The classic cases of nominees taking bitter foes onto the ticket
are JFK and Reagan. Kennedy embraced Lyndon Johnson after being
persuaded he needed the southerner to balance the ticket sufficient
to win the Electoral College. Reagan had formed a low opinion of
Bush Sr. after their hilarious encounter in the Nashua, N.H. high
school gym where Bush, with ungentlemanly ill-grace, refused to
share the microphone with Bob Dole and three other rivals,
triggering the Gipper's famous ``I'm paying for this microphone. .
.'' outburst.
</P>
<P>
   But in a Detroit hotel room on the eve of the 1980 GOP
convention, Reagan was persuaded that only by embracing Bush, the
candidate of the Eastern Establishment and the Non-Voodoo School of
Economix, could the Gipper dump an incumbent president. So there's
ample precedent for taking a former enemy on as your co-pilot, if
that's what it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has other alternatives. There's Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge, a low-key pro-choice Catholic, popular in a state Bush needs
to win. The electoral college map can never be discarded in this
kind of game. The no-better-than-slim-outside-chance that Bush
could carry New York state probably dooms the chances of New York's
Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   But all those considerations of past tangles, ideological
friction, and electoral map-making pale in comparison to the level
of personal security the No. 1 man has in contemplating his choice
of No. 2. If Bush really wants McCain, he should make that plain
Tuesday in Pittsburgh. It's not hard to write a scenario in which
McCain could find it impossible to say no to a summons to duty,
honor, country.
</P>
<P>
   We should know Tuesday night if Bush is smart enough, secure
enough, and strong enough in his own persona to take that step.

 &HT;    Churches that hate have no love of God
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Many churches need someone to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Religious groups have grown strong by promoting hatred in the
name of a God of love. But their behavior is in absolute
contradiction to the God they profess to serve.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example is a small religious community in West Palm
Beach that calls itself the Eternal Gospel Church of Seventh-day
Adventists.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-member church calls Jesus Lord by preaching hatred of
Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Their vocal ranting against the Roman Catholic Church is so
vitriolic that the national denomination of Seventh-day Adventists
went to court to deny them the right to use their name.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination of nearly 1 million people, which has tempered
its own once-venomous prejudice of Catholicism, won the judgment.
Still, the local church plans to ignore the order and continue to
use the name.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-day Adventists observe the Jewish Sabbath, the seventh
day of the week, rather than Sunday as their day of worship. The
denomination has long taught that the pope and fourth-century
Emperor Constantine invented Sunday as the Lord's Day in a vast
self-serving conspiracy contrary to God's will.
</P>
<P>
   That is the basis of their anti-Catholic rancor, which, at
times, has identified the pope with the Antichrist, Satan and the
dread Beast of the Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the denomination has made significant effort to
be less narrow-minded, though the teaching about Sunday is
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Seventh-day Advent movement began in 1844. Founder Ellen
Wright gathered the remnant of a group that was in despair when the
world did not end as they expected. From that ``great
disappointment,'' the church grew.
</P>
<P>
   But Adventists are not alone in preaching hatred. Bob Jones
University, the popular Christian college in South Carolina, has a
long history of anti-Catholic bias and racial prejudice warmly
embraced in the name of God. Some pro-life believers insist God
hates doctors who perform legal abortions. Some Orthodox Jews argue
that God hates the Reform and Conservative Jewish traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Billy Graham is the most famous of a generation of
religious leaders who became popular preaching God's hatred of
communism in the '50s. Now that that philosophy is passe, many
churches, in need of a new scapegoat to hate, concentrate on
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Catholic prejudice of the Eternal Gospel Church is
outrageous but relatively insignificant because the church itself
is insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Religious hatred by mainline Protestant, Catholic and Jewish
traditions are more outrageous and far more dangerous.

 &HT;    SENATE TO TRY ONCE MORE FOR BIPARTISAN EDUCATION BILL
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _After a week of partisan sparring, the Senate will
make one last stab at trying to bridge the wide divide between
Republicans and Democrats over how to reshape school aid.
</P>
<P>
   But the most likely result still appears to be a stalemate next
week in which Democrats who favor an array of targeted aid programs
give up their losing efforts to amend the Republican bill, which
favors lumping programs into large block grants controlled by the
states.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican majority continues to block all major changes
proposed by Democrats, the minority party is expected to introduce
a gun control amendment. Because Republican leaders aren't sure
they have the votes to defeat a gun control amendment, they are
likely to end the debate by pulling the bill from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That would delay efforts to to modernize the current
six-year-old version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act
for at least one more year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're narrowing the (partisan) gap, but at this point it's
still a long shot about reaching an agreement,'' said Dan Gerstein,
press aide to Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who has led efforts
to find a compromise. ``That's not to say it would be impossible,
but in this compressed time frame and political environment, it's
really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana formed the New
Democrats, a caucus of nine Democratic senators who will introduce
their ``third way'' alternative on Tuesday. They would like to fold
the five dozen aid programs favored by the Democrats into six
``performance grants,'' but would not follow the GOP plan of giving
governors control of those grants.
</P>
<P>
   The nine spent the week shuttling back and forth between
Republican and Democratic leaders, trying to negotiate language
that could satisfy both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The other New Democrats are Sens. Bob Graham of Florida, John
Breaux and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Chuck Robb of Virginia,
Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas, Richard Bryan of Nevada and
Herb Kohl of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   They have received some concessions from their fellow Democrats
and praise from Republicans, who have met with them privately at
least three times. But so far, the Republicans have not even gone
so far as to promise them a chance for a vote on their amendment
after it is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working very closely with Sen. Lieberman and the
others,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, the Democratic
floor leader on the education bill. ``The differences between us
and them pale, in comparison with our differences with the
(Republican) side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can still reach an agreement'' with Lieberman's
group, said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. The former governor hosted one
of the negotiating sessions between the group and GOP leaders in
his office suite's Moose Room, which is named after a hunting
trophy on one wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not been privy to those conversations, but we think (the
New Democrats) have a great deal of sympathy for where we're coming
from,'' said Scott Fleming, an assistant education secretary on the
lobbying team of President Clinton, who has pledged to veto the GOP
bill if it reaches his desk in its current form.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Gregg faced off repeatedly on the Senate floor
during the first week of debate on the GOP education bill. While
courteous during sessions on the Senate floor, they took off the
gloves during separate briefings for reporters on on the shaded
lawn on the east side of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 35 years, we have functioned under a system developed by a
Democratic Congress, and it has delivered 35 years of kids unable
to read or write,'' Gregg said as he called for the federal
government to hand control over federal education aid to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said, ``It is always interesting to me to listen to
former Republican governors, who control 93 cents out of every
dollar (spent on elementary and secondary education), coming up and
lecturing others about how we ought to spend the seven cents'' that
comes from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Each accused the other of defending the status quo. Each said
that the other man's approach fails to guarantee that recipients
use federal funds to improve the academic performance of the
neediest students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are moving rather slowly, much more slowly than we
would like,'' Fleming conceded. ``But we remain eternal
optimists.''

FOR A PREPAREDNESS STORE, NO BAD NEWS IS NOT GOOD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Note spelling of dateline is different from Allegheny
River.) 
 By DAN BARRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLEGANY, N.Y. _ The gas masks are gone. The camouflage outfits
and combat knives, the first-aid kits and how-to manuals for
building underground shelters. All gone.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, that Y2K disaster thing never happened. So
Dave Boser and Bill Baxter, owners of the Survival Preparedness
Center on Main Street here, had no choice but to shut it down a
couple of weeks ago. Now the dedicated campers and those
lock-and-load militia boys from the surrounding hills of western
New York will have to go elsewhere for their dehydrated fruit mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Y2K, there were so many people in the store that we
couldn't take care of them,'' Baxter said Saturday, his voice
echoing in the nearly empty store. The ensuing silence spoke to the
dramatic drop in business after New Year's Day _ when a feared
computer problem did not cast the world into darkness and the dawn
of the year 2000 did not bring nuclear winter.
</P>
<P>
   In the corner sat size 10 cans of ``Provident Pantry''
dehydrated food _ elbow macaroni, blueberry muffins, egg whites _
that will keep for a decade. Nearby was half a case of 100-hour
paraffin candles. Still taped to the wall, just above the now-empty
knife case, were the business cards of recruiters for the Navy and
the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   But the preparedness entrepreneurs have not abandoned their
business. They plan to put together a catalog of their merchandise,
and have hopes of selling some of the leftover inventory at cost. A
Mormon church in the area has already expressed interest in their
429 cans of dehydrated food.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows when fear of a looming disaster might drum up some
more interest?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the two men now have the kind of customer
service experience not to be found at the Wal-Mart store just two
miles down the road. They have loaded up the cars of two women
known as the ``Y2K queens,'' witnessed firsthand the economic
impact of prophecies, and rung up sales for skinheads from Altoona,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of smart people out there,'' Boser said, peering
from under his ``Vietnam Veteran &AMP; Proud of It'' hat. ``And a lot
of dumb people.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegany is a small town of 8,500 people along New York's
Southern Tier, about 60 miles south of Buffalo. It is a place where
the Allegheny River beckons and the foothills lend crispness to the
air, a place where students from nearby Saint Bonaventure
University come to live for a while, then leave. But the farmers
and the shop owners, the Dave Bosers and Bill Baxters, stay; it is
their home.
</P>
<P>
   Boser, 49, is a machinist now, but the year he spent soldiering
in Vietnam shaped his worldview; his key chain features the POW/MIA
logo. Baxter, 47, works at the water treatment plant in Olean, a
few miles away. They both smoke, drink beer, stay rail-thin
somehow, and share an interest in the accouterments of survival
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always saved stuff for whatever happened,'' Boser
explained. ``Storms, tornadoes, my daughter's car breaking down.
And it's not just meals. It's first-aid kits, radios, packs of
water, camping supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1998, word spread among the campers, hunters and
survivalists in the area that Boser and Baxter were buying supplies
at various outlets, partly in anticipation of the year 2000. The
two men soon found themselves putting in orders for other people.
Then it struck them: they should open their own shop.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a new presence had established itself among the bars,
restaurants and shops of downtown Allegany.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter spoke with pride of the wares their store once offered.
The camouflage outfits in ``United Nations, European and, of
course, American'' styles were popular with local militia types, as
well as with people who liked to play paintball. The combat knives
sold fairly well, as did the manuals on map reading.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the goods were geared for everyone from casual campers
to those with an abiding distrust of government. The hand-cranked
radios, for example, were big sellers around Christmas. Another big
hit was the dehydrated pudding, in chocolate, vanilla and banana.
</P>
<P>
   For more discerning consumers, specialized items were also
available: your Israeli gas masks, your samurai swords. Baxter said
that a doctor from Jamestown once came in to buy a bulletproof vest
and a helmet; they later learned that he performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The store sold no guns or firearms accessories. ``And we never
carried books that were offensive,'' Boser said. ``I mean, we'd get
requests for bomb-making manuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the area churches proved to be regular customers,
particularly those concerned with prophecies of impending doom.
According to Baxter, a man claiming to be a minister from Bradford,
Pa., drove up in a Cadillac one day, popped the car's trunk and
issued the order to ``fill 'er up'' with supplies.
</P>
<P>
   There were other customers claiming to belong to this militia
group or that militia group. Baxter said the largest in the area
hailed from rural McKean County, just over the border in
Pennsylvania. Another militia is based right here in Cattaraugus
County, he said. In fact, the head of the group was nice enough to
drop off his business card one day.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Potok, the spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a
nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that monitors hate
groups, said that a group called the Bucktail Militia used to
operate out of McKean County, but that it had not been heard from
since 1995. Still, he said, ``There is heavy movement activity in
western Pennsylvania _ both militias and hate groups.''
</P>
<P>
   And Timothy McVeigh _ the man awaiting execution for the bombing
of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 that killed 168
people _ often used property he owned in Humphrey, just three miles
north of here, as a shooting range. Baxter said that he met McVeigh
once through a friend of a friend. ``We were more or less into the
same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When pushed further about his own political philosophy, Baxter
said that most of the country's wealth seemed to be in the hands of
a few people, and that ``Mein Kampf'' ``made a lot of sense.'' Then
he added, ``My partner doesn't believe in `Mein Kampf.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. When asked later about Baxter's views, Boser gave
an exasperated, there-goes-Bill-again kind of expression. ``Hitler
was a moron,'' he said. ``He was the Antichrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Boser went on to say that while militia types, ``hillbillies''
and people posing as Vietnam veterans _ which personally disgusts
him, he said _ frequented the store, there were plenty of customers
interested in nothing more than having ``just in case'' supplies on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own philosophy, he said that `` `We the people' has
become `We the government.''' Overall, he said, he believes only
half of what he sees and half of what he hears, and he belongs to
no organization whatsoever _ ``not even the VFW.''
</P>
<P>
   The Survival Preparedness Center did a fairly brisk business in
the days before the year 2000. But by late January, after the
millennial rush, sales had dropped through the linoleum-tiled
floor, and the partners decided that it did not pay to keep the

   For his part, Baxter has not given up on the prospect of future
disaster generating future business. ``According to the prophecies,
New York City is going to be hit with a giant tsunami,'' he said, a
vanilla-flavored cigar clenched in his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But his partner, Boser, seemed to be considering more practical
possibilities, such as moving the store to where most of the
traffic is _ namely, near the Wal-Mart.

 &HT;    AMID RUBBLE, FUNERAL FOLLOWING ROCKET ATTACKS, ISRAEL PROMISES
LEBANON WITHDRAWAL
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel _ While announcements on Israeli
television Friday told residents here it was safe to go outside,
fear and anger from two days of deadly violence threatened Israel's
planned July withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting, between Israeli troops, their allies and the
Lebanese Hezbollah guerillas, left smoke billowing on the piney
hillsides of northern Israel after the heaviest Hezbollah rocket
attacks in nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Residents on both sides of the border were cleaning up rubble
and weeping over the few dead. Many Lebanese were in the dark after
an Israeli attack on a civilian power station.
</P>
<P>
   The episode displayed both sides of Israel's Lebanon dilemma.
Northern residents were reinforced in fears that a withdrawal will
leave them vulnerable to attacks on the border. Meanwhile, mourners
cried loudly for the latest Israeli soldier killed on that border
in the kind of fighting Israeli leaders hope they can end with a
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak complied with calls from the
United States and the United Nations for both sides to ease the
fighting. But, speaking on Israeli television, he tried to reassure
his public that he was as tough as they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't suggest that anybody test us,'' he said, noting
that many Lebanese now are ``sitting in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   He hinted that Israel could even hit Syrian targets in Lebanon.
Syria keeps about 35,000 troops in Lebanon and exerts significant
control over the country and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanon withdrawal is a campaign promise that Barak made when
he was elected prime minister in last May. Israel has been fighting
in Lebanon intermittently since 1978, first against Palestinian
terrorists based there and, since 1985, against Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had hopes that the withdrawal would be part of a three-way
peace agreement between Syria, Lebanon and Israel. But talks with
Syria have broken down. That raises the possibility that Syria may
back attacks against Israel even if Israel withdraws.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Barak vowed to keep his withdrawal on schedule,
saying Israel's invasion of Lebanon had created Hezbollah and its
withdrawal would help ``solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A cabinet minister reiterated that vow at a funeral Friday for
Shaked Overi, a 24-year-old artillery sergeant killed just inside
Lebanon by a Hezbollah rocket the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government has come to the decision to stop the circle of
blood and bring the boys back from that cursed land,'' Israeli
Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said at the funeral in El
Yachim, in central Israel. ``This will be of no comfort to this
family, but let us hope that peace will come to the people of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern residents fear that a withdrawal will bring Hezbollah,
or Palestinian terror groups, to their fences.
</P>
<P>
   Many said the rocket attacks Thursday and Friday, hour-long
barrages on both days, show Hezbollah's intention is to kill
Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted a heavy Israeli response.
</P>
<P>
   One is 37-year-old computer salesman Dubi Friedman, whose house,
along with his mother-in-law's next door, was badly damaged by the
one of the few direct hits in the town Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries, as both families had left the suburban
villas the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's Katyusha rockets are inaccurate and relatively weak,
but this one left a hole in the tile roof of one home while
furniture, toys and computers were scattered in pieces inside both.
The street smelled like burnt gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ping pong,'' a frustrated Friedman said of the cycle of
Israeli and Hezbollah reprisals. ``We need to kill 200 Arabs. Then
they will be afraid of us.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest round of fighting _ the worst since June, when
Israeli strikes caused severe damage in Lebanon and killed eight
civilians _ escalated early Thursday when the Israeli-paid and
trained militia in Lebanon, the South Lebanon Army, killed two
sleeping Lebanese women with shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the force fighting to end Israel's 18-year occupation
in southern Lebanon, responded Thursday afternoon with several
dozen rockets. One killed Overi, who was in a jeep at a post on the
border. Other rockets lightly injured about 20 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting the pattern of the war, Israel responded with air raids
on a Lebanese power station near Beirut, causing power outages, and
bombed the highway between Beirut and Damascus, Syria. Israel said
it killed three Hezbollah guerillas.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Hezbollah answered with a few dozen more rockets
here in Kiryat Shemona and the western Israeli town of Shlomi.
There were no serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Israel answered with volleys of artillery fire. But, with both
sides under international pressure to cease fire, Israeli leaders
said they would let the fighting stop there.

 &HT;    Courting the Catholic vote
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the pundits were pondering whether religion would
play much of a role in this year's presidential election, most
forgot to ask a pretty fundamental question: Which religion?
</P>
<P>
   Protestant conservatives have played the most vocal role in the
presidential politics of the past 20 years. They have been in the
news this year as well, in the controversy over Gov. George W.
Bush's speech at Bob Jones University and Sen. John McCain's
denunciation of Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   As Ronald Reagan and his father had before him, Bush used an
invitation to speak at the fundamentalist Protestant school outside
Greenville, S.C., to appeal to religious conservatives before the
South Carolina primary, which the Texas governor had to win to
restore faith in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But as the controversy over the speech ultimately proved, Roman
Catholic voters are at center stage this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although it had received more attention before the speech, the
university's policy banning interracial dating did not become as
controversial after Bush's speech as the anti-Catholic preachings
on the school's Web site. Bush's success in the South Carolina
primary, where Protestant conservatives swung heavily in his favor,
was contrasted with his loss to McCain a few days later in
Michigan, where McCain's campaign had targeted Catholic voters with
phone calls about the Bob Jones issue.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain upped the ante, attacking Robertson and Falwell by
name in a speech at Virginia Beach, the home of the Christian
Coalition, his appeal fell flat with most Republican voters. But
Bush was sufficiently alarmed to write Cardinal John O'Connor, the
late archbishop of New York, a letter regretting not having taken a
stronger stand in his speech at Bob Jones University. It was final
confirmation that Catholic voters will not be ignored this year.
</P>
<P>
   In large part this year's focus on Catholic voters is a matter
of perception catching up with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the African-American evangelical vote is the base vote of
the Democratic Party and the white evangelical vote is the base
vote of the Republican Party, then Catholic voters are the jump
ball of American politics. They have been the swing vote in every
presidential election since the 1960s,'' said Republican consultant
Ralph Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic voters were at one time a dependable part of the
Democratic majority, but abortion, crime and school busing caused
many to defect to Richard Nixon and later to Ronald Reagan. In the
past decade they have helped elect Bill Clinton _ as well as
several Republican _ and Catholic _ governors, such as John Engler
of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   That point has been brought more sharply to mind this year
because of the importance of Catholic voters in the big
Northeastern and Midwestern states, which are expected to be the
hottest battleground of the presidential election, as well as in
several key Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   Deal Hudson, editor of Crisis, a conservative Catholic magazine,
and an informal adviser to the Bush campaign, said changing
attitudes among American Catholics are also affecting the political
climate. After an era of trying to ``assimilate'' into the larger
American community, he said, Catholics have grown tired of being
ignored and ``want to be recognized as Catholic Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican nervousness over the Bob Jones controversy heightened
when House Speaker Dennis Hastert passed over a committee's
preference for a Catholic priest, the Rev. Timothy O'Brien, to
appoint the Rev. Charles Wright, former senior pastor of the North
Avenue Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, to the post of House
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Wright withdrew his name in March and Hastert appointed another
Catholic, the Rev. Daniel Coughlin of Chicago, to be the first of
his religion to hold the honorary post.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two controversies, ``Republicans were in deep danger
of totally blowing the Catholic vote,'' said Clyde Wilcox, a
professor of government at Georgetown University in Washington.
While the damage could be repaired, he said, Bush will need to send
some ``strong positive signals'' to Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the nation's largest religious denomination,
representing a great racial and national diversity, does not vote
in lock step. Polling indicates there is now about an even
Democratic-Republican split, with 40 percent of Catholics in the
swing voter category.
</P>
<P>
   While Al Gore has no competition for liberal Catholic votes,
Bush may also be competing for conservative Catholic votes with a
conservative Catholic, Pat Buchanan, if Buchanan becomes the Reform
Party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest irony of all was that Bush was the only candidate
with an explicit Catholic strategy,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy, he said, was based on an understanding of the
growing role of the Catholic Church in the party.
</P>
<P>
   EYE ON RUNNING MATES
</P>
<P>
   One issue in which sensitivity to the Catholic vote could show
up is the selection of vice presidential nominees. Republican Gov.
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Democratic HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo
are among Catholics on the parties' short lists of potential
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee chairman, Jim Nicholson, is
Catholic, and Catholics make up a higher percentage of the party's
governors and members of Congress than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Protestant-Catholic tensions exposed by the Bob Jones
incident, Reed, the former executive director of the Christian
Coalition, argued there's ``probably a greater cooperation and
communication between evangelicals and Catholics than at any time
since they respectively became engaged in civic affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed sees Catholic social teachings that ``the institutions
closest to those in need are best able to help them'' fitting
closely with Bush's ideas about replacing government programs with
private and religious efforts. But Wilcox said Catholics tend to be
more ``communitarian'' in outlook. ``It doesn't have to be
government that helps. But it can be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, a former Baptist minister who became a Catholic while
living in Atlanta, said that while evangelicals and Catholics often
take the same side on issues, they respond differently to political
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   `CAN'T GET PREACHY'
</P>
<P>
   ``With evangelicals you can preach the message, and they will
hear and support you,'' the editor said. ``Catholics want calmness
and warmth, an inclusive message and a positive message. You can't
get preachy with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In counterpoint to this political season's focus on Catholic
voters and issues was the recent news that Robertson, who gave up
his ordination as a Southern Baptist minister to run for president
in 1988, has again taken the ministerial vows, this time before an
``ordination council'' of advisers from several denominations.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree the curve of Robertson's career follows that of
the evolution of the religious right. The Christian Coalition is
only a shadow of what it has been in previous elections, but the
influence of the religious right was clear during the primary
season.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer a need for religious conservatives to charge
the bastions of the Republican Party, Reed said, because they have
largely found their place there.

   SIERRA-LEONE-U.N. (United Nations) _ In their boldest move yet
against the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, rebel
fighters have disarmed a convoy of Zambian peacekeepers, taken the
208 soldiers hostage and now appear to be driving 13 hijacked
armored personnel carriers toward the capital, U.N. officials said
Friday. The convoy, which was sent from Lungi, a port town, to
reinforce other beleaguered peacekeeping troops at Makeni, lost
radio contact on Thursday with the U.N. mission in Freetown, the
capital of the battered West African country, prompting concern
about their fate. By Christopher S. Wren.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-LEBANON (Jerusalem) _ The Israeli government, facing a
troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon for which it needs
international backing, on Friday declined to continue reprisal
bombings in Lebanon even though another cross-border guerrilla
offensive took place Friday morning. In an effort to interrupt the
volley of retaliatory attacks and defuse the exploding violence,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his security Cabinet decided that
they would not respond militarily to a second day of Katyusha
rocket fire on northern Israel. ``Israel has no interest in
escalation,'' a senior Israeli official said. By Deborah Sontag.

   PHILIPPINES-HOSTAGES (Manila) _ They are schoolchildren,
teachers, and a group of mostly European holidaymakers _ true
innocents who have been caught for weeks in a pair of terrifying
kidnappings in the lawless jungles of the southern Philippines.
Their captors, a small army of Islamic separatist bandits, have
herded them up mountains and down riverbeds, to the sound of
gunfire from pursuing Philippine troops. Last weekend, as the
government troops closed in on one group, the kidnappers executed
four Filipino captives, including the priest. With the government
taking a hard line and the kidnappers making wild threats and even
wilder demands, there seems, for the moment, little hope of freedom
for the hungry and frightened hostages. By Seth Mydans.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The nation's unemployment rate fell
below 4 percent in April for the first time in 30 years, the Labor
Department reported Friday, as employers hired tens of thousands of
census takers, restaurant employees and temporary workers in a
booming economy. The new employment numbers _ 341,000 new jobs and
a 3.9 percent unemployment rate _ offered no evidence that the
nine-year-old expansion _ the longest in America's history _ might
be coming to an end or even weakening in response to the Federal
Reserve's attempt to slow the economy by raising interest rates.
The Fed's great fear is that labor shortages will give workers
enough bargaining power to push up labor costs and employers, in
response, will raise prices to cover the higher costs. But wages,
while rising, are still not going up fast enough to set off an
inflationary spiral, the Labor Department's latest numbers show. By

Magazine, appearing on talk shows and getting an invite from
President Clinton to Camp David. Now he's back with a new book and

MIAMI'S GUARD GOES FROM ASPHALT TO HARDWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Anthony Carter looks anguished as he stands
in the middle of a brightly lit gym, waiting for the Miami Heat's
evening practice to begin. His sleepy brown eyes move from side to
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make it short,'' said the 24-year-old point guard. ``I
was a high-school dropout. My freshman year I didn't go back no
more. I was out of school for three years. Went back to school and
got my GED.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not stop, each detail tumbling forward, faster and
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Went to a junior college in California. Had two great years
there. Went to the University of Hawaii. Had two great years there.
Separated my shoulder before my senior season. That kind of scared
everybody away. Had surgery after my senior year. Went to the CBA
and worked my way back up. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter left out the part about playing $1,000 winner-take-all
pickup games in Atlanta and how he caught Coach Pat Riley's eye and
eventually borrowed Tim Hardaway's job.
</P>
<P>
   He may have to give it back when the Heat open their Eastern
Conference semifinal series against the New York Knicks here on
Sunday, but Carter will not raise a fuss. He is making a guaranteed
wage to play pro basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Carter started 30 games during the regular season, averaging 6.3
points, 4.8 assists and 2.2 turnovers. In the Heat's first-round,
three-game sweep of Detroit Carter, outplayed Lindsey Hunter, whom
he was buried behind in Pistons training camp last year, and
averaged more than nine points and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is not a long-distance threat like Hardaway _ he hit
3-of-23 3-point attempts all season _ but he will break down a
defense, using frontlines as pylons as he maneuvers his
6-foot-2-inch, 185-pound frame with ease through the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the chances of that happening were remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he was on his way to was becoming a playground
legend,'' said Llew Haden, who sponsored Atlanta's first `I Have a
Dream' project and who serves as a surrogate uncle to Carter.
``A.C. making it to the NBA was a pretty big longshot.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, founded in New York, randomly selects classes of
third-grade students and guides them as they grow, providing
tutoring, cultural experiences, contacts with role models and money
for college.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was one of 47 children selected in his class to
participate in the program. By the time he was 15, however, Carter
veered off course, a truant whose grades made him ineligible to
play sports. He dropped out of high school simply because ``I
didn't want to get up in the morning and walk to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the ages of 16 and 19, Carter traveled around Atlanta to
hustle games. He and his friends, known as the Boys from Kirkwood,
often divided the $1,000 winners' share after a game. ``It was
physical, and people got upset when they lost, but there were no
fights,'' Carter said. ``After it was over, we just split up the
money. Right there. Everybody paid up. It was a good living.''
</P>
<P>
   The life of a pickup basketball player seized hold of Carter,
and he thought of doing little else with his life. The coach at
Atlanta's Alonzo A. Crim High School still tells Carter he cost him
three state championships.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his quickness, his stop-and-pop game, Carter also had a
large circle of unending support. He grew with his mother, Brenda,
in his grandmother's home with 13 other siblings. They often
doubled as Carter's uncles and aunts.
</P>
<P>
   One aunt, Deborah Carter, 28, went to college (Georgia) and
became a pro (Utah and Washington of the Women's National
Basketball Association).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only girl that could get into the boys' club at the
time,'' she said. ``I'd take him with me to play every day. He used
to get so mad when neighborhood guys would dunk on him. He was just
determined to get back at them. Bottom line, he got a second
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's life took a turn for the better on a summer night in
1994. An opponent recalled how the point guard dunked eight times
in a midnight game. The player, Andre Craig, called his former
coach, Bill Brummel, at Saddleback College _ a two-year junior
college in Mission Viejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Craig asked Carter if he could videotape one of his games and
send it to Brummel. Relying only on the grainy footage, Brummel
offered Carter a financial aid package.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a mentor in Haden's ``I Have a Dream'' chapter who
convinced the high-school dropout to give college a try.
</P>
<P>
   Mattie Baker, a project coordinator for ``I Have a Dream,'' was
driving down Memorial Avenue in southeast Atlanta that summer when
she noticed Carter walking down the street. He had been an on and
off participant in the program, and she wanted to know how he was
getting along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stopped by the YMCA and asked her if she could she help
me fill a form out so I could go back and get my GED, and she
helped me,'' Carter said. He also pulled out a crumpled piece of
paper from his pocket and showed it to her. It was an acceptance
letter to Saddleback.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time she read it, he was supposed to be there two days
already,'' Haden said. ``I called Brummel up and said, `Do you
still want him?' He said, `Damn right! Can you get him here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Haden used money from the foundation to pay for
the plane ticket to Los Angeles. A friend stuffed $200 in Carter's
pocket, and he was off to college.
</P>
<P>
   Carter led the state in scoring the 1995-96 season, erupting for
44 points in one game. He also earned enough credits to qualify for
a Division I scholarship at the University of Hawaii. By the end of
his junior year, he was considered first-round draft material in
the National Basketball Association, but shoulder surgery before
his senior season scared away scouts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 at the predraft camp in Chicago, where players
scrimmaged at the Moody Bible Institute before hundreds of scouts,
coaches and general managers, Carter re-injured his shoulder three
minutes into the first scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   He went undrafted and spent last season taking long bus rides
with the Yakima Sun Kings of the Continental Basketball
Association. He tried out with the Detroit Pistons, but asked for
his release after two weeks of playing behind Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Along came Riley, who saw him play for a Mavericks summer league
team and plucked him away from Dallas. The deal: Carter would go to
camp and they would pay his living expenses. If he made the roster
on Nov. 2, the first day of the season, Riley would sign Carter to
one-year, free-agent deal worth $385,000.
</P>
<P>
   After Hardaway jammed his right knee in late November, Carter
started 30 games, including the last four of the regular season.
When Hardaway sprained his left foot in April, Carter started all
three games in the first round of the playoffs against Detroit.
Carter's value has rocketed, and the Heat will compete with other
teams for his services during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't run into Mattie Baker that day, I wouldn't be here
now,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's game comes straight from asphalt lore. On the court, he
is all about taking risks and hard drives to the hole. But the
package also comes with turnovers, an unreliable jump shot and a
penchant for playing at hyper speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good with him,'' Riley said. ``I feel comfortable with
him. I can deal with his turnovers, because I know they're all
honest. He's trying to make good plays. He's fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley puts special intonation on ``fearless.'' Carter seems cast
from the same mold of fringe players who found a home with a
Riley-coached team, players who all have two things in common: big
hearts and larger limitations. Anthony Mason. Xavier McDaniel. John
Starks. Dan Majerle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Mase, as many problems as I had with him,'' Riley
said. ``And I cried when X went to Boston,'' Riley said of
McDaniel, the former Knick. ``I couldn't believe he left. Then we
got Starks. Then Dan. Keith Askins. And now A.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are cut out of the same cloth. I develop an
affinity toward these kinds of men. They're great pros. They're
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter distinguished himself further by becoming that rare
rookie Riley entrusted with important minutes. Hardaway's injuries
and Carter's progress forced his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks plan to trap Carter, like any rookie, and exploit his
weaknesses. The player whose income once depended on winning
playground games was asked if he is feeling the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel no pressure out here playing,'' he said. ``I had
a lot of pressure not going to school, when people kept telling me
to go back. This isn't pressure.''

JOHNSON AND MARTINEZ ARE ALIKE IN MASTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plans and hopes of other teams aside, this baseball year
could end in no better manner than to have the Arizona Diamondbacks
and the Boston Red Sox win their respective league pennants so that
Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez can pitch against each other in
Games 1, 4 and 7 of the World Series. What more fitting climax
could the season have than to put the premier pitcher in each
league on the mound in the sport's ultimate set of games.
</P>
<P>
   Although that's the only way Johnson and Martinez could pitch in
the same meaningful games, they have been mirroring each other this
season, making four starts on the same day and another start on
consecutive days. In their latest turns in their teams' rotations,
Johnson is scheduled to pitch against San Diego Friday night and
Martinez against Tampa Bay Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the left-hander, will take a 6-0 record and a 0.91
earned run average into the game in Phoenix; Martinez, the
right-hander, will take a 5-0 record and a 1.27 ERA into his game
in Boston. Martinez has made one fewer start than Johnson because
the Red Sox were rained out for four consecutive days last month.
Both pitchers have been no less than terrific. They have clearly
become the most dominating, most intimidating pitchers in their
respective leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The similarities are they are both intimidating,'' Mike
Hargrove, the Baltimore Orioles' manager, said by telephone
Thursday. ``The differences are how they go about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove was asked to compare the two pitchers because as a
long-time American League manager, he has had to deal with both,
during the regular season and in playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy is physically intimidating,'' Hargrove said. ``Here's a
guy 6 foot 12 or whatever he is, 6-10, and when he lets the ball
go, it looks like he lets it go halfway to the plate. That's
intimidating, especially to left-hand hitters. Pedro goes about his
business quietly on the mound, but there's no doubt in your mind
that Pedro feels he owns the entire plate and if you try to take
any of it away from him, he'll come and get you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Martinez did last Sunday in Cleveland with Einar
Diaz. His brushback pitch led to an exchange of hit batters and a
five-game suspension for Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   If his appeal is unsuccessful, he presumably will fall another
start behind Johnson, though not necessarily in stature and
success.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 36, leads the National League in victories, ERA,
strikeouts (64), strikeouts per nine innings (11.7), batting
average against (.156), complete games (3) and shutouts (2).
Martinez, 28, is tied for the AL lead in victories and leads the
league in ERA, strikeouts (50), strikeouts per nine innings (12.7)
and opponents' batting average (.173).
</P>
<P>
   Neither has lost a regular-season game since last August, though
the Mets beat Johnson in a playoff game last October. Since he lost
last Aug. 31, Johnson has started 11 games and been the winning
pitcher nine times. Martinez has not incurred a loss since last
Aug. 19, winning 11 of 12 starts and adding one victory each as a
starter and a reliever in last year's playoffs. Johnson (17-9,
2.48) and Martinez (23-4, 2.07) were the 1999 Cy Young Award
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beattie, general manager of the Montreal Expos, knows both
pitchers intimately. He was in the Seattle front office when
Johnson pitched for the Mariners, and he was the Expos' general
manager who traded Martinez to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both have a lot of confidence,'' Beattie said. ``They
don't let anything bother them. Randy is more emotional out there,
but it doesn't affect how he throws his next pitch. It's the same
with Pedro. They've gotten past those things. That's the mark of a
good pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Beattie, a former pitcher himself, said neither Johnson nor
Martinez was born on the pitching pinnacle; they worked hard to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably 1994, '95 when Randy started to step it up and
concentrate,'' Beattie said. ``He worked hard in the off-season. He
started applying himself and got stronger. The same with Pedro. He
worked hard. Conditioning for both these guys is outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   People who don't know the pitchers, Beattie suggested, might
look at both pitchers and think Johnson was just this tall, skinny
guy and Martinez was a small, skinny guy. Both, however, are very
strong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the maturing of both into the pitchers they have
become,'' the Expos' executive said. ``Both had questions about
them early in their career, but they developed mental toughness and
concentration. It's something they learned as they got more
experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, after the Los Angeles Dodgers decided he
was too small to become a good major-league pitcher and traded him
to the Expos, Martinez was accused of being a headhunter. He hit
batters with pitches liberally, and the batters went after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was a headhunter,'' Beattie said. ``I think
his ball just ran so much that he ended up hitting a lot of guys.
He has refined the way he approaches the game. So has Randy.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Davis, a San Francisco infielder, played with Johnson in
Seattle and has played against him as a member of the Yankees and
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten so good right now,'' said Davis, who doesn't have
a hit in 11 at-bats against Johnson. ``I don't ever remember him
throwing a sinking fastball, a two-seamer that just runs away from
right-handers now. I thought that was pretty incredible when he
came here and I saw that. Other than that pitch, everything's real
hard, a hard slider _ it's hard to detect if it's a fastball or a
slider. And he pitches. He's not just throwing 95 every time. It's
like he's getting better with age, with time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove hasn't had to deal with Johnson since he left the
American League during the 1998 season. Sight unseen, though, the
Baltimore manager said Johnson is the best pitcher in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``Without a doubt I think Pedro's the best in both
leagues. He's kind of a combination of Maddux and Johnson. He has
Johnson's fastball, but Maddux's composure and control.''

A CUSTOM-MADE FRAGRANCE THAT'S ALL `MINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 7)  
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I started wearing Chanel No. 5 because of Catherine Deneuve. To
my teen-age eyes she was the epitome of French style and classic
beauty, and I figured that if I wore it, too _ bell-bottoms aside _
I would somehow acquire that same je ne sais quoi in Scarsdale,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   I had my dalliances along the way. There was Charlie (Shelly
Hack's appeal was somehow not eternal) and Chloe, even Fracas for a
minute, but in the end it was always Chanel. Those dreaded women at
Bloomingdale's who aim their atomizers and fire get nowhere with
me.
</P>
<P>
   But after 25 years, even I was bored, so when I read that Sarah
Horowitz was taking appointments for her Fragrance Journey, I
called. ``The fragrance equivalent of rebirthing,'' the notice
read, ``Horowitz coaxes forth scent-related memories and then
blends you a scent with emotional meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz is based in Malibu, Calif., but she travels regularly
to New York and London; it turns out she has 1,200 clients. Though
it sounded kind of kooky, I found the prospect somehow intriguing _
like having a shrink and a personal shopper rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   While customization has proved popular recently in everything
from suits to ice cream, it is taking off in the top tiers of the
fragrance industry. Creed, the very upscale European fragrance
house, whose perfumer is the sixth-generation Oliver Creed, offers
custom scents ($20,000 for Creed himself to oversee a process that
takes six months). There are also Creed master blenders at Barneys
New York, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, who can blend five or
six of the existing 100 Creed scents for customers in an hour, for
the more affordable fee of $400 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast there are a growing number of fragrance
boutiques like Lather in Pasadena, Calif., and Homebody in Los
Angeles that blend custom scents for clients like k.d. lang. As
Mary Lavo, the merchandising manager in charge of cosmetics for
Barneys, says, the custom-scent trend is not sweeping huge numbers
because of the time (and money) the process requires _ like couture
versus ready-to-wear. Historically, fragrance was an exclusive
privilege of royalty and the very rich, until the late 1800s, when
the common folk got in on the act. So, it's not surprising that
with the economy soaring now, the very rich have once again
realized they no longer have to smell like even the moderately
rich.
</P>
<P>
   While the custom-scent trend has not broken through to the
masses, some online sites plan to offer the service to users, via
questionnaire. (Reflect.com was the only one I found promising that
personalized scents ``will be available soon.'') Horowitz and some
other professionals in the fragrance business are skeptical of this
sort of venture, however, since body chemistry plays such an
important part in determining a scent.
</P>
<P>
   She settled down to determine mine in my apartment, breaking her
``no house calls rule,'' because her New York schedule was so
jammed she could see me only on her day off. (She usually sets up
shop in a hotel suite; appointments can be made by calling
310-317-6858.)
</P>
<P>
   The Fragrance Journey costs $255 for a 90-minute session and
includes a quarter-ounce French-cut bottle of the perfume she
creates with you. (Perfect Perfumes, her ready-to-wear line, as she
calls it, is sold in New York at the Bigelow Pharmacy in Greenwich
Village.)
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz travels with a fragrance organ, a large case containing
120 bottles of fragrances and essential oils. As she set up her
apparatus and put some New Age music on the tape player, I learned
that she grew up on Long Island, N.Y., and graduated from Emerson
College in Boston, where she discovered her interest in scent while
working for Essence, a store on Newbury Street, now defunct. She
has apprenticed at Belmay, a perfume house in the Los Angeles area,
and has spent the last 12 years combining her love of scent with
her love of psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``My passion is to incorporate emotional and physical history
into the blending of fragrance,'' she said. ``I love listening to
people and seeing what we can put together.'' The results have
included everything from separate daytime and nighttime scents to a
custom-made bridal scent that the bridegroom doesn't smell until
the wedding day. ``After that, you only wear it on anniversaries or
special occasions,'' she said. ``It's Pavlovian. You're
impregnating the oil with your memory.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz started the session by telling me, ``You will have to
name the fragrance you give to yourself,'' which she would then
print up on labels for my future orders. She has a lab assistant
who translates her handwritten formulas into sprays, bath gels and
body lotions.
</P>
<P>
   She gave a brief history of fragrance, noting that the Egyptians
made cones out of beeswax and tallow, laid blossoms on them and
wore them on their heads. As the heat of the sun melted them, the
scented fat ran down their faces. Yum yum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the oldest art forms,'' she said. ``You are
receiving the highest gift you can give yourself, a fragrance based
on your experiences and what you love.''
</P>
<P>
   Then her questions started. What were my favorite foods?
Favorite color? What were my scent memories of my mother? Do I love
citrus? Not especially. How about sweet? Even less.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I do like the ocean, better than the mountains. I like
roses and grass and violets. I especially like the way some people
smell like soap, so clean and straight from the shower.
</P>
<P>
   As I spoke, she pulled bottles from her case and grouped them on
the table, moving them around as if they were chess pieces. She
gave me a Parmesan cheese shaker filled with coffee beans and
instructed me to inhale periodically; it works as a palate cleanser
for the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfume is built like music is,'' she said. ``The base note,
middle and top. The base supports the scent, like the percussion,
the middle is the bouquet of fragrance and the top note is the most
pungent and pulls you into the rest. It's like the strings.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first round of inhaling her bottles, she told me what
each scent was and had me tell her whether I loved it, hated it or
wasn't sure. What followed was a series of childhood memories,
instantaneous snapshots of the oddest assortment of people and
places: my Aunt Marcia's bathroom, the soap in my underwear drawer
in junior high school, a hotel room in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet pea smelled like camp. Cassis smelled like Chanel No. 5.
Basil smelled like dinner and did not interest me at all. As a
matter of fact, I disliked most scents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no wrong answer here,'' Horowitz said encouragingly.
``It's all about you, and I know how to balance it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the second round of inhaling she instructed me to keep my
eyes closed. ``When they're open you have a mental association with
what you perceive the scent to be,'' she said. ``With your eyes
closed, you go on your gut. I watch your facial expressions and see
where the emphasis should be when I blend.''
</P>
<P>
   I ended up with six ingredients for her to mix with her long
plastic eyedroppers: Oriental musk, rose, sweet pea, African
violet, gardenia and cassis. ``It has a garden feel, and the cassis
makes it very sophisticated,'' she said, putting it on my arm. I
smelled it and winced. It was way too sweet.
</P>
<P>
   She nodded. ``Your skin brings the rose up,'' she said. ``It
depends on body chemistry. Certain people pull up certain notes
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   She kept adjusting, adding one drop at a time from skinnier
glass eyedroppers to different areas of my arms and hands. She ran
her nose up and down the skin, sniffing, like a puppy. I started to
feel that my choices were wrong, but she kept mixing until suddenly
I smiled. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of something,'' I told her. ``Something good.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``You,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After she had packed up and gone, I showered, dressed and put on
my new perfume, as I did the day after and the day after that. I
tried not to notice, but it was still too sweet. The spray she had
made was better, less concentrated, but still not right. One night
I went back to Chanel No. 5, which surprisingly, smelled thin and
chemical by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   I called Horowitz. ``This happens about 10 percent of the
time,'' she said apologetically. ``My goal is to have you love
this, so I'm going to rework it based on the formula and send you
some samples in the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't completely surprised by my reaction, she added. ``My
impressions of you,'' she said, ``were that you are extremely
thorough and very specific. Yet, there is a little contradiction.
You said you didn't like sweet things, but when you smelled them,
you liked them.''
</P>
<P>
   She hesitated. ``If you don't mind my saying so, you do a lot of
thinking in your line of work and I think you don't want to be
perceived as too sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   She was probably right. But she had overcompensated for me a bit
too much.
</P>
<P>
   After I hung up, I realized I still hadn't named my scent. I
could wait, of course, until the revised version came back. But one
night, at the movies, the name came to me. I had caught a whiff of
myself, and it was fragrant, familiar, even comforting. Not to
mention decidedly imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine.''

   AIRTRAN-ROUTE _ ATLANTA _ AirTran is asking the government to
give it the right to fly between Atlanta and Washington National

creates 12 slow exemptions for service to medium and small markets.
AirTran argues its Atlanta flights would qualify because pax could
connect at Hartsfield to smaller cities. (Thurston, Atlanta

GORE OFFERS PLANS TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND PAY OF TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. _ In a speech here outlining his proposals to
improve the quality of the nation's public school teachers, Vice
President Al Gore offered a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine
go down.
</P>
<P>
   He said that as president he would spend $8 billion over 10
years to recruit 1 million new teachers and another $8 billion over
10 years to increase teacher salaries if the states and teachers'
unions agreed that all new teachers submit to testing and meet
rigorous national standards and if teachers are hired on the basis
of expertise and not seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will ensure that
there is a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every single
classroom, everywhere in this nation, before the next four years is
out,'' he declared in a speech here to the Michigan Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   His proposals are based on the theory that the quality of
teachers is the most significant factor within a school's control
in improving student achievement. And education ranks near the top
of voter concerns, especially in important battleground states like
Michigan, where Gore conducted his fourth ``school day'' Friday,
spending an entire day at the high school in nearby Holt. (He also
conducted his first ``school day'' in Michigan, in McComb County.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's give every teacher a $5,000 raise,'' the vice president
said in Lansing on Friday. ``Let's give $10,000 to master
teachers,'' he said, vowing: ``I will combine greater
accountability with greater investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that by 2004, he would require states to make sure
that teachers are fully qualified to teach the subject they are
teaching. As of now, he said, only 36 percent of teachers consider
themselves to be very well-prepared to meet the standards of their
state or school district. In high-poverty areas, as many as 50
percent of the math teachers have not studied math.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes to change that by requiring teachers either to
have majored in their subject area in college or pass a competency
test. And he would reward outstanding teachers and help schools
improve or remove bad teachers quickly, within the academic year as
opposed to the three years that such a process can take now, aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``While we absolutely must respect due process, we have to put
an end to endless delays in removing those few teachers who really
do need to be removed,'' Gore said. He also said principals should
be allowed to hire teachers for reasons other than seniority. ``No
teaching contract should be a lifetime job guarantee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Teacher testing and seniority hiring are highly controversial
matters among educators and have been strongly resisted by the
teachers' unions, which believe that standardized testing does not
measure the intangibles of good teachers. Others object to
standardized testing of both teachers and students as a step toward
giving up local control of education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the teachers' unions have heartily endorsed Gore's
presidential candidacy. Against that backdrop, his speech Friday
was intended to be seen as a daring, principled stand, the kind
that his political advisers have been eager for him to take to
demonstrate that, contrary to the popular impression as registered
in public opinion polls, Gore does not just blow with the political
winds and pander to every group he addresses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was what Gore aides called a ``Sister Souljah Moment,'' a
reference to Bill Clinton's tough speech during the 1992
presidential campaign when he took on the black singer face to face
for lyrics he said were offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech comes after the American Teachers Federation, the
nation's second-largest teachers' union, endorsed the idea last
week of toughening teacher standards.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been trying to demonstrate his commitment to education
in multiple ways, including by spending a full day at a school
somewhere in the country every week or so. He spent Friday at Holt
High School after spending the night with Margot Strong, a computer
teacher, her husband, Jay, who teaches first grade, and their two
children, Nick, 10, and Anna, 6. Gore arrived at their house after
midnight Wednesday night and stayed up late enough to watch four of
the five overtimes in the hockey playoffs on television.
</P>
<P>
   Holt was the first high school Gore has visited during this
campaign, and the older age of the students was evident in some of
their by-play with the vice president. In a morning physics class,
when Gore asked the students what the most interesting thing was
they had learned, Tonia Van Every, 18, called out: ``About Mr.
Pulver's personal life,'' a reference to the teacher, Eric Pulver.
``I'm one of the sarcastic kids,'' she told a reporter later.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the school newspaper, Gore was asked about
abortion. He said he believed it was up to a woman to decide what
to do, but he said he also believed in abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   And he revealed that his glory moment in high school was
shooting _ and sinking _ a long shot at the final buzzer, but only
after the basketball hit the backboard. Asked to list his favorite
sports, he said: ``Football, basketball, track, art.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his most difficult moment as vice president has been,
he answered without much hesitation: ``The day our soldiers in
Somalia were killed.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Cinco De Mayo and every day
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Resuming his push for California Hispanics, George W. Bush was
marking today's Mexican holiday of Cinco de Mayo amid fresh polling
evidence that the crucial voter bloc is leaning heavily toward
Democrats. Bush appeared at a U.S.-Mexico Foundation breakfast,
followed by a meeting with Hispanic leaders in San Diego County,
which shares a border with Mexico. Bush has made direct appeals to
Hispanics a staple of his campaign swings to California, where 16
percent of the electorate is Hispanic, compared to 10 percent a
decade ago. Cinco de Mayo marks the May 5, 1862, victory by a
rag-tag group of Mexican soldiers over a sophisticated French army
at Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   POT SHOT MISSES THE MARK
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush raised questions today about Al Gore's
trustworthiness, but also faced questions about his own credibility
after asserting that Gore had once been a member of the National
Rifle Association. Gore aides said that, to their knowledge, he had
never belonged to the NRA. Bush said he was waiting for Gore
himself to definitively answer the question, and said that whether
or not he had been a member, Gore's voting record in Congress
suggested he'd once been a fervent backer of gun rights. ``My
position is that when it was convenient politically he voted one
way, and when it's convenient politically, he's changed his tune,''
Bush said. A day earlier, Bush told reporters: ``I've never been a
member of the NRA. Al Gore's been a member of the NRA, if I'm not
mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL FOCUS ON TEACHERS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was presenting his plan today for teacher certification,
testing and, where there's failure, firing, to an audience
traditionally resistant to such mandates: the teachers' unions.
Relying on union support to mobilize voters, Gore, at the Michigan
Education Association convention in Lansing, trod more gingerly on
the question of firing bad teachers than on testing teacher
competence against national standards. He would establish an $8
billion, 10-year fund for salary increases of $5,000 for qualified
teachers, but would make the fund available only to school
districts who, ``in the context of due process protections ...
quickly remove those teachers who really should be removed from the
classroom.'' No guidance, however, on those teachers would be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   READ BARBARA'S LIPS, AFTER THE SHUDDERS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush attracted the attention of Barbara Walters, and
you can catch the result tonight on ABC's ``20/20.'' Walters says
she sought to ``reveal the man'' behind the presidential candidacy.
``For many people in this country, (his) views are still relatively
unknown on some personal and very controversial subjects,'' Walters
told the Dallas Morning News. ``A great many people think this
election is probably going to be decided on personality and
character. Therefore I asked a lot of questions that I sort of
shuddered about asking, but did anyway.'' A transcript of the
interview shows she asked him about his previous drinking,
allegations of illegal drug use as a young man, gay rights, his
``smirk,'' his smarts, broccoli and whether his father made a
presidential mistake by reneging on his famous statement, ``Read my
lips, no new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY CHIEF QUITS AMID FAMILY ILLNESS
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party chairman Pat Choate resigned today and turned
control over to his vice chairman, citing an illness in his family.
Gerald Moan of Tuscon, Ariz., will head the party until a new
chairman is selected at the summer convention. Choate, 59, the 1996
Reform Party vice presidential nominee, told the Associated Press
that the party is united after months of wrangling, thus his
departure will not be unsettling. Pat Buchanan, recruited to the
party by Choate, is the leading contender for the third-party
nomination. Choate's claim to the party chairmanship was challenged
this year by intra-party rivals, but was upheld in court. His first
order of business was to try to soothe the internal strife.
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR FUNERAL PRE-EMPTS BUSH SPEECH
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush canceled his Social Security outline speech in
Pittsburgh on Monday in order to attend the funeral of New York
Cardinal John O'Connor. President Clinton, Al Gore and Senate
candidates Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani also are most likely
to be at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Bush met with O'Connor last fall
while in New York. He also wrote a letter of apology to the
cardinal after being criticized during the primary campaign for
speaking at Bob Jones University, the South Carolina school whose
leader has espoused anti-Catholic views. Bush still will be able to
make an evening fund-raiser in Pittsburgh, though, before his
planned meeting there with John McCain the following day. There was
no immediate word about rescheduling the Social Security speech.
</P>
<P>
   FOLLOW THE SCRIPT, BUT WATCH FOR AD-LIBBING
</P>
<P>
   Nearly scrapped in anger, the long-awaited summit between George
W. Bush and John McCain will produce a show of unity that papers
over their differences, according to aides organizing Tuesday's
session. Top advisers have agreed in advance that McCain will
endorse Bush at a separate event later in the campaign. And while
no formal agreement has been reached, McCain is expected by both
sides to play a prominent role at the convention in Philadelphia.
``We've made a great deal of progress with the Bush campaign on a
lot of issues we've discussed,'' said McCain man Rick Davis.
</P>
<P>
   NEW AD ASSERTS NATIVE RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani launched a new TV ad today, squelching speculation
for the time being that he has decided to quit his campaign against
Hillary Clinton because of prostate cancer. Giuliani aides said the
ad will air statewide for about two weeks at a cost that could top
$1 million. He has had campaign spots running off and on for
months. Clinton launched her first statewide TV ad this week, also
for a two-week run. Her's is expected to cost about $400,000.
Neither of the new ads directly attacks the other candidate, though
Giuliani's has thinly veiled barbs. Like this: ``I want to be a
senator because I was born in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUND OF MIDCLAP SILENCE
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton finished her tour through each of New York's 62
counties in Plattsburgh with a sharp attack on George W. Bush's tax
cut proposals, leaving her mostly Republican audience in silence.
In outlining her opposition to Bush's call for a $1.3 trillion tax
cut over 10 years, Clinton said his plan would hurt efforts to win
more federal money for New York because such broad-based tax
reductions would deplete the surplus. For 10 months, even
Republicans who have no intention of voting for Clinton have come
to get a glimpse of her. And this time, the audience had been
applauding her speech enthusiastically until she broached the tax
cut subject. At that point, many in the audience stopped
practically in midclap.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH PUSH ON CHINA TRADE
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before a closely watched vote in Congress on trade
relations with China, George W. Bush and his advisers are making
sure to remind Capitol Hill Republicans of Bush's support for the
bill and have not ruled out his phoning undecided House
Republicans. Aides said Bush is planning a speech the week before
the House vote, expected between May 22 and Memorial Day, to
explain again why he feels so strongly about facilitating trade
between the United States and China. Those remarks probably will be
delivered somewhere on the West Coast, a region that pins many
economic hopes on Asian commerce.
</P>
<P>
   LAUGHTER, BUT WITH LITTLE MIRTH
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay denied being a fund-raising
racketeer extorting money from lobbyists and corporations and
called the allegations contained in a civil lawsuit against him ``a
pretty pathetic'' attempt to disrupt Republican fund-raising
efforts. Speaking with reporters after an appearance at the
National Press Club, the Texan dismissed as ``frivolous'' the
complaint, filed under federal anti-racketeering laws by the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``I'm trying to laugh
it off,'' he said with a smile. But even though he shrugged it off,
if the case is allowed to proceed, Democrats would get the chance
to pore over DeLay's fund-raising records and question donors named
in the lawsuit. And that prospect, said the Houston Chronicle, is
beginning to worry some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   JUST A STRAIGHT TICKET, IF YOU PLEASE
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan ruled out picking a homosexual or gay rights
advocate as a running mate or Cabinet officer, calling such sexual
orientation ``a disorder.'' ``If someone is an out-of-the-closet
homosexual, he's not going to be my running mate, and if someone
advocates the homosexual rights agenda publicly they're not going
to be in my Cabinet,'' Buchanan said during a lunch with reporters.
``I believe that homosexuality is a disorder. It's a wrong
orientation.'' He did add, though, that he had worked in the past
with people he ``thought were gay'' and that they had done a
``great'' job.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS FROM BEHIND THE WHEEL
</P>
<P>
   Republican needling of Al Gore about telling the truth has
struck very close to home. Towering over Gore's campaign
headquarters in Nashville is an enormous highway billboard paid for
by the Republican National Committee. On the side facing oncoming
traffic, this question is posed: ``Why should we believe you will
tell the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as a
candidate?'' The picture alongside the quote isn't flattering,
either. Gore is either winking or wincing at the suggestion he
stretches the facts. The flip side of the billboard shows Gore in a
bearhug with President Clinton, and Gore's own words: ``One of our
greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   FESS UP, WHO'S PAYING?
</P>
<P>
   Interest groups that air TV ads meant to influence elections
would be forced to say who is paying for them under a proposal
advanced in the Federal Election Commission. Groups across the
political spectrum flood the airwaves with ads praising or
criticizing candidates. But the ads stop short of flat-out telling
viewers how to vote, so the law doesn't require them to say how
much they're spending or who's paying. ``Without any information on
these groups, it becomes impossible for the public to make informed
decisions about the real interests of these groups,'' wrote Karl
Sandstrom, a Democrat on the six-member commission. The proposal
will be discussed at an FEC meeting later this month.
</P>
<P>
   NEVER MIND THE ISSUES _ BRING ON THE BARBS
</P>
<P>
   The nominal focus on issues dear to swing voters is being
drowned out by the presidential opponents' volley of barbs.
Speaking with reporters after his announcement at a Mission Viejo,
Calif., elementary school, George W. Bush vented mounting
frustration with Al Gore's attacks on his experience. ``It's
amazing that a person running for president of the United States
would look people in the eye and say I've never submitted a budget
as governor and continue to say so when I did,'' Bush said. Gore,
who has tried to portray Bush as inexperienced, reached
dramatically into his pocket after a Chicago conference of medical
journalists and produced for reporters what he said was Bush's 1995
budget _ 2 1/2 pages folded in fours. ``If you think that's a
budget, maybe I could convince you it's a duck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   STRUGGLE FOR THE MIDDLE GROUND
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) is a key supporter of Al Gore. But
Breaux and some other moderate Democrats are growing increasingly
concerned about the way Gore has rejected their views on Social
Security reform, Medicare and other major issues, while George W.
Bush has been more supportive. Breaux's concern, says the Boston
Globe, shines a spotlight on a little-noticed but growing rift
between Gore and some members of the moderate Democratic Leadership
Council, a group that Gore helped create. The rift could be crucial
because it centers on what many believe will be the decisive factor
of Campaign 2000: the candidates' ability to attract support from
the vast middle of the electorate that is still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   HARVARD-YALE BRAGGING RIGHTS AT STAKE
</P>
<P>
   It's been 88 years since Yale and Harvard squared off for the
ultimate Ivy League bragging right: president of the United States.
Both lost. That embarrassing outcome is unlikely this year with
contenders George W. Bush and Harvard alum Al Gore. Bush graduated
from Harvard Business School, but Yale claims the pedigree since
Bush got his undergraduate degree there in 1968. His father and
grandfather also were Yale men. Gore graduated from Harvard in 1969
with a degree in government. The last time the two schools faced
off in a presidential election was 1912, when Harvard's Teddy
Roosevelt and Yale's William Howard Taft were running. They were
beaten by Princeton's Woodrow Wilson.

HOW I BECAME THE FAMILY AUTHORITY ON WOMEN'S WEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 7)  
 By ETHAN HAUSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here's a rule of fashion: The lower on the totem pole
a model is, the less underwear she gets to wear. Your Kate Mosses,
your Naomi Campbells, your Christy Turlingtons _ supermodels all _
get to sport granny bloomers if they so choose. But those towering,
unnaturally cheekboned 16-year-olds fresh off the boat from Latvia
or the train from Paducah must wear skimpy thongs.
</P>
<P>
   More trivia: there's no period after the K in the clothing label
Daryl K; Dolce is linked to Gabbana with an ampersand; and the
preferred tanning method of the model Maggie Rizer is to go out and
get burned, then peel for the perfect bronze.
</P>
<P>
   How could I possibly have amassed this wealth of knowledge, this
embarrassment of riches? From a fashion-obsessed girlfriend? A
sister in the modeling business? An unhealthy interest in women's
wear?
</P>
<P>
   If only. For three years, I was a copy editor at a fashion
magazine. I don't have any hard figures, but I suspect I am part of
a small minority of people who know what a dangling participle is
and how to spell the name of Gisele Bundchen, the Brazilian cover
girl.
</P>
<P>
   Being a copy editor at a women's fashion magazine _ and a male
to boot _ is a little like being the designated driver: you're
around people having a lot of fun, but you're not allowed to
imbibe. Your job is to make sure the semicolons are right; you
don't get to pick up the phone and trill ``Daaahling'' or air-kiss
the French photographers when they come in with their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about partaking of the free MAC lipstick and clothing
discounts, and if you try to participate in office chitchat about
Brazilian bikini waxes (J. Sisters is the best _ even Gwyneth
Paltrow goes there), you seem like a pervert. There was the thrill
of occasionally riding the elevator with a model, and my female
friends were always grateful when I passed along freebies the
beauty editors gave me, tokens of thanks for getting their dashes
and commas right. My girlfriend benefited from the pitch-perfect
gift advice the fashion writers dispensed to me come birthday time.
</P>
<P>
   I have since moved on, much to my mother's chagrin. Yes, my
mother. It isn't that she's concerned about my plunge into the
shaky free-lance life. I was prepared for all the questions about
health insurance and how I expected to support myself without the
guarantee of a regular paycheck. I'd even practiced saying, ``Are
you crazy?'' in case she told me to move home.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, she wasn't concerned with such details. She
was worried that she'd lost her entree into the world of high
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   However flimsy my connection was, it was an imprimatur
nonetheless. I'd become the family's fashion authority. When I'd go
home for the holidays, she'd empty her newest purchases onto the
couch and then hold each piece up. ``Yes or no?'' she'd ask, eerily
parroting the same clipped tone I heard leaking from the offices of
the fashion editors at work. I suppose I'm not entirely blameless;
I did manage to wangle her a discount subscription when I was
hired.
</P>
<P>
   This is a mother, keep in mind, who had never picked up a
fashion magazine before her son started working at one, not even in
the supermarket checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   (If you find this difficult to believe, there is irrefutable
evidence in the back of her closet: pair upon pair of sensible flat
shoes.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Now she throws around the names Armani, Prada and Ungaro like a
pro, and she's added some height to her footwear, though she's
careful to clarify, ``I haven't made up my mind about the chunky
heel.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   She recently told me that her Molton Brown shampoo was almost
gone. (To which I was tempted to snap, ever heard of sephora.com?)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite my hesitation at becoming my mother's wardrobe
consultant, I'm glad I injected some of the sprightly fun of
fashion into her life, however circuitously. If I couldn't benefit
directly from my insider knowledge, why shouldn't she? I could have
avoided it. Months into my copy-editing tenure, my parents were
still confusing Harper's Bazaar with Harper's Magazine, the more
high-brow general-interest magazine. Had I refrained from
correcting them, Mom might never have discovered cargo pants.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   (And my father would have continued to suggest subjects for the
Index, Harper's numerically obsessive trivia column.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, I worried that I had lured my mother down the
path of frivolousness. Did she really need to start following
runway trends at this point in her life? Wasn't there a
continuing-ed class she could take, rather than tracking down the
best buys of pashmina? Parents don't need a son who knows that Tom
Ford is the genius behind Gucci; they need one who can assure them
that an aching knee is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fear not: my parents' other child, my older brother, is a
physician. There's nothing like medical school to make you Mom and
Dad's golden child, so imagine my delight when I discovered that I
could steer the conversation away from high blood pressure and low
cholesterol with just two words: Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, my mother's newfound interest in fashion wasn't enough to
keep me ensuring subject-verb agreement in articles about the new
nude shades of eye shadow. I confess I may miss our unexpected
connection. I'm sure she never anticipated it either, after all the
years when she cajoled and dragged me to the department store to
get new clothes for school.
</P>
<P>
   She'll be on her own now, but I suspect she'll still ask me to
look at tops and skirts she's uncertain about. She did have one
final request before I left: ``Could you renew my subscription?''

GOVERNMENT BEGINS TO IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ A day after tightening press censorship in
what it called the interests of national security, the government
said in an official press release Friday that troops had pushed
back Tamil rebels who are trying to capture the northern city of
Jaffna, the cultural capital of the minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   But as they issued the press release, government officials also
deleted portions of reports by international news agencies that
described an opposition political rally organized by the United
National Party to protest sweeping new powers that have been given
to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider this an issue of national security,'' said Ariya
Rubasinghe, the government's director of information and chief
censor. ``We can't afford to have commotions or civil
disturbances.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulations announced Thursday empower the government to
censor news articles by foreign reporters and to close Sri Lankan
newspapers that defy censorship rules. Before, local journalists
who ignored the censor received written warnings. The government
can also seize private property and prohibit strikes, political
rallies and criticism of President Chandrika Kumaratunga if it
believes doing so is necessary for national security.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubasinghe, the chief censor, said that although the
regulations allow censorship of criticism of the president, ``We
won't enforce it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last month, the government has been in a pitched battle
with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a group that has been
fighting for a separate homeland for the Hindu Tamil minority since
1983 and that the U.S. government has included on its list of
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 22, the rebels have taken control of two military
bases in the Tamil-dominated north in a push to regain Jaffna,
which the government recaptured five years ago. The majority of
this island nation of 18 million is Sinhalese and Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's press release, issued by Rubasinghe, said the
government had strengthened its position since April 22 when it
pulled out of its sprawling military base at Elephant Pass _ now
occupied by the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuous attacks by the troops caused the terrorists to flee
southwards with their casualties,'' the release said. ``All troops
in Jaffna peninsula are determined to push back the terrorists. Due
to confrontations on 3rd and 4th of May, terrorists are in a state
of disarray. However, the terrorists continued to fire mortars at
the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said two soldiers were killed Friday and one was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   And it said that life continued normally in Jaffna, with
government offices and schools functioning. The government said it
was providing ``ample food'' to the people there.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible to assess the contents of the press release
because no reporters have been allowed to go to the battlefront or
to Jaffna, and telephone communications to the peninsula have been
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the opposition United National Party held a rally
Friday in Independence Square in Colombo to protest the new
regulations, including those that censor foreign press accounts,
saying they were an infringement on civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   News agency reporters based in Colombo said descriptions of the
rally were cut from their stories, as were some other sentences
about the status of the battle in the north that were not part of
the official version.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Summerlike heat, accompanied by moderate or high humidity, will
cover much of the eastern half of the nation on Saturday as a warm
ridge of high pressure moves northward and westward from the
subtropical Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Dents in the expansive dome of hot weather will occur over parts
of Missouri and Arkansas, where clusters of showers and
thunderstorms will erupt as a disturbance, trapped within the warm
ridge, moves sluggishly east toward the middle Mississippi Valley.
Rainfalls of 2 inches or more are possible in a brief time,
heightening the risk of flash flooding in spots.
</P>
<P>
   Severe thunderstorms will erupt Saturday afternoon in southeast
Wyoming in response to a jet-stream disturbance lifting moist winds
from the east. A few tornadoes are possible. Thunderstorms will
then move into western Nebraska and western South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Reprieve From Heat
</P>
<P>
   An early wave of summerlike heat will waft over the Northeast
this weekend and early next week. Parts of coastal New England,
however, may not share in the hot May extravaganza. Water
temperatures off the coast are still in the 40s because the ocean
is much slower to warm than land. Thus, coastal locations,
particularly where winds from the west do not gain a foothold, will
not bear the full brunt of weekend heat as cool maritime air washes
ashore. The slower pace of ocean heating is a result, in part, of
cooler waters from the depths rising to the surface as winds stir
the ocean.

JUDGE APPROVES PROSECUTION OF TRIPP, BUT BARS LEWINSKY TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Maryland judge on Friday ruled that the state
could proceed with its prosecution of Linda Tripp on charges that
she broke the law when she secretly tape-recorded conversations
with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who was having
a relationship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also dealt a severe setback to the prosecution's
case by suppressing testimony of Lewinsky and another witness that
may be crucial in obtaining a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Diane O. Leasure of Howard County Circuit Court ruled that
the testimony of Lewinsky on one critical point was not credible.
Leasure dismissed as implausible Lewinsky's statements to the court
last December about why she was certain that a specific
conversation secretly tape-recorded by Tripp occurred on Dec. 22,
1997, a crucial date for legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Ms. Lewinsky has admitted that she lied under
oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a
part of her life does not enhance her credibility as a witness,''
Leasure wrote in her 41-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Leasure ruled that the testimony of the only other
witness to testify as to the date of that conversation, Mary
Catherine Friedrich, also could not be used by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The date of the conversation is pivotal because the Maryland law
under which Tripp is charged specifies that a person is guilty only
if it can be shown she knew at the time of the taping that it was
illegal. Although Tripp tape-recorded more than 20 hours of her
telephone conversations with Lewinsky, the one that occurred on
Dec. 22, 1997, was the only one that took place after prosecutors
believe Tripp was definitively informed by her lawyer that it is
illegal to tape-record phone conversations in Maryland without the
consent of the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure ruled Friday that prosecutors could not use Friedrich's
testimony because they only learned of her through the
investigation of President Clinton by Kenneth Starr, the
independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   When Tripp became an informant for Starr, telling him of the
president's relationship with Lewinsky, she asked for and received
a grant of immunity. Although Leasure earlier sharply limited the
scope of the immunity agreement, prosecutors still had to
demonstrate that they obtained their evidence independently of
Starr's activities.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling appears to leave the prosecutors with only the
testimony of some of Tripp's partners in a weekly bridge game and a
neighbor, all of whom seemed aware she was secretly taping
conversations with a woman named ``Monica'' who was having an
intimate relationship with Clinton. The women testified that Tripp
boasted of her secretly taping the woman and even invited Lewinsky
to a Christmas party at her Columbia, Md., home so the other women
could gaze upon the woman she had told them about.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure ruled Friday that the testimony of those women could be
used by the prosecution. But none of them seemed able to recollect
exactly when they learned of the taping and none is able to
identify the date of the crucial Dec. 22, 1997, conversation.

 &HT;    Jimmy Buffett gets Krispy Kreme franchise
 &HT;    By Paul Owers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Come someday, you can thank Jimmy
Buffett for bringing Krispy Kreme doughnut shops to Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based chain said it has granted the
singer and part-time Palm Beach resident franchise rights to build
outlets in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. won't say how many stores will open
here, but one expert predicted the county could support three or
four. The outlets likely won't open until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Buffett could
not be reached for comment Thursday, and a spokesman did not return
calls.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say, however, that Buffett craves Krispy Kremes as
much as he does cheeseburgers in paradise. He mentioned the
doughnuts in his 1999 song I Will Play for Gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really has a passion for our product,'' said Stan Parker, a
senior vice president of marketing for Krispy Kreme. ``He's a great
fan of Krispy Kreme, and Krispy Kreme is a big fan of Jimmy
Buffett.''
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme has been making the pillowy pastries for 63 years.
In the South, they're as popular as country music, but the nearest
local stores are in Broward County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krispy Kreme sure beats the heck out of Dunkin' Donuts,'' said
Jean Parker, a Jupiter resident and member of Buffett's Island Time
Parrothead Club. Parker is not related to the Krispy Kreme
marketing executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're old-fashioned, sugary, crispy, decadent fat pills that
you always thought doughnuts should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Alleva, who owns the Krispy Kreme shops in Fort Lauderdale
and Tamarac, said he regularly gets customers from southern Palm
Beach County. To satisfy the Krispy Kreme demand here, Alleva
trucks dozens of doughnuts to local gas stations, hotels and other
businesses each day. Sales are excellent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal for the area,'' Alleva said. ``People love
hot, glazed doughnuts. That's why the stores are so popular.''
</P>
<P>
   At a typical Krispy Kreme, customers can be found looking on
longingly as doughnut machines make the treats, drop them in hot
oil and bathe them in glaze. The doughnuts then pass along a window
to cooling racks ``like soldiers marching down the conveyor,''
Alleva said.
</P>
<P>
   After each fresh batch, employees light up a red neon sign that
announces ``Hot Doughnuts Now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When that sign is on, you find your car gravitating rapidly
toward the store,'' said Jim Holmes III, vice president of the
Winston-Salem investment firm that helped launch Krispy Kreme's
initial public stock offering last month. ``There's nothing like a
hot doughnut experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme shares (Nasdaq: KREM) climbed more than 75 percent
during their first day of trading April 5. The IPO was priced at
$21 a share and opened at $32. Shares closed Thursday at $43.69, up
$1.56.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme has 152 outlets in 27 states. Some stores,
particularly those in college towns, stay open 24 hours a day. The
company makes more than 3 million doughnuts a day and 1.3 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company traces its origins to a family business that opened
in 1933, when Vernon Rudolph and his uncle bought a doughnut shop
in Paducah, Ky., from a Frenchman named Joe LeBeau. The deal
included the rights to a secret yeast-raised doughnut recipe that
LeBeau had created in New Orleans years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Rudolph family soon joined the business as
it expanded in the South. Rudolph left the family venture in 1937
to open his own shop. He had little cash or equipment, but he did
have the secret formula for what would become Krispy Kreme
doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   The company stayed true to its Southern roots before expanding
into the Northeast and Midwest in the mid-1990s. It is using some
of the $72 million in proceeds from the IPO to break into other
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Riviera Beach talked to Krispy Kreme 18 months ago
about opening a store there, but the two sides could not agree on a
site. The company was interested in land on Blue Heron Boulevard
just off Interstate 95, but the property was not for sale, said
John Green, coordinator of the city's housing and community
development program.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Buffett is the first time Krispy Kreme has granted
franchise rights to a celebrity, officials said. The venture with
Buffett's Margaritaville Holdings will be called KreMaritta.
</P>
<P>
   Margaritaville Holdings, which leased office space on Worth
Avenue in Palm Beach in 1998, operates four Margaritaville
restaurants in Key West, Orlando, New Orleans and Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a hoot,'' said Parker, the Buffett fan club
member. ``I'm amused by this. He's totally off the wall, but at
least he does things close to his heart.''

A NIGHT OUT WITH THE ALMOST FAMOUS BRUCE VILANCH

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The packed house at the recent preview of ``Bruce
Vilanch: Almost Famous'' seemed to like everything about this
one-man show playing at the Westbeth Theater Center except the
title. ``Take out the `almost,''' said one audience member, sensing
that Bruce Vilanch, the show's author and star, has already crossed
the threshold from aspirer to being there.
</P>
<P>
   Vilanch, a master of one-liners who has written for Bette Midler
and Robin Williams, most famously provides quips for stars to
deliver at the Oscars. He also writes witty bits for his own
appearances on ``The Hollywood Squares,'' which have allowed
viewers to recognize the impressively hirsute face behind the
zingers, turning Vilanch into something of a modern-day Paul Lynde.
</P>
<P>
   In his stage show, a mixed bag of showbiz stories and shtick,
Vilanch does his own impersonation of Lynde (telling off a mother
with a screaming baby) in between reminiscences of his experiences
writing patter for ``everyone from Abba to Zadora.'' His opening
line sets the tone: ``Good evening, I'm Linda Tripp. The makeover
was not as extensive as you've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   After the performance, Vilanch stepped into a black stretch
limousine and was joined by Craig Austin, his associate producer.
With his Grizzly Adams-style hair and pudgy body squished into an
``I'm a Friend of Kenny'' T-shirt (a gift from Dame Edna Everage,
who claims ``South Park's'' Kenny as her gay son), Vilanch
resembled a Muppet version of Harvey Fierstein crossed with Jerry
Garcia. He's campy and droll, but not mean, especially not to his
newfound fans.
</P>
<P>
   The car stopped at Lot 61, where a young crowd was celebrating
the birthday of Mark Silver, a publicist friend of Vilanch's. But
from the moment Vilanch entered, the party shifted focus, with
admirers descending on him, including one Fran Drescher type who
got close to his face and demanded, ``Are you having fun?'' Vilanch
assured her he was. So were cast members of ``The Donkey Show,''
the 1970s take on ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' which is playing
across the street from Lot 61 at El Flamingo. They danced around in
hot pants and body glitter, imploring Vilanch to see their show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about spreading love and glitter,'' cooed one cast
member. Vilanch was soon covered in the stuff and saying he needed
dermabrasion.
</P>
<P>
   A young man cornered Vilanch and gushed: ``You're like a
superstar. You're everywhere!'' Clearly, the fan knew Vilanch only
from his latest efforts, and not from such '70s clunkers as ``The
Brady Bunch Variety Hour,'' which he wrote and now calls the Dead
Sea Scrolls of television, along with the original ``Donny and
Marie Show'' and the movie ``Mahogany,'' in which he played a
fashion designer.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight, Vilanch had made his way to a party in his honor
given by HX magazine, a free gay weekly, at Hannah's Lava Lounge, a
lively bar in Hell's Kitchen featuring silver walls, ``Boys Don't
Cry'' posters and a crowd that seemed out of the later plays of
Tennessee Williams. People again swarmed him. ``Bruce is so
brilliant,'' noted Marc Berkley, a co-publisher of HX. ``It's a
shame some of the gay community rejects him just because he's not
gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by the attention, Vilanch broke away to survey the bar's
collection of video games. ``I've never seen a video game with
fruit,'' he said. ``We are in the right neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than play a game though, he headed back to the Excelsior
Hotel, where he was staying, to pare down the unwieldy first act of
``Almost Famous.'' As he was leaving at 12:45, a young man stopped
him to say he'd loved the show, with one reservation. ``At first
the jokes were over my head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine too,'' Vilanch said. ``You'll grow into them.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fretting over what to wear to her daughter's wedding,
Ilene Beckerman experienced an instant of panic. ``Everybody
remembers Princess Diana's wedding dress, but who remembers what
her mother wore?'' she told herself soothingly. ``Nobody pays
attention to the mother of the bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckerman knows better, of course. Taut as a snare drum, smooth
and polished as an apple, the mother of the bride these days is apt
to be as raptly scrutinized and cooed over as the bride herself.
With that in mind, Beckerman, who chronicles her experiences in a
new book, ``Mother of the Bride'' (Algonquin, $17.95), which she
wrote and illustrated, resolved not to fade into the marquetry at
her own daughter's wedding. Bypassing the discreet beige that more
conventional women trot out for such occasions, she chose a
decollete-baring number that riveted all eyes to her chest.
</P>
<P>
   Her dress was not, in a word, standard-issue
mother-of-the-bride, or MOB, garment-speak for a category of dress
that is fast outgrowing the decorous frocks of old. ``The time of
wearing a pale tunic and skirt is way past,'' said Rachel R.
Leonard, the fashion director of Bride magazine, an industry bible.
``It's a much hipper category than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentality of the mother of the bride changed,'' said the
designer Carolina Herrera, who is often consulted for weddings by
the gilded set. ``She no longer wants the gray chiffon or the
little lace dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Gabay, 62, is typical of the militantly modern new mother
of the bride. ``Wear a beige dress with sequins?'' snapped Gabay, a
retired beauty industry executive living in Boca Raton, Fla. ``No
way! I jog four miles a day, I'm a size 6, and I wanted to look
like myself.''
</P>
<P>
   For her daughter Madeline's wedding in New York last June, she
wore a pink strapless gown with sheer inserts that showed off her
legs to the hips _ ``tasteful but certainly sexy,'' she said. ``It
could have been construed as a dress you wear to one of those
awards shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabay shares with many of her contemporaries a giddy fascination
with such media extravaganzas. Not less than the stars, they crave
their moment in the limelight. ``Women now have a really strong
picture of how they want to look,'' said Nadine Lopez Knudsen, a
New York couturier, who frequently outfits wedding parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the influence is Hollywood. We all want a little
glamour in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a competitiveness bred by long years in the
workplace, many women seem to envision their daughter's wedding as
a crowning moment of their own lives _ a time to celebrate personal
triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, between going to the gym and plastic surgery,
everybody looks younger longer,'' said Frank Composto, a New York
fashion designer.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, mothers are motivated by the desire to take
center stage at the kind of fairy-tale wedding they never had
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of women I dress at least give lip service
that they do not want to overtrump the bride,'' said Vera Wang, the
doyenne of lavish New York weddings, who sells her body-skimming
evening wear to many mothers of the bride. ``In reality, however, I
have done some things so sensual, so sexy, that they could have
gone to the Oscars.''
</P>
<P>
   These days such showstoppers might include a Champagne-tone
number designed by Craig Natiello of Halston, which Joanne de
Guardiola plans to wear to the wedding of her stepdaughter, Jeanne,
in Southhampton on June 17. ``It's gorgeous, very classic and
form-fitting,'' breathed de Guardiola, describing a dress that was
cut to follow her size 6 frame.
</P>
<P>
   The dresses vary in mood from a minimalist black jersey leotard
top and skirt by Wang that was worn in 1996 by Sandy Perlbinder, a
New York filmmmaker, to a pull-out-all-the-stops confection
designed by Composto for Alinda Wyckert, a Texas socialite.
Complete with a black bustier and a cabbage-rose-clotted skirt, it
included a bustle and an elaborate train. ``Sharon Stone saw its
likeness at a White House dinner and loved it,'' Composto boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Finkel, a personal shopper, who dresses many mothers of
the bride, said: ``Mothers all adore their daughters, but sometimes
they forget that the wedding is not their affair. Nine times out of
10, they will tell you, `I want simple, I want sleek, I want
nothing on the dress.''' But then comes the transformation. ``They
end up as embellished as a party gift,'' Finkel said, sighing.
``All those tulle buttoms and bustier tops. All they need is a
veil, and you could push them down the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel works hard to prevent such lapses. She was not on hand,
however, at one wedding chosen by the mother of the bride as her
own moment to shine. As her daughter told a bridesmaid, the mother
pressured her to wear a conventional, nondescript frock bought off
the rack for $300. Then she was utterly eclipsed by her mother, a
vibrant bird of paradise in custom-designed raspberry satin, a
coal-size gemstone fastened to her chest. According to the
bridesmaid, the mother had never had a wedding of her own and was
making up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   But such strenuous efforts to compete are more the exception
than the rule. More typical is Pearlbinder, of the leotard-bodice
Vera Wang. ``All I really wanted was to feel young in what I was
choosing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beckerman, who subtitled her book ``The Dream, the Reality, the
Search for the Perfect Dress,'' acknowledged that she lacked the
discipline to shed pounds for a contour-skimming siren dress.
Seeking the safety of the traditional, she tried on, and discarded,
a pink and violet chiffon print (``Lady Bird Johnson would have
loved it,'' she writes) and a turquoise crepe (``I looked like a
wall in a hospital'') before settling on something more daring.
</P>
<P>
   The dress she wore plunged precipitously, though it covered the
proverbial multitude of sins. Beckerman said, ``I learned a long
time ago, if you show a little cleavage, nobody ever looks anywhere
else.''

&HT;     SAILOR AWAITING SPY TRIAL BARRED FROM SPEAKING TO LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, May 7)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

   WASHINGTON _ A sailor accused of giving the Russians secrets
about the U.S. submarine fleet has encountered a unique obstacle in
his efforts to mount a defense: The Navy won't let him meet
privately with his lawyers out of fear that he might reveal
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Daniel King, an intelligence
analyst being held in the U.S. Marine Corps brig at Quantico, Va.,
faces one count of espionage and two counts of improperly
disclosing classified information for allegedly passing submarine
secrets to Moscow. He could receive the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   King, a cryptography or code expert, was working at the National
Security Agency in Fort Meade, Md., in 1994 when he allegedly gave
the Russians a computer disk containing U.S. submarine data.
</P>
<P>
   King, 40, an 18-year Navy veteran and a native of Elyria, Ohio,
was arrested in the Washington, D.C. area by the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service on last Oct. 28 and charged Nov. 5. King
allegedly flunked a routine lie detector test, drawing suspicion
from investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But King has not met with his Navy or civilian defense attorneys
since March 2 when Vice Admiral Joseph S. Mobley, commander of the
U.S. Atlantic Fleet's air unit, barred all contact between the
defendant and his lawyers unless a Navy security officer was
present at the meetings. The Navy said some of King's attorneys
lack high security clearance called ``special access,'' reserved
for some of the nation's most guarded secrets, higher that ``top
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   King's civilian defense counsel, Jonathan Turley, a George
Washington University law professor, said the order also has the
effect of barring e-mails and telephone conversations among the
defense attorneys without a security officer present because all
three of King's lawyers have different levels of security
clearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gross violation of attorney-client privilege,''
Turley said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   `My client is facing death and this is an untenable idea. What
we are asking is for the right to speak (privately) with our
client.''
</P>
<P>
   The case currently is awaiting the military equivalent of a
grand jury proceeding, known as an Article 32, where King could be
formally indicted. The Article 32 is on hold, however, pending
Turley's appeal to the military's highest court, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Armed Forces, to strike the protective order.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Military Justice, a private
organization that monitors military courts, agreed that the
requirement of a security officer ``seemingly shatters the concept
of confidentiality and the attorney-client relationship along with
it. In our corporate experience and research, such an order is
completely without precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the National Association of Criminal Lawyers said
that the protective order ``raises grave and fundamental
constitutional concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is counsel to prepare for cross-examination, to know what
defense witnesses and evidence is available if they cannot
communicate with the accused with a certainty of privilege,'' the
group asked. The Navy has ``functionally barred the effective
assistance of counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Both organizations filed amicus briefs in the appeal, which is
expected to be decided within the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Roxie Merritt, a Navy spokeswoman for Mobley in Norfolk,
Va., countered that the service is taking great pains to protect
King's rights while, at the same time, guarding national security.
For example, she said the Navy would appoint the security officer
as a dedicated member of the defense team who wouldn't be called as
a witness to testify against King.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always security officers in classified court
cases,'' she said. ``But this is the first time that we've
appointed a security officer as a member of the defense team.''
</P>
<P>
   While it might be unusual to treat an individual akin to a
secret document, Merritt said the Navy's view is that the
information in King's head must be kept protected. ``We go to great
lengths to protect national security secrets. There are American
lives at stake and the lives of allies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In defense counsel meetings, the security officer's role would
not be to obstruct the defense, Merritt said. ``If the officer
senses that they are going to talk about things that are
classified, his objective would be to prevent them from going to
that area and warn them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with that arrangement, however, is that it could
easily run afoul of Navy regulations. If King disclosed classified
information in the presence of people who lack proper clearances,
the security officer must report any suspected violations to Navy
officials, Merritt said.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the security officer would be serving two masters, an
arrangement Turley says in unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt said King's attorneys could simply apply for the proper
clearances to end the dispute, allowing the case to move forward to
the Article 32 grand jury then on to a possible trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Turley countered that it could take months for the defense
legal team to obtain special access clearance.

CONSORTIUM ENCOURAGED BY SIGNS OF BIG OIL FIELD IN CASPIAN SEA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ A consortium of nine foreign energy
companies has found oil in a huge Caspian Sea field, and resumed
drilling to determine just how much exists, officials close to the
companies say.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the find may prove to be huge were raised last week,
when President Nursultan Nazarbayev said at an international forum
here that the field, called Kashagan, looked so promising that he
expected Kazakhstan to export as much oil as Saudi Arabia by 2015 _
8 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were premature. The consortium has not yet
determined whether Kashagan contains commercial volumes of oil. But
the officials said Friday that they were encouraged by the data
accumulated so far and that they would accelerate work on the
salt-domed field.
</P>
<P>
   While it will be at least another month before the drilling
establishes whether Kashagan has commercial volumes of oil, the
news that it does contain oil _ and not natural gas or water _ has
prompted much excitement among government and industry officials
both here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Situated 40 miles off the northeast Kazakhstan coast, Kashagan
is a 2,000-square-mile field shaped roughly like an hour glass.
Early optimism was based on its proximity to and geologic
similarity with the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan, one of the world's
10 largest oil deposits, with recoverable reserves of between 9
billion and 13 billion barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
   According to seismic tests, the Kashagan structure is two and a
half times the size of Tengiz, making Kashagan potentially one of
the world's five largest oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   Drilling began last year by the consortium partners: Agip of
Italy, BG PLC of Britain, Inpex of Japan, Totalfina of France,
Statoil of Norway, Phillips Petroleum, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
BP Amoco and Exxon Mobil.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much caution has accompanied the exploration because of a
handful of dry holes drilled in the last couple of years across the
Caspian in Azerbaijan. Moreover, the region has turned up a surplus
of natural gas, so that some oil executives have regarded a
possible similar find at Kashagan almost as unfavorably as water.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium penetrated the three-mile-deep salt dome last
month. The drill instantly confronted natural gas, but the gas
dissipated and then all-but disappeared approximately 10 feet
deeper, according to officials close to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, chips of rock that found their way to the surface in
the drilling process revealed much evidence of hydrocarbons, these
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the consortium planned at this point to shift the
drilling platform to a second test well in a part of Kashagan 25
miles further west. But the initial results convinced the partners
instead to drill further in the current well to try to find its
conclusive ``oil-water contact line'' _ the depth of the oil
floating above the subterranean water also contained within
Kashagan.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium has said it may be able to determine whether
Kashagan contains commercial volumes of oil by June.
</P>
<P>
   If the consortium does declare Kashagan commercial, the
companies may contractually be forced to begin production by 2005 _
thus becoming key to the U.S.-backed oil pipeline to the
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, Turkey. Washington has sought to have
the pipeline built by 2004.

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ If Kent Desormeaux could navigate a fish to
fame two years ago in the Kentucky Derby, he figures he certainly
can do it again Saturday with an armored personnel carrier.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the California-based jockey compares Real Quiet,
nicknamed ``The Fish'' by trainer Bob Baffert because of his slim
stature, to Fusaichi Pegasus, the favorite to win the 126th running
of the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of talent, I think they're comparable,'' Desormeaux
said shortly after arriving here from a red-eye flight Friday
morning. ``In stature and conformation, there wasn't anything to
the other guy (Real Quiet). My ankles rubbed together when I rode
him. This guy's a tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, a son of the late Mr. Prospector, was a
stunning winner of the Wood Memorial in his last start, and has won
four in a row since losing his debut by a neck. He's as imposing as
Real Quiet was ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like comparing Shaquille O'Neal to Michael Jordan,
except (Real Quiet) wasn't that crafty on his feet,'' said
Desormeaux, who will be on his ninth Derby mount.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Desormeaux vehicle is trained by freshly minted Hall
of Famer Neil Drysdale. Fusaichi Pegasus will have to conquer a
large field of 18 opponents and a harrowing historical trend that
has buried 20 consecutive post-time betting choices in the 1
1/4-mile classic.
</P>
<P>
   This also will be Drysdale's first Derby starter, but Desormeaux
and Drysdale sound confident, tradition be damned. Desormeaux's
experience on Real Quiet should give him an advantage over many of
the riders _ six of them rookies _ in this cluttered field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now that I've got a win under my belt, it's a lot
easier to go around there and not be in a panic or concerned about
whether I screwed up my chance to win one,'' Desormeaux said. ``I
can just go out there and ride the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The major knocks against Fusaichi Pegasus are an unpredictable
temperament and the absence of a 2-year-old foundation. His first
race came less than three weeks before he turned 3. Drysdale said
that timetable was no accident.
</P>
<P>
   As for the colt's tendency to act up when he isn't racing,
Drysdale said, ``It's not been a concern to me. But it sure gave
you guys a lot to write about.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said Fusaichi Pegasus was capable physically of racing
as a 2-year-old, but that he wanted to take his time with the $4
million colt because he was so large and needed time to grow out.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale's other Derby entrant, War Chant, also had only one
race at age 2. And, chronologically, War Chant will not turn 3
until after the Derby (Jan. 1 is the universally assigned birthday
of all thoroughbreds).
</P>
<P>
   ``War Chant was foaled on May 22 and he's slightly more
immature,'' said Drysdale, a soft-spoken Englishman who will be
enshrined in the Racing Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs on Aug. 7.
``That's why we're putting on the blinkers. Some horses mature very
quickly and are precocious. They're ready to run as 2-year-olds. It
took a while longer than some others for Fusaichi Pegasus to be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus broke his maiden on Jan. 2 and has been a
runaway freight train since. He won an allowance in February, then
beat The Deputy and 2-year-old champion Anees before romping to a
four-length win in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody is convinced that the race should be conceded
to Drysdale's stable star just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got great credentials coming off a strong Wood,''
said trainer D. Wayne Lukas, a four-time Derby winner who will
saddle High Yield, Commendable and Exchange Rate on Saturday. ``But
I think that was a tough race on everybody. He's coming here and
he's had those good days and bad days. I think this is a race where
you better be pretty focused. It's not a soft enough field where
you can make any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas knows of what he speaks. He has sent out a record 35 Derby
starters, including last year's long-shot darling, Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum, who is starting long shots China
Visit and Curule as an entry from Dubai, also is unconvinced that
Fusaichi Pegasus can become the first favorite to win since
Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the winner will be an outsider, not the favorite,'' he
said. ``This is such a difficult race.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, who saddled Real Quiet and Silver Charm to
back-to-back Derby victories, is hoping to upset the favorite with
Hollywood Futurity winner Captain Steve, who remains in search of
his first win as a 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked great without blinkers,'' Baffert said. ``The last
couple of times he ran, the riders said he seemed to get edgy and a
little hot going to the gate. He's more relaxed without them.
Basically, what we need now is some luck.''
</P>
<P>
   A little luck also might help Jenine Sahadi become the first
woman trainer to win a Derby. She has an excellent chance with The
Deputy.

A TRITE, CLICHED TRY AT AN INTERNET MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is one distinct advantage to downloading a movie and
watching it on your computer. In a word, multitasking. While you
wait for the darn thing to download, you can read your e-mail,
check your stocks, and research your ancestry. While you watch the
darn thing, you can read your e-mail, check your stocks . . .
</P>
<P>
   You get the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quantum Project,'' billed as ``the first premiere event'' to
debut on the Internet, is a multitasking kind of movie, as trite
and cliched as a futuristic, sci-fi romance can get. In fact, it's
hard to decide which is more tedious: the process of downloading
the movie or the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the 32-minute film wins the tedium prize. Why? At
least the two-hour downloading process required some investigative
reporting that will come in handy some day.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't believe the hype, there is no arguing that the
$3 million film represents the wave of the future. Produced by the
team that made ``What Dreams May Come'' and financed by
SightSound.com, it was made exclusively for distribution on the
Internet. Some day, all films will be distributed online, but the
technology isn't exactly there yet. The high-resolution version
($5.95) took 37 minutes to download Friday using a high-speed
Internet connection. No problem there. But then there was this
little problem when I tried to open the file: I received a message
demanding that I make Internet Explorer my ``default browser,''
instead of Netscape. That should have been easy _ at least that's
what three technical wizards here at the Globe thought. Eventually,
somebody figured out how to change the settings, just around the
time that the folks at SightSound.com answered my frantic e-mail
begging for support.
</P>
<P>
   That was way too much work for what was supposed to be a leisure
experience. After all, this ain't quantum physics.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the movie, which is quantum physics, of a sort.
See, there's this guy named Paul (a blurry Stephen Dorff). He's a
scientist. He smashes atoms. He hallucinates. He multitasks (go,
Paul!). The plot is about as fuzzy as the film quality, which fades
from sepia tones to shadows. There's an accident involving three
Volkswagen Beetles, and somehow, the physicist meets up with his
old flame (a blurry Fay Masterson), who may or may not be restoring
a building that resembles the Sistine Chapel. The lonely physicist
ends up having a tete-a-tete with his father (a blurry John
Cleese), who may or may not be ``the ob-gyn of the Internet.'' All
this amid fiery electrons that seem to communicate messages from
the great beyond, a glass that moves magically across a table, and
an electronic soundtrack that provides appropriate white noise.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to spoil the ending and tell you whether the
unfeeling physicist wins the artistic beauty back. Actually, I'm
not really sure myself. Maybe the answer is in the credits that are
impossible to see at the end. But, oh well. Maybe the plot doesn't
matter. Consider the movie's great epiphany: ``Reality is what you
choose to make it.'' Such poetry, that.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the reality. If anyone seriously expects folks to go
through the trouble of downloading movies, they have to make movies
that are worth the wait. Granted, ``Quantum Project'' is an
interesting (if expensive and overly hyped) experiment, and it does
point toward the future. But despite what you may have read, the
future isn't now, not yet.

 &HT;    The (inter)face of arts adn technology
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 7.
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a meeting of palette and pixel.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing they need each other to grow, Atlanta's arts
community and its high-tech industry are linking in creative ways,
forming connections that will place fresh troops on nonprofit
boards and reboot the arts' presence among e-world workers and
online.
</P>
<P>
   And if the arts happen to find a little extra cash along the way
_ well, no one's complaining.
</P>
<P>
   This convergence is also helping change the way the arts are
perceived by the business establishment. No longer can the city
powers afford to regard theater, opera, music, dance and the visual
arts merely as tasteful highbrow diversions, an extra for the
elite, something for the wives to do.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by recent criticism of Atlanta's arts commitment, leaders
around town, from both the arts and business spheres, agree that
building a national arts profile is a quality-of-life necessity for
a city competing for wired-world talent against such cultural
capitals as San Francisco, Seattle and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some steps have been taken to reach that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural technology task force for the Woodruff Arts
Center's annual corporate campaign recently raised $250,000 from
the high-tech sector. The campaign hopes to attain its overall goal
of $6.6 million next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two goals,'' says Bert Rayle, regional manager at
Goldman Sachs, who chaired the 19-member task force. ``We wanted to
get active participation, and we wanted to raise a little money.
We've done better on both fronts than we would have anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-million dollars donated by the city's
``up-and-coming wealth'' represents ``virtually all new money'' for
the arts, Rayle says, coming from entrepreneurs such as Alan
Daniels of realestate.com, Jeff Levy of eHatchery and Bob Cramer of
adam.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competing for talent means putting the best face on the
city,'' says co-chairman Steven J. Heyer, president and chief
operating officer of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. ``A critical
component of that is the quality of schools and other institutions
that enrich folks. I put the Woodruff high on that list.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arts &AMP; Business Council of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce has, for the first time, recruited its chairman from the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   John Bacon is president and CEO of Iterated Systems, a software
company that helps businesses retain control of their brands on the
Web _ ``imagewear for e-commerce,'' he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon has a much wider target than the Woodruff task force: the
development _ and preservation _ of the culturescape that exists
beyond the mighty arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, who serves on the board of the Atlanta Singers, a premier
a cappella vocal group, is engaging high-tech firms around the
area, such as iXl and Macquarium, to help explore ways to sustain
the area's niche theaters, pocket-size dance companies and eclectic
music ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see another Jomandi story,'' he says,
referring to the city's flagship African-American theater, which
cut short its current season due to financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a natural creative affinity between technology workers
and arts enthusiasts, the Georgia Tech grad emphasizes a ground-up
approach that builds audiences, primarily by better communicating
what groups exist and what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, 54, wants to build an ``arts portal,'' which he
alternately describes as a ``really good Web site'' and ``on ramp''
for engaging audiences. Ideally, online visitors will use it to
find event listings, participate in chats, read reviews and learn
about volunteer opportunities with, say, the Metropolitan Atlanta
Arts Fund or the metro chamber's Business Volunteers for the Arts,
a program that trains professionals to be efficient nonprofit
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to have the community-oriented site up and running by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The portal is a natural way to ``speak'' to the local tech work
force, which, Bacon says, numbers between 160,000 and 190,000
people under age 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young folks we're talking about have plenty of money,
and they're happily willing to spend that money on meaningful arts
participation,'' says Bacon, who has 50 employees in his Piedmont
Road office in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not an issue. It's just getting them there and
helping them be aware of it. Then their employers will see these
people going to Jomandi or Dad's Garage or wherever, and they'll
see them coming back to work re-energized and happy. They'll see
them staying with the company, which is the biggest issue that
technology folks face today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon frequently cites Dad's Garage Theatre Company, a
shoestring troupe near Little Five Points specializing in
off-the-wall improvisation, as an example of the cutting-edge
creativity that appeals to the dot-com generation.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Dad's Garage has one of the more active
arts group Web sites in town. The company gets 20,000 hits per
month at www.dadsgarage.com, according to artistic director Sean
Daniels. He says half the theater's 30,000 tickets sold this season
were purchased online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Web site is our main marketing tool,'' says Daniels, whose
company operates on a $250,000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being updated daily, the Web site features an online
improv soap opera, ``Scandal,'' which visitors can participate in
by typing in a message. (A recent entry: ``I think Dr. Weeds is
even more handsome with his gruesome open wound, it draws attention
away from his face.'')
</P>
<P>
   The theater's Web site is sponsored by MindSpring, and Daniels
says the contribution amounts to ``about $2,500 worth of free Web
space and free accounts for our staff.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, MindSpring gets free tickets for employees to Dad's
Garage improv shows. ``We let them come here and blow off steam and
shout and yell,'' Daniels says. ``And they go back to work as
happier MindSpring employees.''
</P>
<P>
   In a burst of e-theater ambition, Dad's Garage is planning to
mount Web cams in its steel-roofed theater to broadcast next year's
annual fund-raiser in its entirety _ 25 1/2 hours of nonstop
improvisation _ over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Considering all this interactivity, it's no surprise that
Daniels, 27, has joined Bacon on the Arts &AMP; Business Council.
Daniels loves Bacon's portal idea. ``We (Dad's Garage) have our
own, but as far as everyone else goes, it's really hard to figure
out what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   A sophisticated portal unifying the arts community might also
spark fund-raising. It's important to connect with these tech-world
fans before they're ``zillionaires,'' Bacon says, by inventing new
ways for them to contribute financially, and electronically, to
arts groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these young people have stock options'' _ Iterated
employees do _ ``and some will be worth a lot of money,'' Bacon
says. ``Why shouldn't we invent simple processes that let them
allocate even a tiny portion of their options to some fund that
goes to support the arts?''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can certify the arts' new clout in the business world,
it's Ellen Meyer, president of the Atlanta College of Art.
</P>
<P>
   With Internet firms looking for designers, ACA students are more
employable than ever. More than half the students major in fields _
video, digital art, computer animation _ relating to technology. If
they're not being hired by local dot-coms, they're moving to
Silicon Alley and Silicon Valley. The animation chief and senior
art director from George Lucas' Industrial Light &AMP; Magic spent a
day on campus last month reviewing student portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyberspace is a visual world,'' Meyer says, ``and that's
wonderful for our students, because it creates a creative ground
for them. These two worlds are really coming together _ art and
design and business and technology. As they do, art becomes a full
player at the table alongside other business concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Often in the shadow of other Woodruff Arts Center divisions _
the Alliance Theatre, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the High
Museum of Art _ the art college has new celebrity thanks, in part,
to the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden we're kind of hot,'' says Sallie Adams Daniel,
chairwoman of the college board and senior vice president at Bank
of America. ``I see us as the way that the Woodruff Arts Center is
going to relate to the high-tech community.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline its technological 'tude, the school invited
Marc Adler, the 27-year-old chairman of Buckhead-based Macquarium,
to speak at Saturday's commencement. Adler is also the founder and
chairman of Artisan Network, a global consortium of art-related
companies and the parent company for MisterArt.com, described as
the world's largest online discount art supply store.
</P>
<P>
   Adler agrees that technology's need for artists has legitimized
the arts in the eyes of the old-line business community. The more
technological the world becomes, he says, the more businesses will
need artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question,'' the Emory University graduate says.
``Technology is about pushing the limits and doing something new
and creating something that wasn't there before. Thus, we are all
artists in our own way. And that's what everyone understands and
knows. That's where we all can talk in the same language. And so
when you talk about the culture of the city, these are two groups
that may not, on a strategic sense, seem to be united, but in a
fundamental sense they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, who has sung bass in the choir at Holy Innocents'
Episcopal Church for 18 years, says, ``It's people like us
musicians who make the best programmers, because a musician has to
deal with all kinds of things going on at once. And a really good
coder has to be able to do that, too. Linear sequential thinkers _
engineers _ typically don't make very good coders. It's just
another example of this arts-technology crossover.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the growth of Atlanta business depends on the
quality of the arts scene?
</P>
<P>
   More than one local high-tech executive says that to attract and
retain creative, highly skilled technology workers, Atlanta needs
to be known as more than a major-league locker room for
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview at his office, Bacon points out to a
cluster of employees. ``The people you'll find here are not the
stereotypical, bare-torsoed, painted-up sports fan,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we love to go to baseball games and whatever. But
these people are looking for more than just sports. Of that, we're
certain. We've got musicians. We've got performers. We have
artists. When they leave work, they're going to go find a great
jazz group or go to the symphony. They'll do all kinds of things
before they choose to go to a hockey fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Burgoom, 31, a program manager at Iterated Systems who has
sung with the Atlanta Symphony Chorus, among other vocal groups,
puts the tech community's interests in a simple light. ``People
like being part of an exciting, international, eclectic
community,'' he says. ``A lot want to do different things, use
other parts of their brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta doesn't yet have the reputation of a major arts haven.
Struggling institutions such as Jomandi and the Marietta/Cobb
Museum of Art face uncertain futures. Earlier this year, three
outgoing arts leaders _ Ned Rifkin of the High Museum, Chris
Coleman of Actor's Express and Harriet Sanford of the Fulton County
Arts Council _ publicly questioned the business community's
interest in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Sour grapes or wake-up call?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, some business people in the technology sector
suggest Atlanta's low profile in the arts dampens their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've heard (from recruits) is, there's nothing to do
here; it's just a big void,'' says Beverly McDonald, a partner at
Socket PR, a high-tech public relations firm in Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   At an economic forum in March at the metro chamber, McDonald
talked about interviewing people around the country who balked at
coming here due to the perceived arts climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit home hard,'' she says. ``I feel their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Socket has formed an in-house group to examine how
company employees might assist arts organizations of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Levine Hartz, community relations director of iXl
Enterprises, says the Internet service and consulting company has
had no problem luring out-of-town workers, citing the area's usual
strong points _ nice weather, good place to raise a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the arts community erodes further,'' she says, ``that's
one more strike against us. Just as traffic is a strike against
us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the economic forum, Iterated Systems' Bacon described
technology's track record for arts support as ``abysmal.''
</P>
<P>
   The nascent collaboration between arts and technology bodes
well, but tech gurus and art lovers such as Adler and Bacon say the
city has not yet arrived as a cultural destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have kind of a national scene anywhere,'' Adler says.
``We don't have kind of a centralized nucleus where we can gather.
Until we really unite as a city, we're not going to achieve the
greatness that a city like Seattle has, which is also a new city
that's embraced the technology and come up as a cultural mecca.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Bacon: ``Clearly, the money's here. We just need to get
hooked up better. You parachute into San Francisco, Boston, even
Cleveland, and you can't miss the arts. We don't have that quite
yet. We have to help make the arts more physically, tangibly
present, so that when you parachute in, you say, `Wow, this is a
cool place; I want to be here.' We need to work on that.''

 &HT;    Collectors can indulge habit at show
 &HT;    By Michelle C. Brooks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are a nation of collectors, and the South is catching on in a
big way.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast racked up $2 billion in collectible sales for
1998, a growing corner of the market that tallies $10 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder the International Collectible Exposition has
turned its attention to Atlanta. The prestigous show will be making
its Southern debut at the Georgia World Congress Center today and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing the passion that collectors have,'' says show
producer Claude Chmiel.
</P>
<P>
   In its 26th year, the exposition, sponsored by Krause
Publications, features more than 100 leading manufacturers
including Ashton-Drake Galleries, Barbie Collectibles/Mattel Inc.,
the Bradford Exchange, Cabbage Patch Kids, Harbour Lights, Howard
Miller, Kurt S. Adler and San Francisco Music Box Co. _ plus
hundreds of exhibit booths, seminars and artist signings.
</P>
<P>
   Several artists are scheduled to appear including acclaimed
African-American artist Annie Lee, Priscilla Hillman of Cherished
Teddies fame and Christopher Radko, the blown-glass ornament guru.
</P>
<P>
   Although collectors will not be able to shop at the show, a few
manufacturers _ Fitz &AMP; Floyd, Christopher Radko, Dreamsicles and
Harmony Kingdom _ will be selling pieces made specifically for the
show. Collectors looking to sell or trade their retired pieces will
enjoy the Swap 'n Sell two-day market. Seminars will include topics
such as: ``The Secondary Market: Tracking Your Collectible
Treasures.'' And for those who missed the Christie's auction, one
of Princess Diana's coveted gowns will be on display from
GoCollect.com.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the delicate figurines and the princess' dress
will be an 18-foot semi _ the Precious Moments Care-A-Van, a moving
museum. Recently renovated, this moving tribute to the art of
Samuel Butcher, artist for Enesco's Precious Moments line, will
interest those who adore the tear-drop-eyed figurines known for
their inspirational messages.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. One-day
admission is $7; two-day ticket is $10. Georgia World Congress

 &HT;    Exhibit explores cultural side of stew
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 7.
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take 200 pounds of meat, 100 pounds of onions, several gallons
of tomatoes and a heaping helping of tradition and throw it all in
a big iron kettle over an open flame. In a few hours, a good
old-fashioned Southern stew will bubble up _ enough to feed several
hundred at a fair or family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In Owensboro, Ky., the meat will be mutton and there will be
some lima beans and maybe some okra in the pot. It's called burgoo.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Roanoke River in Virginia, it's known as rockfish
muddle, because striped bass is used. And throughout South
Carolina, it's called hash _ a mixture of onions, potatoes, beef,
pork, chicken and, perhaps, organ meats, all ground and cooked
together and served with rice.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients vary by location, but the tradition of slowly
simmering large batches of stew for community gatherings is a
shared one captured in a new exhibit at the University of South
Carolina's McKissick Museum in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibit really deals with the history of these stews, the
interaction of the cultures,'' said Jay Williams, McKissick's chief
curator of exhibits. ``So many people have eaten these stews and
don't even question where they came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Stew making is rooted in Colonial times. Europeans brought over
hunter stews or camp stews, which included the wild game of the
day; African slaves accustomed to black pot cooking had their
favorite stews; and Native Americans made vegetable stews. Soon
these traditions were blended and through the centuries have
evolved. Each stew has a story, and the origins of some are a
matter of hot debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like unscrambling an egg,'' Williams said. ``It's
difficult to pin down exact origins because the stews are a product
of very complex cultural interchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunswick County, Va., and Brunswick, Ga., have a longstanding
feud over who made the first Brunswick stew. Stewmasters from each
place frequently face off in cooking contests. (The Virginians won
the last one, yet the trophy mysteriously ended up in Georgia.) The
McKissick exhibit weighs in for the Virginians, citing early 1800s
diary entries of plantation owner Creed Haskins.
</P>
<P>
   Williams researched the exhibit with Stan Woodward, who has been
documenting the making of stews for nearly 10 years. Woodward's
videos are the central focus of the exhibit, which has three
viewing stations _ one for Brunswick stew footage (from both
Virginia and Georgia,) one for mutton-based stews (like burgoo in
Kentucky and sheep stew in Virginia), and one for Carolina
traditions of hash and Lowcountry boils. In addition, there are
photographs and artifacts, like heirloom stew paddles, cook pots
and recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said as urbanization takes over many towns and
mom-and-pop restaurants are closing, the stews aren't as available
as they once were. But they are still being made in home kitchens
and at large public events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southerners tenaciously hold onto their food ways as a part of
their identity,'' Williams said. ``It's one of the taproots of
Southern culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Stews''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit runs through Oct. 29 at the McKissick Museum, Bull
and Pendleton streets on the campus of the University of South
Carolina. 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Mondays- Fridays, 1-5 p.m. Saturdays and
Sundays. Information: 803-777-5400.

   Brunswick Proclamation Stew
</P>

   Makes 600 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation /cooking time: 7 hours
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the recipes featured in the ``Southern Stews''
exhibit. It certainly is a good indication of the work of a
stewmaster. We didn't test it and wouldn't dare to find out the
nutritional information, but it sure sounds like a crowd pleaser
(though we're told it comes from Virginia, not Georgia.)

red pepper and black pepper. Continue cooking and add corn after
cooking approximately 6 hours. Let corn cook 30 minutes, add
butter, take off heat and continue stirring until served. Makes 75
gallons.

 &HT;    For racing-circuit chef, cooking is no drag
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMERCE, Ga. _ The JEG's drag racing teams pulled into Commerce
this week accompanied by two tractor-trailers, two pro-stock cars,
two pro-stock trucks, a mobile home, motorcycles, golf carts, a
tent, some chairs, grills, an entourage of 20 or so _ and a chef.
</P>
<P>
   While the teams spent Friday morning fine-tuning their engines,
Ian Rough rushed to the grocery and plucked eight fresh avocados,
10 pounds of chicken, cheese, peppers, onions and flour tortillas
to make fajitas for lunch. He also snagged ingredients to make
rigatoni for dinner and other meals throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Rough's job is to keep teams and their families well-fueled
throughout the weekend of racing at the Advance Auto Parts National
Hot Rod Association Southern Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   That would include Jake Coughlin, a race car builder and owner
of JEG's, a high-performance auto parts distributor in Columbus,
Ohio, who leads the group. And his sons, Jake Jr., John, Troy and
Mike, who are race drivers. And wives and kids traveling with them,
and technicians such as clutch and transmission specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Coughlins are now the envy of the circuit _ the only teams
with their own chef. And Rough's cooking beats the heck out of
midway food, say members of the Coughlin family, who decided to
hire a chef after years of making do with whatever they could grab
from vendors or late-night restaurants. Jake's wife, Sue, tried
feeding the crew, but as the numbers grew, she got fed up with
kitchen duty.
</P>
<P>
   So, relying on a friend's recommendation in Columbus, she hired
Rough, 23, straight out of the Culinary Institute of America, the
nation's top cooking school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It combines two of my favorite things, cooking and cars,''
said Rough, as he mashed avocados into guacamole. ``But no, I never
dreamed when I was in cooking school that I'd end up with a job
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rough travels with the team to about 24 races between February
and November. Last year, he worked in the mobile home; this year he
has a custom kitchen on one of the tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
   His emphasis is on good, healthy food made with fresh local
ingredients, whether it's Seattle or Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe we've won a lot of races because of Ian. I've
told him if he ever leaves, he has to give us two years' notice,''
said Jake Sr.
</P>
<P>
   The Coughlins are successful; Jake Jr. currently is the points
leader in the pro-stock car division.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying races began Thursday and run through today at the
Atlanta Dragway in Commerce. Final rounds will be Sunday, when $1.7
million in prizes will be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the drag racing competition on Saturday is $38 for
adults, $10 for children ages 6-12, free for ages 5 and under.
Sunday fees are $42 for adults, with children's prices remaining
the same. Gates open at 7 a.m. both days, with races starting at 8
a.m. Saturday and 9:30 a.m. Sunday.

 &HT;    TV season made us feel like a million bucks
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 7.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Switzerland!'' she cried.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland? My wife is in another room, watching ``Who Wants to
be a Millionaire,'' shouting out the name of that historically
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
   Weird. She's not generally a shouter, and when she is, she's
generally not shouting out European states. But that's her answer
to a question on ``Millionaire,'' and like so many of us this TV
season, which ends May 24, she's talking directly to the TV, as if
a two-way wire somehow ran from our set directly to Regis Philbin's
ear.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not with her. I'm with my son in the living room, where the
TV is off. We're trying, this once, not to let ``Millionaire'' suck
us in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleeping sickness!'' she cries.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping sickness? All right, that's it. I'm in. I toss a
catalog on the coffee table, jump off the couch and rush to the
bedroom, where ``Millionaire'' glows on the tube like a votive
candle.
</P>
<P>
   Some guy from somewhere (aren't they all some guy from
somewhere?) has already won $32,000, and Reege's eyes are twinkling
_ partially from that twinkly Irish DNA of his, and partially, I
think, from the reflected sheen of his latest Mafia don wear: dark
suit, darker shirt, shiny dark tie.
</P>
<P>
   My wife's poised for the next question. I am, too. My son
continues to hold out in the living room. When we win our million
tonight, we're cutting him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' doesn't usually polarize the family like this.
Just the opposite. When some guy from somewhere won a million
dollars one night (``Cockroach!'' my son shouted incorrectly to the
million-dollar question about which insect shorted an early
computer that led to the term ``computer bug''; it was a moth), the
three of us exploded into a whoop not heard inside the house since
... actually, we had never, ever whooped like that before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Millionaire'' became so much a part of our nights
together that when we moved in front of the set following dinner
one Wednesday and found some sitcom on instead of ``Millionaire,''
my son looked at me like that paperboy famously looked at Shoeless
Joe Jackson after learning he threw the 1919 World Series (``Say it
ain't so, Joe'') and asked, ``How come it's not on more often?''
</P>
<P>
   I explained that ``Millionaire'' was already on at least three
nights a week, more than any network show not called ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said. ``But how
</P>
<P>
   come it's not on every night?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Good question. There have been better TV seasons than the one
about to conclude but rarely has there been one more fun, and most
of the credit goes to ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if once a game show was unloosed in prime time to
become the most successful program on TV _ ``Millionaire'' should
be this season's three highest rated regular shows, averaging about
29 million viewers _ everything was up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Couric could show us her colonoscopy on NBC's ``Today''
(during which her doctor declared her ``clean as a whistle!''). CBS
could air ``Fail Safe,'' its first live drama in 39 years (with
more coming next season, can another ``Golden Age'' of live drama
be far behind?). ABC's Peter Jennings could win raves and viewers
(and a Peabody) by anchoring 24 straight hours of globe-trotting
millennium coverage, a rare, joyfully optimistic news event that
``Millionaire'' executive producer Michael Davies called a revival
of the variety show _ the next dead genre he expects the networks
to resuscitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Jennings sat there and said, `Let me show you another
thing,' just as Ed Sullivan used to say, `Now watch this,''' said
Davies. ``I know these news guys don't like to hear that. But Peter
did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman's heart got a lube job, and he returned bigger
than Jay Leno. CBS' Bryant Gumble got a new job on a morning show
that virtually no one watched and managed to lure even fewer
viewers (you do that math). John McCain made Americans of every
stripe care about televised presidential politics in February, the
Arizona senator's Straight Talk Express tour bus captivating
nightly news viewers like the enigmatic noodling of Albert Brooks'
trailer home in ``Lost in America.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a TV season that made us talk about TV again _ good, bad,
the worst. We talked about it, even as we were supposedly
e-chatting and
</P>

   e-shopping and e-trading all night long. After ratings declines
of 3 percent to 10 percent each year since the 1994-95 season, the
major broadcast networks' combined ratings this season are
virtually flat _ chiefly because of ``Millionaire.'' In a media
universe that feels splintered beyond recognition, TV felt warm and
bright enough again to reclaim its place as the national fireplace
_ a spot where we could all gather separately to share, you know,
somebody else's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom says TV makes you stupid,'' said Stevie (Craig Lamar
Traylor), the four-eyed, asthmatic best friend in a wheelchair on
Fox's ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' the season's only breakout sitcom
(yes, the sitcom is dead).
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid?'' said a disbelieving Malcolm (Frankie Muniz),the
freshest voice from the American family since Bart Simpson. ``TV
makes you normal!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Well, normal is stretching it. ``Millionaire'' did have its
collateral damage. Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?'' was
watched by more people who claimed to hate themselves afterward
than any show in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger _ those crazy kids with the
porn-star names _ seemed scissored straight from the pages of
Post-Modern Bride. We saw this one coming a mile away and still we
couldn't not watch. They were like wedding cake figurines placed on
America's altar _ a Las Vegas hotel stage _ then brought suddenly
to life by Fox and sicced, Frankenstein-like, on the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marry'' captured perfectly the conflicted nature of our
televised times: We want to see it all, and we want it on record
how bad we think it is to look. Who wants to marry a millionaire?
Hell, we all do. But like ol' what-was-I-thinking Darva, we woke
the next morning to a world-class hangover, with the lyin' lug
snoring right there beside us.
</P>
<P>
   We promised never to drink like that again: The weeks following
that Fox special, when Rick and Darva made their separate,
pre-annulled rounds with Diane and Larry and whoever else asked,
were this season's ritual atonement, a kind of Stations of the
Cross that reminded us just how bad we'd been, and how sorry we
were, and how we would avoid all temptation in the future _ or at
least until the end of this month, when CBS airs ``Survivor,''
which strands 16 strangers on an island and films their attrition.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Other nights, other
</P>
<P>
   channels. ...
</P>
<P>
   The season's most restorative surprise was NBC's ``The West
Wing,'' a political drama created by Aaron Sorkin. He'd also
created ABC's ``Sports Night,'' the laugh-trackless dramedy that
last year promised to redefine the sitcom _ until both it, and the
sitcom, tanked. (Yes, the sitcom is dead. Remember ``Action''?)
</P>
<P>
   ``West Wing'' toted the season's heaviest baggage _ ask Al Gore
about Clinton fatigue _ then strapped politics to a gurney and
turned it into an executive branch of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   As up-to-the-moment and with-it as the show is (Rob Lowe as a
prostitute-dating aide? hel-lo), there's something reassuringly
retro about ``West Wing.'' It's the closest thing we have now to
FDR's old fireside chats. Each week we're let into the White House
to view all the pettiness and meanness and self-interest we can
handle, yet we walk away feeling safely in the committed hands of
engaged, likable folks who deal with those givens and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Wing'' is a smart, savvy, sometimes even savage antidote
to our blaring talk-show cynicism; McCain's primary-season flare
only confirmed our private longing for this stuff. Martin Sheen, as
President Josiah Bartlet, should get more than a few write-in votes
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Less comfy, but no less effective, was ABC's ``Once and Again,''
the latest chronicle from those baby boom Boswells, Ed Zwick and
Marshall Herskovitz (``thirtysomething,'' ``My So-Called Life'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' was a hot boomer soap opera dressed up as
middle-class insight. It's genius was in admitting that they're the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward (as separated-with-kids Lily Manning) and Billy
Campbell (divorced-with-kids Rick Sammler) were the dimple-chinned
faces all divorced-with-kids fortysomethings wish they had _ or
were with. Slinking last season over to the WB's ``Felicity,'' for
some teasing sex after TV's youthquake briefly wiped them from the
screen, boomers found that Lily and Rick's teenlike gropings let
them throw off Noel and Ben and Julie and feel young again, on
their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say young? I meant dirty.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Zwick and Herskovitz were annoyingly dead-on;
the guilt, the panic, the exhaustion of divorced parents was
displayed in such keen-eyed, almost poetic detail, that it spoke to
the whole universe of adults whose lives haven't turned out quite
like they'd figured.
</P>
<P>
   Rick: ``I always had a map for my life. And now, it's like I
walked off it entirely. It's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddening as she could be, Ward's character was the season's
most evolved female _ older, divorced, kids, and still attractive
to attractive men. The fact that she really is a knockout was
beside the point _ Lily's glow came less from her gorgeous,
Sprint-spokeswoman hair than a kind of midlife incandescence. Lily
craved both intimacy and sex while lashed to a world of car pools
and visitation exchanges and dying parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was one slim rung further along the network evolutionary
ladder than Amy Brenneman, who created a winningly heartfelt role
as a harried juvenile court judge and single mom in CBS' ``Judging
Amy.'' And Ward was two rungs ahead of Kathleen Quinlan, who gave a
harder, more L.A. edge to her lawyering single mom in CBS' ``Family
Law.''
</P>
<P>
   All three were welcome leaps ahead of Sydney Hansen (Melina
Kanakaredes), the prodigal plastic surgeon returned home in
``Providence,'' last year's surprise chick hit on NBC. Dr. Syd was
a start _ she gave the networks permission to build dramas around
adult female leads. Still, the fear before this season was that all
women would be like her: TV smart but not one teaspoon more.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise: The smarts of this season's women weren't dumbed down.
And guess what? We fell for them. Hard.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   In its second season, HBO's ``The Sopranos'' went from cult
favorite to TV's most talked-about show. Much of the talk centered
on whether the second season lived up to the first; office workers
engaged in the kind of cross-cubicle debates not heard since the
last years of ``Seinfeld'' (yes, the sitcom is dead). Now we all
have an Uncle Junior; now we all pay off our debts in ``boxes of
ziti.''
</P>
<P>
   This season's ``Sopranos'' was a frequent stunner, bookended by
the arrival and departure (two gunshots to the chest) of dead-eyed
Richie Aprile (David Proval), who replaced Tony's mother Livia
(Nancy Marchand) as TV's most fearsome character.
</P>
<P>
   In between, ``The Sopranos'' sputtered and soared: the
near-death experience of Tony's nephew Christopher (Michael
Imperioli), during which he arrived at the gates of hell _ an Irish
bar where every day is St. Patrick's Day _ might have been the
series' most profoundly hilarious scene ever.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Sopranos,'' with the unmatchable James Gandolfini as
Tony, the mob boss we all would be, was never less than very good.
The honest artistry of it proved _ despite wailing over the demise
of ``Freaks and Geeks'' and ``Sports Night'' and ABC's two-episode
wonder ``Wonderland,'' each brilliant but fatally flawed _ that
there is no such thing as a show too good for TV. There's only too
much TV.
</P>
<P>
   And that's this season's big lesson. There might have been a lot
of awful game shows this year, but that only meant fewer awful
sitcoms and dramas. ``Millionaire'' and its brethren didn't push
out quality; they just shrunk the networks' sitcom-drama-newsmag
Bermuda Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, this season, was subtle. For instance, Mike Billok
of Silverdale, Wash., was asked one Sunday night in March, for
$250,000: What did Newton Minow call ``a vast wasteland'' in a
controversial 1961 speech?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: A) public schools, B) Congress, C) suburbia, D)
television.
</P>
<P>
   Billok didn't know. Didn't know! And so he walked away with
$125,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much fun this season was. Mike Billok couldn't even
remember that the vast wasteland is... D.
</P>
<P>
   Television.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. _ Henry Flagler came to Florida in 1883 to
build grand hotels in what was sparsely populated coastal scrub.
Using wealth amassed as one of Standard Oil Co.'s founders, he
began cobbling together a railroad down the length of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Flagler opened up Florida as he went, erecting posh resorts such
as the Palm Beach Inn, later called The Breakers, that would serve
as starting points for future cities. By 1896, he had built 350
miles of railroad track from Jacksonville to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Now Florida East Coast Industries, the holding company
controlling the Flagler railroad, is using the right of way to
establish itself in the new economy. Since last May, FECI's
subsidiary, Epik Communications, has been selling capacity to move
digital information through fiber-optic cables that run alongside
chugging train cars piled high with crushed stone, building
materials and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Like most railroads, Florida East Coast Railroad had been
collecting rent from giant telecoms that had buried cable beside
its tracks. But two years ago the company decided to jump directly
into the market for bandwidth capacity. Just shy of one year into
its venture selling transmission capacity to telephone companies,
wireless services and internet service providers, Epik's network
covers 80 percent of Florida's population and extends west to Texas
and north to Atlanta. The revenue backlog is $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it a great railroad franchise is what makes it a
terrific telecom franchise,'' says Robert Anestis, FECI's chairman,
president and chief operating officer, who came on board January
1999 to exploit the telecom potential. ``We're in the center of
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the little railroad leveraged the dirt along
its tracks to leap into fiber-optic communications provides a
glimpse into some of the swaps and barters used to create a glass
network for the streams of digital bits and bytes cycling around
the globe. It also suggests how some old economy transportation and
power companies may find prosperity in a cyber age.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad tracks make good paths for telecommunications cable
because they offer cleared, linear routes. In fact, special
railroad cars run along tracks plowing cable underground as they
move. The cost of assembling such paths for conduits from scratch
would be astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, energy and utility right of ways are used for
fiber optics. For instance, Williams Cos. created a whole new
venture by putting cables along its natural gas pipelines.
Consolidated Edison's infrastructure is being used for fiber-optic
lines into 2,000 buildings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Pacific Railroad is the textbook example of a railroad
creating telecoms, having spawned both Sprint and Qwest
Communications International.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest sweep of new entries along with FECI are Norfolk
Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. ``The pickings have been so good, a
lot of people have been getting into this industry,'' says Tim
Caffrey, who follows telecommunications for Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida East Coast Industries is small, it is beginning to
attract attention. Since January 1999, its stock has gone from $27
a share to over $46; its market capitalization has risen from $800
million to just under $1.8 billion. In mid-April an investment
group including the Texas billionaire Robert Bass acquired a 5
percent stake in the holding company, based in St. Augustine, Fla.,
with its railroad, trucking, real estate and now telecommunications
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the nascent stages, but the company is beginning to
make a major play in the telecom industry,'' says Andrew Hamerling,
an analyst at BancAmerica Securities.
</P>
<P>
   FECI was a fairly inert company until Anestis began to kick
start the assets that Flagler had put into place 100 years earlier.
FECI and the St. Joe Co., which held a 54 percent stake in FECI
until recently, had lagged under the control of the conservative
Alfred I. DuPont Testamentary Trust. But in the early 1990s,
investors pressured St. Joe to start exploiting its assets for
better shareholder returns. It shed operations such as a paper
mill, telephone company and bank to focus on its one million acres
of real estate in Florida's panhandle for resort development.
</P>
<P>
   When St. Joe took a look at its 53.8 percent stake in FECI, it
decided that it should put the company up for sale. But Anestis,
then a consultant to Peter S. Rummel, St. Joe's chairman, convinced
him that there was better way to capture the value of the
telecommunications potential. ``I told him it's much better to jump
into this thing proactively,'' Anestis recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Anestis had been eyeing the company's telecommunications right
of way for some time. In the early 1980s AT&AMP;T, MCI, WorldCom and
other big telecom players installed fiber optic cables along
Florida East Coast Railroad lines to reach the state's growing
cities. These leases were a no cost stream of passive revenue. The
next big cable construction wave followed the 1996
telecommunications act. During this second buildup, FECI decided to
get a piece of the digital action.
</P>
<P>
   Anestis started as a mergers and acquisitions lawyer in
Pittsburgh, then headed a railroad holding company, Guilford
Transportation Industries, that a client had created. In 1984, AT&AMP;T
leased right of way from Guilford on an unused line in the White
Mountains to add capacity to its Boston to Montreal fiber link. The
old line, with small trees growing in the tracks, showed Anestis
how valuable the linear paths could be. Anestis left Guilford and
started an investment advisory firm, still consulting with
railroads and negotiating right of way leases with
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Qwest wanted to bury cable on Florida East Coast
Railroad routes, Anestis negotiated on behalf of the railroad and
got Qwest to build for FECI three conduits as part of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The next year when Williams was anxious to add Florida capacity
along the FECI right of way, Anestis brokered a deal for 36 strands
of dark fiber from Williams. Dark fiber is unactivated cable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being just a passive landlord, FECI now had telecom
assets, but it didn't know how to deploy them. ``We were pretty
good horse traders, but we really didn't know what to do with
this,'' Anestis said. Soon after these deals, he was made head of
FECI.
</P>
<P>
   Anestis hired strategic consultants at the Cambridge-based
Monitor Co. to determine whether three empty conduits and 36
strands were enough to jump-start a new telecom company. Each
1.25-inch conduit can hold 216 fiber optic strands. Two strands of
activated cable can transmit 129,000 simultaneous telephone calls.
New technology is expected to increase that number 100 fold.
</P>
<P>
   John McClellan, Monitor's head of telecommunications, concluded
that the venture could work. Florida's economy was expected to grow
37 percent faster than the rest of the country over the next 10
years. The company's rights-of-way, conduits and fiber amounted to
a base to reach the majority of the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FECI also had enough capital to invest nearly $100 million in
cash to get the initial parts of the business up and running.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the consultation, McClellan decided to leave his
16-year career at Monitor to head FECI's new venture. Now,
McClellan splits his time between his Groton, Mass., home and
Epik's headquarters in Orlando. He took a two-thirds pay cut,
spurred by the prospect of stock options. Anestis said Epik could
go public in as few as six months, but acknowledged that market
volatility could extend that timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I entered into this knowing we're in this a while trying to
build a business,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Under McClellan, Epik has extended its reach beyond Florida in
fiber and conduit swaps with Enron Broadband Services and Broadwing
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're becoming experts in swaps and barter,'' Anestis said.
Trade-outs allow quick geographic links without time-consuming
installation. Fiber optic companies build excess capacity so they
can use it as capital in future trades.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FECI and Epik officials are huddling over aerial
photos of the 18,000 Florida acres that Flagler accumulated and
that remain under FECI control.
</P>
<P>
   Gran Central, a real estate subsidiary, has built a portfolio of
high-end office complexes and industrial buildings. Now, FECI is
eyeing the land for Telecom Hotels, high-rises designed to house
equipment needed to keep data flowing smoothly. The company is also
considering constructing office buildings pre-wired for the latest
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Many railroad industry executives are looking for new
opportunities. Last year, Norfolk Southern created a subsidiary,
Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, or T-Cubed, to take
part in the telecom industry. The railroad plans to lay conduit and
use its microwave towers to sell bandwidth capacity to carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In March, CSX signed an agreement with Pathnet Inc., a Reston,
Va.-based wholesaler of bandwidth, to provide railroad right of way
in exchange for equity in Pathnet. Burlington Northern Santa Fe and
Colonial Pipeline also signed right of way for equity deals with
Pathnet.
</P>
<P>
   With all these new players, Caffrey at Standard &AMP; Poor's and
other industry watchers say a glut of fiber capacity may be on the
horizon. Anestis is not flustered by the prospect. ``We assumed
that this supply would cause prices to fall,'' he said. ``Even so,
with the slope of growth there's a great business here.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli government, facing a coming troop
withdrawal from southern Lebanon for which it needs international
backing, decided Friday not to continue reprisal bombings in
Lebanon even though another cross-border guerrilla offensive took
place Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to interrupt the volley of retaliatory attacks and
defuse the exploding violence, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his
security Cabinet decided they would not respond militarily to a
second day of Katyusha rocket fire on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel has no interest in escalation,'' a senior Israeli
official said. ``It was the appropriate moment to take a giant step
backward.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was seriously hurt Friday by the barrage from the
Hezbollah, or Party of God, on northern towns. But the rocket
attacks, quickly following an assault on Thursday that killed an
Israeli soldier and wounded civilians, reinforced the residents'
apprehensions that they were entering a volatile period. They fear
that the period leading up to the troop withdrawal, less than two
months away, will be violent and that the aftermath will be
violent, too.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has maintained that Israel's 22-year occupation of
southern Lebanon sustains the struggle, and that once Israel
withdraws, the rationale for guerrilla attacks will fade. With U.N.
troops in southern Lebanon and international monitoring in place,
there is unlikely to be an all-out battle on the border, he says,
even though it would have been safer to pull out as part of peace
agreements with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Having acted on public sentiment that Israel should end its
involvement in Lebanon, Barak now expresses occasional impatience
with those who are getting cold feet that he is following through
on the most galvanizing campaign promise he made last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that this sweeping public discussion and internal
dialogue about withdrawing from Lebanon didn't take place before we
went into Lebanon,'' he said in an interview published Friday in
the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did validate the concerns of Israel's northernmost
residents _ if somewhat offhandedly. ``There are no added dangers''
to the north after a troop withdrawal, he said, ``apart from direct
gunfire at the houses that sit right on the border.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that those dozens of homes in 17 communities facing
the frontier will be exposed to a higher risk,'' he continued,
``but the entire idea of the withdrawal is to reduce the friction,
because this greatly reduces the legitimization of operations
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest escalation of violence, Hezbollah said Israel had
started it. Israel and the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army
caused civilian deaths and injuries on Wednesday and Thursday in
bombing and shooting attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Israeli army officials characterized those attacks as
accidents, compared with the guerrilla response, which they said
was deliberate and murderous.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between mistakes and intended fire into
the center of a populated city,'' said Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hezbollah attacks Friday morning, the Israeli security
Cabinet sequestered itself in a Tel Aviv meeting room for the
second time in less than 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the ministers emerged shortly before midnight to
order a limited bombardment. Israeli warplanes struck two Lebanese
power stations, a suspected guerrilla ammunition depot and the
Beirut-Damascus highway.
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming their targets to be carefully chosen and their fire
to be efficient, Israeli army generals noted Friday that only one
civilian was injured. They also said that they had not considered
striking Syrian targets, and that they did not think that Syria
encouraged or instructed guerrillas to attack but rather failed to
prevent their fire.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Barak has said that he is not optimistic that talks with
Syria will resume before the withdrawal, ``the door is always still
open,'' he said. European and Arab diplomats say they still think
it is possible that peace negotiations will resume.
</P>
<P>
   Plans, however, are being made for a unilateral withdrawal from
southern Lebanon, under a 22-year-old U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In order to carry out the withdrawal, Israel will need the
support of the United Nations on the ground as well as in
maintaining peace once Israeli troops leave. Barak also does not
want to alienate countries with continued bombings, or military
operations outside the zone of conflict, because he hopes to build
up diplomatic support in case the withdrawal goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the U.S. government urged Israel and Hezbollah to
restrain themselves and expressed disapproval of both sides'
attacks on civilians and civilian targets. ``There is no place for
such attack,'' a State Department official said. ``We are deeply
troubled by the recent escalation of violence, and we deeply regret
the loss of life, injury and damage to infrastructure on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and his government faced some pressure from the right-wing
opposition to bomb again and more intensely. But the opposition is
not strong.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, who led Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and
now heads the opposition Likud Party, said just one air-strike was
insufficient to signal Israel's intention to withdraw and stand up
for itself at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot change the situation with one lone action,'' Sharon
said. ``We must carry out a thorough, systematic and continuous
policy to hit both Syrian and Lebanese interests in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah rocket attacks Friday on Kiryat Shemona and the
small, poor town of Slomi proved to be less accurate than those on
Thursday, which may indicate that they moved their launchers under
pressure, military experts said. Still, they hit four homes, two
supermarkets, a youth hostel and more than a dozen cars. And since
they fired on the northern and eastern Galilee at the same time,
the hiss of the rockets and the sight and smell of the black smoke
made residents feel that they were in a war.
</P>
<P>
   Many fled south to relatives' homes. Others huddled in bomb
shelters, where they were visited by Barak on Thursday night. He
cautioned them to prepare for a long stay underground.
</P>
<P>
   But by nighttime, with all quiet, military officials told them
they could return to their homes for the Sabbath.

 &HT;    Both Democrats and Republicans are reaching beyond evangelical
Protestants in hopes of capturing one of the key groups needed to
win elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the pundits were pondering whether religion would play much
of a role in this year's presidential election, most forgot to ask
a pretty fundamental question: Which religion?
</P>
<P>
   Protestant conservatives have played the most vocal role in the
presidential politics of the past 20 years. They have been in the
news this year as well, in the controversy over Gov. George W.
Bush's speech at Bob Jones University and Sen. John McCain's
denunciation of Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   As Ronald Reagan and his father had before him, Bush used an
invitation to speak at the fundamentalist Protestant school outside
Greenville, S.C., to appeal to religious conservatives before the
South Carolina primary, which the Texas governor had to win to
restore faith in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But as the controversy over the speech ultimately proved, Roman
Catholic voters are at center stage this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although it had received more attention before the speech, the
university's policy banning interracial dating did not become as
controversial after Bush's speech as the anti-Catholic preachings
on the school's Web site. Bush's success in the South Carolina
primary, where Protestant conservatives swung heavily in his favor,
was contrasted with his loss to McCain a few days later in
Michigan, where McCain's campaign had targeted Catholic voters with
phone calls about the Bob Jones issue.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain upped the ante, attacking Robertson and Falwell by
name in a speech at Virginia Beach, the home of the Christian
Coalition, his appeal fell flat with most Republican voters. But
Bush was sufficiently alarmed to write Cardinal John O'Connor, the
archbishop of New York, who died this week, a letter regretting not
having taken a stronger stand in his speech at Bob Jones
University. It was final confirmation that Catholic voters will not
be ignored this year.
</P>
<P>
   In large part this year's focus on Catholic voters is a matter
of perception catching up with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the African-American evangelical vote is the base vote of
the Democratic Party and the white evangelical vote is the base
vote of the Republican Party, then Catholic voters are the jump
ball of American politics. They have been the swing vote in every
presidential election since the 1960s,'' said Republican consultant
Ralph Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic voters were at one time a dependable part of the
Democratic majority, but abortion, crime and school busing caused
many to defect to Richard Nixon and later to Ronald Reagan. In the
past decade they have helped elect Bill Clinton _ as well as
several Republican _ and Catholic _ governors, such as John Engler
of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   That point has been brought more sharply to mind this year
because of the importance of Catholic voters in the big
Northeastern and Midwestern states, which are expected to be the
hottest battleground of the presidential election, as well as in
several key Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   Deal Hudson, editor of Crisis, a conservative Catholic magazine,
and an informal adviser to the Bush campaign, said changing
attitudes among American Catholics are also affecting the political
climate. After an era of trying to ``assimilate'' into the larger
American community, he said, Catholics have grown tired of being
ignored and ``want to be recognized as Catholic Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican nervousness over the Bob Jones controversy heightened
when House Speaker Dennis Hastert passed over a committee's
preference for a Catholic priest, the Rev. Timothy O'Brien, to
appoint the Rev. Charles Wright, former senior pastor of the North
Avenue Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, to the post of House
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Wright withdrew his name in March and Hastert appointed another
Catholic, the Rev. Daniel Coughlin of Chicago, to be the first of
his religion to hold the honorary post.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two controversies, ``Republicans were in deep danger
of totally blowing the Catholic vote,'' said Clyde Wilcox, a
professor of government at Georgetown University in Washington.
While the damage could be repaired, he said, Bush will need to send
some ``strong positive signals'' to Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the nation's largest religious denomination,
representing a great racial and national diversity, does not vote
in lock step. Polling indicates there is now about an even
Democratic-Republican split, with 40 percent of Catholics in the
swing voter category.
</P>
<P>
   While Al Gore has no competition for liberal Catholic votes,
Bush may also be competing for conservative Catholic votes with a
conservative Catholic, Pat Buchanan, if Buchanan becomes the Reform
Party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest irony of all was that Bush was the only candidate
with an explicit Catholic strategy,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy, he said, was based on an understanding of the
growing role of the Catholic Church in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Eye on running mates
</P>
<P>
   One issue in which sensitivity to the Catholic vote could show
up is the selection of vice presidential nominees. Republican Gov.
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Democratic HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo
are among Catholics on the parties' short lists of potential
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee chairman, Jim Nicholson, is
Catholic, and Catholics make up a higher percentage of the party's
governors and members of Congress than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Protestant-Catholic tensions exposed by the Bob Jones
incident, Reed, the former executive director of the Christian
Coalition, argued there's ``probably a greater cooperation and
communication between evangelicals and Catholics than at any time
since they respectively became engaged in civic affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed sees Catholic social teachings that ``the institutions
closest to those in need are best able to help them'' fitting
closely with Bush's ideas about replacing government programs with
private and religious efforts. But Wilcox said Catholics tend to be
more ``communitarian'' in outlook. ``It doesn't have to be
government that helps. But it can be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, a former Baptist minister who became a Catholic while
living in Atlanta, said that while evangelicals and Catholics often
take the same side on issues, they respond differently to political
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   `Can't get preachy'
</P>
<P>
   ``With evangelicals you can preach the message, and they will
hear and support you,'' the editor said. ``Catholics want calmness
and warmth, an inclusive message and a positive message. You can't
get preachy with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In counterpoint to this political season's focus on Catholic
voters and issues was the recent news that Robertson, who gave up
his ordination as a Southern Baptist minister to run for president
in 1988, has again taken the ministerial vows, this time before an
``ordination council'' of advisers from several denominations.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree the curve of Robertson's career follows that of
the evolution of the religious right. The Christian Coalition is
only a shadow of what it has
</P>
<P>
   been in previous elections, but the influence of the religious
right was clear during the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer a need for religious conservatives to charge
the bastions of the Republican Party, Reed said, because they have
largely found their place there.

 &HT;    AROUND THE WORLD: COMPANIES, GOVERNMENTS FIGHTING OFF THE 'LOVE
BUG'
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By ALEC SCHULTZ 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With monikers like ``Joke'' and ``Mother's Day,'' copycat
variants of the ``Love Bug'' virus threatened to infect computers
around the world on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But follow-up reports from governments and corporations from
Hong Kong to Berlin to Rio de Janeiro, working feverishly to clean
up the mess left by Thursday's widespread electronic invasion,
indicated that the new strains lack the virulence of the original.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, by noon, there were no new reports of chaos caused by
the virus. Multinational corporations in Moscow, complained
primarily of some email difficulties. Spokesmen for a British law
firm and U.S. consumer foods company operating in Russia said their
email systems were down as per instructions from their home
offices, but that business experienced few interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the bug in Asia was possibly muted by the fact
that markets in four countries _ Japan, South Korea, China and
Thailand were closed for public holidays on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That followed a day in which the world's fastest-spreading bug,
spawned possibly from two
</P>
<P>
   Philippine e-mail addresses, hit companies in Taiwan and Hong
Kong Thursday afternoon as the other half of the world was
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, broker Nomura International's office was hit, as
were the South China Morning Post, Dow Jones Newswires and the
Asian Wall Street Journal. The bug affected only e-mail and did not
prevent Dow Jones Newswires from distributing financial information
to traders. The
</P>
<P>
   Asian Wall Street Journal would have no problems publishing,
officials there said.
</P>
<P>
   About 385,000 computer files were affected by the virus in
Europe, and 19,000 were hit in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The virus forced the British House of Commons shut down its
email network to prevent the spread of the bug. In Copenhagen,
Danish lawmakers were flooded with emails containing the vius.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the ``love bug'' struck several government offices
and banks, with many forced to block access to email servers. In
Italy, officials at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization said
computer systems at the Rome-based group's headquarters were
paralyzed when an employee inadvertently opened a ``LOVE'' email
message.
</P>
<P>
   A banking network in Belgium was suspended and wide disruptions
were also reported in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, England and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, several key German government institutions were hit
by the ``Love'' email computer virus and on Friday were forced to
shut down their email systems until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those affected were the foreign ministry, the interior
ministry and the finance ministry, German officials said. The virus
was prevented from getting into the German chancellery, law
enforcement agency, and defense ministry because of a computer
security system.
</P>
<P>
   A German government task force will assemble to discuss ways to
prevent a repeat, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates suggested that between 10 percent and 30 percent of
British businesses were hit. Among the firms and organizations
affected in the UK were media companies including News
International _ publishers of the Times of London and the tabloid
Sun _ the BBC, and a number of major companies.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement to the Commons Thursday, Margaret Beckett,
leader of the House, said the parliamentary email system had
crashed. ``I have to tell you that, sadly, this affectionate
greeting contains a virus which has immobilized the house's
internal communication system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the UK arm of Reed International, a publisher of trade
magazines, IT engineers alerted staff after the bug had already
crippled their computer system. ``It completely wipes out your
network,'' said Sarah Perkins of PC Pro magazine. ``Ours is down
and we're going to lose a day's business.''
</P>
<P>
   After it was suggested that the virus may have come from
Lithuania, officials in the former Soviet satellite said they would
launch an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One variant of the virus, called ``Susitikim'' (Lithuanian for
``let's meet'') has a subject line that reads ``Susitikim shi
vakara kavos puodukui.'' In Lithuanian, this means: ``Let's meet
this evening for coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Latin America, which appeared to avoid Thursday's havoc,
seemed to escape the variant strains of the virus on Friday as
well.
</P>
<P>
   For example. preliminary estimates put the number of computer
systems affected in the region at about 22,000, a number
significantly less than Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The region escaped largely unscathed due to a smaller amount of
computer infrastructure in many countries. But several of the
region's technologically advanced countries did experience
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the virus transmitted by e-mail affected a gamut of
victims from the Globo.com
</P>
<P>
   portal to the Agencia Nacional de Telecomunicacoes (Anatel).
Computer technicians in the country are working to salvage
information from the affected computers.
</P>
<P>
   In Costa Rica, although the virus appeared in many email
accounts of various businesses, only the Institute for the
Protection of Biodiversity and Microsoft of Costa Rica were
affected. For both companies, the damage to computer systems was
said to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   That remained a familiar refrain on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, one of the world's hottest high-tech corridors, the
virus reportedly tied up internal email systems at some of the
country's largest hi-tech companies _ including Comverse Network
Systems Ltd., which makes telephone messaging systems, and one of
Israel's cellular telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   But little, if any, damage was reported overall and there was
scant evidence of Friday's variant strains worming their way into
more systems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most news reports focused on the international breadth
of the virus. One newspaper, Yedioth Aharonot, covered the ``I Love
You'' virus under the headline, ``Fatal Love.''

enigmatic political moves of the presidential campaign, Arizona
Sen. John McCain now says he will attend the summit with Texas Gov.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Returning to China five years after moving away, I was
stunned by the new sights in Beijing: fashionably-dressed young men
and women sipping mochas at Starbucks, and mulling over living room
furniture and bathroom fixtures at Ikea.
</P>
<P>
   New sidewalk billboards had sprung up everywhere, with just
about every one taken up by advertisements for Chinese dot-com
companies. Massive new office buildings, indoor malls and luxury
apartment buildings dominate much of the urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing had become a far more international and modern city in
just a few years. Whereas culinary variety used to mean choosing
from Cantonese, Sichuanese or Hunanese, now options for eating out
include Italian, Brazilian, Lebanese and more. When a friend
recently said, ``I don't want Chinese for dinner, I had it for
lunch,'' it didn't sound ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Even government agencies have entered the digital era. The
Public Security Bureau, which issues visas and keeps an eye on
foreign journalists, has fancy new computers, as does every clerk
at the post office. But when a postal worker reached for her abacus
to add up my postage, it hit me _ some very fundamental things
haven't changed at all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a lot of things: it still takes one month to get a
phone line installed; the English-language China Daily is as boring
as ever; purchasing anything at a department store still involves a
convoluted routine with glue, red rubber stamps and several layers
of carbon paper; and connections are still the key to getting
things done. Just about every aspect of life here _ from getting
into a good school and finding a good job to getting bureaucratic
problems resolved _ will go smoother if you've got good guanxi, or
connections.
</P>
<P>
   I lived in Beijing for three and half years in the early 1990s
and had made only two brief visits back since 1995. After getting
over the shock of the new Beijing my first few days, the hassles of
the old Beijing quickly came to haunt me.
</P>
<P>
   While China may have invented gunpowder and noodles, bureaucracy
may be one of its lesser-appreciated contributions to the world. To
live and work in China and get my shipment through customs required
the following documents:
</P>
<P>
   1. Housing contract in a foreign journalist-approved housing
unit;
</P>
<P>
   2 . Certificate of health, including HIV and syphilis screening,
from a local hospital;
</P>
<P>
   3. Journalist's work card, from the Foreign Ministry;
</P>
<P>
   4. Journalist visa, from the Public Security Bureau;
</P>
<P>
   5. Residence permit, from the Public Security Bureau;
</P>
<P>
   6. News organization permit, from the Foreign Ministry;
</P>
<P>
   7. And customs certificate, from Customs;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these couldn't be obtained in just any order. No,
there was a strict sequence. To get my shipment, I needed numbers
4, 5 and 7. To get numbers 4 and 5, I needed numbers 1, 2 and 3 and
a one-week wait. To get number 7, I needed numbers 3, 5 and 6. To
get number 6, I had to pay more than $100 for a two-line notice in
the Beijing Daily announcing Cox Newspapers' presence. Many of
these documents required photos _ some had to be 1-inch, some
2-inch.
</P>
<P>
   And none of this could've been done without the Cox Newspapers
chop, which thankfully, my predecessors left for me. Like most
chops, ours is nothing more than a simple rubber stamp with our
name, but every organization in China _ governmental or private _
has one, and nothing is official without it.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than the bureaucracy, though, is the almost feudal mindset
of some officials. While the Foreign Ministry is making efforts to
be more accessible to foreign journalists, other government
agencies seem stuck in the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call to a Beijing municipal department with a simple
question is met with: ``It's not my duty to provide that
information.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Internet is flooding the country with as much
information as its citizens care to access, Customs thinks it can
seal China's borders and keep out dangerous foreign influences.
</P>
<P>
   Because I am a journalist, it insisted on inspecting my shipment
of personal belongings. When I was notified of the upcoming
inspection, a Chinese friend assured me they were looking only for
drugs, pornography and the like, and they wouldn't be so backwards
as to confiscate books and video-tapes as they did in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   But indeed, the Customs official found seven books he decided
could not be allowed in the country. His book choice was _ I hate
to say it _ inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   Books I would have thought objectionable _ such as those by
Harry Wu, a longtime China critic and former political prisoner,
and Falun Gong, the banned sect _ made it through. The official
also gave a pass to ``The Road to Democracy'' by Lee Teng-hui, the
outgoing president of Taiwan so reviled by China, while objecting
to two innocuous Taiwanese governmental publications about politics
and economy.
</P>
<P>
   Most unfathomable, though, was their choice of four titles that
can be ordered off Amazon.com and shipped to China attracting
little notice from authorities. In fact, ``In the Red: On
Contemporary Chinese Culture'' by Australian scholar Geremie Barme
tops Amazon.com's list of books that are unusually popular in
China. A second book, ``The Search for Modern China'' by Yale
University's Jonathan Spence, one of the most widely-read China
scholars in the world, is No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Only one selection made sense in the Chinese Communist Party
context: an autographed anthology of essays by Wei Jingsheng,
China's most well-known dissident, forced into exile in 1997. Even
his book, though, is available on Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation was ever given for the confiscations. I was told
only that the books were not allowed under China's regulations. No
further elucidation was provided for that term, and intervention by
the Foreign Ministry was fruitless. I looked for a logic behind the
book choice, but the word ``logic'' doesn't even exist in the
Chinese language. Instead, a transliteration from the English,
``luo ji,'' is used.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the answer lays in Spence's book, but alas, I shall have
to wait for my Amazon delivery before I can find out.

 &HT;    AROUND THE WORLD: COMPANIES, GOVERNMENTS FIGHTING OFF THE 'LOVE
BUG'
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By ALEC SCHULTZ 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With monikers like ``Joke'' and ``Mother's Day,'' copycat
variants of the ``Love Bug'' virus threatened to infect computers
around the world on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But follow-up reports from governments and corporations from
Hong Kong to Berlin to Rio de Janeiro, working feverishly to clean
up the mess left by Thursday's widespread electronic invasion,
indicated that the new strains lack the virulence of the original.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, by noon, there were no new reports of chaos caused by
the virus. Multinational corporations in Moscow, complained
primarily of some email difficulties. Spokesmen for a British law
firm and U.S. consumer foods company operating in Russia said their
email systems were down as per instructions from their home
offices, but that business experienced few interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the bug in Asia was possibly muted by the fact
that markets in four countries _ Japan, South Korea, China and
Thailand were closed for public holidays on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That followed a day in which the world's fastest-spreading bug,
spawned possibly from two
</P>
<P>
   Philippine e-mail addresses, hit companies in Taiwan and Hong
Kong Thursday afternoon as the other half of the world was
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, broker Nomura International's office was hit, as
were the South China Morning Post, Dow Jones Newswires and the
Asian Wall Street Journal. The bug affected only e-mail and did not
prevent Dow Jones Newswires from distributing financial information
to traders. The
</P>
<P>
   Asian Wall Street Journal would have no problems publishing,
officials there said.
</P>
<P>
   About 385,000 computer files were affected by the virus in
Europe, and 19,000 were hit in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The virus forced the British House of Commons shut down its
email network to prevent the spread of the bug. In Copenhagen,
Danish lawmakers were flooded with emails containing the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the ``love bug'' struck several government offices
and banks, with many forced to block access to email servers. In
Italy, officials at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization said
computer systems at the Rome-based group's headquarters were
paralyzed when an employee inadvertently opened a ``LOVE'' email
message.
</P>
<P>
   A banking network in Belgium was suspended and wide disruptions
were also reported in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, England and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, several key German government institutions were hit
by the ``Love'' email computer virus and on Friday were forced to
shut down their email systems until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those affected were the foreign ministry, the interior
ministry and the finance ministry, German officials said. The virus
was prevented from getting into the German chancellery, law
enforcement agency, and defense ministry because of a computer
security system.
</P>
<P>
   A German government task force will assemble to discuss ways to
prevent a repeat, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates suggested that between 10 percent and 30 percent of
British businesses were hit. Among the firms and organizations
affected in the UK were media companies including News
International _ publishers of the Times of London and the tabloid
Sun _ the BBC, and a number of major companies.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement to the Commons Thursday, Margaret Beckett,
leader of the House, said the parliamentary email system had
crashed. ``I have to tell you that, sadly, this affectionate
greeting contains a virus which has immobilized the house's
internal communication system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the UK arm of Reed International, a publisher of trade
magazines, IT engineers alerted staff after the bug had already
crippled their computer system. ``It completely wipes out your
network,'' said Sarah Perkins of PC Pro magazine. ``Ours is down
and we're going to lose a day's business.''
</P>
<P>
   After it was suggested that the virus may have come from
Lithuania, officials in the former Soviet satellite said they would
launch an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One variant of the virus, called ``Susitikim'' (Lithuanian for
``let's meet'') has a subject line that reads ``Susitikim shi
vakara kavos puodukui.'' In Lithuanian, this means: ``Let's meet
this evening for coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Latin America, which appeared to avoid Thursday's havoc,
seemed to escape the variant strains of the virus on Friday as
well.
</P>
<P>
   For example. preliminary estimates put the number of computer
systems affected in the region at about 22,000, a number
significantly less than Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The region escaped largely unscathed due to a smaller amount of
computer infrastructure in many countries. But several of the
region's technologically advanced countries did experience
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the virus transmitted by e-mail affected a gamut of
victims from the Globo.com
</P>
<P>
   portal to the Agencia Nacional de Telecomunicacoes (Anatel).
Computer technicians in the country are working to salvage
information from the affected computers.
</P>
<P>
   In Costa Rica, although the virus appeared in many email
accounts of various businesses, only the Institute for the
Protection of Biodiversity and Microsoft of Costa Rica were
affected. For both companies, the damage to computer systems was
said to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   That remained a familiar refrain on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, one of the world's hottest high-tech corridors, the
virus reportedly tied up internal email systems at some of the
country's largest hi-tech companies _ including Comverse Network
Systems Ltd., which makes telephone messaging systems, and one of
Israel's cellular telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   But little, if any, damage was reported overall and there was
scant evidence of Friday's variant strains worming their way into
more systems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most news reports focused on the international breadth
of the virus. One newspaper, Yedioth Aharonot, covered the ``I Love
You'' virus under the headline, ``Fatal Love.''

TALKS RESUME BETWEEN WPP GROUP, YOUNG AND RUBICAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The on-again, off-again merger talks between WPP Group
of Britain and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. are on again. A week after
negotiations between the two advertising companies broke down, WPP
said Friday that it had returned to the bargaining table in hopes
of reviving a takeover of Y&AMP;R, which is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Young &AMP; Rubicam continues to be courted by
Publicis SA, the French advertising company. According to
executives close to the talks, the chief executive of Y&AMP;R, Thomas
D. Bell Jr., is negotiating with both companies again, seeking to
take advantage of each company's ambition to add Y&AMP;R to its
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bell has two suitors for Y&AMP;R, he may be able to
instigate a bidding war between them.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between WPP and Y&AMP;R, which has already been derailed
twice, would create the world's largest advertising company in
billings and revenue and would be the richest agency-company
takeover in history. WPP, which owns Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, J.
Walter Thompson and the public relations agency Hill &AMP; Knowlton, is
keen to take control of Y&AMP;R to add even more mass and scale to its
ever-growing operations as the industry continues to consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R is one of the last few big independent agency companies,
which makes it particularly attractive to Sir Martin Sorrell, the
acquisitive, ambitious chief executive at WPP.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the talks ended, both sides wagged their fingers
at the other in a public scuffle with conflicting versions of who
was at fault. Executives from WPP accused Y&AMP;R executives of
changing the terms of the deal at the 11th hour, contending that
the lawyer representing Y&AMP;R wrote new details into the merger
document by hand. Y&AMP;R executives, for their part, asserted that WPP
made oral and written assurances that were then not included in the
document.
</P>
<P>
   The debate centered on Sorrell's plan to discourage Y&AMP;R's top
executives from leaving the combined agency company by instituting
a noncompete provision that would have effectively kept departing
employees from working in the industry for a year. Y&AMP;R managers
considered the provision too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   There were also disagreements over severance packages,
contractual matters and to what extent WPP could make changes to
Y&AMP;R operations in the first year after the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But on the most important issue, price, both sides had different
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at WPP said they believed Y&AMP;R had agreed that its
British suitor would pay about $5 billion. Executives at Y&AMP;R said
no deal had been struck on the price of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what changed to bring WPP back to the bargaining
table, but executives close to the talks said both agency companies
might be willing to make more concessions. Sorrell, the executives
say, wants desperately to agree to a friendly deal with Y&AMP;R, though
they portrayed him as not averse to a hostile bid. Indeed, it was
through a hostile takeover of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather that Sorrell turned
WPP into what is now the world's third-largest agency company.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's interest in a deal with WPP has also been reignited,
though executives close to the talks said Bell and Sorrell still
had disdain for each other.
</P>
<P>
   A tie-up between WPP and Y&AMP;R is more compelling than a deal with
Publicis, an executive close to Y&AMP;R said, because both WPP and Y&AMP;R
serve some of the same clients _ like Ford, Kraft, Mattel and Sears
_ and do not have major client conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Y&AMP;R and Publicis could have a major client
conflict because Y&AMP;R works for Ford Motor and Publicis works for
General Motors (through an American agency, Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney in
San Francisco) and for Renault.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Young &AMP; Rubicam rose
$4.50, or 9 percent, to $54.125. American depository receipts of
WPP _ with each ADR representing five shares of the British company
_ fell $5.50, or 6.8 percent, to $75.50. Publicis shares fell 18
euros, or 3.3 percent, to 534 euros on the Paris bourse.

INVESTING WITH: JOHN MONTGOMERY OF BRIDGWAY ULTRA-SMALL COMPANY
PORTFOLIO

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday mornings, John Montgomery plays the flute with a
folk-rock group at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Houston. On
Tuesday evenings, he rehearses for three hours with the group's
vocalists and other musicians. ``We could really use a drummer,''
he complains.
</P>
<P>
   A former research engineer at MIT, Montgomery, who is 44, sees
his music as complementary to the computer-based calculations he
uses to pick stocks for the $42 million Bridgeway Ultra-Small
Company Portfolio. ``Math is the underlying language of music,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ultra-Small fund has turned in some sweet results, returning
23.3 percent a year, annualized, for the three years through April
30, versus 8.2 percent for its peers in the small value category,
according to Morningstar Inc., and 15.2 percent for the Russell
2000 index of small-capitalization stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery came to money management by an unlikely route. In
1985, he joined the Houston transit system as a senior budget
analyst and during his off-hours developed computer models to
manage his investments. He said that in 1990 and 1991, his last
years there, his investment earnings far exceeded his modest
salary. In 1993, he started Bridgeway Capital Management, which now
manages a total of $135 million in four actively managed funds, two
index funds and a dozen private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery's background in budgeting leads him to run his firm
economically. The firm does not advertise, for example. And because
Montgomery does not allow personal trading by his firm's seven
employees, Bridgeway has no need for a compliance officer to
monitor their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by negotiating with brokerage firms, he has trimmed
the average commission the fund pays to just a penny a share. The
average such expense is 6 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of successful small-cap stock funds generally face a
problem: their funds are flooded with cash, forcing them to buy
bigger stocks. In Montgomery's view, a small-cap fund is easily
managed as long as its total assets do not exceed the average
market capitalization of the stocks it owns. So he closed the fund
to new investors in June 1998, when assets reached $27.5 million;
he plans to shut it to all new investments, including those by
existing shareholders, when assets hit $55 million, the fund's
current average market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   That market cap is still far smaller than that of the typical
small-cap fund. Montgomery focuses his search for stocks on the
smallest 10 percent of issues on the New York Stock Exchange, but
also picks from among 2,000 very small stocks in an index created
by the Center for Research in Securities Prices, which tracks the
smallest stocks traded on the Big Board, the American Stock
Exchange and the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing stocks, Montgomery never visits companies or meets
with their management. Instead, he uses five proprietary computer
models, the details of which he is loathe to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   He does say, however, that four of the models review fundamental
data like per-share earnings growth and cash flow; the fifth
analyzes technical factors like trading volume and relative price
appreciation. Each model is used to pick a list of 10 stocks; the
names sometimes overlap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a black box shop,'' he said in a slight Texas drawl.
``We put the data in and the computer cranks it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio is filled with cheap stocks: its typical
price-to-earnings ratio is in the low to mid-teens, though its
three-year earnings growth rate averages 36 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery runs the technical model monthly. Three of the
fundamental screens highlight value-oriented stocks and are run
weekly. The fourth, which looks for attractive growth stocks, is
run daily.
</P>
<P>
   The fund owns about 160 stocks, giving it a degree of
diversification that dampens the inherent risks of investing in the
smallest stocks, he said. Typically, he sells stocks when they no
longer meet his models' criteria, or when the models produce better
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stocks he likes is Team America, a Worthington, Ohio,
company that provides payroll, retirement plan management and other
human resources services to business. Its per-share earnings, cash
flow and sales have been strong, he said, but the company's share
price is ``dirt cheap,'' in part because of an acquisition-related
charge taken last year.
</P>
<P>
   As the company moves forward, Montgomery said, the share price
could double in the next 12 months. He bought shares in May 1999 at
$4.78; they closed at $4.50 on Friday, 16 times his 2000 earnings
estimate of 28 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is the Howell Corp., an integrated oil and gas
company in Houston. ``Oil prices are way up, and its stock price is
dead in the water,'' he said. But because its cash flow was $3 a
share last year, he said, ``you could earn your price back with
cash flow alone in less than three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, who bought shares last July at $6.50, predicts
three-year earnings growth of 15 percent a year, on average. The
shares closed Friday at $7.1875, or 4.5 times his earnings estimate
of $1.60 a share this year.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Lifemark, a health maintenance organization in
Phoenix. ``The industry as a whole is cheap,'' he said, ``but this
company is doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the company has doubled its annual per-share
earnings for three consecutive years. Wall Street expects earnings
growth to average 30 percent a year for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in October 1998 at $4.375; it closed Friday at
$4, or 6 times analysts' consensus earnings of 65 cents a share for
the fiscal year ending in May 2001.

`BALANCHINE LIVES!': LEGACY OF A GREAT CHOREOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the thorniest problems facing dance is how to keep the
classics of the past alive yet authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Videotaping and dance notation now augment the age-old handing
down of dances from one performer to another. But what about
differences in individual interpretation or even a choreographer's
different versions? Which should be the interpretation of record?
Those questions are addressed in impressive depth in Michael
Blackwood's ``Balanchine Lives!'' on PBS on Sunday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine shrugged off the matter of his legacy. He redid
dances and allowed performers to shape them individually. But with
the creation of the George Balanchine Trust, whose work has become
a model for the licensing of dances, Balanchine's work had a head
start on life after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with 14 former New York City Ballet and
Balanchine-trained dancers _ of whom some stage ballets for the
trust and others direct ballet companies throughout the United
States and in Europe _ suggest that the best method may still be
the transmission of choreography through the memories and examples
of those who worked directly with the creator.
</P>
<P>
   The blessedly straightforward ``Balanchine Lives!'' is crammed
with photographs of the choreographer at work, looking much more
poignantly human than the icon he is fast becoming. Balanchine's
biographer Bernard Taper provides historical and social context.
Another part of the rich mosaic are the personalities and
observations of the restagers _ all women, curiously _ who
painstakingly teach Balanchine to the dancers of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Karin von Aroldingen, one of the City Ballet performers to whom
Balanchine left his ballets, is the eloquently poetic dreamer of
the group. Patricia Neary jumps into the fray, a whirlwind on point
in her late 50s. Francia Russell, co-director with Kent Stowell of
Pacific Northwest Ballet, is tellingly pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Villella, director of Miami City Ballet, mixes pragmatism
with vivid recall of how it feels to dance Balanchine, and Patricia
Wilde, then director of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, speaks
movingly about a personal sense of legacy. Suzanne Farrell offers a
remarkable insight into Balanchine's musicality.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising amount of information is woven into this
thought-provoking and beautifully photographed hourlong
documentary, edited by Julie Sloane and shot by Mark Trottenberg,
Mead Hung and Reinhard Schatzman. Words and images convey not just
the passing down of dance but also subjects ranging from
Balanchine's respect for child performers to the ways that his
ballets help develop dancers and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Christophe Maillot, director of Les Ballets de Monte Carlo,
sums it up. ``For every single choreographer, the day you give your
step to another dancer you accept you're going to be betrayed by
them,'' Maillot says, adding that what is important is what the
dancer can do with that ``betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the choreographer is alive, good, he will give his own
opinion,'' he said. ``If he's not alive, who knows really how `Swan
Lake' should have been danced?''
</P>

`JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS': COVETS FLEECE! SLAYS HARPIES! YESSSS! 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By NEIL GENZLINGER

<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBC miniseries ``Jason and the Argonauts,'' like any good
epic, has profound questions at its heart. What drives men to
pursue the seemingly unattainable? Are there limits to love and
friendship? And what is that thing on Dennis Hopper's head?
</P>
<P>
   Hopper, sporting a curly coiffure and a creepily understated
malevolence, is one of the high points of this often entertaining
account of Jason, the hero of Greek legend, and his quest for the
Golden Fleece. So odd is Hopper's get-up _ he plays Pelias, the
king with a penchant for stabbing his relatives _ that when he
first appears in Sunday's opening installment that it is difficult
to recognize him. But then comes that voice.
</P>
<P>
   Pelias covets the fleece far more than any animal hide ought to
be coveted, and he sends Jason (Jason London), his nephew, to find
it. Jason is given a ship, the Argo, and the underqualified crew he
recruits becomes known as the Argonauts. Adventures ensue, watched
over and sometimes manipulated by Zeus (Angus MacFadyen) and Hera
(Olivia Williams), the deities of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries, another lavish offering by the producing team of
Robert Halami Sr. and Robert Halami Jr., doesn't quite capture the
suicide-mission camaraderie that ought to prevail on Jason's ship.
Half of the Argonauts are drowned or otherwise disposed of before
they have made much of an impression on the screen. Of those who
aren't, only Kieran O'Brien as a weaselly thief, Brian Thompson as
Hercules and Olga Sosnovska as Jason's longtime
friend-who-wishes-she-were-more-than-that are particularly
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   But calamities, not character studies, are the main attraction
here, and several of the ones the Argonauts blunder into are
skillfully served. Poseidon, the sea god, is a huge, scaly fright.
The Clashing Rocks, which come together to squash passing ships,
are as believable as Clashing Rocks get. And once the voyagers
reach Colchis, the island where the fleece hangs from a tree, they
encounter the worst horror of them all: Frank Langella, playing the
island's king, who appears to have the same hairdresser as Hopper.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think about this ``Jason'' too hard will readily find
flaws. Why do some characters have British accents and others not?
What law of physics allows the Argo to zip smartly along when its
oars are barely reaching the water? When Jason, moments after being
flame-broiled by the fire-breathing Minoan Bull, stirs himself back
to consciousness, would his buddies back there in B.C. Greece
really have shouted a Marv Albert-like ``Yessss!''?
</P>
<P>
   But there is no need for anyone to nitpick when watching this
``Jason.'' It's more fun to trace the antecedents of the various
effects _ beasties that could have been plucked from ``Jurassic
Park'' or the ``Terminator'' movies; a talking statue that is a
cinematic descendant of Babe, the sheep-herding pig; a
color-changing moment from ``Pleasantville.'' There's even a
bow-and-arrow torch-lighting borrowed from that Olympic ceremony a
few years back.
</P>
<P>
   It's also amusing, for anyone whose mythology classes have
merged into one big blob since graduation, to try to guess what's
coming for the Argonauts. Is this the part where they meet the
Cyclopes? (Well, no, that was ....) Wait, it's the Sirens, right?
(No, you're thinking of ....) Wait, I've got it; it's the Harpies,
isn't it? (Yessss!)
</P>
<P>
   And finally, viewers can spend some of their idle time simply
marveling at the restraint of the cast and crew, especially at one
particular moment near the end. Jason has made it back home with
the fleece, which turns out to be a mangy rag still attached to the
skull of its original four-legged owner. Pelias' son, Acastus (Tom
Harper), has snatched the fleece to try to impress Dad. Pelias and
Acastus come face to face, Pelias in his goofy curls, Acastus
wearing the ratty-looking fleece on his noggin.
</P>
<P>
   And no one bursts out laughing. But there's a sense that there
was a lot of laughing on the inside. When this ``Jason'' works,
that is why: It's drama wrapped around a sense of fun.

REMEMBERING CARDINAL O'CONNOR

 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    I will miss John Cardinal O'Connor.
 &HT;    I haven't always felt that way, of course. Back during my 1984
campaign for vice president, in fact, there were plenty of times
when I wished fervently that he would simply go away.
 &HT;    But he didn't, and over the years I took the measure of a man
who, now that he has finally left us, leaves a void that will be
all but impossible to fill.
 &HT;    Then-Bishop O'Connor of New York burst into my consciousness
like a lion pouncing on its prey, and I don't mind admitting that I
was outraged by both the suddenness and the seriousness of his
attack.
 &HT;    As would be the case so often in years to come, the issue in
1984 was abortion. It was a battle of words, not substance, and it
was one that could never be resolved, because we had staked out our
positions and neither of us was going to be moved.
 &HT;    ``The Catholic Church's position opposing abortion is
monolithic,'' Bishop O'Connor asserted.
 &HT;    I agreed entirely, but felt that the Church didn't speak for all
Catholics on the issue. Many Catholics, including some lay Catholic
theologians, were pro-choice, I pointed out, myself among them.
 &HT;    ``The Catholic position regarding abortion is not monolithic,''
I summarized.
 &HT;    In the end, it was a disaster for all involved. We were talking
past each other, neither really trying to convince the other, and
the only winners were Ronald Reagan and George Bush, whose campaign
milked the argument between us for all it was worth, doing their
best to make it seem as if I were running against the bishop, not
Vice President Bush.
 &HT;    Needless to say, we didn't win the election.
 &HT;    It was several months before I had a chance to mend fences with
Bishop O'Connor. The occasion was his departure for Rome to be
invested as a cardinal, a prince of the Church.
 &HT;    I was genuinely happy for him, and wanted to congratulate him _
but I wasn't quite sure how to do it. Finally I decided to trust to
humor, and sent him a short note.
 &HT;    ``I want to add my congratulations to that of all your friends
on your elevation to cardinal,'' I wrote. ``I only wanted to be
vice president. You got to be a prince!''
 &HT;    I was a bit worried when I dropped that letter in the mail,
however. After all, I wasn't sure if O'Connor had a sense of humor
in the first place.
 &HT;    I was reassured when, several weeks later, I got a call from the
Archdiocese, inviting me to the Chancery for breakfast with the
cardinal. We talked for quite a while, but not about abortion _ we
both knew that was one of several issues on which we would never
agree.
 &HT;    But as we talked, it became clear that we agreed on so many
other things. I left the meeting that morning comfortable in the
knowledge that I had made a friend.
 &HT;    Over the next several years, on more than one occasion I found
my life in turmoil. Invariably, just when I needed it most, the
phone would ring and I would hear the cardinal's familiar voice
giving comfort, offering a prayer.
 &HT;    The fascinating thing about the man, I soon learned, was that
while he may have been a Prince of the Church in name, in spirit he
was very much a parish priest, always looking after his flock.
 &HT;    I guess that's what most defined him. He was a man of
contradictions, and most of them arose from conflicts between those
two roles.
 &HT;    He made headlines condemning abortion, but quietly provided
shelter for unwed mothers. He adamantly opposed gays marching in
the St. Patrick's Day Parade, but funded hospices for people with
AIDS.
 &HT;    He never pulled his punches in condemning what he believed to be
a sin, but he loved the ``sinners'' nonetheless, and quietly,
effectively, he made a difference in the lives of many of them.
 &HT;    His job required him to be a politician, and like many
politicians he engendered extreme emotional responses. Like no
Cardinal New York had known before, he seemed to splinter people
into opposing camps. People either loved him or hated him _ and
some of us did both at different times.
 &HT;    Maybe it was his military background that made him seem so rigid
on matters of faith, but maybe that also accounted for the ease he
felt with his brothers in arms in the political and business world.
 &HT;    But this soldier was also a television star, keenly aware of the
impact of television and deft in using it from the pulpit. His
sense of duty to Rome was traditional in the deepest sense, but he
was a man of the modern world when it came to using its media to
bring that message to his diocese and to the nation beyond.
 &HT;    His will be an extremely tough act to follow _ an activist
priest, a defender of dogma, a man of business acumen who was
politically knowledgeable and media-savvy, a prince of an ancient
church who left his mark on 20th-century New York and the United
States as a whole.
 &HT;    He came into my life as a lion and left it as a lamb. And I will
miss him.

PLAN FOR CONCERT AT NAZI CAMP SITE STIRS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The idea behind bringing the Vienna Philharmonic to
play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the site of the former Nazi camp
in Mauthausen, Austria, was to promote reconciliation at the dawn
of a new century. But in Joerg Haider's Austria the plan has
divided the country and sparked anguished debate.
</P>
<P>
   Elie Wiesel has canceled his plans to attend the concert on
Sunday, because of the presence of Haider's rightist Freedom Party
in the government, and critics of the idea have sharpened their
attacks on a performance that they call an insult to memory rather
than a means to transcend the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that changes this unique slaughterhouse on Austrian
soil into a concert house is tasteless, to say the least,'' said
Marta Halpert, the director of the central European office of the
Anti-Defamation League in Vienna. ``The notion of Philharmonic
musicians in striped pants sitting in the quarry where so many died
is grotesque.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people were killed at Mauthausen between 1939
and 1945. Many of them died after being driven to a state of
skeletal exhaustion through slave labor in the stone quarry at the
site. The camp was used primarily for political opponents of
Hitler, although many Jews ended up there after the ``death
marches'' of the war's end.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has been sharpened by the particular history of
the Vienna Philharmonic, which performed Beethoven's ``Fidelio'' at
the express request of Hermann Goering 10 days after the Anschluss
in 1938. The orchestra had many openly Nazi members, responded with
equanimity to the deportation to death camps of six Jewish members,
and for decades after the war continued to turn a blind eye to
these facts, as did most Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens Hellsberg, the president of the Philharmonic who has
done much to throw belated light on the orchestra's dark years
under Hitler's Reich, has defended the concert as a sign of hope
for a new millennium and an educational gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must sensitize the eyes and ears and especially the hearts
of people to need and misery in this world,'' he said in a recent
interview with Die Presse. When the orchestra was criticized at a
performance in Paris shortly after Haider entered government in
February, he pointed to the Mauthausen event as proof of its
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Rattle, the British conductor who will soon take over from
Claudio Abbado at the Berlin Philharmonic, will conduct the
performance, one that has led Rattle to a great deal of soul
searching. He declined to be interviewed, but earlier this year he
told The Guardian that, in the end, silence was not an option for a
musician offered such a rare opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be reaching into ourselves to try to express
what is necessary through the music,'' he said then. ``When the
alternative is silence, there isn't really an alternative for a
musician.''
</P>
<P>
   Rattle added: ``It's retreat or resist, and now is the time to
resist. To do anything else would play into the hands of reaction
and racism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Viennese-born conductor Rudolf Schwarz, who survived
Auschwitz, was one of Rattle's chief mentors and his educator in
the truths of the Holocaust. Rattle seems to believe that the
concert is consistent with Schwarz's lifelong determination to bear
witness and so ensure that there is never again a Mauthausen on
European soil.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The idea for the concert originally came from Leon Zelman, a Jew
from Vienna who survived Auschwitz and Mauthausen. He now leads an
organization that tries to draw back to the city Jews expelled in
1938 and their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dead of Mauthausen were mainly freedom fighters who died
for a certain vision of Europe, and on the eve of a new millennium
I wanted to do something for this dream of a new Europe,'' he said.
``The Ninth Symphony is the hymn of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain what vision of Europe the Nazis' victims at
Mauthausen had, beyond their resistance to Hitler. But Haider's
Freedom Party, a coalition partner in the Austrian government, has
taken a clear stance against further European integration. It has
also criticized the Ueberfremdung _ the word, dear to the Nazis,
roughly means over-foreignerization _ of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Zelman said that nobody from the government had been invited to
the event, because of the presence of the Freedom Party. Haider has
remained silent on the subject of the concert, as have the various
snubbed ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his decision not to attend, Wiesel said earlier this
year, ``In a country where there is a Mauthausen, there should not
be a Haider.'' But he has sent a message that will be read before
the concert and that asks the eternal question: What turned ``good
fathers and loyal husbands'' into cold-blooded Nazi murderers?
</P>
<P>
   Because the camp is the responsibility of the Ministry of the
Interior, it has fallen to the uninvited government to prepare the
quarry for the concert, employing, among others, engineers to
improve the acoustics. More than 7,000 people are expected to
attend, and video screens for live transmission have been set up in
Vienna, Linz and Innsbruck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst sort of event culture, like taking the three
tenors to the Baths of Caracalla,'' said Halpert. ``You can hear
the screams in the quarry. You should not make any other sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Her stance has been broadly supported by Helmut Edelmayr, who
leads the Austrian Association of Prison Camps. He will take part
in a ceremony before the concert, commemorating the 55th
anniversary of the liberation of the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survivors see this place as a de facto graveyard,'' he
said. ``And in graveyards such events are not held.''

MUSIC FROM VICTIMS OF NAZIS LIVES ON IN A CANTATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also HOLOCAUST-PHILHARMONIC) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The balmy spring night belied the occasion of sad
memorial, and as the cantata played out around the city on the
radio, listeners paused at the very idea of a spirited tango
composed by some forgotten Buchenwald prisoner, not to mention the
bold humor enduring beyond long-gone lyricists at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey! There's no life like life at Auschwitz!'' go the sardonic
words, composed in a hidden gathering place at the camp by a group
of inmates who managed to filch some of their keepers' alcohol and
imbibe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something inside is happening again,'' the anonymous composers
attest in the intoxication that preceded their fate. ``We're
beginning to feel like someone again.''
</P>
<P>
   Priceless snatches of such words and music drifted out across
the capital on Wednesday night as part of Holocaust memorial week,
as witness to some of the toughest and most unconquerable victims
of Nazi Germany's extermination machinery.
</P>
<P>
   While the secret classical music compositions of some prisoners
survived them and have long been treasured, there is also a rich
trove of the camp music of the common people that the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum has meticulously collected for anyone
with the heart to delve into it.
</P>
<P>
   Donald McCullough was such a one when, as a newcomer to
Washington, he turned to the museum in seeking to create a fresh
work for the Master Chorale of Washington, the 150-member
professional group of which he is music director. The result is the
Holocaust Cantata, a choral pastiche of authentic music and song
from inmates translated from the Polish. The chorale's chamber
singers performed its premiere two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found ultimately was, I think, the music of spiritual
resistance,'' McCullough said. ``They couldn't resist physically or
verbally. But music was a way for them to resist, and that's the
overarching theme.''
</P>
<P>
   As it sounded forth from the local classical music station,
WETA, the cantata was a reminder of the extraordinary preservation
labors that some inmates carried on. They protected a legacy of
tunes, some rebelliously composed on the spot, others fondly clung
to by the ordinary millions who perished.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Werb, the musicologist at the Holocaust museum, directed
McCullough to an enormous archive left by Aleksander Kulisiewicz, a
Polish journalist and songwriter who was imprisoned for
anti-fascist activities and became the camp troubadour at
Sachsenhausen in Germany. He was regularly beaten for his lyrical
resistance. But he survived, and upon liberation he dictated to
bedside nurses 700 songs and poems that he had memorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to this earth to share with you pain, in the same
manner in which others come to share pleasures,'' Kulisiewicz
declared as he spent the remaining 37 years of his life on a
monumental study of the music culture of the Nazi camps.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough said: ``Rather naively I went into this thinking,
`OK, I'm going to call this ``Light in the Darkness'' or some
such.' But that seemed trite once I really got into it, because
while there are some readings in the cantata about music giving
them hope, so many other songs are about nothing but despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Josef Kropinski, imprisoned for editing an underground
newspaper, spent five years in the camps and jotted down more than
500 musical pieces, some of them on the backs of Nazi bureaucratic
forms. He smuggled out much of what he heard and sang, some of it
now among the saddest parts of the cantata. ``In Buchenwald the
birch trees rustle sadly,'' goes one tune he carried, ``as my heart
sways languishing in woe.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of the material McCullough researched tells of the
sufferings of the non-Jewish Polish slave laborers, dissidents and
intellectuals, among the categories targeted by Hitler for
destruction or decimation that the Holocaust museum continues to
research.
</P>
<P>
   When he began, McCullough _ a musician, not a linguist _ could
only search out promising tunes in the museum's archives. He
discovered more fully what he had found when a member of the
chorale, Laura Kafka, the daughter of a Polish slave laborer,
translated some lyrics. The story of her mother, Irena, a camp
survivor, is now included as a terse spoken prelude to ``The
Train,'' a farewell song that survived the Brzezinka camp. (``The
dark hour's on us, our fate is sealed, I must forget you.'')
</P>
<P>
   Eventually McCullough hired a young Pole, Marcin Zmudzki, to
scan and translate archive selections. Those translations then were
adapted as cantata lyrics by Denny Clark, a member of the chorale.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough said: ``To me the cantata's broad message is simply:
This happened. It can happen. And the line between good and evil in
every single one of us is so thin.''
</P>
<P>
   As a composer McCullough tries to specialize in what he terms
``music of the commoner'' that can ``translate the statistics'' of
history into a sense of individual experience. His latest choral
work is rooted in the spirituals that aided the flight of countless
American slaves along the underground railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love music that speaks of daily life but lasts for
generations and generations,'' he said. ``I wondered if there was
music like that that speaks of daily life in the camps that can
give some insight into what it was like through music.''
</P>
<P>
   Josef Kropinski eventually answered the question in leaving one
of the most mournful songs to survive now in the Holocaust Cantata:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreams of yore will not return,
</P>
<P>
   Nor the reveries that burned,
</P>
<P>
   Nor the nectar of sweet lips,
</P>
<P>
   Nor those longing eyes!
</P>
<P>
   Cello, play the sad song,
</P>
<P>
   Song of pining, pain and tears,
</P>
<P>
   Song remembering dreams of love
</P>
<P>
   And of days now gone.''

IRANIANS VOTE AS TENSIONS RUN HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iranians voted Friday in runoff elections for a
new Parliament, in an atmosphere of heightened suspense after the
conservative crackdown on the politically ascendant reform
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Voting stations were kept open an extra two hours, for a total
of 12 hours, to accommodate a high turnout in a number of cities,
according to the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   There were no runoffs in the capital, Tehran, but 66 seats were
to be decided in rural areas and a few large cities. Election
officials said they expected to announce preliminary results in a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers backing President Mohammad Khatami hoped to clinch a
clear majority in the 290-seat Parliament. Pro-Khatami candidates
won an estimated 70 percent of the 185 races that were decided
outright in the first round of voting, on Feb. 18. To secure a seat
then, a candidate had to win at least 25 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers said they were assured of at least 15 more seats
in the second round from races where both candidates were
associated with reform parties. But the final count is in the hands
of the conservative-dominated Council of Guardians, which must
certify elections.
</P>
<P>
   The council has changed the results in 11 first-round races, in
some cases elevating the runner-up to winner and in others voiding
the election outright. Reform leaders have said the casualties have
all been their allies.
</P>
<P>
   The runoffs capped several weeks of high drama in Iran, as
conservative judges arrested a number of leading reformers and
closed 16 reform newspapers and magazines. The national daily
newspaper associated with the main reform party, which is headed by
Khatami's brother, was among those closed by the hard-line courts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, results from the Tehran vote, in which reformers
and independents won 29 of 30 seats, have yet to be certified two
months after the first round of voting. The council, which includes
some of the most outspoken opponents of the reform movement, has
been recounting ballots for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Reform leaders have speculated that the prolonged audit in
Tehran is an attempt by conservatives to manipulate the results and
reduce the pro-Khatami majority in Parliament, which is scheduled
to begin work on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   But in a highly unusual public explanation of the secretive
workings of the Council of Guardians, one of its most prominent
members on Friday defended its handling of the Tehran ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In a sermon before the weekly public prayers at Tehran
University, Ayatollah Mohammad Mesbah-Yazdi, one of 12 council
members, said the recount in Tehran was not the conservatives'
idea, but had been prompted by challenges from two losing
candidates and a political party.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken so long to complete, he said, because election
officials did not want to work during the two-week holiday around
the Iranian new year in March.
</P>
<P>
   The first few recounts, he added, showed such large
discrepancies between the reported and actual results that the
council decided to re-examine votes from a large number of randomly
chosen ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Mesbah-Yazdi has described the reform movement as more dangerous
to the system than a military coup because it promotes greater
freedom for Iranians to write, read and behave as they wish.

ADVERTISING: SELF-ACTIVATING ADVERTISEMENTS FOR MOVIE THEATER
LOBBIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Calif., Wash.)  (EDS: This column was published in Friday's New York Times) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The next time you step inside the Megacinema
Plethoraplex, or whatever your local movie palace is called, you
will most likely notice the myriad ways that Hollywood embraces
Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   There will probably be advertising on the popcorn bags, on the
racks of postcards near the ticket counter, on the signs festooning
the lobby and on the slides appearing on screen before the show.
There will also probably be some commercials that run before the
film starts, not to mention trailers, which are of course ads for
other movies. During the film, you may glimpse products whose
makers paid to place them there.
</P>
<P>
   So what might you think about plans by a giant film exhibitor
and a company that distributes sponsored postcards at the movies to
bring to theater lobbies interactive wall-mounted displays that
show commercial video clips at the touch of a button? Maybe it
would be, to cite the title of a 1971 film with Peter Fonda and
Dennis Hopper, ``The Last Movie'' you would go to see.
</P>
<P>
   That obviously is not the intent of the theater chain, Loews
Cineplex Entertainment, nor of the postcard marketer, Max Racks
Inc. Their goal for the wall display, named Bluscreen, is to
provide another advertising medium for marketers attracted to the
appealing demographic profiles of moviegoers without alienating
those consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about choice,'' said Sylvie Anapol, president at Max
Racks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get involved in our advertising only if they choose
to,'' she added. ``They can walk by or can stop and interact with
it. They're not captives of it or hostages to it in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   That perspective is shared by executives at Loews Cineplex,
which operates 3,000 screens at 400 locations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer makes the decision to go up to the display and
choose an advertisement'' to watch, said Marc Pascucci, senior vice
president for marketing at Loews Cineplex in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate in our theaters is very valuable,'' he added,
``and we've tried kiosks before, but they've never been able to
withstand usage. This seems to be working.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluscreen, the most recent entry in the booming market for what
is known as place-based advertising, is being tested in 11 Loews
Cineplex theaters in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York (two
Manhattan locations), San Francisco and Seattle. The video clips in
the test are for advertisers that sponsor Max Racks postcard ads;
they are not being charged for the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our postcard advertisers are doing great creative on
TV,'' said Anapol, who heads Max Racks with Michael Gitter, vice
president. ``My partner and I thought kiosk-type advertising seemed
like a natural.''
</P>
<P>
   The test video clips have included trailers for films like
``Mission to Mars'' and ``The Road to El Dorado.'' There have also
been spots for Web sites like Kozmo.com and Motorola.com; retailers
like Sephora; and products like American Express cards and Todd
Oldham jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of yelling out at the customer, it's
self-activating,'' said Ross Klein, senior vice president for
marketing at the Sun Apparel division of Jones New York, which
makes the Oldham jeans line. ``I liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Wasserman, a vice president at the American Express Co. in
New York, which is advertising its new Blue charge card on
Bluscreen _ natch _ had this to say: ``We're looking at a lot of
different ways to use alternative media, from popcorn bags to the
backs of Metrocards to water bottles in health clubs. We want to
reach people where they work and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Another crucial place to reach consumers in a buying mood is
where they shop. That is the idea behind a campaign for eDiets.com,
which operates a Web site providing diet and fitness information.
In addition to radio, print and online ads, dieters will see
place-based promotions for eDiets.com on supermarket floors,
shopping carts and even fruit stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media is the new creative department,'' said Mark DiMassimo,
president and executive creative director at the eDiets.com agency,
DiMassimo Brand Advertising in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can show up in places where the message is relevant,
then the ads make sense,'' he added. ``If we were just shilling,
we'd be adding to the clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the theaters, Max Racks plans to install 100 Bluscreen
wall displays in the third quarter, then expand to 480 displays, or
about a pair for every Loews Cineplex theater in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of selling it right now,'' Anapol said,
``and determining the cost structure.''

SHOULD THERE BE A LIMIT ON LIMIT ORDERS? 
</HEADLINE>

(ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

or 888-346-9867.) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veteran investors know that, in a stock market as jumpy as this
one, limit orders are the only way to trade. Setting prices on
trades means investors are less likely to overpay to buy or reap
too little on a sale.
</P>
<P>
   But limit orders benefit investors only if their brokerage firms
actually post the orders for others to see. According to a
Securities and Exchange Commission report last week, the prompt
display of investor limit orders, as required by securities laws,
occurs with a distressing haphazardness.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the result of SEC examinations in 1999 at the
nation's stock and options exchanges and at various, unnamed
brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Prompt and proper display of customer limit orders is good for
investors and bad for dealers, so the reluctance of some firms to
abide by the rules is understandable. After all, if a dealer gets a
limit order to buy shares at a price slightly below the prevailing
market, he can sell shares to the customer at a profit, never
allowing another investor, who would be happy to sell his shares
for a slightly higher price, to interact with the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Customer limit orders also narrow the difference between the
prices at which a dealer will buy and sell a stock, known as the
spread, driving down investor costs. Because this reduces dealers'
profits, they have an incentive not to show the order.
</P>
<P>
   The rules surrounding limit orders were enacted in 1996 after
the SEC and the Justice Department found extensive investor abuse
on the Nasdaq stock market. Four years and more than $1 billion in
penalties later, many brokerage firms still seem to view investor
fairness rules with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who place limit orders in Nasdaq stocks appear to fare
the worst, according to the SEC. Many Nasdaq dealer firms, for one
thing, do not have automated systems to handle their customer limit
orders. And not surprisingly, when orders are handled manually, the
SEC examiners found significant problems. At one large Nasdaq
dealer firm, a trader working manually failed to display 83 percent
of customer limit orders properly.
</P>
<P>
   Problems arose even among firms with automatic order display
systems. One firm employee unplugged the automatic system for its
entire Nasdaq trading desk for several months without anyone
noticing.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms failed to display the full extent of customers'
orders. At one firm, according to the report, when an order came in
from a customer at a better price than the firm's, it simply
improved its own quote to match the customer's price. The firm told
the SEC that since the customer's order was no longer better than
the firm's price, it did not have to display the full order.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who trade on the New York Stock Exchange do not appear
to encounter such difficulties. The exchange said that last
December, it handled just over 6 million limit orders. Of those,
only 21 were displayed improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling, perhaps, the SEC's report calls into question
whether self-regulation in securities markets works. According to
the report, some self-regulatory organizations were found to
conduct no surveillance of limit order display. One self-regulator
examined only a small percentage of executed limit orders, ignoring
those that were undisplayed. In addition, some self-regulatory
groups failed to refer even egregious rule violations to their
enforcement staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Luparello, executive vice president for market regulation
at the National Association of Securities Dealers, said that it had
brought 49 limit order enforcement cases in the past two years.
Since limit orders make up two-thirds of Nasdaq orders, this number
may not seem large, he conceded. But the NASD is comfortable with
it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the SEC report doesn't name names, it is hard to tell
where investors are safe and where they are sorry. But investors
who are unhappy with limit order executions should carp loudly to
the SEC. The Commission says it is going to step up surveillance of
limit order handling. And it needs all the help it can get.

 &HT;    AirTran wants clearance to fly to D.C.-National

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran Airways is seeking special government approval
to fly between Atlanta and Washington's Reagan National Airport,
arguing its presence on the heavily traveled route would bring down
fares.
</P>
<P>
   The discount carrier applied Friday for ``slot exemptions'' to
serve Reagan National that were created in a federal aviation
funding bill passed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Slots are airline-owned landing and takeoff rights used at
Reagan National and a handful of other congested major airports.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran now flies between Atlanta and Washington's Dulles
International Airport but does not have slots to serve closer-in
Reagan National. Fares to Dulles are often cheaper than to
Reagan-National, which is served nonstop from Atlanta by Delta Air
Lines and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most notable airport city-pair that has not benefitted
from the affordable fare competition provided by AirTran's service
in Atlanta is Reagan National Airport,'' AirTran said.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation bill, signed by President Clinton last month,
created 12 slot exemptions for flights within 1,250 miles of Reagan
National. AirTran wants to fly five daily round-trips to Hartsfield
International, which isn't slot controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The slot exemptions are intended in part to foster more service
to small and medium sized airports. While Hartsfield doesn't fit
that description, AirTran argues it could provide one-stop service
via Atlanta to Savannah, Gulfport, Miss., and Fort Walton Beach,
Fla., and connections to a dozen more cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come down to how the (U.S. Department of
Transportation) secretary interprets the act,'' said Kevin Healy,
vice president of planning at AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers also are applying for slots, although no other
applications involve new Atlanta service. Atlantic Southeast
Airlines, a Delta subsidiary, wants to fly nonstop between Reagan
National and Jacksonville, Fla., with regional jets.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT is expected to award the slot exemptions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokeswoman said the airline has no immediate comment on
AirTran's application but added the carrier will file arguments
with the DOT.

IMMIGRANTS: A FORGOTTEN SIDE OF GLOBALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By DANIEL AKST    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their determination to derail the forces of globalization _ a
process in which dastardly capitalists provide employment to
impoverished people all over the world _ protesters in Washington
focused recently on a pair of plump targets, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they directed none of their ire at the Washington
headquarters of another notorious agent of globalization, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the INS is not really responsible for America's
decision to tolerate consistently high levels of legal and illegal
immigration, or for the nation's indifference to the age, training
or skill level of most of the immigrants it admits.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters seemed mainly to want a symbol. So why assail
global trade (the importing of goods) but ignore immigration (the
importing of people)? After all, economists across the political
spectrum agree that the growing volume of world trade yields
economic, social and even geopolitical benefits to Americans and
foreigners alike, making the world more peaceful and more affluent.
That cannot be said of current immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters claimed to be environmentalists. Surely
the arrival of large numbers of immigrants, who will soon begin
consuming land, fuel and other resources at gargantuan American
levels, is an environmental issue.
</P>
<P>
   Other protesters profess a concern for American jobs. Yet
unemployment in this country is negligible. The real problem for
American workers is that immigration keeps increasing the supply of
labor, seriously suppressing low-end wages. George Borjas, a
Harvard professor of public policy specializing in immigration,
calls this ``an astonishing transfer of wealth from the poorest
people in the country, who are disproportionately minorities, to
the richest.''
</P>
<P>
   John Micklethwait and Adrian Woolridge, in their exhaustive new
book of globalization, ``A Future Perfect'' (Crown Business Books)
state flatly that ``immigration has a much more direct impact on
American wages than trade does.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, immigration holds down wages in exactly the kinds
of low-skill jobs that are not easy to shift overseas _ the only
ones, in other words, that are likely to remain available in the
long run to the poorest Americans. Many of the poor _ often
immigrants themselves _ generally take a much dimmer view of high
immigration rates than does the latte-and-SUV crowd, which mainly
sees cheap child care and great new ethnic restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, immigration has played a role in the declining
fortunes of organized labor. Consider the drywallers of Southern
California. In the 1970s, installing gypsum wallboard there was
highly paid union work. But at the end of that decade, contractors
began using nonunion Mexican immigrants, many of them from a single
village. By the early 1980s, union drywallers had been completely
displaced, and wages had plummeted. Eventually, after a struggle,
the immigrant drywallers formed their own union and won raises, but
their pay remains far below what their predecessors earned _
perhaps because there are more immigrants waiting to take their
places.
</P>
<P>
   In the rhetoric of its opponents, global capitalism has a
prominent failing: income inequality. But in the United States,
that inequality is almost certainly exacerbated by immigration;
indeed, it is becoming common again for the bourgeoisie to employ
servants, though no one uses the term in polite company.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve and bete noire
of anticapitalists everywhere, recently called for more immigration
of skilled workers. Software companies, of course, love that idea.
They want more immigrant programmers, even though there is no great
shortage of homegrown software labor, at least according to Norman
Matloff, a computer scientist at the University of California at
Davis who also studies immigration. There is only a shortage, he
says of cheap software labor.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more logical for foes of globalization to also
oppose immigration, but they find such a stance politically
incorrect. While the other side's views may be more consistent, I'm
not sure they are any more right. If we are to continue reaping the
benefits of globalization, we must do more to help those who suffer
the heaviest cost _ America's working poor, who should, at the
least, receive decent pay and health insurance for their labors.
The nation is unlikely to make much headway on this or many other
important fronts (like income inequality, suburban sprawl or the
breakdown in social cohesion) until we reassess which people, and
how many of them, can enter the country. In the past, big influxes
have often been followed by long periods of digestion in which
fewer newcomers were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The time may be right for another such breather.

   AUTISM-SCHOOLS (West Windsor, N.J.) _ One family came from
India, others from Greece and Italy and Israel. Compared to those
migrations, Rob and Anne Mandel had it pretty easy, giving up his
medical practice and a life they loved in Indiana to get their son,
Sam, the help he needed in New Jersey. Sam is autistic, and his
parents' move here made the Mandels part of the phenomenon of
families that, desperate for the most sophisticated special
education services for their disabled children, move from other
states and even other nations in search of care. But, increasingly,
the needs of parents with autistic children are clashing with the
bottom lines of school districts that have to pay for enormously
expensive services. Iver Peterson.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The nation's unemployment rate fell
below 4 percent in April for the first time in 30 years, the Labor
Department reported Friday, as employers hired tens of thousands of
census takers, restaurant employees and temporary workers in a
booming economy. The new employment numbers _ 341,000 new jobs and
a 3.9 percent unemployment rate _ offered no evidence that the
nine-year-old expansion _ the longest in America's history _ might
be coming to an end or even weakening in response to the Federal
Reserve's attempt to slow the economy by raising interest rates.
The Fed's great fear is that labor shortages will give workers
enough bargaining power to push up labor costs and employers, in
response, will raise prices to cover the higher costs. But wages,
while rising, are still not going up fast enough to set off an
inflationary spiral, the Labor Department's latest numbers show. By

armored personnel carriers toward the capital, U.N. officials said
Friday. The convoy, which was sent from Lungi, a port town, to

   SALMON-DAMS (Lower Granite Dam, Wash.) _ The fate of the huge
hydroelectric dams on the Snake River, and of the endangered salmon
there, may hinge on the effectiveness of a program to bring
millions of the fish on barges around dams. Its success or failure
is the likely key to a momentous decision that will ultimately come
before the U.S. Congress: whether to take down the Snake River dams
altogether. That once-unthinkable idea has emerged in several
federal studies as the single action with the best chance of
restoring healthy salmon runs. But many people in the area bitterly
oppose that plan as an assault on the area's agricultural economy,
and the proposal has already emerged as a hot-button issue in the
state in this year's presidential race. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

passed a measure that permits the sale and possession of hypodermic
needles without a prescription, a move intended to slow the spread
of the AIDS virus among addicts who inject drugs. The legislation
would overturn the state's longstanding prohibitions against needle
sales, making New York the 43rd state in the nation to allow
individuals to make such purchases from pharmacists without a
prescription. By Raymond Hernandez.

   TRIPP-TRIAL (Washington) _ A Maryland judge rules that the state
can go ahead with its prosecution of Linda Tripp on charges that
she broke the law when she secretly tape-recorded conversations
with Monica Lewinsky about Lewinsky's relationship with President
Clinton. But the judge, Diane Leasure of Howard County Circuit
Court, also dealt a severe blow to the case by suppressing the
testimony of Lewinsky and another witness that may be crucial in
obtaining a conviction. By Neil A. Lewis. (800 words)

EXPECTATIONS, OVER THE RAINBOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By MARK HULBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is fair to say that technology investors have high
expectations about the future growth of companies in their
portfolios. But I bet that those companies have almost no chance of
meeting those optimistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I so downbeat? It all comes down to the issue of whether
huge growth rates can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a star of the new economy, Cisco Systems. Sure, its
gear is essential to the growth of the Internet. But it is unlikely
that Cisco will perform well enough over the next five years to
satisfy the earnings expectations that I believe are implied by its
current price-to-earnings multiple of 188.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge those expectations, we first need to calculate how much
Cisco's earnings are likely to grow over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   If Cisco follows the typical pattern of growth companies, its
multiple will drop as it grows and matures. So assume that five
years from now, Cisco's P/E will be 50 _ still well above the
market's long-term historical average of about 15.
</P>
<P>
   Next we need to postulate the company's stock performance.
Cisco's stock has climbed 105 percent, annualized, over the last
five years. So, to be conservative, we will guess that it will grow
just 22 percent a year _ still double the stock market's long-term
average.
</P>
<P>
   Given these cautious assumptions, Cisco's stock will be at $183
in May 2005, up from $67.5625 on Friday. And many investors would
be happy to get that kind of return.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the rub: Cisco's earnings will have to grow by
nearly 60 percent a year, on average, over the next five years to
meet those expectations. And if we assume that Cisco's P/E is below
50 in 2005, or that its price is higher than $183, the requisite
earnings growth rate will have to be even higher. To put this in
perspective, consider that the earnings growth rate of the median
technology company has been just 13 percent, annualized, over the
last five decades.
</P>
<P>
   So if you buy Cisco today, expecting that it will hit $183 in
five years, you are making an implicit bet that its earnings will
grow five times faster than those of the average technology
company. And new research suggests that the odds of that are very
low.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Lakonishok and Louis K.D. Chan, finance professors at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studied nearly every
technology stock from 1951 to 1999. In particular, they sought
companies whose earnings growth rates were consistently above the
median of all publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   They found that over periods of five years or more, just 4.7
percent of companies, on average, had earnings growth that beat the
median during all years of the period. The number is statistically
insignificant because, assuming that earnings growth was random,
3.3 percent of the companies would have beaten the median each year
in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Then the professors loosened up a bit, and searched for
technology companies whose earnings growth rates exceeded the
median in four out of five years. The results were almost
identical. Their conclusion: Sustaining consistent, above-average
earnings growth over five years is so rare as to approach
statistical insignificance.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the professors were looking only for those technology
companies that would beat the median earnings growth rate. The
analysis of Cisco suggests that investors are betting, in effect,
that the company will beat the median earnings growth rate by a
factor of five.
</P>
<P>
   I do not mean to pick on Cisco. It is unlikely that any
company's earnings can grow 60 percent a year for the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are forecasting such growth for many companies.
According to First Call/Thomson Financial, nearly 280 of the nearly
6,200 companies it tracks have consensus five-year projected
earnings growth rates of 60 percent or more, annualized.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say earnings don't matter in the new economy. But
the professors foresaw that argument: They reached nearly identical
results when they looked at sales growth rather than earnings
growth.

 ADIDAS NAMES NEW RUNNING SHOES AFTER A TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARRISON METZGER   
 Times-News, Hendersonville, N.C.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREVARD, N.C. _ This western North Carolina town now has a
running shoe named after it in honor of Brevard College's history
of national champion running teams and its acclaimed summer camp
for runners.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas is marketing the Brevard running shoe for women, said
Norm Witek, professor of exercise science and director and
co-founder of the Brevard College Distance Running Camp.
</P>
<P>
   The German-based shoe company named the lightweight running shoe
for the college and town after top Adidas executives visited
Brevard College two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a year ago there were rumors they were going to pull
this off _ I just never thought it would be reality,'' Witek said.
``It's just such a neat idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Witek describes the Brevard shoe as a ``high-end support shoe''
designed to help runners with unstable foot plants. The shoe
retails for $89, weighs 10.4 ounces and comes in an ``aluminum
blue-white'' color.
</P>
<P>
   Witek, 55, coached four national junior college champion
cross-country teams at the college in the early 1980s, along with a
champion marathon team. Dave Rinker, who followed him as coach in
1985, coached two national champion teams.
</P>
<P>
   Witek and Rinker founded the Distance Running Camp in 1990 to
train young runners. The camp now attracts about 1,000 runners from
eighth grade through high school each summer to Brevard, which is
about 40 miles south of Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, under Witek's coaching, Mike Peveto of Lake Charles,
La., won the national junior college marathon, Brevard College's
first national title. Peveto went on to become a top running-shoe
executive at Nike and later Adidas, where he worked until recently
as senior product manager for running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, Witek accepted an invitation by Peveto to
have Adidas sponsor the camp. In 1998, Peveto and his senior staff
from Germany came to the college for a corporate retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The executives brought more than 100 pairs of shoes with them
and asked camp participants for critiques. They offered advice that
the company used in improving its shoes, Witek said.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Kimzey, director of Brevard College's news bureau, said the
college was proud of the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our distance running programs have always been the highest
caliber, and we have always competed against the best of the best
in running programs across the country,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   MOTHERHOOD-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Political strategies come
and go, but a few endure: Never underestimate the political potency
of motherhood. The leaders of the Million Mom March for ``sensible
gun control'' next Sunday, Mother's Day, have an appealing web
site, a shrewd media effort and an aggressive grass-roots
organizing campaign. But above all, they are invoking a very old
tradition in politics: Trying to break through ideology and
partisanship and make an appeal based on the moral authority of
women as mothers. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-STOCKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nasdaq gave amateur investors
the impression that the thing to own is the new, new thing.
Meanwhile, the antiques world gave amateur appraisers the
impression that the thing to own is the old, old thing _ eBay
allowed Web surfers to go antiquing over high-speed access lines,
Sotheby's and Christie's arrived on the Internet, and ``Antiques
Roadshow'' became the most popular program on public TV. By Jenny
Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside the section:
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Defining national security:
Just when does a big problem turn into a national security threat?
If Eisenhower were alive today, he might be amused or puzzled by
the Clinton administration's linkage of national security to issues
like trade privileges for China, AIDS in Africa and global warming.
But it is possible that after a decade of unchallenged power and
prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national
security in broader terms. BY David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTS-JOB-BIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A good job on the night
shift opens up. A mother with young children is not offered the
job, which would be a promotion, because her supervisor assumes _
wrongly _ that her family responsibilities prevent her from working
nights. Did the supervisor act properly? Hardly anyone would say
so. Should the supervisor's action be against the law? Absolutely,
in President Clinton's view. Is the problem pervasive? No one
knows. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CELLPHONES-CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the use of
cellular phones as crime-fighting devices. Since the early 1990s,
cell phones have increasingly become the all-purpose, cure-all
solution for individual safety. The notion of being wired in the
electronic age is shared shared by both parent and child, salesman
and client, cop and felon. The issue, however, is whether people
are really safe, or merely think they are. By Jason Blair.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-TECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ For believers in technology's
implied promise of an information utopia, in which people can see
or hear or read whatever they want (and show or tell or write
whatever they want), the Disney-Time Warner battle over ABC
transmission was an uncomfortable lesson that the more information
available, the more places in which it is available, the more the
logic of economics and egos will come into play to restrict it. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN'S-REALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ An imaginary discussion
among the characters of ``Gilligan's Island'' about the new trend
toward ``reality-based game programming.'' CBS maroons a group of
real people, contestants, on an island and keeps hundreds of
cameras and microphones pointed at them 24 hours a day to record
everything they say and do. People are voted out of the group one
by one. After a few weeks their small society, a microcosm of the
world at large if you will, devolves into something out of ``Lord
of the Flies.'' CBS awards the final contestant a million dollars
or something. By Jeff MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   E-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For more than a year, I've been
experimenting with electronic books. The various e-book devices
felt like solid hardcovers in hand, but the first generation seemed
stiff to me, somehow nerdy and bulky. The cold gray screens of text
didn't offer the hypnotic calm of vanilla rag paper. Reading books
on a PC felt too much as if I was working, chained upright to a
desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback revolution. I
was drawn to the devices that offered one of the basic elements of
pocketbook design: portability. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-OBSTACLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The debacle of the Sierra
Leone peacekeeping mission and the awkward U.S. response
demonstrate again that Africa takes more than good intentions. Now,
the likelihood of deployment of even the modest force for Congo
looks very distant. And even as the House approved a trade bill
granting new trading privileges to Africa, there are some doubts
whether many African countries have the economic capacity to take
advantage of it. The fact remains that sub-Saharan Africa is so
poor, that McDonald's cannot find enough of a customer base to open
one outlet in even one nation. By Jane Perlez. (Moving in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A tempest is brewing in
Washington, all because of an 11-inch blond bombshell. Mattel, in
association with two nonprofit women's groups, recently announced
plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll. Almost immediately the
protests sounded. But why shouldn't American children learn about
civics and the virtues of public service via their favorite
playthings? By Bruce Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   SWORD&AMP;SANDAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ To mark the opening of
``Gladiator'' and the passing of Hercules actor Steve Reeves,
earlier sword-and-sandal epics are recalled for their memorable
utterances. It didn't matter whether the plots were derived from
the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of ancient Rome _ or, more
typically, some unholy mixture of the three. The dialogue
frequently managed to range from the ponderous to the purple, and
sometimes to the preposterous.

for Sunday, May 7, will move Saturday in the `a' category unless
otherwise noted.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   MOTHERHOOD-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Political strategies come
and go, but a few endure: Never underestimate the political potency
of motherhood. The leaders of the Million Mom March for ``sensible
gun control'' next Sunday, Mother's Day, have an appealing web
site, a shrewd media effort and an aggressive grass-roots
organizing campaign. But above all, they are invoking a very old
tradition in politics: Trying to break through ideology and
partisanship and make an appeal based on the moral authority of
women as mothers. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-STOCKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nasdaq gave amateur investors
the impression that the thing to own is the new, new thing.
Meanwhile, the antiques world gave amateur appraisers the
impression that the thing to own is the old, old thing _ eBay
allowed Web surfers to go antiquing over high-speed access lines,
Sotheby's and Christie's arrived on the Internet, and ``Antiques
Roadshow'' became the most popular program on public TV. By Jenny
Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside the section:
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Defining national security:
Just when does a big problem turn into a national security threat?
If Eisenhower were alive today, he might be amused or puzzled by
the Clinton administration's linkage of national security to issues
like trade privileges for China, AIDS in Africa and global warming.
But it is possible that after a decade of unchallenged power and
prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national
security in broader terms. BY David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTS-JOB-BIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A good job on the night
shift opens up. A mother with young children is not offered the
job, which would be a promotion, because her supervisor assumes _
wrongly _ that her family responsibilities prevent her from working
nights. Did the supervisor act properly? Hardly anyone would say
so. Should the supervisor's action be against the law? Absolutely,
in President Clinton's view. Is the problem pervasive? No one
knows. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CELLPHONES-CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the use of
cellular phones as crime-fighting devices. Since the early 1990s,
cell phones have increasingly become the all-purpose, cure-all
solution for individual safety. The notion of being wired in the
electronic age is shared shared by both parent and child, salesman
and client, cop and felon. The issue, however, is whether people
are really safe, or merely think they are. By Jason Blair.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-TECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ For believers in technology's
implied promise of an information utopia, in which people can see
or hear or read whatever they want (and show or tell or write
whatever they want), the Disney-Time Warner battle over ABC
transmission was an uncomfortable lesson that the more information
available, the more places in which it is available, the more the
logic of economics and egos will come into play to restrict it. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN'S-REALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ An imaginary discussion
among the characters of ``Gilligan's Island'' about the new trend
toward ``reality-based game programming.'' CBS maroons a group of
real people, contestants, on an island and keeps hundreds of
cameras and microphones pointed at them 24 hours a day to record
everything they say and do. People are voted out of the group one
by one. After a few weeks their small society, a microcosm of the
world at large if you will, devolves into something out of ``Lord
of the Flies.'' CBS awards the final contestant a million dollars
or something. By Jeff MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   E-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For more than a year, I've been
experimenting with electronic books. The various e-book devices
felt like solid hardcovers in hand, but the first generation seemed
stiff to me, somehow nerdy and bulky. The cold gray screens of text
didn't offer the hypnotic calm of vanilla rag paper. Reading books
on a PC felt too much as if I was working, chained upright to a
desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback revolution. I
was drawn to the devices that offered one of the basic elements of
pocketbook design: portability. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-OBSTACLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The debacle of the Sierra
Leone peacekeeping mission and the awkward U.S. response
demonstrate again that Africa takes more than good intentions. Now,
the likelihood of deployment of even the modest force for Congo
looks very distant. And even as the House approved a trade bill
granting new trading privileges to Africa, there are some doubts
whether many African countries have the economic capacity to take
advantage of it. The fact remains that sub-Saharan Africa is so
poor, that McDonald's cannot find enough of a customer base to open
one outlet in even one nation. By Jane Perlez. (Moving in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A tempest is brewing in
Washington, all because of an 11-inch blond bombshell. Mattel, in
association with two nonprofit women's groups, recently announced
plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll. Almost immediately the
protests sounded. But why shouldn't American children learn about
civics and the virtues of public service via their favorite
playthings? By Bruce Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   SWORD&AMP;SANDAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ To mark the opening of
``Gladiator'' and the passing of Hercules actor Steve Reeves,
earlier sword-and-sandal epics are recalled for their memorable
utterances. It didn't matter whether the plots were derived from
the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of ancient Rome _ or, more
typically, some unholy mixture of the three. The dialogue
frequently managed to range from the ponderous to the purple, and
sometimes to the preposterous.

A TOAST TO MOTHERS EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much do I love you, Mom? Let me count the wines
</P>
<P>
   Syrah is for your power and strength. When you said, ``Be home
by 10 p.m.,'' you meant it.
</P>
<P>
   Pinot noir is for your elegance and style; ``classy'' is the one
word to describe you, Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Italian reds are for your passionate streak that includes
everything from endless hugs to occasional ``Wait until your father
gets home'' threats.
</P>
<P>
   Viognier is for your delicate, feminine side _ bubble baths and
shopping excursions with your daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay is for your practical, dependable qualities. All
those diapers you've changed have to count for something.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, champagne is for your effervescence and wit. And just
because there's nothing better than bubbly to raise a glass in your
honor!
</P>
<P>
   How much do you love your mom? What about the mother of your
children?
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not a guilt trip but rather a reminder _ with Mother's
Day right around the corner on Sunday, May 14 _ that it's time to
think about a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers are one way to go, clothes or jewelry another, but what
better way to say ``I love you'' than with a bottle of wine? Here
are some suggestions, with approximate retail prices, for an
oenological ode to Mom:

   Editors at publications outside the United States may find the
following stories from the New York Times News Service that are
scheduled for release on  &UR; SUNDAY, MAY 7, &LR;  of particular interest.
We plan to move these stories by 2 p.m. EST on Saturday, May 6.
</P>
<P>
   Please note that some of these stories are tentative and may be
held for space or other reasons. For updates please consult these
weekend budgets: SUNDAY-UPDATE-BUDGET, STYLE-BUDGET, SUNBIZ-BUDGET
and REVIEW-BUDGET.

<P>
   &UR; MONEY AND BUSINESS &LR;  (Will move in `f' category)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-PRIVACY (Undated) _ There has been no shortage of
discussion about how the Internet is stripping consumers of what
thin veil of privacy they have left in this world of credit bureaus
and supermarket scanners. But lost in this debate is just how
ineffective most of these data-gathering systems have been. So far,
no one has been able to make a big business out of being Big
Brother. By Saul Hansell. (With graphic)
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-GOLD (Undated) _ A leading historian of the American West
finds the roots of the dot.com investing boom, and bust, in other
get-rich-quick rushes to find gold and oil. By Patricia Nelson
Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   CONTRARY-VIEW-GLOBAL (Undated) _ On the Contrary Column:
Protesters decry globalization, the process whereby dastardly
capitalists provide paying jobs to starving Third Worlders who were
previously without hope. But their choice of targets is puzzling:
they vent spleen at the World Bank and the IMF while letting
another crucial agency of globalization _ the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service _ off scot-free. By Daniel Akst.
</P>

   HAMLET-FILM (Undated) _ Given the story's familiarity, it seemed
altogether natural to locate a new ``Hamlet'' in the immediate
present, to translate the Danish kingdom into a multimedia
corporation, and to watch the story unfold in penthouse hotel
rooms, sky-level office corridors, a coffee shop, an airplane, the
Guggenheim Museum. Director Michael Almereyda discusses his
decision to bring Hamlet into the 21st century.

<P>
   FAMILY-REUNION-THEATER (London) _ T.S. Eliot's ``Family
Reunion'' has risen greatly in critical esteem since it flopped in
the West End 60-odd years ago. Many now regard the poet's story of
the English lord impelled by updated Furies to atone for his wife's
dark death as the nearest to a theatrical masterpiece Eliot ever
wrote. New Yorkers will make up their own minds when the Royal
Shakespeare Company's revival opens on Wednesday. By Benedict
Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   (This story has moved)
</P>
<P>
   ORESTEIA-THEATER (Undated) _ Murder. Adultery. Courtroom drama.
A fugitive's hair-raising flight from implacable justice. With
super-heated elements like these to work with, it's no wonder
modern playwrights keep rewriting Aeschylus' ``Oresteia,'' the
fifth-century B.C. dramatic trilogy about a family ensnared in
guilt and violence. By Celia Wren.

<P>
   BEETHOVEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ When in the course of human events,
musicians feel impelled to declare to the world and to themselves
the highest ideals of which the individual and humanity are
capable, the composer to whom they are most apt to turn is
Beethoven. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

   ABT-DANCE (New York) _ With the turn of the millennium, American
Ballet Theater moved into overdrive on its new production of ``Swan
Lake.'' The production will have its New York premiere at the
Metropolitan Opera House on May 19 and is expected to be the
blockbuster of the company's 60th-anniversary season, which opens
with a gala performance May 8 and runs through July 1. By Iris
Fanger.

<P>
   SCHWARTZ-PHOTOGRAPHY (New York) _ When he saw a camera obscura
on the roof of a private museum in Kyoto in 1991, Charles Schwartz
knew he had to have one. So now, poking through the roof of his
staid apartment building on the Upper East Side, is a jaunty,
medieval-looking turret that holds the telescopic lens and mirror
of what surely is the only camera obscura of its size in Manhattan,
and one of the very few private devices of its kind in the world.
By Grace Glueck.

<P>
   PARIS-COMMUNE-ART (Paris) _ The Paris Commune of 1871 is one of
those smoldering ruins in French history. As the first news event
in French history covered by photographers, the Commune and its
aftermath also left a unique visual record, as a compelling new
exhibition at the Musee d'Orsay, on view until June 11, makes
clear. By Richard C. Woodward.

   &UR; STYLES &LR;  (Will move in `l' category)
</P>
<P>
   FRAGRANCE-BOUTIQUES (Undated) _ While customization has proved
popular recently in everything from suits to ice cream, it is
taking off in the top tiers of the fragrance industry. Creed, the
very upscale European fragrance house, offers custom scents at
Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus. On the West
Coast there are a growing number of fragrance boutiques like Lather
in Pasadena and Homebody in Los Angeles that blend custom scents
for clients like K.D. Lang. By Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   FASHION-COPY-EDITORS (New York) _ Being a copy editor at a
women's fashion magazine _ and a male to boot _ is a little like
being the non-drinking, designated driver: you're around people
having a lot of fun, but you're not allowed to imbibe. Your job is
to make sure the semicolons are right; you don't get to pick up the
phone and trill ``Daaahling'' or air-kiss the French photographers
when they come in with their portfolios. By Ethan Hauser.

FARM SEIZURES, VIOLENCE CONTINUE TO ESCALATE IN ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Monday: 18 farms seized. Tuesday: 18 farms.
Wednesday: 32 farms. Thursday: 15 farms, maybe more. Friday, Farm
representatives were still reckoning the latest seizures at day's
end.
</P>
<P>
   As Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe this week brushed off the
growing international pressure to halt a 10-week campaign against
white-owned commercial farms, his supporters picked up the pace of
their murderous land grab, seizing new tracts at an increasing
rate.
</P>
<P>
   At least 18 people have been killed and thousands of farm
workers have been badly beaten, often repeatedly, since veterans of
Zimbabwe's war of liberation and other Mugabe supporters began
raiding white farms 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned by the rising violence, white farm representatives
petitioned the High Court Friday to postpone sentencing the leader
of the liberation war veterans, the group behind the farm
invasions, on contempt charges. Blocked by the violence from
working their fields, farmers are losing the window to plant winter
wheat, and they feared the sentencing would only stoke the crisis
at a critical moment in the crop cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the conciliatory tone farmers have tried to maintain
since the attacks began two months ago, the deputy director of the
Commercial Farmers' Union publicly accused Chenjerai Hunzi, the
veterans leader charged two weeks ago with failing to comply with
court orders to end the land grab, of breaking promises to contain
his followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any agreements that we strike with Mr. Hunzvi . . . are
absolutely meaningless,'' Jerry Grant told a group of businessmen
in Harare Friday, describing the situation on the farms as ``total
anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though nominally about land, the attacks have become
increasingly political. The self-styled veterans have accused
Mugabe's political opponents, including white farmers and the
fledgling Movement for Democratic Change, of obstructing land
reform by defeating a draft constitution that would have allowed
the government to seize land without compensating owners. Voters
rejected the document in a nationwide referendum in February.
</P>
<P>
   Land remains the most volatile issue in Zimbabwe. In the 1970s,
blacks fought a bush war against white-ruled Rhodesia, as the
country was called then, to recover land stolen from their
ancestors by British colonialists a century ago. Two decades after
independence, most of the prime agricultural land remains in the
hands of a small community of white farmers, while most rural
blacks subsist on marginal plots owned by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, facing the first serious challenge to his 20-year rule
as the new opposition taps frustration over economic decline and
high joblessness, has encouraged the war veterans to seize land
from whites. He has vowed to take half of the 31 million acres of
white commercial farmland and has given financial backing to the
war veterans' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Farm representatives say pro-government mobs have invaded nearly
1,200 farms in two months and have occupied 760. Despite earlier
assurances to the contrary, Hunzvi emerged from the courthouse
Friday vowing to continue the invasions. The court now plans to
sentence him on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis poses a serious dilemma for regional leaders, some of
whom face similar land imbalances in their own countries and whose
economies have been shaken by the unrest in Zimbabwe. Appearing
with Mugabe in the southern Zimbabwean town of Bulawayo Friday,
South African President Thabo Mbeki publicly urged his counterpart
to seek a ``cooperative and non-confrontational'' solution on the
land issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, who two weeks ago offered Mugabe a Western-backed
economic bailout if he ended the farm attacks and organized the
upcoming elections, broke weeks of public silence on Zimbabwe after
drawing indirect public criticism from his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour-long meeting in London on Wednesday with Nelson
Mandela of South Africa, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the
former South African president backed Britain's strong condemnation
of the violence and that ``Mbeki had a key role to play in contact
with Harare.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's economy has felt sharp economic tremors in recent
weeks, with its banking sector warning of ``Zimbabwean contagion''
as the crisis undermined investor confidence and helped sink the
rand to record lows against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first nationwide address since taking office last
June, Mbeki blamed the media for failing to report accurately the
diplomatic efforts he has made to help stabilize Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government,'' he said, ``will work persistently and
without making the noise of empty drums to help the sister people
of Zimbabwe to find a just and lasting solution to the real and
pressing land question in their country.''

 &HT;    Fusaichi Pegasus odds on favorite
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Early odds of 9-5 say Fusaichi Pegasus will
prove that you get what you pay for at the horse sales. Undefeated
this year in four races, the colt that brought $4 million at
auction is favored to win the 126th Kentucky Derby today against 18
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pegram is not convinced you can buy a Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't a science,'' said Pegram. ``A plus B does not always
equal C.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years before he won the 1998 Derby for Pegram, Real Quiet
was sold for $17,000. At the same stage in his career, 1997 winner
Silver Charm went for $16,500. Less than four months before he won
the 1999 Derby, Charismatic could have been taken with a claiming
slip for $62,500.
</P>
<P>
   At the race track, this is called The Cinderella Factor. For
three straight years, bargain horses have been the stars of The
Kentucky Derby Ball, an embarassment to their peers with far more
expensive price tags.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this conduct considered more unorthodox than in
Kentucky, where thoroughbred auction sales are based on the idea
that breeding is everything. Good papas and good mamas and good
looks keep the market price rising. When a faster horse from the
wrong side of the track comes along, that is an argument against
bids that go over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Fusaichi Pegasus fails today to uphold the theory that top
auction prices produce top records, perhaps High Yield will
represent the blockbluster price tags in the winner's circle. He
cost $1,050,000 before he was turned over to Wayne Lukas for
training. In his last two races, High Yield has been a strong
finisher, second in the Florida Derby and first in the Blue Grass
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pay high prices for a horse, you get a lot of pedigree,
and I think pedigree is important,'' said Lukas. ``But even if you
pay more than $1 million for a horse, like we did for High Yield,
once you get to running and being tested, you have to go on what
you see in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That price tag is not going to help you a bit when you are a
quarter-mile from the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of Derby entries with a bargain sales history
ready to extend The Cinderella Streak.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among these is The Deputy, purchased in Ireland by
Barry Irwin, president of Team Valor. Irwin won't say how much the
Santa Anita Derby winner cost, but surely it was far less than
$100,000. The colt is likely to be the second betting choice today,
with High Yield third.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy's family tree is without promise. His father needed
five races to win for the first time and finished first just twice,
both in short races. His mother did not win in seven races. But in
four races in the United States, Irwin's horse lost just once, by
less than a length to Fusaich Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy has earned new support because of his Churchill Downs
practices and so has Captain Steve, the prospect purchased by
Pegram two years ago to be sent to Bob Baffert, who trained Real
Quiet. The cost was $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Baffert has plenty of high-priced stock, he claims to feel
more comfortable among the inexpensive Derby challengers. Baffrt
saw Fusaichi Pegasus at the auction sales. ``I said that he looked
great. I said he would go for a lot of money. Then I said for them
to take me to look at the $70,000 horses.''
</P>
<P>
   History will be made at the first Derby of the new century and
more history can be made.
</P>
<P>
   On Curule, at 50-1 odds, Marlon St. Julien, who rides in
Louisiana, Texas and the Midwest, will become the first black
jockey to ride in the Derby since 1921.
</P>
<P>
   With The Deputy, Jenine Sahadi can become the first woman
trainer ever to win the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   And if Fusaichi Pegasus ends The Cinderalla Streak, he will be
the first favorite to win the race since 1979.

THE NEW SHEEN OF MUNICIPAL BONDS

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every so often, most strikingly when Congress gets agitated
about the nation's tax structure, the market for municipal bonds
sags, driving yields to lip-smacking levels. Challenges to the
bonds' tax-exempt status typically loom much larger in investors'
eyes than a possible benefit from the scarcity that would be
created by action in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, returns on municipals have been elevated by
economic fundamentals _ mainly the necessity of competing with the
stock market and the near certainty that interest rates _ already
raised five times by the Federal Reserve since mid-1999 _ will
climb even further.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's budget surplus, meanwhile, is shrinking
the supply of Treasury bonds even as growing numbers of refugees
from stock-market gyrations are seeking a haven; both forces are
driving down returns on Treasury debt.
</P>
<P>
   A result is the unusual situation of long-term municipal bonds
that pay tax-free interest yielding just as much, or even a bit
more, than taxable Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term munis and long Treasuries are basically yielding the
same thing,'' said William Hornbarger, fixed-income strategist at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. For many investors, he added,
``that's a no-brainer'' situation.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, no municipality or other tax-exempt issuer matches
the United States Treasury for credit quality, but the difference
is less than many investors imagine. In fact, roughly half of
municipals carry insurance, making credit comparisons of little
practical consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Until about a year ago, according to Alexandra Lebenthal,
president of a family-owned New York firm that specializes in
municipal bonds, municipals were considered attractive when
long-term yields as measured by the Bond Buyer's Index reached 85
percent of those on Treasury bonds. Now, with the ratio above 90
percent for the highest-quality debt and approaching 100 percent
for lesser but still investment-quality bonds, ``it's a fantastic
time for the individual'' buyer to scoop up tax-exempts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a recently marketed New York State Dormitory
Authority issue rated Baa-1 and BBB+ yields about 6 percent in a
maturity as short as 10 years. That return is equivalent to a
taxable investment generating 9.34 percent for a New York resident
earning $150,000 and filing a joint return. Ten-year triple-A bonds
yield 5.25 percent, equal to a taxable 8.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, though, don't bother with fancy calculations even
when sophisticated, state-specific translation tables are
available, like the one at the Bond Market Association's Web site,
investinginbonds.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual investor looks at absolute yield,'' said Dan
Keating, a senior managing director at Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   A 6 percent coupon is ``magic,'' Lebenthal added.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, quality ``has probably never been better,'' according
to a study by Merrill Lynch, whose analysts found that upgrades by
rating agencies have far exceeded downgrades for the last four
years as city, state and authority budgets improved, with the best
performance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds had
substantial outflows in the second half of last year _ aggravated
by redemptions to establish losses for tax savings, of all things _
specialists say the appeal of municipal bonds is broadening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just 70-year-old people'' any longer, said Jane
Trust, who runs four tax-exempt funds for Legg Mason Trust in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Hornbarger concurred, pointing to stock-market and
entrepreneurial profits being redirected to the tax-free market.
``We're seeing more and more younger people in their 30s and 40s,''
he said. ``It's part of their asset allocation strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   And municipals have become easier to buy, with many state and
local issuers insisting on a special retail order period to give
individuals first crack at bonds. Moreover, increasing competition
has sharply cut insurance premiums, reducing the cost to 10 or 15
basis points (or $1 to $1.50 per $1,000), from 40 or 50 a decade
ago. The savings have mostly been passed on to investors in the
form of higher yields.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another attraction of munis is their ability to provide
portfolio ballast when stocks are in turmoil. ``Their volatility is
significantly lower _ that is the real edge to municipals,'' said
Michael Shamosh, chief fixed-income strategist for Tucker Anthony
Inc. Throughout financial history, he said, munis swing only
one-fourth as widely as stocks and half as widely as Treasury
bonds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what is' the smart strategy, given that most analysts expect
the Federal Reserve to keep tightening the monetary screws at least
through midyear, a trend that overwhelms the downward pressure on
rates from a shrinking supply of new bonds?
</P>
<P>
   Most experts suggest deferring purchases of longer-term bonds
and buying only those that come due fairly soon, say within a year
or two but perhaps in as little as a few weeks or months. The idea
is to preserve the chance to reinvest at progressively higher rates
rather than being locked into current levels.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much to persuade most investors of the wisdom of
that approach, since the municipal yield curve _ the progression of
rates through the maturity spectrum _ provides relatively little
extra payment for lengthening one's commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the short term if you have to put money to work,''
Keating said. ``I'd stay within one to five years' maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shamosh takes a different view. ``You want to get out of the
Fed's reach,'' he said. This suggests buying maturities that are
affected relatively little by the Fed's rate increases, those due,
say, between 6 and 20 years, in the conviction that the central
bank will eventually succeed in slowing down the economy. This, in
turn, would reassure the market that inflation _ the worry of
long-term investors _ will be kept in check.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should always have some short-term investments for
liquidity, Shamosh said, but longer-term munis are what should be
added to a sensible person's portfolio. ``The Fed,'' he said,
``doesn't have any control over the long rates, which could come
down,'' enhancing the value of such bonds.

ALL EYES ON PEGASUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Neil Drysdale, who was born in Great Britain,
schooled at the University of Barcelona, and once taught English,
is unfailingly polite. Unfortunately, the Kentucky Derby favorite
he trains is not.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus is 9-5 in the morning line for the 126th Run
for the Roses at Churchill Downs. Many are impressed with the
handsome son of Mr. Prospector. However, he is temperamental, given
to refusing to move or bucking like a bronco during workouts and
gallops. How he'll do in the paddock, or on the way to the gate
before the Derby throng, which numbered 151,051 last year, remains
to be seen. If he runs his race before the starting gate opens, the
chalk players are in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fusaichi Pegasus has been very, very good on race day,'' said
Drysdale, 52, who was named to the Hall of Fame Tuesday. ``I expect
him to be good, even with 150,000 people there.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 26, Fusaichi Pegasus caused a stir at Churchill by
tossing his exercise rider, then falling over on his hip. As it
turned out, there were no injuries but it was a heart-stopping
moment. ``The exercise riders know not to interfere with him,''
said Drysdale. ``If he wants to play, we let him. We'll live with
that. I've warned them that he might flare up. Because a lot of
focus is on him, I think there might be hyperbole. I realize the
press has to focus on something. But he's never done anything
unprofessional in a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a mean horse. I've had mean horses, like Labeeb (a
former star on turf). One time, I told the jockey for a race in
California not to hit him. The rider hit him in the stretch, and
Labeeb threw him to New York. Fusaichi Pegasus is not going to be a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A trainer who uses the word ``hyperbole'' is unusual enough, but
the fact that Drysdale has remained so calm while training a heavy
Derby favorite is even more remarkable. It also appears Drysdale is
unconcerned that, at $4 million, Fusaichi Pegasus was the sale
topper at the 1998 Keeneland July yearling sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which horse is the favorite is not important to me,'' said
Drysdale. ``It is relative to people who gamble, and I don't bet. I
was at the sale when Fusaichi Pegasus was sold and, as with
everybody else, I was very impressed with him. But the sales price
doesn't enter into the equation at the level that I work. I do the
best I can. I don't wake up in the morning and say: `Oh, no! I
train a $4 million horse.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus has the speed and the looks. He lost his only
race at age 2, by a neck at Hollywood Park. This year, he is 4 for
4 _ a maiden win, an allowance win, a win in the San Felipe Stakes,
all at Santa Anita, then the big score in the Wood Memorial at
Aqueduct April 15, the race that brought him to prominence.
</P>
<P>
   But before Fusaichi Pegasus caught the eye of the racing world,
he first caught the eye of Fusao Sekiguchi, his owner. Sekiguchi, a
venture capitalist, has owned horses for 20 years in Japan. When he
saw Fusaichi Pegasus, Sekiguchi refused to be outbid. ``I would
have gone to $5 million,'' he said. ``This was the only horse we
were interested in. My first impression when I saw him was an
inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi often gives his horses the first name of ``Fusaichi,''
which combines part of his first name with ``ichi,'' which means
``the best'' in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale has trained five champions (Princess Rooney, Tasso,
A.P. Indy, Hollywood Wildcat, and Fiji), but he has never saddled a
Derby starter. In 1992, A.P. Indy, who had won the Santa Anita
Derby, suffered a quartercrack (a tear in the wall of the hoof)
that was discovered the day before the Derby. He was scratched the
day of the Derby, went on to win the Belmont Stakes and Breeders'
Cup Classic, and became Horse of the Year. The last trainer to win
a Derby without having saddled a previous starter was Carl Nafzger,
who conditioned Unbridled in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a black and white decision to scratch A.P. Indy,'' said
Drysdale. ``He had a blind (hidden) quartercrack and we couldn't
locate it. It took three or four days to find it. He went off on
Friday afternoon. When he came out for his afternoon walk, he was
not happy, and the foot was carrying heat. There was just no other
decision to make. My thoughts were on how to get to the Belmont. We
want to look forward. When he won the Belmont, I was glad that his
form had been confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale has two chances to win Derby 2000. Although he is
deeply hidden in the shadow of Fusaichi Pegasus, War Chant, owned
by Irving and Marjorie Cowan of Florida, is a very nice colt. The
son of Danzig has won three of four starts, losing only when he
finished second to The Deputy in the Santa Anita Derby April 8. War
Chant is 6-1 in the morning line, will race for the first time with
blinders, and is a serious contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is not to fantasize about winning,'' said Drysdale.
``My job is to get the bloody horse over to the gate. Fusaichi
Pegasus could get in a trap, or he could be bumped around. Lord
knows that things can happen. But Fusaichi Pegasus can turn it on
and off in a race, he did so in the Wood. He's tractable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fusaichi Pegasus and War Chant must answer the distance
question _ but so must the other 17 entrants. And the fact that
both are so lightly raced could pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come here with two talented horses,'' said Drysdale. ``I
feel that if I have a choice between experience and talent, I
prefer to have talent.''

IN A SEARCH FOR HOT WHEELS, BUYERS HIT A DEAD END 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By MICHELINE MAYNARD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Robert Forester watched his dealer pull up in a black
Chrysler PT Cruiser to take him for a test drive, he decided on the
spot that the retro-looking small van would join his family's
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in that PT Cruiser and fell in love,'' said Forester,
who works for a printing and stationery business in Henderson,
Texas, 150 miles east of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But two months after he ordered a red one with automatic
transmission and tinted moonroof for his mother, Jean, it still has
not arrived. In fact, it has not even been built, and Chrysler
representatives could not tell him when it would be.
</P>
<P>
   With auto sales booming along with the economy, consumers who
want the hottest vehicles are struggling to find the unfindable,
which this spring includes eye-catchers like the PT Cruiser and the
Toyota MR2 Spyder sports car, the highly rated Honda Odyssey
minivan, and luxury vehicles like the BMW X5 sport utility and
Mercedes S-Class sedans. Orders like Forester's go on waiting lists
and languish for months.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, it can be impossible even to find a vehicle to
inspect in the showroom, because dealers are selling every one that
comes in. Honda dealers on Long Island are telling customers who
want to test-drive an Odyssey that they must first order one, put
down a deposit, and then wait for it to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   In response, many consumers find that they must alter their
tactics, searching by phone over wide areas for dealerships that
have a car on the lot. A growing number of people are turning to
the Internet, combing dealer sites, omnibus shopping sites like
Autobytel and Microsoft's Carpoint, and even auction sites like
eBay for leads.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking down a hot car is one thing; taking title is another.
Joel Manby, a former executive with Saab and Saturn who is now
president of Greenlight.com, a car-buying site, estimated that half
of all buyers use the Internet to research or find vehicles, but
that only one in 20 concludes a deal online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also tends to lengthen the lines at the dealers who
have hot cars on hand. Corky Jones, Internet sales manager for
Covington Pike Chrysler in Memphis, said his dealership had 103
orders for PT Cruisers from people as far away as Ohio, Illinois
and Texas. In one hour on Wednesday, six people came into the
showroom to see the vehicle, with its vaguely 1930s front end; they
were told that new orders would be filled in December.
</P>
<P>
   Jones likened the demand to the frenzy last year over
Volkswagen's New Beetle, which remains in short supply in some
parts of the country. But he is enjoying the clamor. ``Just once in
your life, you want to sell something that is so popular you have
people lining up for it,'' he said. ``It's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   On the wall in Covington Pike's showroom is an ever-lengthening
list of buyers who have put down $500 deposits. James Alexander, a
mechanic from Mason, Tenn., who went on the list in February, just
got his PT. ``It's a joy to drive,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having no bargaining leverage on such a hot vehicle,
Alexander got his for the sticker price, about $20,000 with
options, because Covington Pike has decided not to charge a
premium. ``That wouldn't be fair to the customer,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   But other dealers feel differently. Last week, anyone willing to
pay $24,999 _ $5,000 above list _ could drive home that day in the
dark blue PT Cruiser on the showroom floor at Village Chrysler-Jeep
in Royal Oak, Mich. Village's new-car sales manager, Jeff Radke,
said it had been bought used with a few hundred miles on the
odometer; his waiting list for new ones numbers 60.
</P>
<P>
   And the dealership is not guaranteeing what the final price will
be on those, he said, leaving open the possibility that it will
tack on a premium if demand stays strong. And if customers balk?
``If they don't want it, they can cancel,'' he said. ``It's up to
them.''
</P>

   Some dealers are looking to maximize profits on scarce vehicles
by auctioning them online. Blouin Truck Center of Augusta, Me.,
posted a dark red PT Cruiser on eBay last week, seeking an opening
bid of $19,990, or $2,400 above list. ``It's a variation on what
the market will bear,'' said Mike Linkenbach, the dealership's
manager. ``This is a unique vehicle. This isn't like a Dodge Neon
that they build every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rossi, vice president for global communications at
DaimlerChrysler, said such markups were isolated. ``You've heard a
handful of stories,'' he said. ``What you haven't heard are the
10,000 positive experiences, people who went through the process,
placed an order and got their vehicles.'' Chrysler dealers
delivered 8,325 PT Cruisers in April, he said, and have about
79,000 more on order.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the X5, its first sport utility, in December, BMW
found itself in the catbird seat. Jack Pitney, a spokesman, said,
``We're in an enviable position where demand far outweighs
supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Too far, in fact. The first year's production is sold out, and
dealers are not yet allowed to take orders for 2001 models. For
now, the only way to get one is to buy it used; an X5 with 4,700
miles was on eBay last week at a minimum bid of $49,100, just $800
below its base price when new.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, with Toyota's new MR2, a two-seat sports car whose
production was limited to generate buzz with consumers: all 7,425
available this year are spoken for, the company said. And at Betten
Imports in Grand Rapids, Mich., the back-order time for the latest
Mercedes S-Class cars, which start at around $80,000, is up to a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Odyssey has no such cachet; its attractions are Honda's
reputation for quality and raves in the consumer press. Joseph
Phillippi, automotive analyst at PaineWebber, observed, ``It's a
Honda _ enough said.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced more than a year ago, the Odyssey is still scarce,
even though Honda is making as many as it can. ``Most dealers only
have one or two,'' said Michael Luckey, an automotive consultant
who shopped for an Odyssey in Pompton Plains, N.J. Manby of
Greenlight.com, which matches potential buyers with 1,000
participating dealers, said it ``is tough to find anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the toughest of all, for now, is BMW's Z8 sports car,
featured in ``The World Is Not Enough,'' last year's James Bond
thriller. The car went on sale only last Monday, but all 400 to be
sold in the United States have already been allotted to buyers who
ordered them up to a year ago, when the Z8 began appearing in
European car magazines. An Internet search last week found none on
auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, ``the advice I can give any customer is
basically, `Get to your dealer early,''' said Steven Sturm, vice
president for marketing at Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   What will be the next hot car? Analysts mention the Audi TT
Roadster and the new Thunderbird that Ford is planning for next
spring. Jeff Leckta, Internet Services Manager at Betten Imports,
cites the convertible New Beetle. Though Volkswagen told dealers
not to expect the car until the fall of 2001, he said, ``I already
have orders.''

DERBY WAGERING REQUIRES IMAGINATION, COURAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It would be nice to bet on the Kentucky Derby
with Confederate money, enough to cover the wagering possibilities
without risking much.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Confederate money has not been worth much here since Union
generals Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman met at the
Galt House hotel in downtown Louisville in 1864 to discuss the
strategy of how Sherman could best light up Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   So, only real money is accepted at the endless number of
``windows'' at Churchill Downs that seldom are closed on the
weekend of the Kentucky Derby. Change is given at these windows,
but not information.
</P>
<P>
   With no desire to waste real money and with a real desire to
impart information, here are some ways to approach wagering on this
most-competitive 126th Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   1. Betting on The Prettiest Horse: It is possible, especially
here in horse-crazy Kentucky, for the mere sight of a horse to take
one's breath away. If a beauty contest were held, the two top
contenders would be War Chant and Fusaichi Pegasus, two animals
that are absolutely gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus is such a perfect specimen that you're wowed by
a mere glance at the colt. If you like to bet on the prettiest
horse, go with Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   2. Betting on a horse's name: Many, many contenders here. Only
one guess, for example, where Impeachment last raced before coming
to Louisville (the Arkansas Derby). For you football fans, you
elderly football fans, that is, Trippi is named after Charlie
Trippi, the legendary running back from the University of Georgia
in the 1940s and later with the Chicago Cardinals. Trippi (the
horse) was sired by End Sweep to carry on the football analogy, but
it is unsure whether Trippi (the horse) can run any further than
Trippi (the elderly football player). &UR;  &LR; Today.
</P>
<P>
   The most touching name, especially for policemen, is Captain
Steve, trained by fun-loving Bob Baffert and owned by even more
fun-loving Mike Pegram. It seems that when the Baffert-trained
Silver Charm won the 1997 Derby, paying $10, Baffert and Pegram had
bet oodles and oodles and won boodles and boodles of money.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram packed the boodles of money into his bag, which also
contained a .357 Magnum. Pegram was stopped at the airport gate and
was arrested when authorities put two and two together _ namely
boodles of money with a .357 Magnum equals one drug dealer.Only the
intervention of Louisville Police Capt. Steve Thompson, a friend of
the fun-loving Baffert crowd, saved good ole boy Pegram from many a
long night in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Even more touching is Hal's Hope, named by 88-year-old trainer
Harold Rose after himself. Rose has never had a Kentucky Derby
winner, but the mere prospects of training Hal's Hope enabled Rose
to leap out of a hospital bed after bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   For the intellectuals, there is Curule, a Latin word for a seat
or throne reserved for the highest dignitaries. The occult-obsessed
can claim Deputy Warlock, whose connections have named their horses
from the deepest corners of the Twilight Zone, such as Obeah, Go
for Wand, and Witching Hour. Bet on your favorite name.
</P>
<P>
   3. Betting on the politically correct: A sure thing _ The
Deputy, who is trained by Jenine Sahadi. No horse trained by a
woman has ever won the Derby, but Sahadi has an excellent chance.
Even more of a sure thing for the yuppie crowd, Sahadi is the only
trainer to spike her horse's feed with wine. Second choice: Curule,
whose jockey is African-American Marlon St. Julien. No black jockey
has won the Derby in 98 years.
</P>
<P>
   4. Betting on the jockey: Only five of the 19 jockeys have ever
won a Derby (Jerry Bailey, Chris McCarron, Pat Day, Craig Perret,
and Kent Desormeaux) and, of those five, only Bailey has won as
many as two. So, many a jockey is going to make many a wrong move
as they wilt under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But a favorite, especially of the car-wash set, is Roger Velez,
the jockey on Hal's Hope, who likes to relieve the pressure of big
races by going to a car wash and helping to towel down a few cars
before heading to the track. So bet on your favorite jockey.
</P>
<P>
   5: Betting out of spite: Americans have long been suckers for
the Sky-is-Falling and the End-is-Near crowd, usually of a
religious variety. But lately the doomsayers have been
environmentalists (global warming), and last year it was the
computer crowd (the Y2K bug). Few doomsayers have made as much
money off so many gullible Americans as Satanish Sanan, whose Y2K
software raked in untold millions as Jan. 1, 2000, came and went
with barely a blip.
</P>
<P>
   Sanan, though, had not made so much money doomsaying that he was
willing to bid a penny more than $4 million for a Mr. Prospector
yearling that eventually was bought by a Japanese businesman. That
colt, of course, was Fusaichi Pegasus. So the wager for all those
who despise doomsayers is Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   6. Betting on horses chosen after 64 straight hours of
handicapping: Some believe this is the more
intellectually-responsible way to analyze a horse race than merely
picking a winner by name, color, or jockey's silks. Alas, the
percentage of winners chosen in this responsible manner often does
not top the percentage of those merely choosing by name.
Nevertheless . . .
</P>
<P>
   One secret to handicapping is to eliminate horses with no
chance. In early betting at Churchill Downs Friday, the four-horse
entry of Trippi, Commendable, Impeachment, and High Yield was made
the 3-to-1 favorite. Not one of those horses has a chance to make
the board, especially High Yield, a speed ball starting from post
position 17.
</P>
<P>
   Another secret to handicapping is deciding what to do with the
favorite. When the horses are put into the starting gate, Fusaichi
Pegasus will be the strong favorite at 8-to-5 or so, and a decision
must be made about this extremely good horse.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where Chaos Theory enters, as many unexpected events are
going to happen when 19 horses mount their calvary charge for two
minutes. It is possible, if not likely, that Chaos will envelop the
favorite and his jockey, Desormeaux, who is not the most dependable
under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves us with the winner, Irish-bred The Deputy. There is
tremendous early speed in this race from four or five horses and a
closer will win it. Sahadi is a master in having her horses primed
for big races, and The Deputy looks very ready to make a winning
closing kick under his dependable jockey, McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   It seems probable that Fusaichi Pegasus has to finish second or
third. But if he runs into traffic trouble, which is sure to hinder
some horses, look for one of the horses in the mutuel field, either
Wheelaway or Deputy Warlock, to make the board. Captain Steve and
More Than Ready also can finish second or third.
</P>
<P>
   The Final Play: The Deputy to win, with Wheelaway or Fusiachi
Pegasus second in your perfecta (betting horses to finish first and
second in order), and those two horses with Captain Steve and
Deputy Warlock third in your trifecta combinations (picking the top
3 in order).

TWO FACES OF BEAUTY: TIMELESS AND TIMELY 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was once a time, says the cultural historian Sander
Gilman, when Irishmen had their noses surgically altered to look
more like Englishmen so they could seem more American. Later many
Jews had their noses surgically altered to look more like Irishmen
so they could seem more American. Such are the knotty ways in which
different cultures pursue visions of beauty, proclaiming timeless
ideals while succumbing to the tastes of their time and place.
</P>
<P>
   In even more knotty ways, contemporary culture is doing the same
thing. As an ideal, beauty has been taking quite a beating. It has
been viewed as an ideology that is as culture bound as the taste
and distaste for Irish noses. It has come to seem irrelevant to
artworks preoccupied with race and gender. And claims for its
superiority and moral stature have been beaten down by the memories
of artistic mastery cohabiting with evil in regimes like the
Nazis'. So beauty is often treated as merely a matter of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Yet during the last 10 years or so, there has also been a
movement in the other direction. The philosopher and classicist
Alexander Nehamas has suggested that beauty is once again becoming
an academic obsession as philosophers and critics resuscitate the
beautiful as an ideal, recasting old philosophical arguments and
forecasting new variants.
</P>
<P>
   These two opposing perspectives have led to a tense mixture of
politics and aesthetics, reflected in recent books reinterpreting
beauty. Four of their authors gathered under the auspices of the
Vera List Center at the New School for Social Research on Wednesday
night to discuss their views. They included Gilman, a professor at
the University of Chicago; Nehamas, a professor of philosophy and
comparative literature at Princeton; Elaine Scarry, a professor of
aesthetics at Harvard and Jed Perl, the art critic for the New
Republic. (Full disclosure: this writer moderated the discussion).
</P>
<P>
   In Gilman's view, much evil has been caused in the name of
beauty. His book, ``Making the Body Beautiful: A Cultural History
of Aesthetic Surgery,'' (Princeton, 1999) portrays the quest for
physical beauty as an ugly human epic. He tells how flesh and fat
and lids and lobes have been cut from bodies and faces to modify
ethnic and racial characteristics and create new identities. While
cosmetic surgery allows each person to be sculptured into a version
of an ideal, that ideal is itself politically constructed and is
meant to exclude as much as refine. Surgery can seem to confer
power, he said on the panel, adding, ``I can be anyone I want to be
because I can control who I am.'' But it also creates servitude to
notions of beauty that are no more than ``a reflex of the culture
in which we live.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``On Beauty and Being Just'' (Princeton, 1999), Scarry also
attends to the political aspects of beauty but invokes them in
beauty's defense. One of the reasons beauty has been eclipsed in
recent decades, she argues, is that it has been considered
politically harmful. Beauty is criticized for being a distraction,
opium for the elites as well as the masses. What's more it has been
perceived as inherently oppressive, most evidently in what has been
called the ``male gaze'' that treats women as objects.
</P>
<P>
   But this argument, she says, is all wrong. The beautiful is life
restoring, not imprisoning. It serves as a muse of sorts, inspiring
the viewer to give birth to other beautiful objects created in
homage: paintings, poems, sculptures. And far from distracting from
justice, beauty does just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   It teaches a kind of fairness _ the fairness of balance and
symmetry. This sense of fairness, Scarry suggests, is precisely the
quality that defines justice. She invokes the philosopher John
Rawls, whose vision of justice is of a ``symmetry of everyone's
relations to each other.'' So while in Gilman's view beauty can
deform justice, in Scarry's, beauty leads to it. Beauty is
politically beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Nehamas is more reluctant to generalize. In ``The Art of
Living'' (California, 1998), he argued that the philosophical quest
for a worthwhile life does not involve the application of universal
principles; each life is given shape in a particular and
idiosyncratic manner. On the panel Nehamas gave a glimpse of some
of the similar arguments he is developing into a book on beauty,
suggesting that beauty, like philosophical investigation, is also
personal, not universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't want anyone or everyone to accept my judgment of
beauty,'' he said. Instead beauty inspires communities of shared
taste in which notions of moral or political virtue are secondary.
But within these communities, Nehamas argued, beauty provides an
education in character; beauty aids in ``the art of living.'' Like
Scarry, Nehamas sees beauty as socially therapeutic and
enlightening; like Gilman, he sees it as a conglomeration of
contrasting visions, each defining a distinct community.
</P>
<P>
   As a practicing critic, Perl has a different perspective. He is
less interested in beauty's political benefits or betrayals
(although like Nehamas, he is reluctant to seek universals),
attending instead to the ways the eye perceives each artwork.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest collection of essays, ``Eyewitness: Reports From
an Art World in Crisis'' (Basic Books, 2000), Perl proposes that
art is endangered precisely because it is treated as subservient to
political or social ideals. He writes about the ``internal logic of
a work of art'' and defends art's ``freestanding value.'' He
attacks the manners and machinery of dealers, curators and the
media, who he suggests distort the dynamic and mysterious powers of
the beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   But Perl does not seem to be alluding to beauty as some
universal property. It is, for him, inseparable from the work of
art. In fact, there are few contemporary thinkers anywhere who
would try to define beauty in the abstract; such claims would have
to be sweepingly large. Yet until recently this was one of the
principal ways in which beauty was discussed. Objects were
beautiful because they possessed beauty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his 1790 ``Critique of Judgment,'' for example, Kant outlines
the principles that characterize judgments of beauty. He argued
that any judgment of beauty is removed from any considerations of
an object's usefulness, political or otherwise. The beautiful
object may inspire a desire to possess it or understand it, but the
judgment of its beauty is untainted by such considerations of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kant argued, when we are gazing at an object, we do
not consider its beauty a mere assertion of taste; we do not
emphasize the relative aspects of our experience _ the cultural
moment or our mood. Instead, beauty is felt to be universal, beyond
the reach of time and fashion or individual whim. We may not
declare that everyone will agree with our proclamation of beauty,
but beauty inspires a feeling that everyone should agree. The
judgment of beauty carries an assertion of authority: something
universal has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, such authority is gone. A contemporary judgment
of beauty incorporates a belief that not everyone will agree or
should agree. Beauty is almost never felt to be universal; it is
almost always a product of experience. The judgment of beauty is
not free of interest; it is laden with interest. Beauty, far from
being independent of usefulness, may even be assessed by its
usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the contemporary revival of beauty completely undoes
this inversion of the Kantian idea. Beauty may create injustice, as
in Gilman's argument, inspire justice, as in Scarry's, cultivate
character, as in Nehamas', and serve an artwork as in Perl's, but
it does not exist apart from this place and this time. That may be
this era's taste in beauty, our version of the surgically altered
nose.

DATABASE DISPUTE SETTLED WITH BIG SWISS BANKS IN HOLOCAUST
RESTITUTION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Representatives of Swiss commercial banks and Holocaust
survivors are expected to present the final details of a $1.25
billion restitution settlement to a federal judge next week after
two of the largest banks agreed to give the survivors' lawyers
access to databases containing information on 2.1 million Nazi-era
accounts, the lead lawyer for the survivors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Burt Neuborne, said the agreement, which was reached
at a 2 1/2 hour meeting on Thursday with Judge Edward R. Korman of
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, could greatly speed up the last
bit of haggling about the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is to give the judge a completed set of negotiations
late next week so he can finalize the agreement,'' Neuborne said.
``I call it inching toward Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Swiss banks and the Holocaust survivors reached the
precedent-setting accord in August 1998 to create a billion-dollar
fund intended to settle the claims of tens of thousands of people
whose families lost assets in World War II, the negotiations have
been hamstrung for months over the question of checking Swiss
records to find additional claimants.
</P>
<P>
   Neuborne and Paul Volcker, the chairman of an independent panel
that conducted much of the investigative work in the case, wanted
to create a centralized database that would have contained 4.1
million Swiss accounts set up from 1933 to 1945. The two banks,
Credit Suisse and UBS, agreed to grant access to their own 2.1
million accounts, but scores of smaller banks, which control about
another 2 million accounts, have so far declined to allow the
lawyers to search their files.
</P>
<P>
   In December the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons, the
panel led by Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve,
said a centralized database was needed ``to reach a speedy
conclusion to the claims resolution process.'' Neuborne added
Friday that the power to sift through all accounts opened in
wartime Switzerland was needed in order to ensure that no claimant
was left unfound.
</P>
<P>
   In letter to Volcker in February, Korman supported the idea of a
wide-ranging database, writing, ``I agree that the success of this
effort depends on the willingness of the Swiss authorities to adopt
your recommendation that a central archive of data on all 4.1
million accounts be established.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss originally balked at the proposal and, in March,
authorized the creation of a much smaller database that included
only 46,000 accounts. In a report issued in December, Volcker's
panel had named those 46,000 accounts as the most likely to have
been owned by Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Credit Suisse nor UBS could be reached Friday for
comment. Roger M. Witten, a Washington-based lawyer, who represents
the banks, refused to discuss details of the agreement but said,
``Everybody wants to get to the point where the settlement is
approved and the money is flowing to class members.''

   MONTREAL-BOOM (Montreal) _ St. Catherine's Street, this city's
fabled entertainment and shopping artery, used to boast the highest
rents in Canada. But 25 years ago, after separatist governments
mandated French supremacy in commercial signs, English-speakers
sourly noted that the most common sign on the street was ``A
louer'' _ ``For Rent.'' But now, Montreal is coming back after
years of fray and decay. Once the eastern shipping hub of the
country, Montreal has reinvented itself as a center for biotech,
telecommunications and information technology companies. Rents are
rising along with construction cranes, tourists are packing hotels,
and this city of 3.3 million people has become the third most

whose fabled leaders Lyndon B. Johnson and Sam Rayburn once
dominated not just the state but the nation, has fallen on hard

Democrats. And much to the chagrin of the Democratic state

out campaigning with none other than George W. Bush, the
second-term Republican governor and soon-to-be GOP presidential
nominee. Other than the most partisan Republicans, few people in
Texas would argue that Democrats are powerless or obsolete,
particularly since the party still controls the Congressional
delegation and the Texas House of Representatives. But as Bush
campaigns for the White House, Democrats are consumed by a
parochial, less glamorous agenda, such as legislative races and
preparing for the 2002 gubernatorial race. And few elected

PARCELLS TO DIRECT JETS EFFORT INDEFINITELY

<P>
   As it turned out, Bill Parcells didn't want to shop for the
groceries and then head off into the sunset. Instead, he has
decided to remain with the New York Jets indefinitely as the
director of football operations and monitor the four No. 1 picks he
had in this year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells will also continue to be in full view of the Patriots,
not in the ``Monday Night Football'' booth, or an ESPN studio, or
diagramming X's and O's with the Fox crew. Parcells rejected all TV
overtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I indicated some time ago that I would not abandon this
franchise,'' said Parcells. ``I look forward to working with
(owner) Woody Johnson and Al Groh in a collective effort to try to
bring a championship to New York. I view my job very simply: to try
and get good players for the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   That coach is Al Groh, named on Jan. 24. He's a longtime ally of
Parcells, but not his first choice. That was Bill Belichick, who
took the job then quit the next day, citing the instability of the
ownership as it passed from the late Leon Hess to Johnson, of
Johnson &AMP; Johnson fame.
</P>
<P>
   There had been reports that Parcells was going to guide the Jets
and help Groh for a while, but then leave by the summer. But
Parcells may be on the verge of building a stellar defense; he
traded Pro Bowl wide receiver to Tampa Bay for two first-round
picks, which gave New York an unprecedented four of the first 30.
</P>
<P>
   With those picks, the Jets selected defensive end Shaun Ellis,
outside linebacker John Abraham, quarterback Chad Pennington, and
tight end Anthony Becht.
</P>
<P>
   The offense may miss Johnson, one of the premier players in the
game, but on the other side of the ball, Ellis and Abraham are
highly regarded and Pro Bowl linebacker Mo Lewis had earlier signed
a one-year tender offer.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has had to deal with defections on his staff. Besides
Belichick, Parcells's son-in-law, Scott Pioli, the team's former
director of pro scouting, left the organization to join the
Patriots. Over the past few days, Belichick and Pioli have tried to
interview scout Lionel Vital for the job of national scout,
replacing the fired Dave Uyrus. Parcells rejected a request by the
Patriots to allow Vital to interview because Parcells viewed it as
a lateral move. The Patriots may now offer a title under Vital's
name so he can be free to interview for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets should be a competitive team with quarterback Vinny
Testaverde returning from a ruptured Achilles' heel that he
suffered in the season opener vs. the Patriots last season. The
Jets have not adequately replaced Johnson, but have been discussing
the possibility of Cincinnati's Carl Pickens, who has been
disgruntled for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole idea and thought process is to improve this team each
year,'' Parcells said. ``The only reason you should be in this
business is to win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh, the former Patriots' defensive coordinator, said ``Bill's
decision to remain in his current position means we kept a Hall of
Fame performer on our team. What could be better than that?''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells turned the 1-15 Jets of 1996 into a 9-7 team in 1997,
then went to 12-4 and won the AFC East in '98. Considering the
disaster of losing Testaverde in the first game, the Jets rebounded
to go 8-8, same as the Patriots. Parcells will now attempt to bring
the Jets back to where they were two years ago. No small task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am obviously delighted that Bill Parcells has decided to
stay with the New York Jets,'' Johnson said. ``Our sole objective
since the purchase of the team has been to create a winning
organization, attitude and team. Having Bill around to help us
through this period is an enormous advantage to the franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also be an advantage for the Jets in the Patriots-Jets
rivalry. Now, twice a year, it'll be Belichick vs. Groh _ Who's the
better coach? Belichick and Groh have worked hand-in-hand on
defenses for the Giants, Patriots, and Jets. And now Parcells will
be looking down on Belichick, the coach who scorned him. Belichick
has sometimes been referred to as the ``genius'' behind Parcells.
Belichick is not competing against Parcells on the field, but now
he'll be competing against him in the personnel office.
</P>

   Former Patriots tight end Ben Coates has been talking to the
Detroit Lions about a job . . . . . . The Patriots are considering
unrestricted free agent defensive tackle Gilbert Brown of the
Packers, who lost 25 pounds at a Duke University weight loss clinic
this offseason and is reportedly down to 320.

   Call him the recording industry's secretary of defense. As
millions of college students use Napster and Gnutella software to
swap free MP3 music files over the Internet, ignoring warnings
about copyright infringement, Dick Wingate is helping the music
industry fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Wingate, a senior vice president at Liquid Audio and a former
recording industry executive himself, secured an agreement last
month to provide crucial support for BMG Entertainment to sell its
music over the Internet. Liquid Audio, an Internet music and
software company based in Redwood City, Calif., will manage the
technology for putting BMG's music online and combatting piracy.
BMG, whose labels include Arista Records, is the world's
second-largest recording company, behind the Universal Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   With its big role in selling music on the Web, Liquid Audio was
a major beneficiary of an April 28 federal court ruling that found
MP3.com and its online music library in violation of copyright law.
On the day of the ruling, MP3 shares plunged nearly 40 percent
while Liquid Audio's rose more than 30 percent. It now trades at
$12, below its $15 price when it went public in July.
</P>
<P>
   Wingate, 48, says recording companies have no choice but to sell
their music online. ``Until the majors put significant amounts of
their catalog into authorized distribution,'' he said in his
mid-Manhattan office, a nondescript suite filled with piles of
pop-music compact discs, ``you're forcing music fans who want to
download music to find unauthorized copies.''
</P>
<P>
   BMG, with artists including Santana and Christina Aguilera, and
Sony Music Entertainment plan to sell their music online by means
of digital downloads starting this summer. Other labels are
expected to introduce similar plans.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing contingent in the online music industry believes
that the tide of free online music will wash away the hopes of
companies like Liquid Audio for significant revenue from digital
downloads.
</P>
<P>
   Free MP3 files remain far more popular than files that must be
paid for among the young listeners most likely to download music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make files available in a lot of different formats, and at
this point Liquid Audio has been the least selected of those
formats,'' said Larry Lieberman, chief executive of Musicmaker.com,
an online music vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio, however, changed its strategy this year, forming a
partnership with Microsoft, whose Windows Media Player system was
previously a competitor, and concentrating on distribution for all
digital music formats _ not just its own.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other Internet company executives, Wingate knows how
to navigate the tangle of artists' concerns and rights issues that
have so far slowed the labels' online transition. Kevin Conroy,
senior vice president of new technology for BMG, says Wingate's
industry experience and contacts made him a key player in forming
the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we're really happy to have somebody who's in an
important new media company also helping to shape the music
business,'' Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Wingate has long built his music industry credentials. In the
mid-1970s, while a student working as a disc jockey for his Brown
University radio station, WBRU, he somehow convinced Bruce
Springsteen, already a hot ticket, to perform a paid show on campus
for just 150 people. After graduation, Wingate landed a job as a
product manager at Columbia Records, Springsteen's label. In the
early 1980s, Wingate became an executive responsible for signing
new artists at Epic Records.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in technology goes back many years as well. In
1991, he became a top executive at In Touch, which sold kiosks to
let record store customers preview digitally encoded snippets.
</P>
<P>
   After In Touch went out of business because of the high cost of
its machines, Wingate went to Arista in 1994 as marketing chief. He
left two years later to become a new-media consultant to companies
including BMG, Arista's corporate parent.
</P>
<P>
   As a consultant, he impressed Liquid Audio's chief executive and
co-founder, Gerald Kearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that he knew the record business inside and
out,'' Kearby said. ``It was also clear that unlike many record
company guys, he had the ability to morph his mind over to our side
of the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Liquid Audio in 1998, Wingate has been
instrumental in shaping his company's changing strategy and in
coaxing nervous music labels online. He now has options on 111,000
shares, and he lords over an inventory of about 67,000 downloadable
songs from more than 8,500 artists, some available as promotional
freebies, others for purchase through 750 online retailers,
including Amazon.com and CDNow. Liquid Audio has formed alliances
with more than 1,400 labels.
</P>
<P>
   Wingate's maneuvering has already had measurable results. Last
fall, nearly 1,000 customers paid the same price as for a CD to
download David Bowie's latest album in the Liquid Audio format,
figures that impressed some industry insiders, considering the
45-minute average download. Wingate says broadband access will
speed the download time once it becomes more widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his aspirations have a personal cost. Wingate often
works 18-hour days that include frequent trips to Silicon Valley.
However, he has made a point of working twice a week from his
Westport, Conn., home office to spend more time with his wife,
Karen, and two young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm away so much, my little boy cries when I just leave for
the day,'' he said with a sigh. ``A revolution is a full-time,
round-the-clock thing.''

LOSS OF N-PLANT CLEANUP WORK THREAT TO STONE, WEBSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The owners of the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant have
canceled a $250 million cleanup contract with Stone &AMP; Webster Inc.,
which could push the engineering firm closer to a bankruptcy
filing.
</P>
<P>
   Maine Yankee's owners, including Central Maine Power Co., Bangor
Hydro, and National Grid, voted Thursday to suspend payments to
Stone &AMP; Webster. Earlier in the week, a key Stone &AMP; Webster
subcontractor ceased work on a power plant project in Tiverton,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects could also slip as the gravity of Stone &AMP;
Webster's financial position begins to sink in with customers
around the world. Last Sunday, Stone &AMP; Webster disclosed that its
problems had forced it to take a $27.5 million charge and begin
talks to sell most if its assets.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks fail, Stone &AMP; Webster may be forced into default
with creditors, it said. The company expects to receive credit
extensions in such an event.
</P>
<P>
   Many worry that Stone &AMP; Webster might not be able to continue
operating, though.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority said it
would reduce payments to Stone &AMP; Webster if it seeks bankruptcy
protection and shift contracts so that subcontractors are still
paid to work on the MetroWest water-supply tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster is construction manager for the $680 million
tunnel. It has 30 employees dedicated to the job and has received
$19 million of the $38 million it is due under an eight-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Maine Yankee was closed in 1997 amid safety problems and rising
costs, and Stone &AMP; Webster was hired in 1998 to ``decommission''
the plant by removing or storing radioactive material. Stone &AMP;
Webster employs 480 people at Maine Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are in talks to try to return the employees to
work on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN Central Maine's board ended the contract, Stone &AMP; Webster
had already received about $60 million under a contract due to end
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Michael Frietag would not discuss the company's
financial outlook beyond its previous disclosures. But he said that
``while we dispute Maine Yankee's right to terminate our current
arrangement, we're encouraged by its willingness to explore
alternatives that would allow S&AMP;W to continue its involvement in
this important project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to quickly identify a solution that allows us to
continue our work and ensure that the project is completed safely
and within the time frame originally estabilished.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine Yankee spokesman Eric Howes said the vote to suspend the
contract was not unanimous but declined to say which owners don't
support the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster shares rose 18.75 cents to close at $3.1875 in
New York Stock Exchange trading.

   MONTREAL _ St. Catherine's Street, this city's fabled
entertainment and shopping artery, once boasted the highest rents
in Canada. But 25 years ago, after separatist governments mandated
French supremacy in commercial signs, English-speakers sourly noted
that the most common sign on the street was ``A louer'' _ ``For
Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Rue Ste. Catherine has a new face. Vacant storefronts
have been filled with high-fashion boutiques, restaurants and
``exotic dancing'' clubs that are attracting crowds that spill off
sidewalks into the street. At one end, the old hockey rink is being
transformed into a multimedia entertainment center with 5,000 movie
theater seats. At another end, the old Loews Theater is to reopen
next year as entertainment salad of circus stages, restaurants and
night clubs, the second ``Club Med World'' after Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is coming back after years of fray and decay. Once the
eastern shipping hub of the country, Montreal has reinvented itself
as a center for biotech, telecommunications and information
technology companies. Rents are rising along with construction
cranes, tourists are packing hotels, and this city of 3.3 million
people has become the third most popular site in North American for
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Toronto is still No. 1, the pendulum is swinging back to
Montreal,'' Gillian Cosgrove, a business writer, lamented recently
in The National Post, a newspaper edited in a city stuck with such
labels as ``Toronto the Good'' and ``Toronto the Clean.'' The
rivalry between Montreal, the fun center, and Toronto, the
financial center, compares with the rivalries between Rome and
Milan, or between Rio and Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time anyone can remember, Montreal's unemployment
rate has dipped below Toronto's, hitting 6.5 percent in January,
the lowest level in a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Quebec province registered 4 percent economic growth last year,
higher than the rest of Canada for the first time in more than a
decade. While poverty still blights many communities, Quebec's
welfare rolls have dropped by about a quarter in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Where once construction cranes were an endangered species, more
than a billion dollars worth of construction is under way. The
convention center is being doubled, and the downtown airport is
expanding. Near the river, workers are finishing Cite Multimedia, a
huge incubator for high-tech start-up companies. Later this summer,
work is to begin downtown on a new $150 million baseball stadium
for the city's Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shooting to get the shovels in by June,'' Stephen
Bronfman, the 36-year-old co-chairman of the Expos who is member of
the wealthy Bronfman clan, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Montreal hotels enjoyed their best occupancy rates
since Expo 67, the world's fair 33 years ago that marked the city's
last economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it `Paris without jet lag,''' said Marie-Josee
Allaire, spokeswoman for the Ritz Carlton Montreal, one of several
Montreal hotels that have spent a total of $150 million for
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The floods of New Englanders and New Yorkers booking rooms in
Montreal this summer follows a 20 percent jump in foreign tourism
that Canada has enjoyed for two years. As airlines add new flights
this year between the United States and Montreal, the tourist boom
is partly built on bargains to be had with the weak Canadian
currency, which trades at almost 1.50 for one American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Montreal has also reinvented itself as a major center for higher
education. The city now edges out Boston for the highest number of
college students per capita in North America's largest cities,
4.38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal to is to have 25 percent of our students coming from
outside of Canada,'' said Bernard J. Shapiro, principal of McGill
University, which is the largest predominantly English-language
school in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage French-speaking bonds, a student from Senegal,
where France was the colonial power, often pays less state tuition
to study in Montreal than a student from neighboring,
English-speaking Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   This concentration of brain power has helped to move Montreal
away from its old industrial base into a mix of biopharmaceutical
companies and other technology-based concerns. In Montreal's
suburbs, the shift can be most visible at ``pill hill,'' where 40
percent of Canada's pharmaceutical companies are based. Bombardier,
a Montreal company that many Americans associate with snowmobiles,
has become the world's third largest aircraft manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new economy is multimedia, we are No. 1 in research and
development,'' said Montreal's mayor, Pierre Bourque, in an
interview. Reflecting the economic dynamism here, the Quebec
government and the Nasdaq Stock Market announced plans a week ago
to open Nasdaq Canada this fall, a new electronic exchange based
here. That would return company stock trading to the city since the
Montreal Stock Exchange closed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Spending by American filmmakers has also been a source of
economic growth, jumping four-fold in the last five years to $200
million a year. American directors have discovered that this
gracefully aging city with its stately churches and quaint public
squares offers discount locations that can pass for European or
American.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attracting American startup companies is the fact that
electricity, office rents and industrial construction costs are
about half those of New York and Boston. The downside is that
Quebec has North America's highest income tax rates; combined
federal and provincial rates top out at 51.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rents are extremely cheap relative to the horror stories
I've heard about Manhattan,'' said David E. Pawsey, a 24-year-old
digital editor. Referring to the American equivalent of $550, he
added, ``You can get a three bedroom place downtown for $800, and
that's considered expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   With free trade, Quebec is increasingly oriented south,
expanding the part of its economy devoted to trade with the United
States to 25 percent today, from 10 percent a decade ago. If Quebec
were a nation, it would now be the United States' fifth largest
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montreal is losing Canada as its hinterland and focusing on
the U.S.,'' said Raphael Fischler, a Belgian immigrant who teaches
urban planning at McGill. ``The francophones have reconquered
Montreal. Now, the great tension in Quebec is between linguistic
nationalism and economic globalization.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although red and white maple leaf flags generally fly only over
federally owned buildings here, separatist passions and linguistic
tensions seem increasingly relaxed. In the last vote on Quebec
separation from Canada, in 1995, the separatists narrowly lost.
</P>
<P>
   After the French-supremacy language laws were imposed, about 40
percent of Montreal's English-speaking population decamped for
Ontario and points west. Those remaining are more culturally and
linguistically supple. The Gazette, the city's English-language
newspaper, recently published a series on ``the new Anglos,''
noting that in one generation, the percentage of bilingual
English-speaking residents had doubled, to about two-thirds today.
While ethnic politicians often demonize the other group, bicultural
marriages now outnumber marriages between two English-speakers.
</P>
<P>
   While English-speakers in Montreal may sometimes feel as
beleaguered as English-speakers in Miami, there is no sign that the
English presence is going to disappear here. Indeed, in one of the
biggest investments in the Canadian newspaper world this year, The
Gazette plans to inaugurate a $50 million, full color printing
press in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely an endorsement of the city and, frankly, of
the English-reading audience,'' Alan E. Allnut, editor of the
222-year-old newspaper, said over lunch in a French restaurant in
the gradually gentrifying Vieux Port neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, Montreal, with its improving economy, European
style and cheap real estate, is looking more and more attractive.
Bronfman, the co-chairman of the Expos, said of friends who left,
``There are a lot of people who are in Toronto who are dying to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Life magazine committed a very public hara-kiri for a
boosterish city monthly. The cover of an issue last fall was
devoted to a photograph of a smoked meat sandwich, with the title:
``Where to find Montreal in Toronto: the food, the fashion, the
booze, the fun _ a guide to all things Montrealish.''

PHILIPPINE TERRORISM ROOTED IN MEDIEVAL STRUGGLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Muslim insurrection that has launched a wave of terrorism
and kidnapping in the remote southernmost corner of the Philippines
is a 21st-century incarnation of political and religious struggles
that stretch back 500 years to Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval also has roots in the emergence of the United
States as a superpower in the middle of the last century, and in
the ebbs and flows of Philippine politics in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle ``is really the jihad vs. the crusade, still being
fought out in the Philippines,'' said David Steinberg, president of
Long Island University. Steinberg is widely acknowledged as the
leading American specialist on the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in the 15th century, when a resurgent Spanish
crown began dispatching ships westward with the dual mission of
finding a route to the Spice Islands and converting native peoples
to Roman Catholicism. In the Philippines, they encountered the
advancing edge of Islam, which had spread east and south from
Mecca, through Pakistan and India, down the Malay peninsula, and
across what is now Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spanish were able to push the Muslims out of most of the
Philippines, but were not strong enough to push them out of the
south,'' Steinberg says. ``For centuries, there was an uneasy peace
between local sultans and the distant Spanish culture'' based in
Manila, which ``claimed Mindanao, but didn't really control it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindanao Island, the Muslim heartland, encompasses 35 percent of
the land area of the Philippines, but over the centuries it
remained outside the country's mainstream. When American forces
defeated Spain and made the Philippines into a US colony 100 years
ago, they saw in Mindanao's open fields and pastures an echo of the
American West and an outlet for the intensifying political unrest
among the masses of landless, destitute peasants crowding Luzon,
the main island.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans set out to move people to relatively unpopulated
Mindanao, oblivious to the possibility that the Asian Muslims and
the ardently Catholic peasants from Luzon might not prove a
compatible mix. But limitations of technology and transportation in
the early 20th century were barriers to massive change. The area
remained predominantly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   All this changed after World War II. The United States and the
new republican government of its former colony were under pressure
from communist movements. They feared such movements would prosper
in the squalid poverty of Luzon, and President Ramon Magsaysay,
actively assisted by the US Central Intelligence Agency, began
again to resettle poor people from Luzon to Mindanao. In short
order, Muslims were a minority in their ancestral homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in central and northern sections of Mindanao, Christians
outnumber Muslims about 9 to 1. In southern sections and the
smaller out-islands, where many of the kidnappings and armed
clashes are occurring, Muslims outnumber Christians by similar
lopsided proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of Christians did not spark immediate rebellion,
probably because Washington and Manila did not press the aggressive
advocacy of Catholicism that had been integral to the Spanish
empire.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1970s, anger about exploitative mining and farming
concessions that President Ferdinand Marcos, who was notoriously
corrupt, granted his cronies coincided with a global trend of
Muslim societies seeking to throw off foreign influences. The long
period of uneasy truce in Mindanao and the out-islands gave way to
an armed Muslim insurgency, with the rebels gaining support from
Libya, Iran, and Iraq, and, closer to home, from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict wound down but did not end decisively. Marcos
eventually fell to a political revolution. Efforts by his
successors, Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos, to reduce corruption
and reconcile with the Muslims made headway; and the general
situation was eased by improving economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1998, those gains have been squandered under the
corrupt and unsophisticated administration of Philippine President
Joseph Estrada, Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a loss of cohesion throughout the country and a sense
that the center cannot hold,'' Steinberg said.

INVESTIGATORS WHO SEARCHED THROUGH DEBRIS OF PAN AM 103 TESTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
   By By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands _ The police officers who searched the
scenes of the crash of Pan Am 103 in 1988 began taking the stand
Friday in the trial of two Libyans accused of blowing up the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony was drier than that of the first two days, when
air traffic controllers described the flight winking off their
radar screens, and neighbors described the hailstorm of fire, metal
and bodies that fell on their roofs and gardens in Lockerbie,
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   If the day's testimony was more about the grim minutiae of
police work in the confusion of a crime scene covering 850 square
miles, it was also testimony that let the defense tip its hand a
bit more.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers tried to get witnesses to say that both CIA and
FBI agents were tramping the moors, with opportunities aplenty to
plant or steal evidence.
</P>
<P>
   They did get testimony that the Scottish police believed for
more than a year that Palestinians had bombed the London-to-New
York flight, which fell out of the skies on the small town of
Lockerbie. The 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground died.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended with a reading of the names of the victims, by
families when applicable, with their addresses and the ages of all
those under 21. Audience members wept quietly as a speaker buzzed
faintly with the noise of the list being repeated in Arabic by a
translator. Two older women sobbed when the prosecutor reached the
Owens family, killed with their daughters, and a young woman
employed by the Scottish government slipped down the aisle with a
box of tissues, patting their arms. Others reached across the seats
to comfort each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the relatives have become close friends,'' Jim Swire,
a Briton who lost a daughter on the flight, said afterward. ``And
all I can say is that that's one of the few good things that have
come out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony elicited by the prosecution from seven officers
who directed the searches of various sectors, seemed intended to
leave the image of a vast but precise operation. Pictures were
displayed of long rows of searchers combing fields while
helicopters flew grid patterns overhead. The first sweeps were for
bodies, they said, and then it was done over again, sometimes in
driving rain, for debris. Items as small as watches were logged. At
one point, said former Chief Inspector Alexander McLean, tarpaulins
had to be brought in because the cargo included a million sewing
machine needles, and two officers had been pricked.
</P>
<P>
   The defense cross-examined six of the seven officers, mostly
probing for details about Americans on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost as many published theories about Pan Am 103 as
about the Kennedy assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   One published in Britain held that it was a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration sting that went wrong when someone
swapped a bomb for a heroin package.
</P>
<P>
   Because two people who worked for the CIA were believed to have
died in the crash, agency personnel were on the scene, officers
testified Friday. Scenarios blaming the CIA have been bruited.
</P>
<P>
   More widely believed was the theory that U.S. and Scottish
investigators worked with until 1991: that the plane was bombed by
Syrian-backed Palestinians working for Iran, which was seeking
revenge for the downing of an Iranian passenger jet by a U.S.
warship in July, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   That had plausibility because in October 1988, two months before
the plane went down, West German federal police arrested a dozen
Palestinians with Syrian passports, a Toshiba boombox, detonators,
barometric fuses, a bazooka, a grenade-launcher and other arms.
</P>
<P>
   But most of them, including a known bomb maker named Marwan
Khreesat, were released by a German judge and disappeared. In a
later search, the Germans found three more bombs packed in
Toshibas, one of which killed the man dismantling it.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian groups have repeatedly denied blowing up Pan Am
103.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators changed their minds about them after finding bits
of a timer embedded in a charred shirt in the debris. The timer was
traced to a Swiss firm that is said to have identified its customer
as the Libyan government, although it later said it also sold to
others and lost some in a burglary.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the defense announced its intention, as required
by Scottish law, that it would blame another party, namely, the
Palestinians. As the defense, they need not prove that to win; they
must only raise doubts in the judges' minds about the prosecution's
case.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, they plan to suggest that the Libyan-connected timer
was planted by U.S. investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony for the prosecution, former Deputy Chief
Inspector Andrew D. Jackson described his sector search. Then the
defense asked him about six months he spent in Washington in 1989
as a liaison officer with the FBI. He acknowledged that the bureau
then believed the Palestinians were guilty and that he purchased
and brought home two Toshiba boom boxes for Scottish investigators.
</P>
<P>
   McLean, on cross-examination, expressed surprise that foreign
investigators suggested which items of debris might be interesting,
but he appeared confused about differences between the FBI and the
CIA, which he twice called the ``Criminal Intelligence Agency.''
</P>
<P>
   And in his prosecution testimony, former Chief Inspector Norman
Brown described how he tagged and recorded tons of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, he was pressed to admit that rows of large
plastic evidence bags stood open and unguarded on a park lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Then the defense lawyer, William Taylor, asked: ``This debris
was collected by police officers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire personnel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``RAF volunteers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Army personnel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American personnel?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a long pause.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Brown said, ``I don't remember any American personnel in
Sector B, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's hero was Constable Michael Stryjewski of Lockerbie,
who saw the crash from his house, fetched a first aid kit and ran
up a flaming street and into burning houses to rescue residents. He
then drove to another neighborhood, did it again, and finally got
aboard a military helicopter to spend the rest of the night looking
for bodies.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked to describe how, days later, he spotted a crumpled
luggage container, labeled AVE 4041. A defense lawyer asked if he
had been sent to find that particular number. ``No,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you certain?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely _ no.''

TENSIONS MOUNT AS ISRAEL, HEZBOLLAH CALL CEASEFIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas called a halt to
their attacks Friday after dozens of Katyusha rockets slammed into
northern Israel and Israeli fighter jets struck at targets across
Lebanon in a sharp escalation of violence just two months before
Israel's planned withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis in northern border towns cautiously emerged after
spending most of the previous 24 hours in small concrete bunkers
during the attacks and counterattacks that left large parts of
Lebanon without electricity and scorched the northern Israeli town
of Kiryat Shmona.
</P>
<P>
   But both Hezbollah and Israel made it clear that they would
resume fighting if provoked.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's security Cabinet, meeting for the second time in 24
hours, ordered a halt in retaliatory strikes for the time being,
and officials said the bombings were a warning of the damage Israel
could inflict on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in no hurry to escalate the level, but we say very
clearly that if there is a need, we will go up one step,'' Deputy
Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel's Channel One.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, which is backed by Syria and Iran and says it is
fighting to oust Israeli forces from south Lebanon, warned that it,
too, would not hesitate to attack again if Israel kept up its air
raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We warn the Zionist enemy against continuing in the rape of
Lebanon, because we are going to respond and confront it,''
Hezbollah said in a statement. ``If it wants to spare its northern
settlements the danger of the Katyusha rockets then it has to
restrain its army from any aggression and also has to restrain its
agent militia,'' a reference to the Israeli-financed South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's decision to suspend strikes on suspected Hezbollah
targets and Lebanon, which Israel holds responsible for attacks by
Hezbollah, came as the United States and France appealed for an end
to the fighting. The Arab League scheduled an emergency meeting for
Saturday in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition Likud politicians immediately criticized Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak for halting the Israeli strikes that
began early Friday and resumed at midday after Hezbollah again
rocketed northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, are they going to wait until civilians are dead?'' asked
Gideon Ezra, former deputy director of Israel's internal security
agency Shin Bet. ``Every so often we must remind the Lebanese army
that we have the stronger army, and that the best thing for Lebanon
will be to stop Hezbollah because otherwise they will get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires still smoldered late Friday along the northern border
where Katyusha rockets had fallen short of their targets, and large
areas of Lebanon were without electricity after Israeli F-15 and
F-16 fighters bombed two power stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will plunge their world into darkness,'' warned Israeli
President Ezer Weizman during a visit to the hard-hit town of
Kiryat Shmona, which was littered with shattered glass and the
burned wreckage of cars.
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli soldier was killed and about 30 Israelis lightly
wounded in the barrage of missiles that hit Thursday night and
again Friday morning, just as people emerged from shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's counterattack destroyed a Hezbollah arms depot and left
a crater that halted traffic on the main highway linking the
capitals of Syria and Lebanon. Israeli gunboats off the coast
joined in the pounding of suspected Hezbollah targets. One Lebanese
civilian and an off-duty soldier were injured in the Israeli
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes and counterstrikes underscored the problems Israel
may face once it ends its 20-year occupation of a strip of south
Lebanon along the northern border, and pointed to the difficulties
Israel faces despite the so-called security zone.
</P>
<P>
   The tens of thousands of Israelis living along the border are
worried that without a peace agreement with Syria and Lebanon, the
Israeli withdrawal will only leave border towns more vulnerable to
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 Katyusha rockets slammed into Kiryat Shmona alone in
this round of fighting, damaging some 16 buildings and leading to
calls for more and tougher attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid and they are angry and they want the army to
hit back so Hezbollah will think twice before it attacks again,''
said Mayor Haim Barbivay.
</P>
<P>
   This round of violence, the biggest in nearly a year, was
apparently sparked by attacks on Wednesday that killed two Lebanese
women and wounded six other civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In the first incident, Israel's proxy militia in south Lebanon
opened fire when it saw movement in an abandoned village, killing
an 82-year-old woman and her 40-year-old daughter. In the second,
the Israeli army said one of its planes flying over Lebanon had
accidentally released a bomb over a civilian village, wounding six
people.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers in the 10-mile deep security zone killed at
least two guerrillas readying to lay land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of Hezbollah's counterattack was seen by some in
Israel as a last-ditch attempt to stop the unilateral Israeli
withdrawal _ or a warning of what it will be like after Israel does
withdraw. Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon, wants the
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon to occur as part of a peace
agreement that will secure the return of the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also preferred to withdraw as part of a peace deal, but
when talks with Syria broke down earlier this year Barak decided to
stick to his campaign promise to get Israeli soldiers out of
Lebanon by July.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cisco Systems said Friday that it had agreed to
buy ArrowPoint Communications in a stock swap valued at $5.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint, based in Acton, Mass., makes switches _ specialized
computers that optimize the delivery of content over the Internet.
Acquiring ArrowPoint gives Cisco, the leading maker of network
equipment, the technology it needs to compete against companies
like Alteon Web Systems in the fast-growing portion of the market
devoted to what is known as content switching, or load balancing.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street rewarded Cisco with a boost to its valuation that
eclipsed the cost of the deal. Cisco shares rose $3.9375, or 6
percent, to close at $67.5625 in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in ArrowPoint, which went public in March, had gained 27
percent on Thursday after a report by Greg Geiling, an analyst with
J.P. Morgan, forecast that the company's sales would quintuple in
the next 12 months. Its shares closed Friday at $139.875, up
$5.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco dominates the market for routers, computers that manage
data traffic on a network using the Internet Protocol, known as IP.
More than 80 percent of the routers connected to the Internet are
Cisco machines, which move traffic around the Internet based on the
IP address assigned each packet of data.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, a market has developed for switches that
can rapidly identify the type of data in the packet, and give
preferential routing to voice, for example, over plain text.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very big market opportunity, and ArrowPoint had
come in with the most intelligent switch,'' Geiling of J.P. Morgan
said. ``It was just a great opportunity for Cisco to seize once
again the No. 1 product in an emerging market. I think it's a good
transaction for all involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco will exchange 2.1218
shares of its common stock for every outstanding share and stock
option of ArrowPoint Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Content distribution is increasingly important for our
customers,'' Ammar Hanafi, Cisco's vice president for business
development, said in a telephone interview. ArrowPoint ``has taken
a very innovative software-based approach and is a real leader. We
think over time content networking is going to be as important a
technology as IP,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Volpe, ArrowPoint's president and chief operating officer,
said that a merger with one large company or another at some time
seemed likely, but that Cisco was the most compelling candidate.
``When the most highly regarded technology company comes calling,
they're probably only going to come once,'' he said. The deal
``ensures our technology will be the dominant technology in this
space.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As corporations move to an Internet-hosted computing model,
where not only software applications but telecommunications and
transaction-processing occurs over the Web, ArrowPoint's
load-balancing software is just one of several technologies they
will need, said Paul Johnson, a Robertson Stephens analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco already dominates routing, and is now buying a leading
player in load balancing, but still lacks strong positions in other
areas like gigabit ethernet, for fast transmission of data, and
cache technology, which smooths and speeds Web traffic by storing
frequently used data closer to the user, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe in this, it's highly likely Cisco will have to
do more acquisitions to fill in their product line,'' Johnson said.

CURB A DOG; HELP A TREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For Sunday, May 7) By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I know I'm supposed to curb my dog, but occasionally
she goes when I'm not paying attention, and it seems cruel to yank
her away. Well, I'm not going to feel sorry for her anymore. You
shouldn't feel sorry for your dog. Because that urine kills trees
and other plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acid eats right through the bark and cambial zone to the
wood zone, destroying the tree's defense system,'' said Eric T.
Fleisher, the director of horticulture at the Battery Park City
Parks Conservancy, which oversees the public park at the lower tip
of Manhattan. Even a small opening in the bark is a gateway for
micro-organisms that can spread disease through the tree.
</P>
<P>
   One gorgeous morning last week, Fleisher, who is known as T,
bent over the devastated base of a 15-foot linden tree on a corner
of Rector Place, where it ends at the walkway along the Hudson
River. The bark was completely eaten away, exposing the living
tissue, through which nutrients and water flow. A knobby ridge of
calluses showed where the tree had tried to wall off the damage, to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do a proper pruning cut, the tree can
compartmentalize that damage,'' Fleisher said. ``But it can't
localize something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The base of the tree was stained dark gray, and its bark was
deeply fissured, from dog-leg-level to the ground. The soil was as
hard as concrete, from all those dog feet, so the roots were
suffocating. (Urine also contains a lot of salt, which deprives the
plants of water and burns their roots.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to correct this is for people to alter the way
they train their animal,'' Fleisher said. ``Even an older dog can
be trained. Years ago, when my family moved to the Upper East Side,
we taught our old dog Franny to go in the street.'' This is
especially important for a dog that has been kept inside for hours.
``He'll still try to mark the plants, but he won't be emptying his
bladder on one tree,'' Fleisher said. Picture dozens of dogs doing
that to the same tree.
</P>
<P>
   Such frank talk might disturb readers expecting to learn about
tree peonies and such, but this is consciousness-raising time. Take
a look at street trees and shrubs along well-used park paths. The
damage is unmistakable. And even if you don't have a dog, you might
say something to the next offender _ politely, of course. Many
people don't realize that their adorable pets kill trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 24 trees we replaced this year, six were due to
urine,'' Fleisher said. And trees at park entrances, like this
linden, are usually the first to go.
</P>
<P>
   Battery Park gardeners never wrap a newly planted tree with
burlap, because it holds urine next to the bark. To try to
counteract ground compaction, they add gypsum to lighten the soil
and neutralize the salt, and lime to offset the acidity. Aerating
is also important, to open up compacted soil and let plant roots
breathe. Mulching with organic matter also helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do very little fertilizing,'' Fleisher said. ``We just keep
incorporating leaf mold and compost. A small percentage of aged
horse or cow manure is helpful, in terms of grubs and other
insects, protozoa and nematodes, which all make up a healthy,
living soil.'' Such additions also help roots absorb magnesium and
other elements in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view fertilizer as junk food,'' Fleisher said. ``If the pH
is right, and you have good organisms in your soil, the plants will
get what they need.'' As we walked along the allee of lindens, he
pointed out mugho pines, azaleas and yew all under stress from
dogs. The leaves were limp and flaccid, and the soil was compacted.
The yew's needles were yellowed; the muhgo pines had scale. When a
plant is stressed, it's more likely to be attacked by insects.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher also emphasized the importance of planting a tree at
the right depth to give it a healthy start and a leg up, so to
speak, on dogs. ``They used to say plant at the same depth as it
was planted in the nursery, but there's often too much soil on top
of the root ball,'' he said. If you plant too deep, the roots
aren't able to get enough oxygen, so they grow upward, seeking air.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to grow back towards the trunk and girdle the
tree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you look carefully at a tree, you will see how the trunk
flares out near the bottom. The bottom of this flare should be
flush with the ground, Fleisher said. ``The periderm is much
tougher in this area, so it won't deteriorate as fast from dog
urine,'' he said. Bark higher up is less resistant.
</P>
<P>
   But such measures just delay a tree's demise if it is constantly
watered by dogs. So keep them in the street to do that.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds ``unnatural,'' cities are unnatural places.
Remember how awful the streets were before owners were required to
clean up after their pets?
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher's garden crew is also experimenting with a minty spray
that is supposed to repel dogs from plants. In their own version of
a controlled experiment, they are spraying some trees with the mint
mixture and others just with water. The sprayers aren't supposed to
know which is which, but the minty smell is unmistakable. It's
quite attractive. If I were a dog I'd go toward those trees.
Fleisher's crew isn't waiting with bated breath, but they'll try
anything once.
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture. You can love Fido and a linden, too.

LIVING WITH ROBIN HOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 07, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the only column I am truly embarrassed to have written.
(That I can remember, that is; it is always possible that I have
repressed the memory of others.) Last winter the pioneering Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care health maintainence organization was in crisis.
A couple hundred thousand dollars were required to tide it over
until higher fees kicked in. Who besides the state of Massachusetts
could provide the financing?
</P>
<P>
   Why not Harvard? I wrote. Why not the institution whose name was
on the door, which 30 years had blown life into the noble
experiment? Just a sliver of its $14 billion endowment could back a
credit guarantee that would prevent irreperable harm to the
venerable plan.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion wasn't as farfetched as it sounded, I argued
privately to friends. The impulse at Harvard to do good was
powerful. And sure enough, the next day, the Globe on its front
page headlined, ``Harvard may end millions to aid HMO. Proposed
investment would keep university's namesake nonprofit.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of days, however, cooler heads at Harvard's
headquarters in Massachusetts Hall prevailed. Whatever offer had
been broached had been rescinded, leaving a testy and confused
Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly with no alternative
but to ``cram down'' the health plan's debt, subordinating its debt
and sticking it mildly to its bondholders. The plan survived.
</P>
<P>
   So what was wrong with what I wrote? Just this: There are many
reasons for the size of Harvard's enormous war chest. Most of them
have to do with the competition among universities for the best
students; a large endowment makes possible bigger student
subsidies, which attracts better students. Explaining odd markets
like this one is a big part of my job.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact is that when you've got $14 billion in the bank,
it's a mighty slippery slope if you start responding to public
pleas, demands, threats and all other sorts of requests for help.
Cave in and pretty soon every two-bit Robin Hood in the neigborhood
will have a sword at your ribs.
</P>
<P>
   That was the point last week, when a band of ruffians with a lot
more clout than me attempted to stick up Harvard and came away, if
not empty handed, then with something other than they had sought.
</P>
<P>
   My colleague Alex Beam calls Cambridge the Sixteenth Republic.
The first fifteen belonged to the former Soviet Union, he says.
``The FSU is no longer, but the Sixteenth Republic lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness Cambridge has had some notable successes in recent
years. After it was forced to junk its rent control ordinance, it
set a national standard in building affordable housing, mainly
through the mechanism of inclusionary zoning. But Beam is right.
Despite its strong city manager form of government, the city's
system of proportional voting insures that tightly organized
interst groups can play a larger-than-usual role in politics, and
in Cambridge that means Lefties.
</P>
<P>
   Boom times have made the city council loopier than ever. Though
it sits astride several major highway arteries, the city has
attempted to ban truck traffic after dark. After four years and
four architects, the councillors have been unable to site a new
public library. A recent campaign against mutual savings bank
conversions spawned charges of of ``attempted nationalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall's election brought three new councillors to the
nine-memmber board. Two in particular, Jim Braude and Marjorie
Decker, have taken on a new high-profile foe: Harvard University.
Decker is a newcomer to elective politics, but Braude, 50, has had
a long career as union organizer and community activist. As
director of the Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts for many
years he unsuccessfully sought passage of a state-wide progressive
income tax. In 1986 his wife Kristine Rondeau led a successul
campaign to unionize Harvard's clerical workers.
</P>
<P>
   Braude and Decker immediately put their weight behind a campaign
to force Harvard to pay a ``living wage'' _ a $10 minimum wage
(already paid to its workers by the city of Cambridge),
substantially above the federally-mandated minimum wage $6 an hour,
which is slated to rise to $6.75 next year. Their tactic has been
to deny the university building permits. ``If Harvard wants to
build a new building and comes to the city council, all nine of us
will say, `Implement a living wage and we'll talk,''' he said
recently, according the the Harvard Crimson. ``Many of us would
feel it hard to approve some beautiful new building when somebody
working in it is making $8 or $9 an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus plans for development are at a standstill: for a new art
museum that Harvard wants to build on the banks of the Charles
River; for a a new center for government and international studies
on the opposite edge of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Harvard made its response: a blue-ribbon committee
recommended an extensive effort to better the lot of workers at the
law end of the university's pay scale _ especially the 372 persons,
three percent of the workplace, who make less than $10 an hour _
but not through a big boost in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the committee recommended, Harvard should broaden its
education and training programs (especially its language and
literacy coaching); extend subsidized health care benefits to every
employee working more than 16 hours a week; and insist that outside
contractors to the university do the the same. (A couple of deans
argued that the contractor provision would cost the university too
much.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvard clearly intended the plan to be a national model for
improving the lives of low-wage workers. Equally clearly, it
intended to demonstrate that it wouldn't be held hostage by
shakedown-minded politicians. In rolling out its proposal, it
signalled its intention to fight Cambridge City Hall in a highly
public manner.
</P>
<P>
   The ``living wage'' isn't a foolish idea, especially when
applied to governmenmt organizations. The situation of the working
poor should be a subject of far greater national concern than it
is. But when wages controls are extended to non-profit institions
and firms operating in open markets, they begin to have serious
perverse effects. Harvard is right to refuse to deal, even though
it easily can afford to pay. In fact, the benefits recommended by
the committee almost certainly will cost far more than knuckling
under to the wage demand would have.
</P>
<P>
   The ``living wage'' plan won't go away. Indeed, a rally is
scheduled for Harvard's big arts festival Saturday, led by city
councilors Braude and Decker and Cambridge homeboys Ben Affleck and
Matt Damon, the movie actors. But the students who throng to the
the bullhorns must have something else in mind as well; they should
claim victory, be proud of themselves and go study for finals.

GALAXY FACES WIZARDS IN SHOWDOWN

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Western Division is now Major League
Soccer's group of death for one reason: the Kansas City Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   K.C. is tops in most everything best record (6-0-1, 19 points),
most goals (17) and fewest goals allowed (4).
</P>
<P>
   Tonight the Wizards can really stamp themselves as contenders
when they visit the Rose Bowl to face the Los Angeles Galaxy
(5-0-2, 17 points), MLS' only other unbeaten team.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards, 8-24 a year ago, made two key acquisitions in
Danish striker Miklos Molnar and defender Peter Vermes. The rebirth
of goalkeeper Tony Meola has bumped them up another level.
Suddenly, K.C. sounds as dangerous as D.C.
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors. Preki (36) and Mo Johnston (37) are
playing with renewed energy, and coach Bob Gansler, the 1990 U.S.
National team coach who took our troops to the World Cup in Italy,
has everyone believing the best is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're happy about what has transpired so far,''
said Gansler. ``We feel that we are for real. I think the
combination of veterans and good young players are going about
their business in good fashion. How real are we? Only time will
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermes, acquired from Colorado, said Kansas City is only showing
glimpses of what it's capable of.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of room to grow,'' he said. ``No doubt this game
will be a huge challenge, but the amazing thing for our team is
that we've come together as quickly as we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is glowing at the Wizards' amazing turnaround,
especially Galaxy defender Danny Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people may be surprised with K.C.'s start, but I'm
not,'' said Pena. ``They have always been a good team on paper, but
now they've got a coach they believe in, a system they believe in
and they're believing in each other. When all of that happens it
makes for a great formula for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Greg Vanney said he always believed the Wizards
had the players to contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that was always good but maybe lacked
leadership,'' said Vanney. ``Something was always missing from that
organization but now they have it. Tony is having a great season,
Vermes in solid in the back, Molnar has provided a lift and the
workrate of Johnston and other guys has turned their franchise
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this has done is change the outlook of our division. This
isn't only a battle of undefeated teams, it's a battle to stay on
top of your division.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy leads the overall series with K.C. 9-7, but each
match is usually a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure why they give us trouble,'' said Galaxy defender
Robin Fraser. ``It's something about the individual match-ups that
we have. They've always been a very tough team to play against;
maybe it's the styles. It's going to be even more difficult now,
based on the players they have brought in.''
</P>
<P>
   Molnar was the biggest acquisition. He was named the MLS player
of the month for April after registering 11 points. Molnar missed
K.C.'s last match, a 5-0 victory over Colorado, because of an ankle
strain.
</P>
<P>
   He is questionable again tonight, but Schmid said K.C. will be
tough with or without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Molnar doesn't play, they've got (Alex) Bunbury and (Gary)
Glasgow, two others guys with speed,'' said Schmid. ``It doesn't
change how they play because they have replaceable items.''

STUDY CITES BRAIN DAMAGE FROM ROLLER COASTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid an explosion this year of gargantuan roller
coasters, including several that set records for speed and
gravitational force, a growing number of passengers are being
diagnosed with severe brain injuries after being whipped through
the most adventurous rides.
</P>
<P>
   At least 18 incidents of closed-head injury have occurred since
1995, according to one pathologist monitoring the trend. And a
study released this week by Representative Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.) found that of more than a dozen cases documented in the
past decade, almost all patients suffered brain injury from the
sheer force of the ride, not from being hit in the head by a loose
object.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are of particular concern to doctors this season,
as more than 100 million Americans are expected to visit amusement
parks now featuring a new generation of extreme rides. At Six Flags
New England, which opened in Agawam, Mass. Friday, one ``thrill
ride'' boasts speeds of up to 80 miles per hour _ the
fourth-fastest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the country, new roller coasters have gravitational
forces, or G-forces, greater than what an astronaut experiences
during liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Newton's laws of physics,'' said Dr. Pete Speth, a
forensic pathologist in Wenonah, N.J., who is studying the
neurological impact of roller-coaster rides. ``If the head is
suddenly stopped, the brain will keep moving ... And as they
increase the rates of acceleration on the rides, they are reaching
the limit of (people's) endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   What is most troubling to consumer advocates is the absence of
any federal or state oversight. No rules govern the G-force of a
roller coaster; in 14 states, including Massachusetts, amusement
parks are not subject to any federal or state inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials insist they sufficiently regulate themselves.
In most cases, amusement parks and roller coasters are inspected by
insurance companies, who have a serious financial stake in making
sure all rides and activities are safe. Additionally, officials
say, better technology has made rides far safer than they were in
1981, when Congress approved a Reagan initiative to abolish the
federal role in amusement park safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress looked at this issue 20 years ago and decided there
was nothing they could do to improve on the outstanding record of
this industry,'' said John Graff, president of the International
Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, a trade group of
some 450 theme parks. ``The truth is that modern technology has
made our rides much safer than they were years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, about 9,200 theme park accidents last year landed
park-goers in the emergency room, according to the Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   That does not include passengers who stepped off roller coasters
with a headache, only to discover weeks later they had suffered
brain damage during the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts are not sure how many such head trauma cases
exist, in part because they have been treated in isolation for so
long. In the study he released this week, Markey, who is pushing
for federal regulation of amusement parks, sought to compile more
than a dozen medical journal articles about roller coaster-induced
brain damage in order to demonstrate what he believes is a
``growing epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, completed by the National Institutes of Health, found
that the number of detected brain injury cases surged in the 1990s.
While there was only one incident in 1979, and one in 1991, there
have been a total of 13 documented incidents in the years since _
during the same years that amusement parks began ``constructing
roller coasters that move at supersonic speeds,'' Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, the frequency of these reported brain
injuries is accelerating,'' said Markey, a Malden Democrat.
``They're going 90 miles an hour now. The G-forces are above five,
which is greater than what an astronaut is subjected to on takeoff
of a shuttle mission.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a 31-year-old dance teacher suffered a severe
headache and vomiting after riding ``Space Mountain'' at the
Disneyland park outside Paris. She was diagnosed as suffering from
``dissection,'' in which arteries in her brain were split. In
another case, a 64-year-old man was diagnosed with a subdural
hematoma, or a clot inside the layers of the lining of the brain,
after riding on a roller coaster with six upside-down loops.
</P>
<P>
   Taken against the hundreds of millions of visitors to amusement
parks each year, some industry officials said the several dozen or
so head injuries should be taken seriously but not blown out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Nauser, an official at Six Flags, said: ``Sixteen cases,
I don't really think that's in the realm of what we do every season
at our parks ... Our coasters travel the equivalent of 75 orbits
around the Earth each season. And they are all safe rides.''

 &HT;    Key surgery for Hearst today
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ San Francisco 49ers running back Garrison Hearst will
have surgery today on his left leg, a procedure doctors hope will
save the former Georgia star's NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, from Lincolnton, missed all of last season after
breaking his left ankle in an NFC playoff game against the Falcons
in the Georgia Dome on Jan. 9, 1999. His left leg suffers poor
blood flow, which makes the bones in his foot susceptible to
necrosis. The same type of bone deterioration developed in running
back Bo Jackson's hip after an injury and forced him to retire from
football.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, Georgia's second all-time leading rusher, will be
operated on in Seattle. Orthopedic specialist Pierce Scranton and
Michael Dillingham, the 49ers' team physican, will perform the
procedure. Doctors will drill holes in Hearst's lower leg and plug
the holes with cartilage from his knee. The procedure is designed
to generate blood flow and aid healing in the affected area.
</P>
<P>
   Dillingham said last month that Hearst had a ``70-percent
chance'' of returning this season if he underwent the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming that's still holding true,'' said Pat Dye Jr.,
Hearst's Atlanta-based agent.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, 5 feet 11 and 215 pounds, set a San Francisco team
record with a career-high 1,570 rushing yards in 1998. He was
selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career but
didn't play after he was injured in the playoffs. A former
first-round draft pick of the Arizona Cardinals in 1993, Hearst
suffered a season-ending knee injury as a rookie and missed half of
the 1994 season. He was named the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year
in 1995, when he rushed 1,070 yards for the Cardinals.

REGGIE LEWIS JURY SEEKS INSTRUCTIONS FROM JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After a third full day of deliberations -- and a round
of feverish late-day negotiations among lawyers for both sides --
the jury in the Reggie Lewis medical malpractice retrial failed to
reach a verdict Friday and will return Monday for further
instructions from Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 jurors, looking weary and frustrated, filed into the
courtroom at about 5 p.m., nearly 90 minutes after they had sent a
note to the judge, who did not disclose its contents.
</P>
<P>
   While the note was not read publicly, the lawyers were shown it,
prompting intense and at times animated group discussions in the
courthouse corridor among lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis and Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., as well as representatives from Risk
Management Foundation, which insures Mudge and all
Harvard-affiliated doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis, Lewis's widow, has accused Mudge, Lewis's chief
cardiologist, of failing to diagnose her late husband with the
heart condition that caused the Celtics star's July 1993 death.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge heads the cardiac transplantation unit at Brigham and
Women's Hospital, a Harvard-affiliated institution.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a crush of news photographers crowded the hallway
to film the huddled attorneys, who were gathered in a small circle
at the far end of the corridor. The gathering spurred heated
speculation that settlement talks may be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, two months after an earlier jury deadlocked over
whether Mudge's treatment of Lewis was negligent, a source close to
the case told the Globe that Harris-Lewis's lawyers had offered to
settle the case for no more than $5 million -- the ceiling on
Mudge's malpractice insurance coverage -- but that the offer had
been rejected. Mudge's coverage is known as a ``wasting'' policy,
meaning that it is being steadily depleted to pay for the lawyers
defending him.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the source said that a major sticking point was
Risk Management's refusal to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, after lawyers for both sides met privately with
Fremont-Smith in his chambers, the jury was brought into the
courtroom and told by Fremont-Smith to return Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which began deliberating Tuesday after hearing more
than four weeks of testimony, has now spent more than 20 hours
discussing the case. The panel includes ten women, six men.
</P>
<P>
   As the deliberations grind on, there have been indications of
disagreement among the jurors. On Thursday, after deliberating for
two full days, jurors sent a note to Fremont-Smith saying that,
``The jury is at a point where nothing more productive will occur
today. It might be good to cool off overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach a verdict, 13 of 16 jurors must be in agreement. They
must consider eight separate questions, including whether Mudge was
negligent in his care of Lewis, and, if so, whether that negligence
substantially contributed to his death. If Mudge's negligence is
found to have contributed to Lewis's death, jurors must determine
how much his family should be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   In the first trial last year, 15 jurors deliberated for six days
before announcing that they were hopelessly deadlocked, resulting
in a hung jury. After a mistrial was declared, one of the jurors
later told the Globe that nine of the 15 jurors had concluded on a
fourth and final ballot that Mudge was not negligent in his care of
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   If the jurors in the retrial were to announce that they had
reached an impasse, Fremont-Smith is obligated to deliver
additional instructions, the so-called dynamite charge, aimed at
helping them reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible for the jury to agree on some questions but
deadlock on others.

FLOWER MAN GOES A COURTIN' CHARITY BALL CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 7) 
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unsuspecting woman received a bouquet of flowers
recently at her Fifth Avenue home. Set in a silver-plated urn, the
$350 arrangement was lush with romantic pink roses, Italian
poppies, deep-purple sweet peas, calla lilies and a card that read,
``We'd be a good match.''
</P>
<P>
   Her secret admirer? A floral designer named David Beahm, whose
intentions were not particularly romantic. The object of his
attentions is a member of the organizing committee for a fall
fund-raising gala for the Metropolitan Opera, with the unofficial
position of flower chairwoman: she picks the florist who picks the
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The unsolicited arrangement was ``a courting bouquet,'' Beahm
explained. He sent it in hopes of winning the account to provide
flowers for a party that annually attracts some of New York's
richest and swellest, names like Kissinger, Kravis and Bass. (He
did not want to reveal the woman's name, out of fear that his
competitors would court her as well.)
</P>
<P>
   Beahm sends up to five courting bouquets a week this time of
year, with a retail value of $250 to $400 each, to women all over
the city who are immersed in the charity social circuit and are
selecting the decor for fall benefits. Doing flowers for the
$1,000-a-plate dinners can make the career of an ambitious florist.
Centerpieces that provoke oohs and ahhs among the guests can lead
to contracts to provide arrangements at extravagant society
weddings and Park Avenue dinner parties, and to fill the floral
needs of hostesses like Carroll Petrie, who spends up to $20,000 a
week in the summer filling her Southampton house with Casablanca
lilies and white mixed blooms.
</P>
<P>
   The ``flower chairs'' and those who advise them are the keys to
this lucrative business, and they are courted in ways that go well
beyond sending a free bouquet. Four florists discussed how, to win
these women's favor, they provide flowers at discounts of 50 to 75
percent for the private needs of some of the city's wealthiest and
most socially active hostesses. The largesse includes fresh flowers
sent weekly to the women's homes, bouquets that they send to
friends as thank-yous for dinner invitations and reductions of tens
of thousands of dollars from the going price for their daughters'
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   The deep discounts are little known outside the world of the
ultrasocial. ``It's simply the way most of my friends keep fresh
flowers in their houses year round,'' said Arlene Dahl, an actress
who can be seen at many a Park Avenue dinner party. ``It's like
buying wholesale.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahl, who chooses the decor for the Oscar party for New York
members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and for
annual galas by the Pearl S. Buck Foundation and the New York
Cancer Society, said that at this time of year, her apartment is
abloom with courting bouquets. She considers it an innocuous form
of petty bribery, she said, adding, ``It's in the course of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   She has not chosen florists for public events as a result of
price breaks for her personal flowers, she said, but she knows
others who do. In general, women who receive personal discounts say
they see nothing unethical in choosing a florist for a public
fund-raiser and receiving discounts for one's personal use.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is related to the quiet but widespread convention
that allows some of New York's best-dressed, most socially visible
women, who are often most able to pay full price, to receive
clothes free from designers, or have their homes furnished at a
deep discount. ``Doing an apartment for free or at `a special
price' is the only way for some newcomers to get the caliber of
clients on their roster,'' said Mario Buatta, the interior
decorator. ``These women kind of sponsor you.''
</P>
<P>
   Polly Onet, a party planner with wide experience among the beau
monde, agreed. ``That's New York,'' she said. ``Look at the girls
we know who get all these cut-rate designer clothes, and they are
loaded and they don't pay a dime, for clothes or jewelry. We see
them every night, and they don't even dry-clean the clothes before
they bring them back to the designer, and the designer doesn't care
_ he is just happy that they are wearing the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharyn Mann, another object of Beahm's attention, is a
well-connected social figure with homes in Manhattan and Quogue,
which she likes to keep well appointed with fresh blooms. ``Flowers
are your calling card,'' she said. ``They represent you and your
taste. Flowers are like angels blessing the room.''
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, Mann was showing Beahm pictures of a 28-acre
island she and her husband, Stephen, an investment banker, had
bought in Vero Beach, Fla. Sitting on the down-filled damask couch
in the family room of her Fifth Avenue duplex, Mann said, ``David
is going to see the property before my husband.'' (Mann had
approved the purchase sight unseen.) She turned to Beahm to say,
``We must go to Vero Beach soon.'' Beahm agreed. With a blush on
his cheeks and glee in his voice, he said, ``I already have ideas
of what we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Beahm had that week filled Mann's living room overlooking
Central Park with more than $600 worth of Kwanzan cherry blossoms
and lilacs, at no cost. Mann, who was chairwoman of the Food
Allergy Ball at the Plaza in December, hired him to do the flowers
for the 70 tables at the event, which raised more than $2.2 million
for charity. Mann introduced him to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Valerie
Zilkha, Fe Fendi, Iris Love and CeCe Kieselstein-Cord.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head was spinning with all the contacts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make the right people happy and then meet the right
people, that hopefully is going to make the discount worthwhile,''
he added. By the same logic, he said, he did the gala flowers for
$20,000, with the cost covered by an anonymous sponsor, though the
job was really worth more than $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said it is natural for an up-and-coming florist to offer a
discounted fee for a high-profile assignment like her gala. ``He
was just starting, unknown in New York, so it was understood if he
was good to me, I in turn would be good to him by introducing him
to everyone I know,'' she said. ``I purposefully looked for someone
just starting. Other people who are established and well known
don't try that hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the flowers he provides for little or nothing for her
apartment, she denied using her position with the gala for personal
gain. ``I have never asked for anything personally,'' she said.
``Whatever David charges, we pay the bill.'' Even if that bill is
sometimes nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Another charity woman, who receives about $300 worth of peonies
and roses for her home each week, paying only about $100, also
defended the practice. ``Look, what's wrong with receiving
discounted flowers at home?'' she said, sipping a cocktail during a
``tailgate party'' at the New York Auto Show to benefit the East
Side Settlement House last month. This woman is not a flower
chairwoman, but she has many prominent friends. ``We are giving
these boys a big opportunity,'' she said, ``and you know, important
people come to my home and see what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Many florists say they refuse to court socialites, either with
the occasional sample arrangement or with more valuable long-term
discounts. ``I know it goes on,'' said Helena Lehane, a floral
designer who places arrangements every week in the homes of several
Upper East Side billionaires. ``I think integrity has something to
do with it. I have preferred over my career not to court.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Those who do court justify it as good business sense. Gaige
Clark, a co-owner of Spruce, whose clients include the model Amber
Valletta and the actress Julianne Moore, said, ``I do give special
discounts to special clients.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing business with them has helped our name get out there,
considering who they are sending their flowers to: people in
fashion, people in the film industry,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Some florists never have to weigh the ethical or economic
issues, because they are already so busy they don't have to offer
discounts. Two designers, Robert Isabell and Philip Baloun, have
long had a near duopoly on society parties and benefits, and both
deny courting clients with personal discounts. In fact, hostesses
sometimes grumble about their high prices. Donna Harvey, a senior
account manager at George Trescher Associates, which organizes
charity fund-raisers, said it was hard to stay within a budget when
planning a party with one of the top-tier florists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very talented, but many times we have to look
elsewhere for someone who is eager for the business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Veronis, another socialite involved in the charity world,
is heavily courted by up-and-coming florists. ``If you get a nod
from Lauren Veronis, you're in for the long haul,'' one florist
said.
</P>
<P>
   Veronis, who was chairwoman this spring of a gala celebrating
the 30th anniversary of Zubin Mehta's directorship of the Israel
Philharmonic and a buffet dinner at the Four Seasons for the
Irvington Institute for Immunological Research, is flattered by the
sentiment. For both events, Veronis broke with the florist she has
long favored, Isabell. ``We used Robert for years, and he was
wonderful,'' she said. ``But it was time to move on and give the
up-and-coming a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   For both events she chose David Tutera, a party planner in
Mamaroneck who, she said, has not given her any discounts for
personal flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The understanding always is when they do a big charity that
there is no budget for the party,'' she said. ``We want all of our
proceeds to go to the basic research, so we're delighted to provide
the audience for their work to give them big exposure. But in
return they have to work below cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutera, whose clients include Clarissa Bronfman, several Tisch
family members and Iris Cantor, said: ``I don't exactly give them
financial discounts. I give them more attention and hand-holding.
Personally, I'm totally with them every step of the way, and I make
sure they get the best flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in the long run what I will receive if I give them a
lot of attention. I know who is on their guest list. The secret to
being successful in the society world in New York is all word of
mouth, and I know what they can do for me if I give them a better
product for a little less.''
</P>
<P>
   Another up-and-coming florist who does give Veronis a price
break is Lisa Marie McWilliams, who said she provides flowers for
the Veronis homes in New York and Southampton more than 40 times a
year, for 40 percent less than the going rate. McWilliams said she
is so grateful for the exposure her work receives because she is
Veronis' florist that she would not think of charging more.
Moreover, it is her way of repaying Veronis for encouraging her to
leave a previous employer and go into business on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe so much to her,'' said McWilliams, who has not handled
any of the charity accounts Veronis oversees, but hopes to in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Veronis said she had never asked McWilliams for a discount, and
seemed unaware she was receiving one. ``Whenever I use anyone
personally, I have never received a reduction or asked for one,''
she said. ``It would be inappropriate to expect something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand-holding that florists provide is no small thing on the
social circuit. Like fashion designers, interior designers and even
some hairstylists, florists have gone from being members of a
service class to escorts and dinner-party guests in some of the
swankest company. At a gala for the Horticultural Society of New
York on Tuesday, where the city's new and old society converged
around 40 tables set with flowers by 48 designers, Suzette de
Marigny Smith, a chairwoman of the event, described ``the very
special relationship'' some people have with florists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be little geniuses,'' she said. ``They have to
know more about you than your dressmaker and your interior
decorator and your caterer.''
</P>
<P>
   De Marigny Smith, who was wearing a Sander Witlin gold lame
dress with hand-painted irises and waving a gold wand, said,
referring to some of the florists, ``They are very amusing and
attractive people, and they are good conversationalists, and
they're just fun to have at parties _ like flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another coveted assignment for floral designers is the society
wedding. Some admit that they are willing to offer huge discounts
on jobs worth tens of thousands of dollars to have their work seen
at its most extravagant by the right crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne de Guardiola, an interior designer who takes an important
part in prominent charities like the Society of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the New York Botanical Garden
(she is fashion chairwoman of the garden's June gala), could have
hired a name-brand florist for the wedding of her stepdaughter,
Jeanne de Guardiola, next month. Instead, she is using McWilliams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be very big for me,'' McWilliams said. ``There will
be a lot of important people there who could very well recommend me
for the next step, the charity parties.'' She said she will charge
the family $50,000 to $75,000, less than half what a comparable job
for another wedding would cost.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams, who speaks to Joanne de Guardiola every week, is
planning a white and cobalt theme with lots of peonies for the
wedding, which will be in Southampton and will be attended by 400.
</P>
<P>
   Like many florists in her position, she must weigh how long she
can continue in business without making a profit on some of her
biggest jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For Beahm, who said he lives hand to mouth despite consorting
with the rich and powerful, the flower business is a dicey one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, they'll spend as little as they can get away
with,'' he said, referring to the women who ask him to send
bouquets to friends as thank-yous for a dinner party or to mark a
birthday. ``The minimum I'll let someone get away with paying is
$50, and yet they'll get a $250 bouquet. It's killing me. I have to
remind these ladies all the time that I'm not the charity.''

Sam, the help he needed in New Jersey. Sam is autistic, and his
parents' move here made the Mandels part of the phenomenon of

HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY GROWS, BUT BIG IS NO LONGER GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Money managers George Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr., who
once rattled world financial markets with mere hints of their
actions, have lost much of their punch. But hedge funds, the
investment vehicles for the wealthy that these prominent investors
epitomized, are by no means on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Though comprehensive figures are unavailable, the unregulated
hedge fund industry continues to grow. Domestic and offshore hedge
fund assets grew 23 percent to $362 billion in 1999, according to
TASS Research, a Rye., N.Y., firm that advises hedge fund clients.
Figures provided by the Hennessee Group, a New York firm that
tracks hedge funds and consults with their clients, indicate that
the industry grew by 47 percent last year to $324 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the portion of the hedge fund industry known as
``macro'' funds has seen its role greatly diminished. These are
funds like Long-Term Capital, which was rescued by a group of big
financial firms in 1998, and those run by Soros and Robertson,
which have used complex financial strategies to make large,
leveraged bets on the direction of global currency, bond and equity
markets.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1996, macro funds accounted for roughly 30 percent
of all hedge fund assets, making them by far the largest single
category, according to a Hennessee Group report. By the end of last
year, they had dwindled to about 7.2 percent of hedge fund assets.
Because of the recent demise of Robertson's Tiger Management and
the turmoil of the Soros family of funds, the portion in macro
funds will probably be smaller still at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The macro funds have been eclipsed by a core of smaller, more
nimble funds that focus on specific sectors, or larger firms that
offer collections of smaller funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the next wave,'' said Philip W. Treick, who managed
two mutual funds for the insurer Transamerica to top performances
in 1998 before departing to co-found his own hedge fund group last
year. ``It is becoming absolutely apparent that big is not good in
hedge funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The new managers are more likely to be stock pickers than the
superstars of the past. ``There is a change in the industry,'' said
Andrew J. Kessler, who co-founded the $500 million Silicon Valley
hedge fund Velocity Partners in 1996. ``We don't do macro bets. I
don't even know how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pequot Capital, a secretive investment management firm based in
Westport, Conn., that oversees $10 billion to $12 billion in more
than 18 funds, avoids macro strategies and is widely considered the
largest hedge fund manager after Soros' group, which has shrunk
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   In a London press conference this week, Soros said he thought
investors might withdraw as much as $3 billion from his $14.2
billion hedge fund empire. After incurring significant losses this
year, Soros' top two lieutenants announced a week earlier that they
were departing Soros Fund Management. Their exit came just three
weeks after the industry's other most prominent investor,
Robertson, said he was dismantling his Tiger Management investment
company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Soros and Robertson each presided over hedge fund
empires with assets of more than $20 billion, and their sway over
markets was amplified by their use of leverage and their
reputations. Soros was nicknamed `'the man who broke the pound''
after making a $10 billion bet against the British pound in 1992
that brought him a profit of at least $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite impressive long-term records, Soros and Robertson could
not keep up the pace the last two years. Besides failed bets on the
direction of currency prices like the euro, both firms were burned
by technology stocks and their transforming effects on the markets,
though in different ways. Robertson missed out largely because he
avoided technology stocks. Stanley F. Druckenmiller, who managed
Soros' flagship $8.2 billion Quantum Fund, made a significant move
into technology stocks in the middle of last year. But his
technology exposure during April's market woes led to a 22 percent
decline in the fund's performance this year, he said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The losses prompted Soros, in a letter to his shareholders, to
say that ``a large hedge fund like Quantum Fund is no longer the
best way to manage money.'' He plans to remodel Quantum as a more
conservative fund called Quantum Endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge fund clients now prefer funds that use less leverage, or
borrowed money, than Soros was known for, according to B. Scott
Reid, who oversees four hedge funds for the Auda Group, a New York
firm that manages $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want risk controls, reduced leverage and more
transparency,'' Reid says. ``They don't simply want to know if
they're making money or losing it; they want to know how it's
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The valuation models at the big firms are also being questioned.
Increasing volatility in the markets, and the wide-eyed enthusiasm
for the next new thing, has made traditional methods of valuation
less profitable of late. As the kick-the-tires investor Warren E.
Buffett notably quipped after a disappointing 1998, he would have
done better if he had gone to the movies instead of the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamental analysis says value stocks should be bought and
tech stocks sold, but that's not what was happening,'' says Charles
J. Gradante, chief investment strategist at the Hennessee Group.
Gradante believes certain macro strategies continue to succeed, but
that the rules of the game have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who were reading the tape _ in terms of currency
trends, bond market trends and stock market trends _ were making
money,'' he said. ``The people that were reading balance sheets and
income statements were losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson does not expect fundamental analysis to be forever out
of fashion. ``The market goes through these periods of
irrationality, where the worst stocks do best,'' he said last week.
``We've been in a period of irrationality for such a long time that
it hurts a rational strategy. You have a group of irrational
investors carrying the market.''
</P>
<P>
   As Soros was describing his difficulties last week, Robertson
was preparing to take his family snorkeling at the Great Barrier
Reef in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of great young people coming along,'' he said.
``It's their time to be in the sun.''

IN A CROWDED FIELD, FUSAICHI PEGASUS STANDS OUT
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ America's oldest racing traditions surrounded
19 of the world's best 3-year-old thoroughbreds Friday on the eve
of the 126th Kentucky Derby with its deep cast primed to answer the
question: Is Fusaichi Pegasus a wonder horse, or will he be
thwarted by the dense traffic in the race and the 150,000 clamorous
fans watching it?
</P>
<P>
   One answer was ventured Friday by D. Wayne Lukas, who has
entered three horses in the Derby and has won with four others,
including Charismatic last year. He considered the twists of Derby
fortunes, and said, ``It's just a matter of letting the race
unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the uncertainties of racing 1 1/4 miles with a field of
19 colts struggling to gain favorable position for the long drive
down the homestretch, which measures 1,234{ feet from the final
turn to the finish line at Churchill Downs. And most of the field
will be trying to catch Fusaichi Pegasus, the son of Mr. Prospector
who was bought for $4 million as a yearling and comes into the
Derby as either a superhorse or a potential victim of
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Lukas added, sounding like a basketball coach,
``too many times we get all caught up in strategy, and these
Hollywood scripts don't play out. Sometimes when you've got good
players, it is better not to coach them.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather was mild, almost summery, and the track was fast as
Derby Day neared. Most racing analysts seemed to agree that this
was the most tightly matched bunch of horses in years: it includes
champions from the United States, Britain and the Middle East. But
the favorite was still Fusaichi Pegasus, owned by the Japanese
venture capitalist Fusao Sekiguchi, who arrived at his horse's Barn
41 Friday morning while his trainer, Neil Drysdale, was sending the
colt through a trot of 1 1/4 miles followed by a gallop of 1 1/4
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, an Englishman who was elected to racing's Hall of Fame
this week, continued to protect his star against the growing furor
at Churchill Downs as well as the warming weather. Aside from the
fact that no favorite has won since Spectacular Bid in 1979,
Drysdale's chief problem seemed to be the balky temperament of
Fusaichi Pegasus, who might be inflamed by both the weather and the
clamor. In fact, Drysdale said his last-minute training plans for
introducing his horses to the outdoor paddock would be influenced
by the heat of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to depend on the weather,'' he said. ``It was
pretty sticky yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   At Barn 42 next door, Todd Pletcher sent his fleet of four Derby
horses through their final dress rehearsals of about 1 1/4 miles,
then said, ``They're all doing great.'' Pletcher, 36, a former
assistant to Lukas, was asked whether his speed horse More Than
Ready could last 10 furlongs one month after he ran nine in the
Blue Grass Stakes and lost to High Yield by a head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was questioned about his ability to go a mile-and-an-eighth
before the Blue Grass,'' he replied. ``And now, of course, his
ability to go 10 furlongs is in question. Then the Belmont is 12
furlongs, and that will be a question, too. But anyone who says
they know their horse can go that far is kidding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Each horse in the race will move one stall to the inside because
of the withdrawal of Globalize, who was first in the Turfway Park
Spiral and second in Keeneland's Lexington. The horse was scratched
after he was kicked by his stable pony while leaving the track
Thursday after exercising. He had held the No. 1 post position,
which now goes to last year's juvenile champion, Anees.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, will move from his
No. 11 slot to No. 10, but will still be loaded in the gate first
with Anees. Under the double-loading system, Nos. 1 and 10 are
loaded at the same time, then No. 2 (Aptitude) and No. 11 (China
Visit).
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy was galloped 1 1/4 miles Friday morning for his final
exercise, and will not go to the track the day of the race,
according to his trainer, Jenine Sahadi. She is the 10th woman to
saddle a Derby starter and probably has the best chance so far of
becoming the first to win. Shelly Riley finished second with Casual
Lies in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The international flavor of the Derby will be upheld by China
Visit and Curule, both owned by Sheik Mohammed al-Maktoum of Dubai,
who watched his colts cantering Friday morning. He was asked about
the fact that China Visit had only two races on his record, and
Curule four. But he repeated his abiding interest in winning the
Kentucky Derby, and said: ``We can win from Dubai, and we will do
it. They will not have any prep races here. From my home, which is
2 kilometers from the training center, I can see my horses. I can't
do that if they are over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, who won the Derby in 1997 with Silver Charm and in
1998 with Real Quiet, was conceded a good shot this year with
Captain Steve. The colt, who has shined in his workouts at
Churchill Downs, galloped 1 3/8 miles Saturday. Bobby Frankel, who
trains Aptitude, third in the Wood Memorial, was asked if he had
scouted any of his rivals who looked sharp, and he replied, ``The
favorite and Captain Steve.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you ever, when absent-mindedly cleaning the house, troubled
by those deep philosophical questions such as: How did we get here?
What is the meaning of life? Why does a collection of carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen atoms like me feel the need to ask such
difficult questions?
</P>
<P>
   The answers probably won't come to you while you're still
cleaning, so stop dusting and pay attention to Sorin Solomon, a
physicist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Solomon has
discovered that adaptive, almost intelligent behavior can emerge
from the interaction of just two very stupid kinds of entity.
</P>
<P>
   We'll call them angels and mortals. From their simple dance
comes an explanation for our very existence. These ideas are
embodied in a game that Solomon developed last year. In a paper
submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he shows that life
gains the upper hand in what ought to be disastrous circumstances.
It has other happy consequences, too. It shows that financial
markets will survive even in the hands of dunces. In the future it
could even provide you with an army of robot cleaners. So put your
feet up, pour yourself a glass of something refreshing, and drink a
toast to Solomon's angels.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of any system, such as life on Earth, must
somehow arise from the interaction of its simplest parts. If you
can find and map those simple interactions, whole areas of
seemingly impenetrable complex phenomena should be laid bare. Such
microscopic representations can be used to break down the Universe
into galaxies, and a nucleus into protons and neutrons. See how the
component parts work, then put them back together again, and you
should have an explanation of the most complex phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon and his team work from the bottom up, with what they
consider to be the most basic of ingredients. First they scatter a
race of ``mortals'' evenly over a square grid. Life for these
beings is bleak, as every hour a fraction of the population dies.
But there is also a ray of hope, in the form of eternal agents, or
``angels,'' scattered over the board. The mortals and angels hop
around randomly like soot particles in Brownian motion. There is
only one rule: when mortal and angel meet, the mortal multiplies.
There, in the presence of immortality, a life begins. What fate
awaits this world?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that depends on how you look at it. If you stand far from
the playing board, you see only a smeared-out cast and not the
individual players. Given the average population densities of
angels and mortals, you can work out an equation that predicts the
average death rate and birth rate. If the mortals die out faster
than they are born, the race becomes extinct.
</P>
<P>
   This way of looking at the world is called the ``continuum
approach.'' But with Solomon's microscopic representation, the
outcome is starkly different. Although the population slumps at
first, it can recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It constitutes the difference between life and death,''
Solomon says.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the continuum approach predicts extinction, the direct
simulation uncovers the emergence of a thriving, developing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuum is utterly misleading,'' says Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Why should that be? When Solomon looked closely at his game, he
found that some groups of mortals, though completely ignorant of
everything around them, appear to follow the angels around. Thanks
to the new births in each angel's presence, there is an overall
increase in the mortal population at these sites.
</P>
<P>
   The new mortals move randomly away from their birthplace, but if
the angel's random hop is onto their turf, they multiply again. The
result is islands of life that move around the playing area,
following their angels. Islands can grow, join and split up again.
Small islands are unstable, but can become more stable when they
merge to form larger islands. Because of this apparently adaptive
behavior, the pockets of population survive and proliferate. Ever
the underdog, life simply blows a raspberry at the big bad world.
But Solomon's mortals are totally unaware of their environment, and
have no life goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start with very stupid microscopic components. The islands
are made up of individuals who don't have the slightest clue of
where they are going,'' Solomon says. ``The microscopic agents are
nonadaptive, but the collective object has a behavior which can be
called adaptive.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a conclusion that can be drawn from other
simulations, says Solomon. He points to adaptive agents, generated
by John Holland, a simulations expert at Michigan State University.
According to Solomon, Holland's agents have complexity already
built in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have strategies, efficiency criteria and make choices,''
he says. ``Since you are putting it in, you can't claim that you
are studying the emergence of adaptability.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland takes the opposite view. He says he would hesitate to
describe the behavior of Solomon's system as being adaptive. He
likens it more to a kind of self-regulation maintained by feedback.
For instance, when the body's sensors register a high temperature,
they trigger the sweating mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon and his colleagues insist their model is genuinely
adaptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The islands are not just self-regulating, they are
self-serving. They move in a way that prolongs their life,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   If adaptability really does emerge at this basic level, the
implications are far-reaching. For instance, the angels could
represent the necessities of life, such as edible animals for a
population of carnivores. Most researchers into population dynamics
would treat the animals as a resource that is spread evenly across
the whole area. With just a few animals, the situation would look
grim: there wouldn't be enough meat in a given area to allow the
carnivores to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's microscopic view reveals that a few animals are bound
to be in just the right place, allowing a few bands of carnivores
to become established. Jeff Kirkwood, a population dynamics
researcher at Imperial College, London, says this close look is
particularly valuable when predicting population growth in a
diverse environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked on average, the conditions are just hopeless and
no one has any right to survive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But if there are patches where it is possible to survive, some
faster-growing species like pest plants and bacteria can hang in
there for ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the conditions get good in one little area, up they
come,'' Kirkwood says.
</P>
<P>
   The number of dimensions available on the playing board turns
out to be crucial. If Solomon lets his angels and mortals move in
three dimensions instead of two, the players tend to cross each
other's paths too rarely for life to survive. But with just two
dimensions, life always wins.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a high death rate, a single angel enables life to
flourish on Solomon's two-dimensional board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may explain the fact that most ecological systems are
two-dimensional,'' Solomon says.
</P>
<P>
   Even creatures that can move in three dimensions, like birds,
fish and microbes, tend to stick with one particular level,
limiting themselves to largely two-dimensional movement because
their particular angels _ be they light, oxygen or food _ tend to
be found within a small vertical range.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Beringer, an expert on microbial biology at
the University of Bristol: ``Microbes that need oxygen will be
found close to the surface of soil, and microbes that are very
fastidious about oxygen concentration will be found in bands at the
appropriate oxygen concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Microbes concentrating on a two-dimensional resource may have
been more successful than their cousins who tried exploiting a
three-dimensional feast. Set up the game in a slightly different
way, says Solomon, and it can explain why there is no such thing as
a duckbilled hippopotamus.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a place in real space, like a stretch of savannah,
the playing area could represent all possible ways in which genes
can be arranged. Biologists call this sort of abstract space a
fitness landscape. Now think of Solomon's angels as the perfect
genomes for the habitats and niches available, and the mortals as
species wandering through the fitness landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Far away from the perfect genome, a species will probably fade
out of existence. But around the angels, islands of similar species
will develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space of species is very sparsely populated _ there is
nothing in the space between giraffes and elephants, or between
lizards and snails,'' Solomon says.
</P>
<P>
   The finite number of environments that exist on Earth
significantly reduces the number of genomes that can survive. &QL;

<P>
   Has silicon had its chips? The next generation of computer
processors could be grown in vats of chemicals and be millions of
times faster. With components forged from single molecules, even
the tiniest chips could be vastly powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Already chemists have succeeded in making individual components.
Now they're working out how to stick them together. And it's
stretching their ingenuity to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong with silicon? Well, not a lot. But if
miniaturization continues at its present pace, by 2008 silicon
devices will probably be as small as they can get. Shrink things
too much and electrons will jump from one component to another _
the circuits simply won't be able to contain their electrons.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming this barrier to continued miniaturization is causing
a lot of head-scratching among scientists. Some think the best hope
is to abandon digital computers all together and invest in more
radical designs using DNA or bizarre quantum effects. But don't
dismiss digital computers just yet.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of scientists believe there are ways to shrink
computer components by an astonishing million-fold. And to do it
they're using some of the smallest building blocks
around-molecules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, there are two important advantages,'' says James
Ellenbogen of the MITRE Nanosystems Group in McLean, Virginia. ``It
makes use of a lot of good stuff we already know about building and
programming digital computers. And it allows us to go to the very
limits of miniaturization.''
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of just how small that could be, consider the
differences between today's micro-devices, such as transistors, and
molecules. A modern computer contains about a billion transistors.
If everyone on the planet had 10 computers, they would contain 60
billion transistors in total. But there are ten thousand times as
many molecules in a single gulp of water. Of course, water
molecules aren't computer components, but researchers have made
other molecules that are. And they don't think it'll take long to
build them into molecular computers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of forging electronic components from single molecules
was first proposed in 1974 by Ari Aviram of IBM's T. J. Watson
Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, and Mark Ratner, now
at Northwestern University in Illinois. But it took researchers
until 1996 to make a key breakthrough. By adding sulphur-containing
``thiol'' molecules to the most basic of molecular devices _ a wire
_ they were able to anchor wires to a gold sheet and for the first
time, run currents through them.
</P>
<P>
   These wires, designed by Jim Tour of Rice University in Houston,
Texas, and his colleagues at Pennsylvania State University were
based on a molecule called polyphenylene, essentially a long chain
of carbon rings. In most molecules, the electrons that bind them
together move in well-defined orbitals. But in polyphenylene, these
electron orbitals overlap, forming a conducting channel along the
length of the molecule.
</P>
<P>
   To get a current to run down one of these ``Tour wires'', you
just have to apply a voltage across it. A wire is fine, but by
itself it isn't going to get any computing done. For that you need
switches. So Tour and his colleagues set about making one.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, they came up with a molecular version of a diode _ a
type of switch that works by letting current flow in one direction
only. To make it, Tour took two polyphenylene wires and linked them
together with an insulating molecule, such as methylene. To one
wire he added two ``methoxy'' molecules that pushed electrons into
the wire. To the other, he added two ``cyano'' molecules that drew
electrons out of the wire. This makes current flow far more easily
in one direction than the other. By linking these together to make
a molecular diode, you can make some useful electronics.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Ellenbogen and his colleagues are doing back
at MITRE. Using molecular diodes, they're designing logic gates-the
electronic circuitry needed to crunch numbers. As well as common
logic gate s such as AND, NOT and XOR, they've drawn up plans for a
complex molecular ``half adder,'' a fundamental computer circuit
that takes two binary digits and adds them together.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the half adder may look like a sprawling
super-molecule, but it takes up only 100 square nanometers _ at
least a million times smaller than its silicon counterpart. Of
course, no computer would be complete without a memory, but this is
an easier problem to solve _ you just need a bank of on/off
switches.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Tour and Mark Reed at Yale University revealed just
such a device-a simple molecular memory that could be written to
and read electronically. Throw all these components together and
you have got the essentials for a working computer. So where can
you buy one? Well, nowhere right now, because a lot of thorny
problems still need to be overcome, like how to actually make one.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know that the molecules they've created should work
as electronic components. But that's not the same as building them.
Armed with a good knowledge of organic chemistry, however, and
there's no reason why researchers shouldn't be able to produce
millions of these molecules.
</P>
<P>
   The next stumbling block will be connecting them altogether. One
way to do this could be to use a machine called a scanning
tunneling microscope. This has a very fine tip that can push
molecules, or even atoms, around-as demonstrated in 1990 when IBM
researchers spelt out their company name with 35 xenon atoms. But
there are two problems with direct manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Some molecules stick to the surface they're on and break apart.
Others simply go flying when you touch them. Even if molecules
could be pushed into the right positions one by one, how long would
it take to hook up the 10 million needed to make the molecular
equivalent of a Pentium chip? There might be a way to automate the
process, but it would take some doing.
</P>
<P>
   A more complex, but far quicker and more elegant approach could
be to make the molecules ``self-assemble'' _ arrange themselves
into the circuits you're trying to build. With thiols attached like
crocodile clips, Tour made his wires stand up on gold sheets. But
making complicated circuits with different components is a much
bigger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more complexity you want out of them, the tougher it will
get,'' Tour says. But there's worse to come.
</P>
<P>
   You've still got the problem of how to achieve gain in a
molecular computer. Electrons lose energy as they zip around
circuits, so currents need to be boosted to make sure they don't
become too weak. In electronics, transistors hooked up to a
separate power supply top up weak currents, but so far, no one has
created a molecular transistor. Without that, the already faint
signals in a molecular circuit could easily drop below a useful
level.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty is a result of miniaturization itself. How
would you connect a keyboard and screen to such a tiny processor?
In conventional computers, this is fairly straightforward. But when
you're trying to connect things to the nanoworld, where components
and currents are orders of magnitude smaller, it won't be so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting individual molecules to each other will be tricky
too. Once you start trying to get billions of devices hooked up
together, the number of interconnections shoots up, and with it the
potential problems. Since these devices will be so small, tiny
defects could cause big problems. Even if a single molecular device
in a billion has a dodgy connection, a chip with a billion devices
would throw up errors. But designers may be able to work around
this problem.
</P>
<P>
   According to Terry Fountain, an expert in computer architecture
at University College London, molecular computers must be built to
cope with defects such as faulty circuitry and defective
components. Each component, he says, will need as many as a hundred
back-up copies-built-in ``redundancy'' _ to ensure that at least
one copy works. But this raises an obvious point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to build a hundred transistors to get one to work,
maybe you shouldn't build them so small in the first place,'' he
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more hopeful. A collaboration between James Heath's
group at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Phil
Kuekes's team at Hewlett-Packard's labs in Palo Alto, Calif.,
resulted in a computer that can tolerate defective components. The
Teramac, as it is known, was built with standard silicon devices.
The difference is that Heath and Kuekes deliberately used thousands
of faulty components, but still ended up with a working computer.
</P>
<P>
   Teramac's circuits have a special layout that allows the
computer to redesign itself. First it tests which of its circuits
work and which don't, then it finds a way to route signals around
the damaged parts. A similar design might work for self-assembled
molecular computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important lesson of Teramac for nanotechnology is that a
system doesn't have to be perfect to be very powerful,'' says Stan
Williams, head of basic research at Hewlett-Packard. ``And the more
defects a system can tolerate, the cheaper it will be to build.''
</P>
<P>
   A simpler way to go, according to Tour and Keukes, might be to
give up trying to create chips according to specific designs.
Instead, key components and their connections could be ``grown''
randomly using self-assembly. Each chip would be different and
would have to be tested to see what inputs produce what outputs.
</P>
<P>
   Some would probably not work at all, while some would work
better for certain applications than others. ``You could say, 'Hey,
this one's great-let me use it in a Cray computer.' The next one,
say there are a lot of faulty circuits, you would put that one in a
toaster,'' says Tour
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, even if scientists work out how to make molecular
components, they might not be able to take full advantage of the
miniaturization they promise. The problem is heat. With all those
electrons charging around inside them, even the relatively gigantic
chips in your personal computer heat up. Molecular circuits packed
a million times more densely will get extremely hot-a processor
could get as hot as a stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will fry,'' Tour says.
</P>
<P>
   One hope is that some yet-to-be-discovered material capable of
removing excess heat could prevent molecular computers from
disintegrating into smoldering blobs. Tour, however, proposes
another strategy.
</P>
<P>
   He believes molecular computers could work without a single
electron having to move around a circuit. Feel the force Instead of
using electric currents, Tour says signals could be passed from one
component to another using electrostatic potentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose you have an electron in your left hand and an electron
in your right hand,'' Tour says. ``As soon as you bring them close
together, they'll feel a repulsion. Likewise, if you bring a charge
up next to a molecule, you'll cause a shift in its electric
field.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in the electric field could be used as the signal.
And no moving electrons means no heat. The idea isn't new, Tour
points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how molecules talk to each other in nature _ they
sense changes in each other's electrostatic potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour has good reason to believe the same principle could work in
molecular computers. A group led by Craig Lent at the University of
Notre Dame in Indiana has already proved the principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's built an electrostatic working system,'' says Tour.
``It's very large-micron sized. What we're saying is we can
extrapolate that down to the molecular scale.''
</P>
<P>
   And doing so wouldn't require brand new materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``All molecules have the potential to work electrostatically,''
Tour says. ``Some are just better than others.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as getting around the problem of overheating,
electrostatic computing has other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of interaction is around six orders of magnitude
faster than where we are now with a typical current in a
computer,'' says Tour. ``It will literally be lightning fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Other strategies for preventing overheating are being
investigated. One is to pack molecular circuits less densely. This
would appear to defeat the object of molecular computing, but it's
not as absurd as it sounds. You could leave plenty of room between
molecular components and still pack them one hundred thousand times
more densely than today's chips.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more curious is Ellenbogen's suggestion to run
chips slower than ever. He says that by packing molecular circuits
very tightly and designing them for specialized tasks, you could
run each device very slowly and still get huge computing power. In
the brain, neurons fire a modest 100 times a second, passing
signals 5 million times slower than a modern computer. But since
neurons are jammed together so closely, and brain structures are so
specialized, you end up with an extremely effective computer. The
brain, though, is adept at processing many signals at once-parallel
processing-which accounts for much of its power.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the technological advances still needed to make
molecular computers work, you could be forgiven for thinking it's a
hopeless task.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellenbogen disagrees, pointing to the history of silicon
chips. ``Etching a circuit in a silicon chip is complicated. It
requires very sophisticated chemistry,'' he says. ``The only reason
it looks simple to us now is because we've been doing it for 40
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour believes the remaining hurdles are surmountable, and even
predicts that hybrid systems using traditional and molecular
components will appear within two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes me think it's going to work? All the pieces point
to it working,'' he says. ``We can self-assemble these things _
order them on surfaces _ we can make working logic gates out of
them. We are doing this, we are making this work. It's not a matter
of what makes me think this'll work. It's working already.'' &QL;

<P>
   Ice palaces are the stuff of legend.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two centuries, Russia and then North America
witnessed a succession of these creations, each more elaborate and
preposterous than the one before. They were short-lived, glittering
places of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest was built in 1740 on the whim of a Russian
empress, who reputedly forced a shivering courtier and his bride to
spend their wedding night inside on a bed of ice, with guards
around the walls lest they try to escape.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, am about to spend an unguarded night in
the modern equivalent _ an ice hotel. Yes, my bed is also made of
ice and my room unheated. And I am staying here without the Empress
Anna's military encouragement. The truth is, I'm fascinated by ice.
And for ice junkies, the Swedish hamlet of Jukkasjarvi 200
kilometers north of the Arctic Circle is clearly the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Every winter for the past 10 years, Jukkasjarvi has been the
site of a hotel made entirely of snow and ice. The first was built
in 1989 to house an art exhibition. A few hearty souls decided to
spend the night inside, and the idea took off. Now there are more
than 6,000 overnight guests in a season, and many more day
visitors. Some come to get married or baptized in the ice chapel.
Others come for the dare, or-like me-to witness the closest living
relative of the old ice palaces.
</P>
<P>
   You are probably wondering: How do you build a 37-room hotel to
last 5 months from such an unpromising starting material? And what
does it feel like to see your painstaking efforts melt away come
the spring?
</P>
<P>
   The first rule of snow building is that there are no vertical
walls. The hotel is made up of interconnecting arched hallways, the
arches not quite semicircular. The white, sloping walls of the
entrance hall are reassuringly solid, and the ceiling is propped up
by cylindrical columns of ice, some blue-green and flecked with
bubbles, some perfectly clear. Overhead is a sparkling chandelier
of ice crystals. The ends of the hallway are closed off by huge
windows made of ice blocks, rendered opaque by intricate carvings.
At the far end of the hall, raised on a dais, stands a fairy-tale
ice throne strewn with reindeer skins.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide Anna explains that it was created for the Queen of
Sweden, who came in December.
</P>
<P>
   Another hallway leads into the bar, where Anna pauses by a stack
of ice glasses: cubes of ice drilled with a cylindrical hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you drink vodka 'in' the rocks,'' she says, and the
group laughs nervously.
</P>
<P>
   She demonstrates how to slide an ice glass, cowboy style, along
the translucent bar. Sitting beyond the bar, on an ice bench
comfortably draped with reindeer skins, is Mark Szulgit, one of the
hotel's architects. He worked on adobe buildings in the desert
before he discovered ice.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques, he says, are surprisingly similar, and the trick
is to avoid stresses that stretch the material. Instead, you have
to keep it under compression.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stack a pile of sugar cubes on your table and push
them, they'll fall over,'' he says. ``But if you use gravity to
hold them together, they'll stay there until there's an
earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains the shape of the snow arches. To keep them under
compression, says Szulgit, you need a catenary arch, which is
slightly higher than it is wide.
</P>
<P>
   The arches are made from a combination of snow and ice, which
the designers call snice. They start in November, using snowmaking
machines. First, they line up a row of metal frames and coat them
with a mix of snow and water. In temperatures that can drop to
minus 30 degrees Celsius or less, the snice takes only a couple of
days to become rock solid. The frames can then be slid out and
moved on to make the next part of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snice is incredibly strong,'' says Ake Larsson, one of the
hotel's five owners. ``You could drive a car on this roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The ice for the columns _ and for the windows and sculptures _
comes from the Torne river, which runs alongside the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wild river,'' says Arne Bergh, another of the owners.
</P>
<P>
   There are no hydroelectric plants or factories, and the ice it
produces is as clear as glass. Special tools are needed to cut the
ice. Saws designed for wood or metal wouldn't work, because ice is
too soft.
</P>
<P>
   Individual ice blocks for the columns and windows are dragged up
into the growing hotel, and welded with water. At these
temperatures, says Larsson, ``it's like superglue.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to bring in an army of artists to create the
sculptures and model the rooms. The hotel designers are very
particular about the art inside, and are scornful about traditional
ice carvings of swans and pagodas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bring contemporary artists, teach them the crafts and they
create from their temperaments,'' Bergh says. ``You won't find pink
swans here.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the lighting, Bergh says, it's a constant battle to
produce light without heat. The chandelier is lit from a projector
on the roof, which feeds into a bundle of fiber-optic cables.
Behind the sculptures are low-wattage halogen lamps, and the bar
has a gentle neon strip light. The purism extends to the color
schemes, which are designed to emphasize the cold.
</P>
<P>
   To power the lighting, the hotel walls contain many kilometers
of cables, frozen into the ice. And while there may be electricity,
there is certainly no heating. The temperature inside the hotel is
a steady minus 6 degrees Celsius, which makes lingering in your
room rather improbable.
</P>
<P>
   I turn down one of the smaller corridors, eager to explore. The
scuffed snow floor dulls any sounds, the white walls and ceilings
are low, and candles gutter in sockets along the walls. It feels
for all the world like a convent cloister, pervaded with a vague
smell of reindeer skin and burning wax.
</P>
<P>
   Every room in the hotel is different. Mine turns out to be quite
plain, with just a few small carvings in the wall and a huge ice
bed draped yet again with reindeer skins. But along the corridor, I
find a room to gladden every Viking heart. The bed is dominated by
two stylish dragons carved into the foot. There is an ice tablet
covered in runes by the side of the bed, and Norse symbols cut into
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ice hotels are springing up in Finland, Norway and Canada too.
So what's the appeal? Staying the night here means a miserable few
hours on a hard, cold bed and reindeer skins for company. True, you
get a hot drink when you wake, and can then head straight off to
the sauna. But for 5-star prices, it's not exactly 5-star comfort.
</P>
<P>
   People are fascinated by giant ice and snow. It's the clarity
and coldness. They find something very pure in it. &QL;

   The postcard shows a fur-clad woman cowering in the back of a
cave. In the foreground, her manly-looking husband deftly carves a
female figurine. This image from a French archaeological museum
reflects current ideas of human society in the Ice Age, about
28,000 years ago. Man the hunter is also cast in the role of
sensitive artist, while his partner fades into the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image is almost certainly wrong,'' says Jim Adovasio.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully carved female forms _ the so-called Venus figurines
_ are some of the earliest works of art. Their often explicit
sexuality has led archaeologists to see them as fertility symbols
or mother goddesses. But Adovasio, from Mercyhurst College in
Pennsylvania, and his colleagues want to rewrite the history books.
</P>
<P>
   They have discovered what look like carvings of woven fabric
detailed on the figurines. If they are correct, it means that
textiles were being made long before anyone ever suspected. It also
challenges old ideas about the status of men and women, and who did
what to fill the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   Notions about how our Palaeolithic ancestors lived come mostly
from evidence in ancient stones and bones. They paint a picture of
macho men wielding stone-tipped spears as they hunted for mammoths.
In reality, though, the great majority of material that Ice Age
people worked with probably came from plants.
</P>
<P>
   In technologically simple societies today, and in more recent
archaeological sites, people used 20 times as much plant material
as stone. But it is only in the past couple of decades that
archaeologists have started to get a handle on this missing matter.
Adovasio's lab is leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first glimpse of evidence for Palaeolithic weaving
five years ago when, lacking a proper screen, he projected a slide
showing a strangely embossed piece of ancient ceramic onto the door
of a refrigerator belonging to his colleague Olga Soffer from the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was immediately obvious to us that the image was of the
warp and weft of woven fabric,'' recalls Adovasio, who has spent
many years working with ancient textiles.
</P>
<P>
   That set them off scrambling for more evidence. Working with
David Hyland, also at Mercyhurst College, they found a rich vein in
the archaeological sites of the Czech Republic, where ancient
domestic conflagrations had fired wet clay, leaving traces of
textiles on the surfaces. So far, they have analysed 100-odd small
fragments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to us that by 28,000 years ago, people had
developed technologies for sophisticated weaving of textiles,
making nets, and plaiting and coiling baskets, using plant
material,'' says Soffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is very exciting,'' says Sarah Nelson from the
University of Denver in Colorado. ``It fits into what people have
begun to say must be there.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no known fragments of woven fabric in the
archaeological record from this time, but Adovasio and his
colleagues realised that there might be clues on the Venus
figurines. About half of them have patterns on the head that have
been interpreted as Ice Age hairdos, or around the arms, chest and
waist that are usually thought to be tattoos or cloth made of
animal skins.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers started to look at these patterns under
low-power microscopy, however, they saw depictions of twined or
plain woven cloth, like the indentations Adovasio and Soffer had
noticed on the ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been handling these figurines for 100 years, and
they have been so overwhelmed by the sexual imagery that they
barely saw these patterns, let alone analysed them,'' Adovasio
says. ``But when you point it out to people, they say, 'Of course,
it's so obvious'.''
</P>
<P>
   The detail of the carving is extraordinary. On the famous Venus
of Willendorf, for example, the criss-cross pattern on the head,
once thought to represent plaited hair, turns out to be a
representation of a fiber-based woven cap. The patterns on the
lower body of the Venus of Lespuge depict a kind of skirt made from
11 cords. The carver even went to the trouble of depicting the
cords in one section as fraying at the hem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you could carve just by looking at
textiles,'' Adovasio says. ``You have to know how the weaving or
plaiting is done technically.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's technologically simple societies, women do most of
the weaving. If the carvers were also the weavers, then it might
have been the women who fashioned the figurines.
</P>
<P>
   ``That challenges a lot of unquestioned assumptions in
archaeology,'' Soffer says.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the sophistication of the textiles implies that
their production was very labor intensive and required great skill.
The researchers believe that these were probably ritual items _
symbols of achievement _ not daily garb. If so, they say, Ice Age
women were not the subservient preparers of food and bearers of
children as has been assumed, but individuals with social prestige
and power.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Conkey from the University of California, Berkeley,
believes that such inferences about social status may be ``getting
onto shaky ground''. Nevertheless, she concedes: ``This work is
important because it forces people to sit back and figure out what
questions need to be asked to get a deeper understanding of past
societies. They are rattling a few cages, and that's terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   In the practical realm of subsistence, the ability to make nets
would bring new ways of acquiring meat. Armed with nets,
Palaeolithic people, including women, children and older people,
could have caught rabbits and other small game. ``This is a much
more realistic picture of what was probably going on in the Upper
Palaeolithic,'' Conkey says.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings challenge our thinking about what technologies
characterize advances at this critical time in human evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the explosion of weaving was one of the
signature technological elements of our species,'' Adovasio says.
</P>
<P>
   For Soffer, the work has a personal side, too. Before becoming
an archaeologist, she was a fashion promoter and coordinator for
Federated Department Stores in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she says, ``it closes the circle for me very nicely.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST WINDSOR, N.J. _ One family came from India, others from
Greece, Italy and Israel. An Australian family is thinking about
coming. By comparison, Rob and Anne Mandel had it pretty easy,
giving up his medical practice and a life they loved in Indiana to
get their son, Sam, the help he needed in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is autistic, and his parents' move here made the Mandels
part of a phenomenon: families that, desperate for the most
sophisticated special education services for their disabled
children, have moved from other states and even other nations in
search of care.
</P>
<P>
   But, increasingly, the needs of parents with autistic children
are clashing with the bottom lines of school districts that have to
pay for enormously expensive services _ often more than $40,000 per
child per year _ for students who may never set foot in district
classrooms, but will be sent to private institutions at a school
district's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Most districts are sympathetic to the needs of families,
increasingly armed with sophisticated knowledge about programs and
treatments, who uproot themselves to get their children the best
care. But many districts, particularly in states like New Jersey
with programs that are magnets for families around the country and
the world, say schools are bearing too much of the cost with too
little control over which children get what care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driving the suburban school districts crazy,'' said James
H. Lytle, the superintendent of Trenton's public schools. ``If you
have eight kids who need to go to a special school, you have to go
to your taxpayers for $400,000. That's essentially like sending
them all to Andover.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lytle added, ``I hate the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1975 federal law, guarantees a ``free and appropriate public
education'' for all disabled students. But the education available
in most places cannot compare with what is offered in states like
New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which have the most
sophisticated private programs for treating autism. So families,
many of whom share information on the Internet, are increasingly
relocating to areas with the best programs.
</P>
<P>
   Total school enrollment in New Jersey grew by 11.8 percent from
1991 to 1997, the most recent year for which comparable figures are
available. The number of disabled students increased by 14 percent.
The number of autistic children registered in New Jersey increased
sevenfold, from 234 to 1,634.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the increase may be due to better diagnostic methods or
the inclusion of children with behaviors that resemble autism. But
migration obviously plays a major role.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a parent of a child that has been diagnosed with
something like autism, you are not going to wait,'' said Gary S.
Mayerson, a New York lawyer who specializes in representing
families battling school districts over care for disabled children.
``You are going to look at your beautiful house and realize that it
is a noose around your neck. So people are moving all over the
country to get to states that are most responsive to their child's
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment most in demand for autism is a method known as
applied behavioral analysis, a form of highly structured and very
expensive one-on-one coaching by trained teachers. While other
treatments try to help youngsters cope with their disabilities,
applied behavioral analysis, administered at an early age, offers
children the possibility of eventually being able to attend regular
classes, its advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   So parents flock to the Princeton Child Development Institute,
where Sam Mandel and 34 other students are enrolled, or the Eden
Institute, in West Windsor, N.J., or to the Martin C. Barell
School, in Levittown, N.Y. And they go to the Connecticut Child
Development Center in Milford, where a couple from India showed up
with their child earlier this month, hoping in vain to gain
enrollment even though the school was full, said Suzanne Letso, the
school's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a doctor _ I sent people to have sophisticated tests all
the time in Indiana,'' Dr. Mandel, an anesthesiologist, said. For
that reason, he said, ``I thought there was no reason to be closer
to New York City to get these sophisticated services for Sam. But
you know what? There's nothing back there like what we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   For $46,024.20 per year, the Princeton institute provides 10
months of intensive training to help autistic children discover a
sense of the rewards of learning that they are born without.
Although they may be capable of brilliant feats of intellect _
think of Dustin Hoffman's character in ``Rain Man'' _ autistic
children totally lack both curiosity about the world and the
instinct to learn by imitating other children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Krantz, director of the Princeton institute, said that
half the children who came to her school early enough were sent to
regular classrooms within five years. If people object to paying
something like $200,000 to achieve such a goal, she said, they
should think of the alternative: a lifetime of
institutionalization, ``not to mention the human cost.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mandel is making spectacular progress, his parents say. But
for every winner like him, the huge expense of special education
programs and the scarcity of places at the most sought-after
schools also create losers. Only a comparative handful of autistic
children gain admission to the best private programs, and they tend
to be the children of parents with the education and money and
careers that permit them to move from state to state and from
country to country to seek out those programs.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer in India, for example, researched his child's
disability over the Internet and pinpointed Lawrence Township,
N.J., as a good place for treatment, said Terry Rosenfeld,
Lawrence's director of special education. Then he found a job at
Bell Laboratories in Hopewell, secured the necessary work papers to
allow him to immigrate, and moved his family to Lawrence. Rosenfeld
said eight severely handicapped children who had moved to the
district to receive treatment were now enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have parents moving in just for these
services,'' said Susan DiDonato, director of special services for
West Windsor-Plainsboro public schools. ``Sometimes they call ahead
and ask us what we have available.''
</P>
<P>
   But the migration and the legal requirements for ``appropriate''
education raise issues of cost and control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents' definition of appropriate and the district's
definition of appropriate are often very different,'' said
Rosenfeld. If the disagreement leads to litigation, ``when you go
to court, the courts often look at what parents are saying before
they listen to us,'' he added. ``And that is why, to me, I think
the system is totally out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rosenfeld suggested, local schools want control over the
assignment of students and their education plans, and generally
favor local or county-based programs, typically at a local
community college. Parents complain that the local programs, while
cheaper, do not offer enough hours of training per week, let alone
the special benefits like home visits that places like the
Princeton institute offer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law requires the federal government to to pay 40
percent of a the cost of services provided under the education act.
But the government has never paid his district more than 8 percent,
Rosenfeld said. The state, meanwhile, reimburses school districts
on a sliding scale, depending on the severity of the disability,
but never more than $11,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators, in defense of the special-care migrants, say
that parents who relocate should be applauded for placing
confidence in their new homes' school systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, we should be proud that we are so successful,''
said Barbara Gantwerk, director of the Office of Special Education
Programs at the New Jersey Department of Education. Indeed,
advocates for the children say, the biggest problem is not what it
costs to educate such children at the best treatment centers, but
that not enough children get that care.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenfeld, at Lawrence public schools, said he was deeply
discouraged over the drain that expensive treatments for a few
children were imposing on other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents will do absolutely anything for their children,
and it's wonderful that these kids have such great advocates,''
Rosenfeld said. ``But it costs a lot of money, and that money has
to come from other programs.''
</P>
<P>
   And for families, everything is secondary to getting results for
their children. So when Tim and Leslie Quinn of Charlotte, N.C.,
realized their son Ryan, now 4, showed signs of autism, Tim Quinn
transferred to his company's headquarters in Hackettstown, N.J. The
Quinns sold their dream house in Charlotte, took their two teen-age
daughters out of high school and moved to Belle Meade, in the
Hillsborough school district, to enroll Ryan in the Princeton
school.
</P>
<P>
   They have no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan has shocked us all,'' Quinn said. ``Up until September he
was not speaking and he was not doing a lot of things, and it was
very discouraging. But then he started speaking, and he's doing
very well.''

MAT MLADIN: MOTORCYCLE RACING'S JEFF GORDON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mat Mladin was casually explaining how he broke
his back.
</P>
<P>
   He was eating a piece of sourdough bread at a restaurant before
heading north to Sonoma County to race this weekend at Sears Point
in the AMA Superbike Challenge. As he munched, his mind happened to
wander back over the years to 1994, to the day he and his
motorcycle parted company for the briefest, most frightening
moment.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Perth, Australia. Not that Mladin's from Perth. He
grew up outside Sydney, and still has a place there, although he
spends most of his time in Las Vegas these days. He was speeding
down a hill in practice, doing something like 130 or 140 mph, and
wouldn't you just know, he got himself into false neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``False neutral'' was Mladin's phrase, and he said it as
matter-of-factly as someone might say ``Pass the mustard.'' So he
was in false neutral and found he had no chance to get his bike
back in gear, not with that wall gaining on him at warp speed. So
he jumped off the bike and landed in a sand trap. And he didn't
think anything about the accident after that, except for being out
of breath all the time, and not being able to suck in a good
lungful of air.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled at that detail about not being able to breathe. He ate
a bit of Caesar Salad. He's 28 and in remarkably good health, and
because he won this race last year at Sears Point and because he
was last year's AMA Chevy Trucks US Superbike champ, any time he
``throws it away'' (motorcycle slang for crashing), it's big news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raced the following day,'' he announced to the people eating
at his table. ``Do you believe me?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No one was about to question his veracity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I did,'' he said. ``I had gone to the hospital for
X-rays, but they didn't pick up any problem. I thought I just took
a good hard bang. I spent all night in the Jacuzzi. They kept a guy
with me to make sure I didn't drown. The next day it was raining. I
finished sixth in the first race and first in the second race. I
couldn't bend at all. I looked funny.'' Mladin smiled at the memory
of how funny he looked. Broken backs will do that to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks later, I hadn't improved,'' he said. ``I told my mom
something was wrong. So they gave me some more tests and they
picked up that I had five fractured vertebrae and three
compressions.''
</P>
<P>
   People at the table praised Mladin on his high pain threshold,
but he brushed them aside. ``It's just something you do,'' he said.
``You've got to race. It's a championship. You don't always get the
day off from work because you've got a cold or the flu, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Mladin started racing motorcycles at age 4, which means he was a
child prodigy, which means he's something like the Jeff Gordon of
superbikers. He went through the 10th grade in school, but only
because he had to. ``I would have left earlier if I could have,''
he said. ``I wasn't allowed. I really didn't care for school. I
loved bikes. School just got in the way of practicing.'' School
always gets in the way of something.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of those racers who loves Sears Point. He's a
road-course guy. Some aren't. Some want to ride around in circles
with no surprises _ maybe they approach life that way, too. And
although Mladin can't gun his Suzuki past 155 at Sears Point (he
pushes 190 at other tracks), he likes to say, ``Sears Point is one
of the most technical race tracks.'' By ``technical'' he means
hardly any straightaways and a certain number of blind turns. These
kinds of things turn him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some tracks,'' he said, ``you take two riders and give them
the same bike, they'll finish very close together at the end. Sears
Point is different. It rewards how well you set up your bike, how
well you think. It rewards you if you're an aggressive rider who
hangs it out all race.'' In other words, Mladin is a thinking
person's superbike racer. He likes solving problems.
</P>
<P>
   He's cleverly solved the problem of how to get from track to
track. You probably know that Winston Cup drivers fly from race to
race like royalty. On race day at Sears Point you can see some of
them being coptered in so they don't get caught in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   That copter business isn't for Mladin. He doesn't stay at a
fancy hotel even though top superbike racers can earn upwards of
$1.5 million a season. He bought himself a motor home in which he
and his wife Janine tool around the country. They park that baby at
the track and set up house right there on top of the grease and the
old engine oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of it,'' Mladin said, not that everyone
would find a motor home beautiful. ``I can eat what I want and I
won't get food poisoning because Janine does all the cooking. I've
got a microwave, washer and dryer, satellite TV and a DVD player.
When you get more money you can afford motor homes. More and more
of the racers are doing that.'' And you can just picture it, the
cream of the crop of superbikers hanging out in the dark night at
the track, roasting weenies, swapping yarns and avoiding food
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live for my racing,'' Mladin said.
</P>
<P>
   We believe you, Mat.

DETROIT SCHOOL DISTRICT'S NEW CEO HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mich.)   By NICHOLD M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Detroit's troubled school district has selected as its
new chief executive Dr. Kenneth Burnley, a Colorado Springs
superintendent known for making tough decisions and increasing
parental involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Burnley, a 58-year-old Detroit native, will take over the
172,000-student district, the state's largest, at a time of immense
turmoil. It will be his job to shepherd a $1.4 billion bond
construction project for 69 new schools, raise, test scores, which
for years have trailed state and national averages, and repair a
payroll system that routinely issues late checks.
</P>
<P>
   He will also be responsible for a $1.9 billion budget, 10 times
the budget of Colorado Springs District No. 11, where he worked for
13 years. That district, which has struggled financially, has 263
schools and 33,500 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't be an easy job,'' said Burnley, who was
superintendent of schools in Fairbanks, Alaska, before moving to
Colorado. ``There is a lot of heavy lifting that needs to be done
to focus on our young people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would commute between Detroit and Colorado Springs
through the end of June. The job here, which could pay him up to
$250,000 a year, is unusual because, as the school CEO, he has the
authority to approve budgets and contracts without input from a
school board. The CEO post was created last year when the state
took over the troubled district and removed its superintendent and
elected school board
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Burnley took the Detroit board 11 months, a job that
proved challenging in part because at least a dozen other cities
are looking for school superintendents and the jobs have become
increasingly difficult to fill.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the difficulty was a complicated state school reform
law that allows Michigan's governor, John Engler, to appoint one of
the district's seven board members and grant that person sole veto
power in the selection of a new CEO. Mayor Dennis Archer appoints
the other six members of the board.
</P>
<P>
   In January the board's first choice, John Thomson, former
superintendent of schools in Tulsa, Okla., was vetoed by the
governor's appointee, Mark Murray, the state treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But after a three-hour interview late Thursday night, the board
took just five minutes to unanimously select Burnley.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leadership, his vision were all well stated ,'' said
Freeman Hendrix, the board's chairman. ``He did more than just talk
philosophically about what needs to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Burnley is a graduate of the district and was
reared in a pro-union family in this heavily unionized citywere
bonuses, Hendrix said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he did not regret delaying Detroit's search. ``This
is a very powerful position,'' he said. ``You take as much time as
you need to make a good choice.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Burnley's work in Colorado Springs say he
is quite capable of wrestling with Detroit's problems. Critics and
supporters in Colorado Springs cheer him for creating an outreach
program that has recruited more than 7,000 parents as volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the American Association of School Administrators named
Burnley superintendent of the year. He also That same year, he
raised eyebrows by making the district the first in the nation to
allow major companies to advertise in the schools. Through contract
with more than 50 companies, including Coke, the district had been
able to draw $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Burnley was criticized for recommending that the
district close five schools to save money after a school millage
failed. The board sided with the community, deciding to keep the
schools open for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he doesn't listen as well he should,'' said Kathy
Glasmann, president of the Colorado Springs Education Association.
``But he's very pro-teacher and willing to try new things. It's a
real loss.''

 &HT;    Amid all Derby stories, expect `Pegasus' to fall
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, KY _ Outside Barn 42, where Dogwood Stable's hopes
for the 126th Kentucky Derby are in residence, there was much
jollifying. Cot Campbell, master of Dogwood, was accommodating
photographers with his series of grotesque masks. Trippi, the colt
bearing the name of the old football character from Georgia, was
wearing a thin, white cloak as he nibbled in the grass while being
admired. (Most women have never seen the thoroughbred they don't
admire.) Lila Campbell was fondling the harmonica on which she had
learned to play ``Old Kentucky Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment was in his stall, bobbing and weaving, as if begging
attention. All week, Trippi has been the attraction, not just
because he is unbeaten, but the name. The name, though it has been
half a century since the heyday of old Charlie himself.
Impeachment, a $260,000 purchase, has a name that draws snickers,
out of a filly named Misconduct, whose daddy was named Criminal
Type. You draw your own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a little alcove of an office sat the topic of note. Todd
Pletcher is a 32-year-old by a former trainer named Jake, as bright
as he is young, but serious in his work, especially this week. He
has worked the Derby before as an assistant to D. Wayne Lukas. Now
he has four _ count 'em, four _ horses in his first Kentucky Derby
on his own, the two Dogwood horses, More Than Ready and Graeme
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He sat at his desk in the office, wearing a baseball-type cap,
poring over papers, but with time to be affable. ``You try to be
fair to them all,'' he said. ``Having four is really not much more
trouble than one, just get out early and do the same thing four
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider him more an executive director than trainer. The new
variety of trainer that has sprung up is far removed from the old
hardboots who came with the farm or were seasoned in the bluegrass.
Pletcher is a college graduate, degree in animal science at
Arizona, now lives in New York and has made quite a dent in racing
on the East Coast. Call it his first Derby, if you choose, but he
was trainer-behind-the-scene of Thunder Gulch, winner in 1996, but
unsung in his own stable.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers now come to the Derby in all shapes, sizes and
heritage, all for one reason _ to win the most cherished prize in
horse racing. There are, and have been, trainers here from
Yugoslavia, England, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Brooklyn,
Canada, France and none more avid in the pursuit than the Godolphin
Stable of Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum. The sheikh has been in form
this week, visiting around, shaking hands with the great and
near-great, handing out blue shirts, caps and windbreakers with the
Godolphin insignia at his barn. And talking more of Dubai
Millennium, who won the rich Dubai Stakes, than his two Derby
visitors, China Visit and Curule.
</P>
<P>
   The sheikh's trainer is one of his own, Saeed bin Suroor, who
speaks passionately of winning the Derby. Winning a Derby, however,
says D. Wayne Lukas, ``is no guarantee of prolonged success. David
Cross (Sunny's Halo, 1983) is running a kitchen in California. Cam
Gamboloti (Spend a Buck, 1985) now has a small stable, and Jack van
Berg has had some hard times since Alysheba.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said of jockeys. Pat Valenzuela won with
Sunday Silence, fell into the drug pit and is now down and out in
California. Chris Antley, the comeback kid of '99, hasn't been able
to keep his weight down, and he won't be defending his title.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a female trainer on the grounds this week, Jenine
Sahadi, who is Lebanese and known to spike her horses' oats with
wine. The name comes up here, for Jenine (Mrs. Ben Cecil at the
courthouse) has the horse your traveling seer expects to win the
roses Saturday. The Deputy is Irish-bred and has staying power, and
if you take stock in such things, has the lowest Dosage Index in
the field. That's a gauge that has lost some of its influence in
recent years, but when you've got it on your side, use it. He is
not your typical closer, rather hangs nearer the lead than, say,
Impeachment, who comes out of the next county.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McCarron has been The Deputy's only rider since coming
over here, knows where the finish line is at Churchill Downs, was a
winner on Alysheba and Go for Gin, and the rider-horse relationship
is advantageous. War Chant, More Than Ready and Impeachment come in
that order. Sorry, Fusaichi Pegasus, there's no next year in the
Derby.

<P>
   The NBC miniseries ``Jason and the Argonauts,'' like any good
epic, has profound questions at its heart. What drives men to
pursue the seemingly unattainable? Are there limits to love and
friendship? And what is that thing on Dennis Hopper's head?
</P>
<P>
   Hopper, sporting a curly coiffure and a creepily understated
malevolence, is one of the high points of this often entertaining
account of Jason, the hero of Greek legend, and his quest for the
Golden Fleece. So odd is Hopper's get-up _ he plays Pelias, the
king with a penchant for stabbing his relatives _ that when he
first appears in Sunday's opening installment that it is difficult
to recognize him. But then comes that voice.
</P>
<P>
   Pelias covets the fleece far more than any animal hide ought to
be coveted, and he sends Jason (Jason London), his nephew, to find
it. Jason is given a ship, the Argo, and the underqualified crew he
recruits becomes known as the Argonauts. Adventures ensue, watched
over and sometimes manipulated by Zeus (Angus MacFadyen) and Hera
(Olivia Williams), the deities of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries, another lavish offering by the producing team of
Robert Halmi Sr. and Robert Halmi Jr., doesn't quite capture the
suicide-mission camaraderie that ought to prevail on Jason's ship.
Half of the Argonauts are drowned or otherwise disposed of before
they have made much of an impression on the screen. Of those who
aren't, only Kieran O'Brien as a weaselly thief, Brian Thompson as
Hercules and Olga Sosnovska as Jason's longtime
friend-who-wishes-she-were-more-than-that are particularly
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   But calamities, not character studies, are the main attraction
here, and several of the ones the Argonauts blunder into are
skillfully served. Poseidon, the sea god, is a huge, scaly fright.
The Clashing Rocks, which come together to squash passing ships,
are as believable as Clashing Rocks get. And once the voyagers
reach Colchis, the island where the fleece hangs from a tree, they
encounter the worst horror of them all: Frank Langella, playing the
island's king, who appears to have the same hairdresser as Hopper.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think about this ``Jason'' too hard will readily find
flaws. Why do some characters have British accents and others not?
What law of physics allows the Argo to zip smartly along when its
oars are barely reaching the water? When Jason, moments after being
flame-broiled by the fire-breathing Minoan Bull, stirs himself back
to consciousness, would his buddies back there in B.C. Greece
really have shouted a Marv Albert-like ``Yessss!''?
</P>
<P>
   But there is no need for anyone to nitpick when watching this
``Jason.'' It's more fun to trace the antecedents of the various
effects _ beasties that could have been plucked from ``Jurassic
Park'' or the ``Terminator'' movies; a talking statue that is a
cinematic descendant of Babe, the sheep-herding pig; a
color-changing moment from ``Pleasantville.'' There's even a
bow-and-arrow torch-lighting borrowed from that Olympic ceremony a
few years back.
</P>
<P>
   It's also amusing, for anyone whose mythology classes have
merged into one big blob since graduation, to try to guess what's
coming for the Argonauts. Is this the part where they meet the
Cyclopes? (Well, no, that was ....) Wait, it's the Sirens, right?
(No, you're thinking of ....) Wait, I've got it; it's the Harpies,
isn't it? (Yessss!)
</P>
<P>
   And finally, viewers can spend some of their idle time simply
marveling at the restraint of the cast and crew, especially at one
particular moment near the end. Jason has made it back home with
the fleece, which turns out to be a mangy rag still attached to the
skull of its original four-legged owner. Pelias' son, Acastus (Tom
Harper), has snatched the fleece to try to impress Dad. Pelias and
Acastus come face to face, Pelias in his goofy curls, Acastus
wearing the ratty-looking fleece on his noggin.
</P>
<P>
   And no one bursts out laughing. But there's a sense that there
was a lot of laughing on the inside. When this ``Jason'' works,
that is why: It's drama wrapped around a sense of fun.

 PBS EXPLORATION OF vIKINGS WOULD MAKE EVEN THE STONY LEIF SMILE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Shilshole Marina, on the edge of Seattle's wellspring of
Scandinavian identity, the 12-foot-high statue of Leif Ericson
offers stony testimony that the Vikings weren't exactly the
effervescent type. Leif's dour likeness could be the poster boy for
irritability, though you'd probably be annoyed, too, with seabirds
using your head as a restroom.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was occasion for Leif to crack a smile, though, it
would be now. All of a sudden, Vikings are everywhere. Hotter than
the Dixie Chicks, they grace the covers of Time and National
Geographic, they're starring in a new Smithsonian road show and a
just-published companion book (``Vikings: The North Atlantic
Saga''), and _ here's a shock! _ they're on TV.
</P>
<P>
   It's all because the scholars say Ericson (a k a Erickson,
Ericsson and Eriksson) discovered North America 1,000 years ago.
Nothing like a good, round-numbered anniversary to get our
inquisitive, revisionist juices going. And nothing like PBS to stir
the brew _ twice in eight days _ when there's enlightenment to be
had.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, a special episode of ``NOVA'' gets things started
with ``The Vikings,'' an enjoyable treatment in the
scholarship-is-painless ``NOVA'' style. The two-hour exploration of
Viking lore suggests the Norse invaders of the late eighth century
probably weren't much worse than any other group of aggressive,
peripatetic, materialistic expansionists who believed the best
defense is a good offense. It's just that they got bad press from
the people they were conquering. (Doesn't help that the early
Vikings themselves were storytellers, not writers.)
</P>
<P>
   So the Vikings, who swept into other parts of Europe from
Norway, Sweden and Denmark, went down in history as a marauding
bunch of blood-spilling plunderers who held sway for 2{ centuries,
then faded from the scene in a remarkable bit of social blending.
</P>
<P>
   Ten centuries later, the accumulated historical and
archaeological evidence doesn't refute the unsavory record. Rather,
it balances the saga of savagery with solid proof that the Vikings
were skilled artists and artisans, sophisticated traders, astute
politicians, fearless explorers and absolute geniuses when it came
to nautical engineering. They traveled farther and wider than the
Greeks and Romans, affecting social and economic developments in
much of what is now modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Leif Ericson's forays from Greenland to North America
never established the sort of foothold the Vikings established in
England, Ireland, France, Russia and Iceland, they at least serve
to remind us that unrecorded achievement isn't any less important
than the written record, just harder to prove.
</P>
<P>
   As with most episodes of ``NOVA,'' the best part of ``The
Vikings'' is the application of science to imagine the Viking
experience. Bit by bit, from the use of ground-penetrating radar to
microscopic analysis of charcoal fragments to good old mucking
around in ancient privies and garbage dumps, forensic scientists
have pieced together a Viking mosaic shimmering with the allure of
new discovery. Faithful replicas of sailing ships and
computer-generated re-creations of villages complete the
transformation of the Vikings from figures of legend to
flesh-and-bone people.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally accepted that the Viking Age ended in 1066 when
William the Conqueror invaded England and defeated King Harold at
the Battle of Hastings. But William himself was descended from
Vikings who had wrested Normandy from the Romans 155 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   So, what makes one a Viking?
</P>
<P>
   The ``NOVA'' piece would suggest that a successful weaving into
the tapestry of the places they occupied is perhaps the greatest
Viking legacy, a contribution that includes democratic government,
a fabulous spirit of adventure and a trading network that reached
across the Mediterranean Sea and as far east and south as Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   This record of survival makes all the more strange the
disappearance of a settlement from Greenland in the middle of the
14th century. On May 16, ``The Lost Vikings of Greenland'' on PBS
takes a look at this colony, which thrived on Greenland's eastern
coast for about five centuries before vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost Vikings'' is the second in a four-part ``Secrets of the
Dead'' series airing next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday (may 15, 16
and 17) on PBS. (Other segments examine the origin of the Dark
Ages, the disappearance of the Anasazi in what is now New Mexico,
and a theory on what really caused the Hindenburg to explode.)
</P>
<P>
   Set up as a kind of cheesy detective story, ``Lost Vikings''
isn't as much fun as Tuesday's ``NOVA'' profile, but its subject
matter is fascinating and the detective work, right down to the
examination of fossilized blowflies, is a riveting example of how
scientists can create a believable construct when it seems they
have nothing to work with but a pile of centuries-old rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost Vikings'' loses points for promising to tell us the truth
about the colony, when its conclusion is really a best-guess
scenario that posits a mini-ice age. That, combined with the
settlers' apparent depletion of natural resources and their
inability or unwillingness to mix with the native Inuit population,
spelled certain doom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the theory is eminently plausible, and it suggests
somewhat ironically that the colonists' demise may have been
abetted by the very religion that was anathema to their pagan
ancestors 500 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland, where the Greenland settlers were from, had adopted
Christianity around the time Leif Ericson was exploring the western
reaches of Viking territory. There is no question of significant
church presence in the Icelanders' settlements on Greenland. What
isn't known, but assumed by some historians, is that xenophobic
churchmen may have forbidden contact with the Inuit, thus
establishing a social barrier that effectively prevented the
Vikings' descendants from learning how to adapt to a changing
environment.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, ``Lost Vikings'' underscores the clarion lesson
of ``The Vikings'' that, despite the seeming incongruity of the
premise, the enrichment of national or ethnic ``identity,'' at
least in terms of social contribution and achievement, ultimately
lies in assimilation, not isolation.

BUZZ OFF: SECRET BARS THAT SPURN HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 7) By JULIA CHAPLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 1:30 a.m. on a recent Saturday, Milk &AMP; Honey, a
tiny bar on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, was jammed for one of
the few times since it opened in January. But instead of feeling
elated, the 27-year-old owner, who had barely been able to make the
rent until a few weeks ago, scooped up the discarded martini
glasses and cast a disapproving eye on the cheery crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're breaking the rules,'' he said, raising his brows in
concern. ``Men are talking to women all over the place without
permission.''
</P>
<P>
   It was amazing that anyone was in the bar at all, considering
the effort made to hide it among the grated storefronts and
overflowing garbage cans on an unassuming block near Delancey
Street. Not only is there no sign, but the place is as disguised
as, in the words of the owner, ``an old Jewish tailor shop.'' The
word Alterations, in fact, was freshly painted in an antiquated
style on the store window. Behind it was a dusty mannequin dressed
in a ratty three-piece suit.
</P>
<P>
   To gain admission, would-be patrons must phone at least 20
minutes ahead, have their references approved, then traverse a
pitch-black hallway. Anyone caught knocking or talking while
waiting to be admitted is blacklisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service I'm offering is an idiot-free environment safe
from celebrity sycophants and frat boys who read the listings in
Time Out,'' said the owner, who agreed to be interviewed only if
his bar's exact location was not revealed and he was identified by
his first name only, Sasha. ``Unfortunately, hiding my bar was the
only way I could think of to do it these days.''
</P>
<P>
   These may seem like extreme measures, but Sasha is the most
extreme example of a small contingent of night life entrepreneurs
less dedicated to cultivating heat and hype than avoiding it. They
have had enough of clubs and bars used as promotional venues, that
act as hosts of parties sponsored by liquor companies and where
paparazzi are planted at every velvet rope.
</P>
<P>
   New clubs striving for the cachet of bold-faced names shell out
small fortunes for publicists to broker premiere parties and other
promotional events. The scenes are all but interchangeable:
clipboard-wielding list-keepers in headsets part the sea of
beautiful but not famous guests to make way for limousines with
celebrities. The next day, the spectacle is chronicled in the
tabloids, and legions of readers form the impression of a hot new
destination they must go to as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The prepackaged hoopla has created something of a backlash. A
wave of secretive bars have lately cropped up, from the simple SoHo
establishment on the corner of Spring and Sullivan Streets with no
sign, no name and blacked out windows, to bars modeled after old
Mafia social clubs, to the underground Milk &AMP; Honey.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to stay hype-free, catering to a small but loyal
crowd, and make enough money to remain in business. It's not so
easy, as Ian Stell and Michael Drury learned. As owners of the
popular downtown scenes Orchard Bar and Double Happiness, they
opened the secretive Wyanoka last year, hoping to provide a
laid-back environment for the art world. Located upstairs from
Double Happiness on Mott Street in Little Italy, Wyanoka was an
apartment-like single room with decor inspired by the mobster
gambling parlor that formerly occupied the space. The only clue to
its existence was a tiny logo of a Wyanoka Indian on a plain metal
door. The initiated would slide a special membership card through
an ATM-like slot. But exclusivity couldn't pay the bills, and the
two partners closed down after eight months. They are now
converting it to a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way a bar like this could work is if the owner was
extremely dedicated,'' Stell said. Sasha turns out to be that
owner. He sees himself as a kind of Holden Caulfield of night life,
scorning ``phonies'' and crusading against lapsed values. In
addition to his strict entrance policy, he has eight house rules
posted in the bathrooms and strictly enforced. Rule No. 1 is ``No
name dropping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks that celebrities are the new aristocrats
will not be tolerated,'' Sasha said. ``They are the most tedious
people in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar is for people who feel responsibility, not
entitlement,'' he added, volleying the incoming requests for entry
on a rotary phone and whipping up elaborate cocktails with egg
whites and hand-squeezed citrus. ``If Puffy showed up here in a
limo, he could come in as long as he had a reservation and could
obey my rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other rules include: ``Don't tell anyone about this place unless
you would leave that person alone in your apartment,'' and
``Gentlemen will not introduce themselves to ladies. You may not
speak to a woman to whom you have not been introduced. Wait for her
to speak to you, or ask the bartender for an introduction.'' That
is the rule most often broken.
</P>
<P>
   Sasha maintains a Rolodex with all of his customers' names in
it, cross-referenced with the initials of the person who
recommended them. If either party breaks the rules, the card is
torn up and both are banished. Sasha said he heard that this
screening method was practiced by a secret Yale University club or
an illegal after-hours gambling parlor. He also plans to install a
video surveillance system on the front door to screen the guests,
as soon as he can raise $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the club with money that he, his sister and three
friends he met while at Stuyvesant High School borrowed against
their credit cards, between $10,000 and $15,000 each. The debts are
still outstanding; all of the revenues from the bar are put back in
the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I haven't had to physically kick anyone out,'' he
said. ``I find the best way to make people leave is to make them
think it is their idea. I just speak to them like I'm scolding a
child in a stern disapproving voice. They usually apologize and
then never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Milk &AMP; Honey is like a Prohibition-era speakeasy.
Sasha wears only old-fashioned clothes: suspenders, high-waisted
pleated trousers and a fedora. He plays jazz and soul from the
1920s and 1950s. The bar is made of solid oak, the banquettes are
leather and the walls are plaster, not sheet rock. Hat hooks are
provided. The bathroom is stocked with meticulously rolled cloth
towels. No Bounty here.
</P>
<P>
   Only top-shelf liquor is served, though Sasha refuses to serve
drinks he deems fratlike. These include woo woos, kamikazes and
shots of any kind. If you sit at a table long enough, a silver tray
will arrive with long-stemmed strawberries drizzled with honey, or
freshly shucked oysters.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Milk &AMP; Honey isn't for everyone. Many one-time patrons
who have been chastised for sitting on the tables, whistling loudly
or trying to pick up women refer to it as ``that rule place'' and
have complained that the atmosphere is a ``buzz kill.'' But most of
the regulars are extremely loyal and protective. When Sasha gets
too busy (he is the only employee other than one part-timer), they
help out by answering the phone, opening the door and escorting
``ladies'' to taxis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough good people out there to fill up a
500-square-foot bar,'' Sasha said. ``But I doubt there are enough
to fill up 1,000 square feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Felix Salmon, 28, an English journalist, who was leaning against
a polished brick wall last Saturday night, said: ``If I broke one
of the rules, I'd feel dreadful. It would be like talking during
the opera.''

RANCOROUS HOWDY DOODY CUSTODY TRIAL NEARS DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ With a ghost of a smile occasionally playing
across his face, a federal judge is prepared to play Solomon
Saturday in a struggle over the puppet that is commonly known as
the Original Howdy.
</P>
<P>
   That is, not Ugly Doody, an early model that was abandoned as
not sufficiently appealing for television, and not Double Doody, a
duplicate built especially for public appearances. Not Photo Doody,
which had no strings and was sold last year to a Palm Beach, Fla.
woman for about $113,000, or the two Canadian Doodies, but Doody
himself, the Doody who matters, and who is locked in a Rhode Island
safe deposit box while a preeminent puppet museum and a Connecticut
puppeteering dynasty battle over who owns him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be the universe of Doodies,'' said U.S. District
Court judge Christopher F. Droney, who heard both sides argue for a
summary judgement Friday in their first face-to-face court
appearance. Droney's decision could be many months in coming.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the freckle-faced '50s icon _ which one
collector said could easily fetch half-a-million dollars at auction
_ was precipitated by the death in 1998 of his human sidekick and
voicebox, ``Buffalo Bob'' Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy Doody appeared from 1947 to 1960, on a show that began
with Smith's ritual question to the Peanut Gallery, ``Say, kids,
what time is it?'' They would scream, ``It's Howdy Doody time!''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the show went off the air, eager to cash in on
Howdy Doody's nostalgia value, Smith had borrowed it from the man
who pulled his strings, Rufus Rose, who kept the puppet after the
show ended. Rose died in 1975. Shortly before Smiths' death, Rose's
son Christopher, 53, flew down to North Carolina and took
possession of the puppet, which Smith and the Roses had planned to
sell at auction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Detroit Institute of Arts said Rufus Rose had long ago
promised to add the puppet to their 850-puppet collection upon his
death. And the lawsuit that followed, filed last year, has teams of
lawyers debating removable hands, puppet abandonment, and the
mysterious handwriting inside Howdy Doody's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a forensic puppet examiner, but what I saw was when
they took the skull cap off the back of the head, there was some
notation in there,'' said Stuart Rosen of Bingham Dana LLP, who is
representing the museum. The notation named a Scott Brinker as the
designer, opening up a new set of disagreements between the many
factions that have taken an interest in Howdy.
</P>
<P>
   The clash over Howdy Doody comes just as the market for 1950s
collectibles is at its demographic peak, said Gary Busk, a
Carrollton, Texas man who is one of the nation's foremost
collectors of marionettes. Baby boomers in their 40s and 50s have
the disposable income to invest in the icons that defined their
childhood, and then about age 60, they start ``pulling in their
horns,'' he said. With that in mind, Busk estimated that the puppet
could draw a price of $500,000 _ probably from a foreigner, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely very big, it really is,'' Busk said. ``There's
a lot of people that are sitting out there who would like to get a
shot at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not if the team from Detroit can help it, though. Arguing for
summary judgement Friday, Rosen said Rufus Rose had custody of the
puppet, rather than ownership, and that his promise to the museum
amounted to a contract. He cited a letter ``Buffalo Bob'' Smith
wrote in 1995 after the museum had refused his request to sell the
puppet to relieve his financial woes: ``In complying to you
request, when I no longer wish to keep the HOWDY DOODY PUPPET for
my personal use and enjoyment, I shall contact the museum director
to have him arrange for the transfer according to the wishes of
Rufus Rose, who, incidentally, did not create the puppet or the
character.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rose family maintains there was never a real contract,
and Christopher, the only of Rufus Rose's three sons to attend the
hearing, said he is shocked at how aggressively the museum
approached the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Within the clannish puppet world, that family has won a lot of
loyalty, said Steven Abrams, president of the Puppeteers of
America, an organization Rufus Rose once led. Although Howdy Doody
hardly represented Rufus and Margaret Rose's range and
craftsmanship _ Rufus Rose's favorite was a far less successful
production based on the story of Pinnocchio called ``The Blue
Flower'' _ observers from the trade have sympathy for the Roses'
attempt to capture ``the only opportunity to realize this kind of
windfall,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's real fascinating that Detroit has the moxie to do
this,'' Busk said. ``For an organization to file suit against the
Rose family _ look, if they win, they lose, as far as the puppetry
community is concerned, because look what they put the Roses
through. And if they lose, look what they put the Roses through.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On top of everything else, the coffee was not
ready for Benjamin Demps Jr., the superintendent of the beleaguered
Kansas City School District, as he arrived in his office early
Friday, charged with fixing educational woes here that have endured
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a good sign for the day,'' said Demps, 65, whose schools
have essentially been judged a failure by a state review board,
which stripped them of its seal of accreditation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Demps has been on the job just 10 months. He is a former air
traffic controller who rose to become a high-ranking federal
aviation official before turning his attention to the school
problems in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm asking for is patience,'' said the chief of the Kansas
City schools, which have been under a court desegregation order
stemming from a lawsuit filed in 1977. ``I don't mind the criticism
_ that comes with the job. I've got confidence in what I'm doing.
When you've been an air traffic controller, and you need to bring
down the plane safely, you have to trust your own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a laborer, Demps grew up in New York and joined the
Air Force after graduating from high school in 1951. He later went
to work as an air traffic controller, rising into management ranks.
Going back to school as a married man with two daughters, Demps
earned a college diploma at age 32 and a law degree at 48.
</P>
<P>
   He has also served as Oklahoma's secretary of health and human
services.
</P>
<P>
   The state Education Board removed the accreditation from the
Kansas City District after its schools failed each of 11
performance standards, including test scores and attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The move means that the district has two years to show
significant improvement, or face the prospect of being abolished by
the state Legislature and broken into smaller districts. It also
means that students in the district are eligible to attend suburban
districts, and that the Kansas City District must pay tuition and
transportation costs for them.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the problems in the Kansas City system _ similar
to those, he noted, that endure in most urban centers _ Demps
nonetheless bristles about the timing of the state board's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make it official in May _ three weeks before the school
year ends,'' he said. ``I'm incensed for our graduating seniors.
They've gone to school all these years, and just before their
graduation, this happens.'' Demps said state education officials
insisted that the loss of accreditation would not harm the college
prospects of Kansas City graduates, who can expect admission based
on test results.
</P>
<P>
   But the superintendent is not so sanguine. ``When colleges have
50 students for 25 spots,'' he said, ``they've got to look at
something, and maybe this will be one of those things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the national debate on ways to remedy problems in urban
schools, the Kansas City district has long been an object of
scrutiny. Despite spending some $2 billion over the last two
decades to better the schools and draw more white students from the
suburbs, the Kansas City schools continue to struggle, and
three-quarters of the students are still members of racial minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to satisfy federal court demands to draw more white
students, and to narrow the performance gaps between whites and
blacks, the district has spent lavishly on new buildings and
created special magnet schools like one focusing on Greek studies.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri lawmakers outside Kansas City have long complained
about the city schools drawing a disproportionate share of
education spending. Meanwhile, many residents of Kansas City,
especially blacks, have complained that the spending focused too
much on attracting white students, and not enough on improving
basic education for all.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into the firestorm, Demps, who earns $156,000 a year,
has grown accustomed to fierce criticism. For example, Clinton
Adams, a black lawyer and leader of a group of dissatisfied
parents, has labeled the Demps administration ``feebleminded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are skeptical because I'm not from Kansas City,
I'm not a Missourian _ `Who is this guy?''' said Demps, who was a
high-ranking federal civil aviation official in Belgium between
1985 and 1991. His wife, Patricia Demps, is a lawyer for Kerr
McGee. He has one daughter in Norman, Okla., and another in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that some people believe that a superintendent
should have had experience as a teacher or a principal, Demps said
his role was that of a leader of the education forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the general necessarily know how to drive the tank?'' he
asked. ``Maybe not. But he knows how to lead the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides coping with the loss of accreditation, Demps is working
to build ties with civic and academic leaders, who he believes can
help city schools with their resources and suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   To improve attendance, his administration now works with the
police on truancy sweeps during school hours to find young people
who are playing hooky. He said he had also sent a message to
teachers and administrators that academic standards could not be
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a recent increase in attendance, he said he was hoping
that other improvements would follow swiftly. Results of important
standardized tests, which students have just completed, will be
known in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's a lot of anxiety around here,'' he said. ``How did
we do? We just don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems in the Kansas City schools are not much different
from those confronting other big city districts, he said, and the
solutions are just as difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing well in Kansas City,'' he said. ``The
difference here is that we're attacking it openly. You've got to
say: `We've got a problem here, gang. Let's get this train going in
the right direction.'''

GLOBALIZATION: UNSPEAKABLE, BUT IS IT REALLY EVIL? 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The media coverage has faded. The tripartite enforcers of global
capitalism _the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the
World Trade Organization _ still make loans and settle trade
disputes. But the protesters who rang the alarm about global
economics in Seattle and in Washington left a distinct legacy: they
made globalization a naughty word.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International
Monetary Fund, says world leaders will have to come up with another
way of describing economic integration if the idea is ever to
become popular again. Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury secretary,
delivered a long address on world development policies recently
without so much as mentioning the term.
</P>
<P>
   Among both mainstream economists and their left-leaning critics,
it has become axiomatic that globalization leaves too many poor
people behind. At best, it is described as a blunt instrument for
growth that inflicts collateral damage on people who do not have
the education or resources to defend themselves. At worst, it
actually increases poverty, worsens social divisions and shifts
power from people and governments to multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weisbrot, an economist at the Center for Economic and
Policy Research in Washington whose writings are part of the
protesters' intellectual canon, argues that globalization, as
defined by the American government and the Washington-based lending
institutions, has systematically failed to help poor countries grow
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation has ever pulled itself out of poverty under the
conditions that Washington currently imposes on underdeveloped
countries,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion is disputed, of course, but less vigorously than
might be expected. The idea that globalization has done more to
help the haves than the have-nots has become economically correct _
a litmus test for progressive internationalists.
</P>
<P>
   A growing body of evidence does suggest that 1990's-style global
integration did far less to relieve poverty and inequality than its
early supporters predicted. But the record also shows that the
process is probably less economically harmful than some critics
maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank recently released one of the few comprehensive
attempts to assess the impact of globalization. The bank, a leading
target of some protesters, has also been flagellating itself
recently, pledging to become a more effective poverty fighter. And
its report, ``Assessing Globalization,'' is less than cheery.
</P>
<P>
   The report found than progress on poverty reduction has been
glacial. The number of people in extreme poverty _ surviving on $1
a day or less _ fell only slightly from 1990 to 1998, from 1.3
billion to 1.2 billion.. The population in developing countries
increased during that period, so the change in percentage terms was
somewhat greater, from 29 percent to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only region of the world where poverty declined much was
East Asia _ from 27.6 percent to 15.3 percent. It barely budged in
sub-Saharan Africa and actually increased in the former Soviet
bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that many nations that opened their doors
widest to foreign trade saw income accrue mostly to the rich.
China, the United States and Latin America all had bigger gaps
between rich and poor by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The figures help explain why few people these days talk about
globalization as if it were a new Enlightenment. But if the era of
globalization has hardly been one of universal prosperity, it is
probably too early to conclude that economic integration is
actually to blame for stubborn poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The report finds plenty of support for the premise that economic
growth is the best antidote to poverty, and that the most open
nations are usually, though not always, the fastest growers,
whether wealthy or poor.
</P>
<P>
   It also finds some nations where the gap between rich and poor
narrowed, rather than widened, as reliance on trade grew. That
suggests, at a minimum, that the correlation between economic
integration and social inequality is inexact. Other factors _
effective government policies, strong labor laws _ are also at
work.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only safe conclusion about globalization's impact
may be that no sweeping conclusion is possible. East Asia and the
former Soviet bloc, for example, both globalized extensively in the
1990's, to diametrically opposed economic results.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider another example. Incomes in both African and Latin
American nations were growing faster before globalization took hold
than they have lately. But it's hard to say globalization is to
blame, since Latin America has opened wide to trade and investment
recently, but Africa has by some measures become less open.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were right _ globalization is no panacea. But
neither does it seem to be the disease some critics claim.

THE CAREER COST OF CARING FOR ELDERLY PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>

(DW) 
 By SUSAN J. WELLS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is growing evidence that caring for the elderly is taking
a big financial toll on employees and their careers.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study suggests that two-thirds of workers who care for
elderly relatives have lost out at work by forgoing promotions, pay
raises and training opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on 55 people age 45 or older who spent more
than eight hours a week providing unpaid care. Although it involved
relatively few participants, it is the first to detail financial
losses for providers, the researchers said. It was conducted last
year for the MetLife Mature Market Institute in New York by the
National Center for Women and Aging at Brandeis University in
Waltham, Mass., and the National Alliance for Caregiving in
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   How expensive can elder care be? For workers in the study who
were able to quantify the impact, the care has cost an average of
$659,000 over their lifetimes in lost wages, Social Security and
pension contributions, because they have taken time off, passed up
promotions or ``plum'' assignments, quit their jobs or retired
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the caregivers' glass ceiling,'' said Sandra
Timmermann, a gerontologist and director of the MetLife Mature
Market Institute. ``It's an issue that will become even more
critical within the next 5 to 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the reason is clear: As the nation's population
continues to age, the number of people providing their care will
grow in tandem. That will intensify the impact on businesses and
workers.
</P>
<P>
   According to projections from the Census Bureau, 82 million
Americans will be 65 or over by 2050, more than double the 34.6
million in that age group in 1999. The projections, released in
January, show an especially rapid surge in the elderly population
as baby boomers begin reaching 65 in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Women apparently bear a larger share of the responsibility for
elder care, according to a recent survey commissioned by Senior
Care Action Network, a health plan for seniors in Long Beach,
Calif. Of nearly 1,500 seniors over 65, some 29 percent said they
relied on a daughter or daughter-in-law for care, while 12 percent
said they relied on a son. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Until it hits home, it tends to be viewed as someone else's
issue,'' said Joyce Ruddock, vice president of MetLife's Long-Term
Care Group. ``But demographics will change that and put elder care
on a lot more employer radar screens. It's not only an emotional
issue, but a financial one, too. Elder care will be to the 21st
century what child care was to the last few decades.''

LEGACY OF AGENT ORANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after the end of the Vietnam War, the
devastation that the United States wreaked on large parts of South
Vietnam by spraying millions of gallons of herbicides is still an
open wound. The most common herbicide was Agent Orange, named for
the orange band around its containers. Sprayed on forests and
fields to deny cover to enemy troops and supply lines, it included
trace amounts of dioxin, a toxic substance that has been linked to
several diseases.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been considerable research in the United States
on the effects of Agent Orange on US personnel, much less has been
done on its impact on the Vietnamese. It is high time that US
scientists join with their Vietnamese counterparts to do such
studies, and in March US Defense Secretary William S. Cohen gave
Clinton administration support to bilateral research projects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, studies done in the West have pointed to statistical
links between dioxin and diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.
While the Vietnamese contend that dioxin is to blame for a range of
birth defects among children born in high-dioxin areas, US
scientists dispute their evidence.
</P>
<P>
   What is indisputable is that the world needs to know more about
dioxin, and Vietnam is _ sadly _ one of the best places to study
it. As Dr. Arnold Schecter, a professor of environmental science at
the University of Texas School of Public Health in Dallas, has
noted, everyone living in the industrialized world has dioxin in
his or her body.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin hot spots show up in many parts of the globe; Baltic Sea
fish have been shown to have high levels, for instance. New studies
in Vietnam, combined with previous ones in the West, could provide
scientists with a better idea of what dioxin does to the human body
and what levels are unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States should do more than just cooperate with
Vietnam on dioxin research. We should be prepared to assist in
cleaning up areas of highest contamination, such as river
sediments, and in helping Vietnam deal generally with defoliation's
grim environmental and public health legacy.

UNLOVABLE BUG

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The streets have their usual version of calm, but there's chaos
in cyberspace. Massive _ and expensive _ damage has been caused by
a raging computer virus, the Love Bug. It's a high-tech plague born
from a very human _ and twisted _ heart.
</P>
<P>
   The virus may have come from the Philippines, possibly making it
an Internet Asian flu. It has infected millions of computers across
the globe at point-and-click speed.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail's subject says ``ILOVEYOU.'' Open it and there's an
attachment. Open the attachment, and the virus explodes. It
slithers into e-mail address books and resends itself to those
listed.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an infestation. E-mails have flooded and shut down
e-mail networks and destroyed data. Victims include the Pentagon,
the British House of Commons, the Danish Parliament, and companies
all over the world. Early guesses are that damages will cost
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has opened an investigation, but it will not be easy to
round up the usual suspects. Hackers can be almost anyone,
anywhere. Still, the usual human motivations stand out _ even in
the world of servers, drives, and bytes.
</P>
<P>
   The Love Bug seems like the work of some Superman comic book
villain who wants to take over the world: a vast, diabolical
project used to disguise a sad cry of ``Pay attention to me!'' It
is the manipulative gambit that recipients will find a message
saying ``I love you'' irresistible. It is that the three little
words may have sent a warm, electric rush through those who had
been waiting for a declaration of previously unspoken affection. It
is the chance that, for even a micro-second, someone believed an
e-mail could contain an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   All the infected e-mails contain is a warning: The Internet is
vulnerable. What will protect us? There should be stronger
partnerships between governments and businesses to better unite law
enforcement and industry innovators.
</P>
<P>
   Shielding e-mail networks is a priority, because the system has
become a common but essential tool. And because, occasionally, we
do have profound things to say to each other.

   It's the story of a quantum physicist in search of lost love, a
computer scientist who lost his way and a talking electron with a
few words to say.
</P>
<P>
   It's a film with big stars and a big budget and it's coming to a
home computer near you. Right now. Whenever you happen to have some
time to download it.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is called ``Quantum Project,'' a sci-fi tale about
technology and humanity and a young physicist caught in between. It
was released by SightSound.com late Thursday night and can be
downloaded to a computer _ if you happen to have a credit card
handy and somewhere between 15 minutes and four hours to transfer
it to your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   SightSound.com is a Pennsylvania company that specializes in
downloadable movies and music. It's generated a fair bit of buzz by
billing ``Quantum Project'' as the first ``feature film'' to be
made for and distributed exclusively on the Web. Go to their site
and they'll tell how to get it.
</P>
<P>
   While the term feature film sounds pretty exciting, don't get
your hopes up too high.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the movie was produced by a major studio _ Metafilmics,
which made ``What Dreams May Come''.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are some biggish-named stars in it _ Stephen Dorff
(``Blade''), Fay Masterson (``Eyes Wide Shut'') and John Cleese
(shouldn't have to tell you who he is).
</P>
<P>
   And sure, they spent lots of money making it _ $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this made-for-the-Web movie comes off on par with your
average made-for-TV movie: semi-cheesy special effects, weak
character development, mediocre plot (so maybe it's actually good
that it's a lot shorter, too).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, although the distributors say the movie will cost
you only $3.95, you actually end up paying $5.95. Yes, that's
nearly $6 for a movie that lasts a mere half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   And although SightSound's technology is quite advanced, watching
a movie on your computer still leaves you with the feeling that you
might need glasses. The images are a bit blurry and they move a wee
bit haltingly.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's own AtomFilms.com offers far more clever movies made
for far less money.
</P>
<P>
   Their short films are ``streamed'' rather than downloaded, so
the visual quality isn't as high as SightSound's. But they also
don't charge any money to watch them _ which is the way it should
be until the visual experience is good enough to make
Net-distributed movies worth paying for.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's still way cooler to watch a movie on your TV,
and especially on a big screen.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Internet-delivered entertainment goes, ``Quantum
Project'' isn't a quantum leap, but it is an interesting _ if small
_ step in what is guaranteed to be the future of entertainment
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is already a major source of entertainment for a
growing portion of the world's population. Downloadable music is
flourishing. Would-be filmmakers are flocking to put their
low-budget films on the Net. And thousands of movie fans are
already downloading bootleg versions of their favorite movies _
``The Blair Witch Project'' and ``The Matrix,'' to name a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Movies are and will continue to be delivered via the WWW. And as
technology improves, they will become quicker to access and more
enjoyable to watch.

SUPERMARKET STOCKS, IN THE BARGAIN AISLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, the long-suffering supermarket sector seems an
attractive place for investors to shop. Those seeking safety in a
turbulent market have already begun to pile into what analysts
perceive as the highest-quality supermarket stock, Safeway. Despite
the pounding of retail stocks last week, its shares are up 20.3
percent so far this year; other grocery stocks have also shown
gains of late.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers and analysts say some of these companies _
including Safeway _ may still be good bets, particularly for
investors willing to take a longer-term approach.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Standard &AMP; Poor's retail food chain stores index
of five supermarket stocks fell 26 percent, versus a 20 percent
gain in the S&AMP;P 500, as investors fled value stocks in general and
low-margin retailers in particular. This year has been a different
story: the S&AMP;P retail food chain index is up 5.3 percent, compared
with a loss of 2.5 percent for the S&AMP;P 500. But Lisa Cartwright, an
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, estimates that the group is still
trading at a 40 percent discount to the S&AMP;P 500, based on current
price-to-earnings multiples.
</P>
<P>
   The chains themselves have joined the buying spree. Last month,
the nation's two largest grocery chains, Kroger and Albertson's,
announced plans to buy back $750 million and $500 million of their
shares, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction in a time of tumult is obvious. In the past,
grocery stocks have held up well during market downturns and
recessions, so the stocks are seen as good defensive plays. The
industry is likely to continue consolidating, many analysts say,
creating greater economies of scale and fattening what have long
been razor-thin net margins of 3 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector has good earnings growth and it's trading at close
to its 20-year lows in terms of valuation,'' said Mark Husson, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``Food retailing stocks are stable and
solid. They have good earnings potential and the valuations are
very cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are risks. If the stocks are to stay
attractive, analysts say, earnings per share need to grow in the
range of 16 to 18 percent _ a level last achieved in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts expect some of the companies to reach that
rate in 2000, they disagree on which ones will do so. Last year
earnings per share for the five stocks grew just 14 percent, on
average.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the threat posed by Wal-Mart Stores, which has
been rapidly pushing into the grocery business with its Supercenter
outlets. Wal-Mart Supercenters combine a large grocery store with
the traditional Wal-Mart discounted general merchandise in vast
stores of between 100,000 and 200,000 square feet. The company is
introducing the Supercenters at a rapid pace: there were 739 as of
March 31, compared with 582 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Among the large chains, Kroger, of Cincinnati, faces the biggest
risk from Wal-Mart because of geographical overlap: Wal-Mart
operates Supercenters in about half of Kroger's 15 largest markets.
So far, Kroger is holding its own, according to analysts. Indeed,
Joseph Pichler, the chief executive, told analysts in a conference
call two months ago that Kroger had increased its market share in
five of the seven markets where it competes head-to-head with
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're finding is that Wal-Mart is consolidating the
business, but that Kroger is still able to compete effectively,''
said George Thompson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. Thompson
said Kroger should have no problem achieving earnings-per-share
growth in the 16 to 18 percent range going forward.
</P>
<P>
   He has a strong buy on the stock and a 52-week price target of
$32; the shares now trade at $19.5625, or 14.5 times analysts' 2000
earnings estimate of $1.35 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Basu Mullick, co-manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund,
says Kroger presents an interesting risk-reward story because of
its $13.5 billion acquisition last May of Fred Meyer, a supermarket
chain based in Portland, Ore., that nearly doubled Kroger's size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of a terrific opportunity and a terrific
challenge,'' said Mullick, who had about 2.5 percent of the fund
invested in Kroger on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the merger has made it more difficult for Kroger to
focus on its Internet strategy. Though Internet grocers are
struggling to turn profits, some analysts worry that traditional
brick-and-mortar chains will eventually feel some impact.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, Safeway has invested in Groceryworks.com,
an online grocer in Dallas, while Royal Ahold, the
Netherlands-based operator of Stop &AMP; Shop and Giant Food Stores,
has invested in another, Peapod of Skokie, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is clearly going to be a channel, even if the
model has not yet been figured out,'' Cartwright said. ``But it's
important to have a strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the run-up in Safeway's stock, it remains the favorite
of some analysts, largely because the company has avoided the big
acquisitions that Kroger and Albertson's have made.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway, which is based in Pleasanton, Calif., and operates more
than 1,600 stores, is often cited as having a strong management
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have have the integration risk that Kroger has'' as
a result of its merger, said Deborah Weinswig, an analyst at Bear
Stearns. Her 52-week price target for the stock is $65; the shares
closed on Friday at $43, or 19 times analysts' earnings estimates
of $2.23 a share for this year.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Albertson's, based in Boise, Idaho, is not
encountering major problems in its merger with American Stores,
completed last June, but analysts said it still has to prove that
it can handle increased competition from Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright has a hold on the stock and a 12-month price target
of $35. It now trades at $32.1875, or 12 times analysts' 2000
earnings estimates of $2.68 a share.

AN INJUSTICE OF SECRETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A flagrant injustice was righted, at least partially, when an
immigration court judge signed a preliminary ruling this week that
allows Dr. Karim Ali, a prominent member of Iraq's democratic
opposition, to escape a 3 1/2-year nightmare caused by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and FBI investigators.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of hearsay evidence gathered from Iraqis fleeing
Saddam Hussein _ evidence that the INS classified and withheld from
Dr. Karim's attorneys _ a man whom Saddam targeted for execution
was detained on arrival in the United States as a suspected spy for
Iran, Iraq, or Syria. Since Karim was known and trusted by a former
CIA case officer in northern Iraq and leaders of the Iraqi National
Congress, the largest Iraqi opposition group, they both tried to
persuade the INS to correct its blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Former CIA director James Woolsey joined the defense team for
Karim and worked ardently to free him from his Kafkaesque
nightmare. But for a long time Woolsey was denied permission to see
the secret evidence that was the basis for the refusal of the INS
to release Karim and grant him the right to request political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   When the INS was finally obliged to disclose a large part of the
secret evidence, it became clear that much of the information
gathered by FBI investigators to be used in the case against Karim
was built on rumor, innuendo, or false allegations.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents who knew nothing about the labyrinthine politics in
the Kurdish areas of Iraq, Iran, and Syria gave credence to dubious
statements from frightened refugees airlifted to Guam after
Saddam's troops routed them from northern Iraq. The agents
misconstrued Karim's efforts to save the life of his mentally ill
brother by bringing the brother out to Guam under the name of
another Iraqi who had decided to stay behind.
</P>
<P>
   There is an important lesson to be drawn from the injustice
inflicted upon a courageous Iraqi Kurdish doctor who put his faith
in America's goodwill. The INS should not be allowed to use secret
evidence based on uncorroborated and unchallenged statements to the
FBI.

REFERENDUM FEVER

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's jockeying over the Legislature's failure to vote on
the annual crop of initiative petitions provided a glimpse of what
threatens to be a serious problem in Massachusetts and potentially
a national calamity.
</P>
<P>
   That word is not too strong for the damage that would be done to
our representative democracy and our society if proposals are
advanced to conduct national policy by referendum. Already, Ross
Perot and Pat Buchanan have hinted at such proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ill-effects of government by referendum are already
abundantly visible in California and Oregon, which have to a
considerable degree neutered their state legislatures through
over-reliance on direct democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Government by referendum does ``let the people speak,'' as its
advocates claim, but it gives them a vocabulary of only two words:
yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, too, the problems are apparent, as eight
proposed initiative petitions move toward the November ballot,
along with one constitutional amendment slated for 2002. One of the
most-discussed items promises to improve health care, but it would
do so with a three-pronged approach, each complex. Voters who like
one or two of the elements cannot choose. They have no opportunity
for debate or amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trend is toward increasing use of the device. And, as
columnist David Broder points out in a his new book, ``Democracy
Derailed,'' the proportion of ballot questions that pass has risen
to about 50 percent _ the highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   This trend is a direct threat to the ideal of representative
democracy embraced so passionately by the nation's founders.
Clearly, voters don't think their elected officials are
representing their interests well enough, if at all. The paradox,
however, is that the legislators whose own power is directly
targeted by the movement have often responded with disdain and with
behavior in their chambers that is nothing short of suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the Massachusetts House's late-night budget
session, in which special-interest amendments were adopted at 4 or
5 in the morning, with no rollcalls and no previous hearing or
debate? In fact, one reason for the late session was that the
leadership has held very few formal sessions this year, so scores
of items that should have been considered as separate bills ended
up as budget amendments. In an atmosphere where an iron-fisted
leadership thinks open floor debate is too much democracy, voters
can hardly be blamed for looking to other ways of making their
voices heard.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the threat is even greater, for several reasons. Any
method of passing legislation by popular vote would decimate the
careful balance of the federal system, in which individual citizens
have an equal voice in the House, while small states are protected
from the tyranny of the majority by disproportionate representation
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that public opinion _ often ``a factious
spirit'' in James Madison's words _ can change quickly. Will policy
flip-flop every few days, as public sentiment wavers?
</P>
<P>
   Most important, though, is that the entire rationale for public
policy referendums is turning on its head in many states and would
surely be upside down if implemented nationally. That rationale is
that, when representatives will not do what citizens clearly want,
voters have a right to mount grass-roots campaigns to take matters
into their own hands. The Proposition 2 1/2 property tax limit, it
must be said, was an example.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, monied special interests have learned they can
buy the advertising campaigns and other mechanisms to prevail in
referendum campaigns, and this would surely be most true at the
national level. With the stakes so high, a national referendum
would only shift the arena of special-interest money from Congress
to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Perot has only called for an ``electronic town hall'' in which
voters could guide their elected officials. But Congress and the
president already pay too much attention to public opinion polls.
Governing is a job for representatives, not for citizens with quick
trigger-fingers on their computers.

CISCO SWAPS $6 BILLION IN STOCK FOR ARROWPOINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology giant Cisco Systems Inc. announced its second biggest
acquisition ever Friday, snapping up ArrowPoint Communications Inc.
in a stock swap valued at $6.08 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint, a switching equipment maker that had its initial
public stock offering barely five weeks ago, is the largest
Massachusetts high-tech company to be acquired so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal marks Cisco's 11th acquisition in New England since
1994, bringing its total investment in the region to nearly $10.3
billion. Ten of the companies it has bought are in Massachusetts,
and one is in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   New England, in fact, has become Cisco's largest base of
operations outside its home state of California. The San Jose-based
company is purchasing 580 acres along Interstate 495 in
Massachusetts to consolidate its holdings and expand further.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng Wu, founder and chief executive of ArrowPoint, said the
Acton, Mass. company would be a good fit with Cisco, an
infrastructure company that has prospered making the nuts and bolts
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected all this to happen so quickly, but we always
felt that the technology we were developing would be very
signficant,'' Wu said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco officials said they pursued ArrowPoint earlier this year
but held off making an offer once the small firm began preparing
for its public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint's value rose quickly as its shares climbed from an
IPO offering price of $34 a share to $118.48 in the first day of
trading. Friday, it closed at $140.1875 a share, up $5.375. Cisco,
meanwhile, closed at $67.75 a share Friday, up $4.125.
</P>
<P>
   Under the purchase agreement, Cisco will exchange 2.1218 shares
of its stock for each share and option of ArrowPoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisco saw that ArrowPoint had products and capabilities it
needed,'' said William R. Becklean, managing director of technology
research at SunTrust Equitable Securities in Boston. ``And since
money is no object and (Cisco has) a philosophy of getting to
market before anyone else, it bought the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint is the largest of a group of companies developing
specialized switching products in the emerging field of Web traffic
management. Its software routes online transactions, or content,
from the browsers of individual users to computers best able to
handle search requests immediately. This quick flow of data is
known as content switching.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said he first identified the need for this kind of equipment
as Internet use exploded more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But only in the past 90 to 120 days, said ArrowPoint and Cisco
officials, did the market for content switching take off as large
companies such as MCI WorldCom, Excite At Home Corp. and Lycos
became ArrowPoint's customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Cisco) did not want ArrowPoint to each their lunch,''
Becklean said.
</P>
<P>
   For Cisco, the leading supplier of Internet servers, switches
and routers, ArrowPoint's products filled a void in its product
line. And with a push from Cisco's massive sales force, the market
for content switching products is projected to increase to $2
billion by 2003 from $500 million this year, said Greg Geiling, an
analyst for J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw how fast the content networking arena was shaping up
and that we had to be in it,'' said Ammar Hanafi, Cisco's vice
president of business development. ``So it made sense to talk to
ArrowPoint again. Our discussions took a strategic turn after they
went public. We never made an offer before then.''
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint agreed to the acquistion, in part, because it could
grow more quickly under Cisco, said Lewis Volpe, ArrowPoint's
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   During the first three months of this year, ArrowPoint added 80
customers for its switching equipment. The price of the gear ranges
from $14,000 to $100,000 and more. ArrowPoint also hired more than
185 sales and support employees in the first quarter, boosting its
sales and marketing force to 337 at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt that, if we were going to be acquired, we
preferred Cisco,'' said Wu, who with Volpe will continue to run
ArrowPoint under the umbrella of Cisco. Wu said they plan to expand
ArrowPoint employment to about 400 by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Wu previously co-founded Arris Communications, which was
acquired by Cascade Communications Corp. of Westford, Mass. in
1996. He owns 2.58 million ArrowPoint shares, now worth $371
million in Cisco stock.
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint's largest shareholder is Matrix Partners, the
Waltham, Mass. venture capital company that helped Wu start
ArrowPoint. Matrix will receive Cisco stock valued at $1.1 billion.

MISSISSIPPI PROMISES DIVERSE VIEWS ON NEW-FLAG COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., S.C., Ga.)   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A day after Mississippi learned that its bitterly
contested state flag had not been an official symbol for 94 years,
Gov. Ronnie Musgrove formed an advisory commission Friday to design
a new flag, guaranteeing a year of debate about whether the flag
should bear a Confederate symbol.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that because of
a legal technicality, the state had not had an official flag since
1906, when the Legislature forgot to include the flag in a
codification of state laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate cross in the flag's left corner has been
criticized by many black residents over the years, but the court
said the flag had no legal status unless the government chose to
make it or another design the official symbol.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Jackson, Musgrove, a Democrat, said he
wanted the commission to ``take positive action,'' but he voiced no
opinion on whether the new flag should carry a Confederate symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbols mean a lot,'' he said, standing in front of a pole
bearing the current flag. ``They mean a lot to all of us. We want a
good, open, honest discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised that the 17-member commission would be a diverse
group, containing members of both parties and black and white
residents. The commission will include three members of the State
Senate, three members of the House and 11 members appointed by the
governor from a variety of fields.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is to recommend a design by May 4 of next year,
according to the governor's executive order, which also mandates
that the current flag be kept in use until the Legislature acts.
The Legislature, however, is not required to approve the
commission's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Several white members of the Legislature have already made it
clear that they want the current flag to be made official and that
they are not interested in a new design. But many black
legislators, who had already vowed to make the flag a major issue,
have welcomed the opportunity for a new design.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the official use of Confederate symbols has been
growing in the South this year, spurred by the movement to lower
the Confederate battle flag from atop the South Carolina
Statehouse. That issue may be settled next week when the South
Carolina House votes on a plan to remove the flag and place a
smaller version in front of the Capitol, but five other states,
most notably Georgia and Mississippi, incorporate Confederate
designs into their state flags.
</P>
<P>
   Several Georgia legislators have promised to begin a movement to
change the state's flag later this year, and civil rights groups
have threatened an economic boycott of the state if it is not
changed. Up to now, opponents to the flag in Mississippi faced a
big challenge in getting it changed, but the court's ruling has now
created an opportunity to change the flag.

INDEFENSIBLE MISSILE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment of truth is fast approaching in the politicized
quarrel over a national missile defense. President Clinton has said
he will decide this summer whether to build a phased system to
protect against several dozen long-range missiles. Russian
President Vladimir Putin, after pocketing the Duma's ratification
of START II and passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, has
warned that if the United States withdraws from the 1972 ABM Treaty
to build the missile defense, ``We will withdraw not only from the
START II treaty, but from the whole system of treaties on
limitation and control of strategic and conventional weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes could not be greater. The $60 billion system
contemplated by Clinton risks undoing nuclear weapons cooperation
with Moscow and might also compel Beijing to expand and modernize
China's basic deterrent force of about 20 intercontinental
ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What would follow, arms control specialists fear, would be a
chain reaction of nuclear weapons proliferation. India would
probably not be able to resist pressure to deploy its nuclear
missiles and match a Chinese build-up, and Pakistan would be almost
certain to follow suit. Even Japan could be tempted to use its
stockpile of fissile material to join the Asian nuclear-weapons
club.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for national missile defense is more compelling
than was President Reagan's old ``star wars'' concept. Instead of
trying to defend the United States against the full panoply of
Soviet rocketry _ a clearly impossible task _ the system would be a
defense against only one or two missiles fired by a rogue state
such as North Korea or Libya. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
has said that the system would not and could not be a defense
against Russia and therefore would not upset the deterrent value of
the mutually assured destruction concept.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four criteria Clinton has said he will consider
when making his decision on the system are: the scope of the threat
to be countered, the effect on nonproliferation, and the cost. The
first cannot be accurately calculated. No one knows what rogue
states might conceive of, and those in favor of the system suggest
it could act as a deterrent. The effect on nonproliferation could
be dire, but it ultimately depends on how the project is presented.
</P>
<P>
   As for cost, the government has already squandered about $60
billion in the vain pursuit of the ``star wars'' vision of missile
defense that Ronald Reagan was willing to fund. Members of the
current Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are unenthusiastic about the
latest proposal for a missile defense system, have to worry that
other, more tangible military needs may get short shrift if the
politically driven system is funded for the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fourth criterion is technological feasibility.
Independent scientists and weapons designers who have analyzed the
system say it can be overcome, relatively cheaply, by
countermeasures that are readily available to any state capable of
deploying a long-range ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical or biological agents could be delivered in warheads
that release large numbers of bomblets, or submunitions, that would
overwhelm the interceptors of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear warheads inside mylar balloons could be hidden among
hundreds of similar balloons serving as decoys. The sensors of the
current missile defense system are not able to distinguish decoy
balloons from those that contain nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the system that Clinton is to decide on this summer
has not been tested against realistic countermeasures. There is no
evidence that the first phase of the system, planned to become
operational in 2005, could cope with decoys or simple cooling
shrouds on incoming warheads. Plus, there have been no real-world
tests to determine whether the full system, scheduled to be
completed about 2010, could distinguish an empty radar-reflecting
balloon from one with a nuclear warhead in it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a missile launched against the United States would
be easily tracked from its point of origin, and there would be no
doubt from whence it came. A nation making such an attack could
expect instant destruction.
</P>
<P>
   No presidential decision to deploy a national missile defense
should be taken until the system proves, in tests analyzed by
disinterested scientists, that it cannot be defeated by
countermeasures that must be anticipated from any state capable of
delivering a ballistic missile to these shores.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the years to come, a workable national missile
defense system will be developed. But there is no such thing in
existence today, and an unworkable national missile defense system
threatens to make Americans less, not more, secure from long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The true challenges of creating a national missile defense
should be debated in the coming presidential campaign. Research
should continue on missile defense, and a commission of
distinguished, independent scientists should be established to
assess future tests against real-world countermeasures. But for the
present, national missile defense is simply not a viable defense
option.

   KANANGA, Congo _ They ran to the side of the road, scores of
people waving wildflowers or palm fronds or anything they could
pluck from trees lining the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Paix!'' they shouted. ``Peace! Peace!''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying, `The U.N. is coming and the war will end,'''
a Congolese doctor working for UNICEF said as a delegation from the
U.N. Security Council rode into Kananga, a town in south central
Congo that seems to be sliding downhill from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Kananga has been designated one of four outposts of a U.N.
mission bound for Congo sometime this year, and three Security
Council members broke away from meetings in Kinshasa Friday to fly
here over a vast, deep green tropical jungle and take a look at
what was in store for the peacekeepers.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a voyage into the heart of sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British ambassador, who had pressed
for this visit away from the politics of Kinshasa, was moved by the
passion of the crowd in a city that has no electricity, water for
only an hour a week, and the rusting remains of a great rail hub,
once the pride of a line that went all the way to Cape Town.
Thousands of emaciated refugees who have come to escape endless war
are as close as 50 or 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have to see their faces,'' Greenstock said. ``You
have only to see the faces we saw on the streets of Kananga to see
how very deeply they want the U.N. to come here and bring peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter van Walsum, the Dutch ambassador, and Martin Andjaba, the
ambassador of Namibia to the United Nations, shared his bittersweet
reaction to the place whose fate may lie in their hands if the U.N.
Security Council decides the situation in Congo is safe enough to
send 5,500 peacekeeping troops. It was good, they said, to get away
from the diplomacy of capitals to see the reality. But the reality
was sobering.
</P>
<P>
   It was soon clear, traversing the rutted streets of Kananga and
catching glimpses of the buildings the U.N. mission in Congo may
have to inhabit, that this will be a mission with a challenge. And
a price tag. The startup costs in the first year alone may be $600
million. And that's just the projection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the most expensive peacekeeping operation
ever, per head of peacekeeper,'' Greenstock said. And putting it _
and the future of the Congo _ together, he said, is like walking
``on stepping stones in a river in the mist, where you can't see
where the next step is.''
</P>
<P>
   For the United Nations and its members, who will have to pay the
bill and send the troops, a policy of ``slowly, slowly'' prevails.
</P>
<P>
   For Andre Qabwe, a restaurant cook who was standing outside the
gate of the provincial governor's palace when the Security Council
delegation and the predictable swarm of ministers and outriders
arrived, that won't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them here this very night,'' he said, pointing
emphatically to the ground between his feet. ``We have suffered too
much, and now we need peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Kananga has a history of hardship. It was a town _ now swollen
to a city of 700,000 _ that opposed Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator
who was driven from power in 1997 by Congo's current president,
Laurent Kabila. The provincial governor's father was killed by
Mobutu's thugs. But the victory of Kabila has not brought them
peace or a better life, a number of people in the crowds who
gathered Friday said. As in many places in the Third World, there
is hope that the United Nations will bring not only peace but also
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tall order for an organization that is not even sure the
peacekeeping operation in Congo will ever be deployed, given the
fragility of repeated cease-fires _ illustrated bizarrely Friday by
an outburst of fierce fighting between Ugandan and Rwandan troops
who are supposed to be united against Kabila's government, which
they once supported. Security Council diplomats, as they prepare to
meet the presidents of Rwanda and Uganda in the next few days,
wonder whether this points to another rearrangement of alliances.
</P>
<P>
   For two reporters who left the motorcade to visit the village of
Katora, several miles beyond Kananga, the human cost of war was
quite evident. Although Kananga and its immediate outlying areas
have been free of fighting, they have become places of refuge for
people from other towns with terrible stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph is 9 years old but the size of a child half his age in
the richer world. He has never owned shoes. But last year he was
thrown out of a hamlet under attack 120 miles away and separated
from his family, so he decided to follow a soldier here to Katora _
on foot. Once here, a Belgian priest, Ivo Vanvolsem, took him in
and added him to his collection of desperate people who have lost
the wherewithal to survive in a country watered profusely by
rivers, replete with fertile land and studded with diamonds and
gold. Here, even the adult men are skeletally thin, wasting away
from a lack of nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Lalula, a woman of about 30 from a distant village trashed by
war, saw her husband die. She found her way to Vanvolsem with three
of her children. One died on arrival, drained by malaria. She has
the passivity of the truly hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Mogwanja, a Kenyan who is the UNICEF representative in
Congo, said that women caught in the ebb and flow of war are more
than just victims of family tragedy these days; they are also among
the fastest-growing AIDS-infected population. Often, the cause is
rape. In Eastern Congo, he said, women have been raped repeatedly
as armies advanced, retreated, then advanced and retreated again.
These women carry immense burdens.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all these wars,'' Mogwanja said, ``the women are always the
losers.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Kane thought he had concocted the perfect advertising
medium.
</P>
<P>
   First, in 1996, he created an Internet site called
Gamesville.com that let visitors distract themselves with bingo,
card games and quizzes _ typically for cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants would willingly enter their names and addresses,
because otherwise how could Gamesville mail them their prize
checks? The advertising on the site, in turn, would be customized
to each user, based on all sorts of facts that Gamesville could
gather with that address from credit bureaus and mailing-list
houses.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this could hardly offend, Kane figured, because he
told users what he was doing. ``Our privacy policy was simple,'' he
said. ``Abandon all privacy ye who enter here.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan worked. Gamesville has attracted more than four million
visitors who entered their addresses _ information that turned out
to be the key to all sorts of other data, not just the usual lists
of magazine subscriptions and auto registrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can find out whether you are a person who lives on the edge
of your credit limit or pays your bills,'' he said, ``whether you
are a mountain guy or a beach guy.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem: advertisers didn't much care. Most
just wanted to reach as large an audience as possible. Some used
the most basic pieces of data that Kane collected, aiming their
messages, say, at women or college students or people in the
regions where the advertisers have stores. But Kane's effort to
find debt-laden beach bums or Volvo owners who read Guns and Ammo
was to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the unspoken but enlightening secret about corporate
America's attempt to get even more personal with its customers. For
all the discussion about how the Internet is stripping consumers of
whatever thin veil of privacy they have left in this world of
credit bureaus and supermarket scanners, analysts have failed to
recognize just how ineffective most of these data-gathering systems
have been. Sure, many companies are trying to peer back through the
glowing screens at Internet users, but so far no one has been able
to make a big business out of being Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Many ad-driven Web sites, from Gamesville to giants like Yahoo,
have hoped that their clients will be willing to pay a premium for
the ability to aim ads at specific groups of users who, presumably,
will be more likely to buy their products. And database systems
have been promoted even more heavily by advertising networks, like
DoubleClick and Engage, that increasingly act as middlemen between
sites and advertisers, inserting ads into Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   The few advertisers that have tried these systems have not yet
given up on them. But most say the response to their ads does not
go up enough to be worth the extra cost and bother. It seems easier
for them to buy cheap shotguns, in effect, than expensive
laser-guided rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been overwhelmed by how underwhelmed I have been on
people's ability to deliver on the promise of targeting,'' said Dan
Springer, director of marketing of NextCard, a credit card company
that is one of the Web's biggest advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Some data marketing systems have already been abandoned _ though
that doesn't mean that privacy-rights advocates should be retiring
to count their successes. Many proponents of database marketing say
they are building new systems to overcome their temporary setbacks,
with more ways to collect and link data about users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data is the holy grail,'' said Anil Singh, the senior vice
president for sales at Yahoo, which has based much of its business
strategy around database marketing. Yahoo's problem is that while
it can command high prices for advertising on some parts of its
site, like its stock quotation page and computer shopping area,
advertisers are willing only to pay much lower rates for others,
like e-mail and weather pages.
</P>
<P>
   So Yahoo's goal is to be able to track users so that advertisers
can find the ones they are looking for, whatever page they are on.
If it can identify those users who frequent the stock-quotation
pages, for example, Yahoo hopes to charge brokerage firms high
rates to reach them, even while they are checking the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Singh says such data-based targeting is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't use data, you wind up with a bunch of excess
inventory,'' Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   But many advertisers, and even some operators of big Internet
sites, find that they do not need to look in keyholes to figure out
their best prospects. That is because the sites that people go to _
and the searches they conduct _ tend to reflect their interests
better than even the most elaborate mailing lists developed in the
pre-Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to track people,'' said Robert Pittman,
president of America Online, which has disavowed the database
marketing techniques that are being offered to advertisers by other
big Internet sites. ``If you want to sell cars, you talk to people
when they are in the car area.''

</P>
<P>
   The failure, to date, of Web-based data-gathering systems is not
for lack of trying by Web sites and ad networks, which have worked
to gather and correlate information about computer users from a
wide range of sources.
</P>
<P>
   Sites can glean a few facts about users from the Internet itself
_ mainly, what type of computer and browser a user has and through
what network it is connected to the Internet. That lets advertisers
aim at corporate users in certain industries, say, or sometimes at
home users in certain cities.
</P>
<P>
   They can also follow surfing habits, keeping track of Web pages
that a user visits in order to infer his interests. Some also try
to use this information to predict users' demographic
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   A site may gather personal information online by asking users to
register and fill out surveys, as is required by The New York Times
on the Web.Or a site may accumulate such data slowly, grabbing a
ZIP code, for example, when a user checks the weather, or a
birthday when he checks his horoscope. Many sites offer sweepstakes
to get users to enter their addresses and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Personal information is also obtained off line. Once a site
collects a user's name and address, it can buy other information
about him or her from mailing-list companies or, if it already has
a database, it can examine its own customer files.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this data-gathering relies on a technology that places
small files, known as cookies, on the hard drive of an Internet
user; these generally contain an identifying number. Cookies allow
sites to record each page a user sees and to show each user
different advertisements based on information in their files.
</P>
<P>
   With all these techniques, it would seem that Web sites could
collect vast dossiers on users. In fact, much of the available
information is crude, fragmentary and filled with errors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, though the network address can often pinpoint a
user's location, the 20 million users of America Online all show up
as living in Dulles, Va., where the company has its headquarters.
Moreover, most systems cannot figure out all the sites visited by a
user. Yahoo knows where users go on its own site but knows nothing
about where they go on other sites. Working with such a fragmentary
file is something like having only 50 pieces of a 500-piece jigsaw
puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   An ad network gets a broader view by inserting ads into Web
pages on a wide range of sites and by using a cookie to record
which sites are visited. But this method, too, provides information
on only a portion of the pages viewed by a user.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick, in fact, decided that its information on users'
surfing habits was so meaningless, at least for now, that it does
not even offer it to advertisers. (The company has become the
lightning rod for concerns over privacy issues, but the criticism
relates to its future plans to use data about people's mail-order
purchases, not its current practices.)
</P>
<P>
   MatchLogic, an ad network now owned by Excite(at)Home, has
collected personal information on 20 million users through a
multiplicity of techniques. Using banner ads on various sites,
MatchLogic runs contests to lure users into identifying themselves.
It also gains access to information when people register at and use
the Excite Web portal, and from other sites that agree to share
user identities.
</P>
<P>
   For these Web users, the company can customize advertising based
on their answers to questions. Moreover, it tries to use this hard
data to draw better inferences about 52 million other users on
whose computers it has placed cookies, examining their surfing
habits to reach conclusions about their interests and demographic
characteristics, even though it does not know their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for signals and patterns in the data to figure
out whether you are male or female rich or poor, married or
single,'' said Mitchell Bennett, MatchLogic's vice president for
sales. But, he acknowledged, ``It's an art, not a science.''
</P>
<P>
   Matchlogic officials say that for now, use of its targeting
systems is small _ but that it is growing as advertisers learn how
to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get more mind-share from clients than spending,'' said
Martin Smith, MatchLogic's director of enterprise solutions. ``The
clients say we have to prove we are faster, better and cheaper for
them to use us. We will. This is like television in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   Engage, an ad network that is partly owned by CMGI, is also
trying to deduce information about users by tracking where they
surf. It hopes to get a comprehensive picture of users' interests
by getting a big network of sites to feed the topics of all the
pages a user visits into a central database. In return for
providing the information, the sites have access to profiles of
individual users' interests; that, in turn, can be used to help
determine which ads to show.
</P>
<P>
   To get sites and users to cooperate, Engage promises that it
will not collect personally identifiable information like names or
addresses. The interest profile is simply associated with a cookie
on a computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 52 million profiles, with information from 3,000
sites. Nonetheless, it has had trouble attracting either
advertisers or many of the most visited sites _ so much so, in
fact, that it has changed its strategy to also offer other, more
general advertising services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company says its data system will eventually prove
successful. ``We think the original premise is absolutely 100
percent on the money,'' said Paul Schaut, Engage's chief executive.
``Your past online behavior is the best predictor of your future
online behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites and ad networks say advertisers have just been too
harried to learn how to use the database tools. But many
advertisers that have tried them find the results modest at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this stuff is the tail wagging the dog,'' said Al
Noyes, executive vice president for sales and marketing at
SmarterKids.com, an online seller of educational toys that has
tried various ad networks that promise to search out mothers of
young children. ``Maybe you can increase your returns by 10 or 15
percent, but it's not worth it for such a small increase to the
bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites and ad networks see targeted ads as their premium
product, so they charge advertisers the full rate-card price _
typically $20 to $80 per thousand times an ad is shown.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the glut of available Web pages, site owners
often sell general advertising at heavy discounts, with prices well
under $5 a thousand available to advertisers who bargain well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found it much more effective to buy cheap media than to pay
more money to buy targeted ads,'' said Springer of NextCard.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites are themselves beginning to question whether they
come out ahead by charging a higher price for a smaller number of
ads. Many are concluding that they can make more money selling a
lot of broader ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a media company, you want to sell your entire base,'' said
Charles Ardai, chief executive of Juno Online Services, an e-mail
and Internet service company that initially hoped to sell focused
advertising based on responses of its users to a questionnaire.
``You don't want to sell an infinitely large number of infinitely
small segments. It's not a good use of our sales force.''

TECHNICIANS STRUGGLE TO STAY AHEAD OF MORPHING LOVE BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Love Bug computer e-mail virus morphed into varients like
the Mothers Day Bug and the Joke Bug Friday, raising new hurdles
for technicians trying to corral the runaway code.
</P>
<P>
   The new bugs didn't appear more advanced than the original
virus, which has already disabled tens of millions of computers
worldwide including at least two classified U.S. military systems.
But their appearance meant more work for technicians and slowed
efforts to restore e-mail services at many companies who shut down
their systems Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, authorities were preparing to arrest a man in
Manila suspected of creating the virus, though the FBI and Justice
Department declined to confirm those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, computer-security experts said the virus,
and the quick appearance of the copycats, show the Internet is more
fragile than many of its users assume.
</P>
<P>
   It may be years before businesses and Internet service providers
can make the medium as reliable as the telephone network, said Pete
Tasker, director of security of systems at Mitre Corp., a research
contractor in Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   `It's the wild, wild West out there, and in many ways the Web
still is not a robust place to do business,'' Tasker said. ``Nobody
wants this to happen on a regular basis, but it's going to continue
at least for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Love Bug first appeared Thursday morning, presenting itself
as an attachment to e-mails with the words ``I Love You'' in the
subject field. If activated the attachment can delete audio and
graphic files as well as forward itself to other computers.
</P>
<P>
   The virus uses relatively simple computer code, but it is seen
as the most destructive example of its kind to date, with damages
estimated at $1 billion or more. Companies like Fidelity
Investments and Ford Motor Co. were forced to shut down their
e-mail systems or lose data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most active virus we've encountered,'' said Jennifer
Latchford, deputy chief information officer for the City of Boston.
``The replication was unbelievably fast.'' The city's internal
e-mail service was only restored at noon to 5,000 users, 26 hours
after it was pulled off-line.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 city computers were rendered useless and require
more servicing, said Latchford, who added Massachusetts and Maine
state agency mail servers would probably be down until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith, a computer-security expert, said clues in the
virus' code suggested it originated in the Phillipines. In
Washington, FBI and Justice Department officials wouldn't discuss
their investigation except to repeat vows to track down the
creators of all types of the virus, just as they arrested the
author of the ``Melissa'' virus a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That virus was designed to swamp e-mail systems, and the creator
pleaded guilty to causing $80 million in damages. But the Love Bug
is more dangerous because it seeks out and destroys certain audio
and graphics files.
</P>
<P>
   Also, at least five new versions of the Bug appeared that seemed
to be copycats, created by users who had made subtle changes to the
Love Bug's roughly 45 lines of code.
</P>
<P>
   The new strains bore titles like ``Very Funny'' and ``Mothers
Day Order Confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latter version, the body of the email includes a message
that the recipient has been charged $392.92 for a ``diamond
special'' and invites users to open an attached invoice file _
which activated the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies said it wasn't clear just how extensive was
the damage from the copycats. But software to combat them quickly
became available, and for many techicians was a time of clean-up
rather than crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity Investments, where almost all 30,000 computers have
e-mail accounts, employees were able to trade messages but remained
cut off from outside communication as of Friday afternoon, said a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At Cabletron Systems in Rochester, N.H., service was still slow
after its computers received 100,000 e-mail copies of the bug.
Technicians worked through the night, however, and employees
retained access to the Internet, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Carnegie-Mellon University's Software Engineering
Institute, said new reports of the Love Bug had trailed off Friday
afternoon, though they repeated warnings of the new version and
cautioned users not to open unfamiliar attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Some avoided the problem altogether. Wendy Wolfson, a
public-relations specialist, said she received three copies of the
Love Bug from clients on Thursday morning but deleted them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I instantly knew it was a virus, because nobody sends me love
letters,'' Wolfson said. ``The companies I deal with, they're just
not that effusive.''

A WIDOW'S WISH FRUSTRATED BY POVERTY, TWO NATIONS' BUREAUCRACIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE and HSIAO-CHING CHOU  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Chen Shaolin has a simple wish: She wants to see her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   An ocean stands between the Chinese woman and Jiang Dainbiao,
dead since January. But the Pacific is nothing compared to the
seeming indifference of two governments, and the poverty in which
Chen and her two children are mired.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and two other illegal immigrants were dead when the cargo
ship they were hiding in arrived in Seattle. Since then, the three
men's remains have been stored at the King County Medical
Examiner's Office, where officials wait for families to decide what
should be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to see my husband one more time, then I'll come
home,'' Chen said in a tearful telephone interview from her
in-laws' home in Fujian province. ``No matter how difficult it is
to go to America, I will go.''
</P>
<P>
   People from Fujian are used to hardships, especially where
America is concerned. Thousands have come to the United States,
arriving for supposed vacations, then disappearing. Hundreds have
braved ocean crossings in rusty fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and dozens of other illegal immigrants tried a different
tactic earlier this year _ cramming themselves into 40-foot cargo
containers, then crossing the Pacific in the black dankness of the
hold of a ship.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a week in January, four such containers
arrived in Seattle on ships from Hong Kong. Immigration agents
opened them to find 63 men who endured squalor and sea sickness
only to fail.
</P>
<P>
   The worst moment came Jan. 10 at Harbor Island. Acting on a tip,
immigration agents waited for a container from the NYC Cape May at
Terminal 18. Three of the 18 men inside were dead. Thirst and
starvation brought on by unending sea sickness took their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Hui, a few days short of his 26th birthday, died first on
New Year's Day. He left a father and brother in China.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, 35, died Jan. 7. Besides Chen, he left a daughter, Nana,
8, and a son, Jiazhi, 3, in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Benqing, 30, died two days later. He had a wife, Jiang
Saimci, and a 2-year-old daughter, Shiyao.
</P>
<P>
   Entombed in the hold of the ship, fellow stowaways pounded on
the sides of the container for help as the men died, said Alan Lai,
a counselor with the Chinese Information and Service Center in
Seattle. No help came.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to see people die,'' said Lai, who has talked
to the families of the dead men to try to offer help.
</P>
<P>
   One more container filled with stowaways arrived in Seattle
after the Cape May, then the human smuggling to the Northwest ended
_ temporarily, immigration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has detained the 60
stowaways who arrived in January. The U.S. Attorney's Office in
Seattle has been investigating the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   There is mostly waiting at the Medical Examiner's Office and in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tangled, bureaucratic political situation,'' said Jerry
Webster, chief investigator at the Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Until he hears from the families, the bodies will remain where
they are. ``If this goes on another year, those folks still will be
with me,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   In China, three families want to come to Seattle to see their
loved ones. They fear that if the bodies are shipped home, the
Chinese government will dispose of them, allowing relatives neither
the opportunity to see them nor to perform final rites.
</P>
<P>
   Lai's social service organization has offered to help, as has
U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department hasn't been encouraging about issuing
tourist visas to the relatives of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``While their applications will receive every consideration
consistent with U.S. visa law and regulations, they should realize
their situation arises because of their relatives' attempt to enter
illegally the United States,'' Edward McKeon, U.S. counsul general
in Guangzhou, in Canton province, wrote in a telegram to Murray.
``This indicates the deceased did not believe themselves eligible
for United States visas.''
</P>
<P>
   The visas, Lai said, are the key. After that, money probably can
be raised in the Chinese community in Seattle to bring family
members here.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has been trying to arrange a visa interview in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I called five or six times, but they wouldn't help
me. They put the phone down and wouldn't even listen to me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please help. I called five or six times, and they wouldn't
talk to me. I beg you to please help.''
</P>
<P>
   Life was never easy for Chen and Jiang. The government forced
him to have a vasectomy after the couple violated China's one-child
policy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple scraped together $1,000 as a downpayment to the
snakeheads, as smugglers are called, to get to America and earned
needed money for his family. He left Fujian as 1999 ended.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chen said she lives ``one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Poverty has forced her and her children to move in with in-laws.
``There is no work,'' she said. ``I want to work, but there is
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As she waits, Chen must face her son and daughter. For now, she
has kept the truth from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call, `Daddy! Daddy!' But I had to lie to them. I told
them their Dad left for a faraway place to make money.''

 UNDATED: sales force.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These disappointments do not come as a surprise to veterans of
the mail-order world, who have long used customer data and found
that database marketing has hardly been the panacea that was
predicted 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some pieces of data _ particularly information about
a customer's behavior _ have been enormously useful to certain
industries. Credit card companies, for example, found that people
who borrow a lot of money but pay it back are their best customers.
And direct-order merchants found that the best predictor of whether
someone would buy from a given catalog was whether he had recently
bought something _ anything _ by mail.
</P>
<P>
   But there are hundreds of other variables that are seemingly
just as logical but do not work as well, like ZIP codes or magazine
subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of even the most advanced data analysis techniques
are not huge. In the direct-mail area, such techniques have allowed
the most sophisticated users of data to increase their response
rates by only tenths of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such gains can be important; a company that spends $2
or $3 to mail a catalog has a lot of incentive to send it only to
people who are likely to respond. But because Internet marketing is
neither as expensive nor as precise, such fine-tuning has less
impact.
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, the often-quoted idea that that technology
lets companies market their products with a different message for
each consumer turns out to be hardly more practical than sending a
sales representative to every person's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of technology people with no direct marketing
backgrounds assumed that since the Internet allows you literally to
have one-to-one marketing, then that must be the holy grail,'' said
George Garrick, the former chief executive of Information
Resources, a big marketing data company, who later started and then
sold Flycast, an Internet advertising company. ``But they just
don't understand the law of diminishing returns. The more and more
finely you segment an audience, the less the increase in your
return on investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, efforts to develop even more elaborate database
marketing systems are continuing. Some ad networks have started to
link their cookie files to those of their clients, so that a
company's existing customers see different ads as they surf the Web
than new sales prospects do.
</P>
<P>
   For example, another advertising network, 24/7 Media, is
creating an ad for an online stock brokerage firm that will show
the brokerage's customers up-to-the-minute quotations on the three
largest holdings in their portfolios. The idea, naturally, is to
prompt them to trade. Others will see a promotion encouraging them
to open an account.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest effort by the ad networks is to move beyond data
about where people surf to customizing ads on the basis of what
people buy.
</P>
<P>
   That is the theory behind DoubleClick's recent acquisition of
Abacus Direct, which runs a consortium through which catalog
companies share information about the purchasing habits of their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick wants to learn the names and addresses of as many
Internet users as possible, by running contests and by having the
information referred from other sites that learn the identities of
users. This data, in turn, will let the company look up purchase
habits in the Abacus database and in a new consortium of online
merchants that DoubleClick is putting together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transactions are the best predictor,'' said Kevin O'Connor,
chief executive of DoubleClick. ``If you buy a computer, you are
more likely to buy other computer products.'' (Doubleclick's plan
is on hold, however, until it works through the privacy concerns.)
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that the problem with database marketing on the Web
is not the data but rather the ineffectiveness of advertising on
Internet pages, especially with narrow banner ads. Indeed, many
advertisers are finding surprisingly good results by using
companies that have assembled lists of people who have agreed to
receive advertising by e-mail. Most ad networks have started or
have bought e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies say the real value of data will be realized after
a customer goes to the site of an online store or advertiser.
Amazon.Com, for example, has long used its records of customers'
past purchases to recommend other items that they may like.
Similarly, Fingerhut, a subsidiary of Federated Department Stores
that has opened an online retail operation, is trying to identify
all the Web surfers who have bought from its many catalogs; the
information will help it customize its home page to feature items
that they are most likely to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Angara E-Commerce Services, a software vendor, is using many of
the techniques of the ad networks to gather data about Web users.
But it will feed that information to Web sites so that they can be
personalized, even for people who visit them for the first time.
Its first client, Greatcoffee.com, features one of four different
coffees, depending on where the user lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a variation on banner ads, some companies have found ways to
get users to accept superimposed ads on the pages they are viewing.
Companies that offer free Internet service have such ads, as does a
company called Dash, which offers shopping discounts. The
technology allows them to record all the sites that their users
visit; Dash even plans to read all the pages to record what its
users are buying.
</P>
<P>
   Though advertisers have not been very interested in such data so
far, the ability to float an ad for one company directly over the
site of a competitor has been very popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better place for BMW to advertise than when someone is on
Mercedes' site?'' said Daniel Kaufman, the chief executive of Dash.
</P>
<P>
   The devotees of database marketing remain insistently loyal to
their work in progress. Kane, for one, figures that eventually
someone will get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of interest by advertisers in its more
sophisticated targeting systems, Gamesville was one of the few
Internet companies to make a profit; it was sold to Lycos for $232
million in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamesville.com barely crawled out of the primordial ooze onto
the beach,'' Kane said last month, shortly before leaving the
company. ``And our clients still have one fin and two cells. But we
will evolve.''

<P>
   Most financial writers, groping for historic precedents to
explain the dot-com boom, cite foreign events, like the tulip mania
and the South Sea Bubble. But the most important precursors are
those episodes in American history that exemplify our passion for
seeking fortune and adventure in new territory. Mining and
drilling, in particular, have set a mood that has never disappeared
from the West. It is the attitude of extractive industry _ get in,
get rich, get out.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctions between mining or panning for gold, drilling
for oil and founding or investing in a dot-com are great. Founding
a modern technology company, especially, may depend on expertise of
a sort alien to the earlier venturers. They trusted luck and
intuition. But the parallels remain striking.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Internet boom, the California Gold Rush of 1849 was
also a huge media event. It dominated national attention, and it
fixed certain expectations in the American mind-set: fortunes for
the finding, riches waiting for men with the right pluck to come
seize them.
</P>
<P>
   Guidebooks, newspapers and rumor all publicized, and often
exaggerated, the riches to be made out West. Susan Lee Johnson, in
``Roaring Camp: The Social World of the California Gold Rush'' (New
York: W.W. Norton, 1999), recounts how men left the familiar bricks
and mortar, or at least the wooden logs and shingles, of home,
family and farm, for a world turned upside down, where few of the
old norms applied.
</P>
<P>
   Many were disappointed, and many disgusted. ``All are here for
money,'' the forty-niner Peter Decker wrote in ``The Diaries of
Peter Decker: Overland to California in 1849 and Life in the Mines,
1850-51,'' edited by Helen S. Giffen (Talisman Press, 1966). ``The
importance of the dollar and the might of an ounce are studied,
sought for in every possible way. In short the sociable man is lost
in the money-seeking gold-hunting selfish acquisitive miser and
conniving millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry David Thoreau dismissed arguments that the extreme
exertions of many gold prospectors gave them a moral right to their
riches. ``It is not enough to tell me that you worked hard to get
your gold,'' he wrote. ``So does the Devil work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The California mining boom provided the occasion for a national
debate about wealth, as the historian David Goodman demonstrated in
``Gold Seeking: Victoria and California in the 1850s'' (Stanford
University Press, 1994). Ministers warned that the explosion of
riches would corrupt the national character (warnings that appear
to be muted or absent today).
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the spirit of the California rush ruled over
the petroleum boom in western Pennsylvania. There, one well
returned $15,000 for each dollar invested, as Daniel Yergin
recounts in ``The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1991). ``The oil and land excitement in this
section has already become an epidemic,'' according to an 1865
citation from one local editor. ``Land, leases, contracts,
refusals, deeds, agreements, interests and all that sort of talk is
all they can comprehend. All our habits, and notions, and
associations for half a century are turned topsy-turvy in the
headlong rush for riches.'' But, he predicted, ``the big bubble
will burst sooner or later.'' This painful lesson was learned by
many investors in the hundreds of oil companies that went public.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the Spindletop gusher of 1901 set off such a frenzy of
exploration and trading in shares that the discovery also became
known as ``Swindletop.'' In two years, land prices rose from $10 an
acre to as much as $900,000. But the inevitable glut lowered a
barrel of oil to 3 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Succeeding Texas booms enshrined the wildcatter in history and
novels, television and film. But even into the 1980s, a collapse in
oil prices could cause personal bankruptcies and a deep regional
recession.
</P>
<P>
   To test my notions about the ties connecting the nation's past
to the present, especially in the West, I spoke with Charles
Scoggin, a board member at the Center of the American West, a
doctor and a high-technology entrepreneur. He is currently on his
fourth start-up, called Medrock, a company intended to help
consumers find the best health care.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving conventional employment _ in his case, as a medical
school professor _ and starting a business, Scoggin said, can
deliver a sensation much like the Gold Rush experience of leaving
friends, families, and familiar circumstances behind.
</P>
<P>
   Like a forty-niner chronically wondering if his decision to
leave for California was an awful misjudgment, today's
entrepreneur, he said, lives with what he calls ``the terror that
you might be wrong.'' Those people who choose not to take such
risks, or those who stay at home in more comfortable if less
promising circumstances, give the adventurer a heavy dose of envy
and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Failed or even moderately successful gold prospectors wondered
whether their families and friends would welcome them back. Today,
individuals less successful than my friend wonder whether the
old-economy companies they left will take them back once their
start-ups collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Scoggin said exaggerated investment claims, wild speculative
swings, predatory investors' taking advantage of the little guy's
work, fights over claims (read ``patent disputes''), constant tests
of endurance and adaptability, and a custom of casual dress that
makes it difficult to read status at a glance were common to both
booms.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, acknowledging the kinship between the Gold Rush
and the Start-Up Rush could give today's business innovators cause
for reflection, if the declines in many dot-com stocks haven't
already.
</P>
<P>
   Scoggin responded in hearty agreement to the comments of Decker
and Thoreau. But he says many entrepreneurs today are driven not
only by money but also by the intellectual and personal challenge
of innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good capitalists get paid for solving problems,'' he said.
Providing a service that solves a problem, he noted, is ``a lot
different than digging a hole in the ground and blundering upon
something.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some of those who blundered upon something invested
talent, intelligence and loyalty in their new communities, contrary
to the ``get in and get out'' mode. When the forty-niner Peter
Decker died in 1888, the Marysville, Calif., newspaper gave him an
epitaph that anyone could envy: ``Success in accumulation of wealth
makes many men arrogant and pretentious, but it had no such effect
upon Decker.''

 &HT;    Georgia's air quality problems call for more stringent standards
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even as Atlanta struggles to resolve its ozone
problem, environmental officials are just beginning to tackle what
may be an even more dangerous pollutant _ ultrafine specks of soot,
dust, metals and other material that can penetrate deeply into the
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   It's called particulate matter, the solid component of smog and
the cause of the area's thick summertime haze. Ozone and
particulate matter mix together to form smog. While ozone is a
colorless gas, the particulates are visible in the form of the haze
over Atlanta on high-pollution days. And it may be a killer some
research indicates the tiny particles may be responsible for
hundreds of deaths in the metro area each year.
</P>
<P>
   New data released this week by Georgia Tech researchers shows
just how pervasive the problem may be. An analysis of monitoring
for ultrafine particulate matter nationwide in 1999 shows that
Atlanta's dirty air now rivals that of Los Angeles, long regarded
as having the nation's most polluted air.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, however, has been focusing its efforts almost
exclusively on reducing levels of ozone, the lung-scarring gas
responsible for metro Atlanta being on the federal government's hit
list of cities that violate clean air standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Georgia is going to have to deal with particulate matter,
and that may be just as hard to resolve as ozone,'' says C.S.
Kiang, a professor in Georgia Tech's School of Earth and
Atmospheric Sciences. ``We are going to have to look at our air
quality problems wholistically, and not just focus on one pollutant
at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiang said new monitoring data shows that the entire state will
be out of compliance with new, more stringent standards for
particulate matter proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Those standards are being challenged in a case being considered for
review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Trucking industry groups and
others charged that the standards were based on flawed data.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, EPA spokesman Dave Ryan said Friday the agency is
confident it will prevail in court. He said the agency is
proceeding with steps to put the new standards in place. The
monitoring data reported this week is part of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's case was bolstered last month, when researchers
meeting in Atlanta said that even low levels of very fine
particulate matter raise the risk of death and serious illness. The
study examined the link between dirty air and human health in 90 of
the largest U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   It found that for every increase of 10 units of particulates in
the air, the risk of death rose by an average of 0.4 percent
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the meeting also affirmed two other studies which
the EPA cited in setting stricter limits on particulates in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that the microscopic specks _ especially the
tiniest ones, 30 times smaller than a human hair _ may be sickening
thousands of Atlantans and hospitalizing many of them each year. A
1996 study by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
Washington-based environmental science group, estimates that the
ulfrafine matter contributes to the deaths of up to 950 metro
Atlantans annually from acute respiratory illnesses and heart and
lung diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusions of the report are sound,'' Dr. Howard Frumkin,
chairman of Emory University's Department of Environmental and
Occupational Health, said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Emory are in the midst of an 18-month study of
emergency room visits and hospital admissions to get a clearer idea
of the health effects of particulate matter.

WITH EYES ON ELECTIONS, LAWMAKERS DEBATE EDUCATION POLICY  
</HEADLINE>
 
  &HT;    (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from
the Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)  By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Setting the stage for a November showdown, lawmakers are
sparring over education with Democrats and Republicans both making
the claim that they care more about America's classrooms and
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the two parties differ in their approach, and those
distinctions surfaced in the Senate where members debated a bill to
reauthorize the sweeping 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education
Act, which commits roughly $14 billion a year to more than 50
federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Republicans favor granting states and local school
districts more leeway in how they spend education money, and they
want to dismantle some of those programs. They also want to
introduce more accountability into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, for example, wants to allow states
to use some money to establish merit pay programs for teachers
``without any additional Washington mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats prefer to spend the money on specific programs or
initiatives, such as school construction or hiring more teachers.
They're leery of giving a blank check to states, fearing that poor
and disadvantaged children would lose.
</P>
<P>
   For all the partisan jabs, Democrats and Republicans have found
common ground in recent years. Consider that Republicans no longer
talk about dismantling the U. S. Department of Education as they
once did, and they have supported substantial increases in federal
spending on schools.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some moderate Democrats have also embraced the idea
that accountability ought to be an important part of any federal
initiative. In the Senate, Florida's Bob Graham, and Louisiana's
John Breaux and Mary Landrieu, are pushing a plan that calls for
pegging funding to academic performance standards that states would
have to set and meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we challenge conventional thinking to improve the
way we educate our children,'' Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN BY THE SCHOOLYARD
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the nation's schools up to snuff won't come cheap,
according to a new study from the National Education Association
that looks at costs from a bricks-and-mortar perspective.
</P>
<P>
   In what it described as the first-ever tally of the costs of
repairing and modernizing schools, the NEA put the expense at $322
billion nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Southern states were not exempt from the costs, but the push in
the region to make room for the unbroken flow of new students left
it in better shape than other parts of the nation, particularly the
Northeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Still there is work to be done, the NEA report said, estimating
the bill for modernization at $2.3 billion in Alabama; $5.5 billion
in Florida; $8.5 billion in Georgia; $3.9 billion in Louisiana;
$1.6 billion in Mississippi; $7.5 billion in North Carolina; $3.3
billion in South Carolina; and $3.2 billion in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   BITTER SWEETS
</P>
<P>
   It's being cast by some as a David vs. Goliath battle, but a
fight over sugar imports really involves two giants.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. sugar lobbyists are upset with a Michigan refiner that they
say is bypassing quotas on foreign sugar imports by buying
so-called ``stuffed molasses'' from Canada. The company, Heartland
By-Products of Michigan, then distills the sugar from the syrup and
sells it.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland By-Products insists it's a victim of industry greed.
In ads, the company portrays itself as being crushed by ``Big
Sugar.'' In fact, Heartland is itself part of E D &AMP; F Man Inc., an
international corporation based in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hardly refer to this sophisticated multi-national
conglomerate as a beleaguered little David,'' said James Johnson,
president of the United States Beet Sugar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Siding with U.S. sugar interests, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., is
pushing for a bill that would raise tariffs on the sugar syrup, but
he recently lost an effort to attach the measure to another trade
bill.
</P>
<P>
   TUNED OUT
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates like to seem hip, but a recent study
of four media markets found that they're old at heart when it comes
to spending their campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Third Millennium, an advocacy group for Generation
X, found that the presidential contenders spent far more money on
political television ads that aired during shows aimed at older
viewers, who are more likely to vote. In other words, shows like
``60 Minutes'' trump ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The group studied four markets: New York City, Los Angeles,
Manchester, N.H., and Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C., a key primary
battleground this past February.
</P>
<P>
   Brent McGoldrick, project director for Third Millennium, said
the results weren't surprising but underscore the generational
divide between young Americans and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates' spending priorities have shifted to Americans
50 and older,'' he said.

NEW YORK LEGALIZES OVER-THE-COUNTER NEEDLE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York State Legislature passed a measure
Friday that permits the sale and possession of hypodermic needles
without a prescription, a move intended to slow the spread of the
AIDS virus among addicts who inject drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation overturns the state's longstanding prohibitions
against needle sales, making New York the 43rd state that does not
require prescriptions to buy needles.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has provoked heated debate in other states, where
opponents of over-the-counter needle sales have argued that such
sales will encourage drug use. But here, no organized opposition
surfaced, enabling the bill to pass with little public debate or
even notice.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was buried in one of the hundreds of spending bills
passed shortly after midnight as lawmakers rushed to enact a budget
and head home for the weekend. Gov. George E. Pataki had submitted
the measure, so it does not need his signature to become law.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature completed passing the budget late Friday
morning. It calls for spending $77.5 billion, with large spending
increases for education, health care and transportation. It also
includes nearly $1.5 billion in new tax cuts to be phased in over
the next four years. The budget was due April 1. But for the 16th
straight year, the governor and the Legislature missed the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The needle bill had strong support from some of Albany's most
influential groups, including doctors, pharmacists, hospitals and
groups representing people with AIDS. The groups argued that the
measure would greatly reduce needle-sharing among drug addicts,
along with the transmission of H.I.V.
</P>
<P>
   The groups immediately praised the action, though many said that
Albany's leaders should have acted years ago because the virus has
spread among intravenous drug users and their partners. Michael
Kink, the legislative director for Housing Works, an advocacy group
for people with AIDS, said the law would help stem the spread of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence has existed for years that H.I.V. spreads swiftly among
addicts who share contaminated needles. More than 50 percent of the
new AIDS cases diagnosed each year in New York are found to have
been connected to intravenous drug use, according to the New York
State Aids Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most significant public health legislation in the
history of fight against AIDS in New York,'' said Ana Oliveira,
executive director of Gay Men's Health Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is similar to a law that Connecticut enacted in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly approved the measure shortly after midnight, after
receiving it from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The New York law permits people 18 or older to buy up to 10
nonprescription needles at a time from a pharmacist. The law goes
into effect in January, giving state health officials time to put
regulations in place. The governor and the Legislature must renew
the law in March 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Gottfried, a Democrat who is the main sponsor of the
legislation, said the price of needles on the black market was so
high that addicts felt the need to share them.
</P>
<P>
   For years, New York's leaders have been under pressure to change
the state law banning the sale or possession of syringes without a
prescription. The law was originally adopted to combat drug abuse.
But critics argued that making needles more readily available did
not appear to encourage drug use in places like Buffalo, Rochester
and New York City, where officials have been running
needle-exchange programs with waivers from the state.

<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ They are schoolchildren, teachers and a
group of mostly European holiday makers _ true innocents who have
been caught for weeks in a pair of terrifying kidnappings in the
lawless jungles of the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Their captors, a small army of Islamic separatist bandits, have
herded them up mountains and down riverbeds, to the sound of
gunfire from pursuing Philippine troops. Last weekend, as
government troops closed in on one group, the kidnappers executed
four Filipino captives, including a Roman Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   With the government taking a hard line and the kidnappers making
wild threats and even wilder demands, there seems, for the moment,
little hope of freedom for the hungry and frightened hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The longest held of the groups includes a dozen children and
teachers, the last of about 50 people kidnapped from two
schoolhouses on March 20. When 15 children and teachers were
rescued last weekend, they described beatings, torture and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   There are 21 people in the second group, kidnapped from a nearby
Malaysian resort island on Easter Sunday. In addition to local
workers, they include two South Africans, a Lebanese, three
Germans, two Finns and two French travelers. Although the
kidnappers recently said two of those hostages had died, emissaries
who visited Friday said all were alive.
</P>
<P>
   On a videotape made by a local journalist one week ago,
foreigners in the second group said that they were not being
treated badly but that they were sick and hungry. In tears, they
pleaded for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage taking is as complex as it is seemingly senseless,
the full expression of a lawless world of pirates, smugglers and
warlords, where kidnapping for ransom is a business and religious
wars are fought by throwing bombs into markets and churches.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, various Islamic separatist groups have
battled the government on the island of Mindanao, some 500 miles
south of Manila. The conflict has taken as many as 120,000 lives
and has helped to keep the island of 17 million people one of the
poorest areas in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In this largely Roman Catholic nation of 74 million people, the
Muslims of Mindanao have never been assimilated and have lived _
for four centuries _ in continuing conflict with the island's
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappings are the work of a fundamentalist splinter group
called Abu Sayyaf, or ``Bearer of the Sword'' in Arabic, a group of
as few as 200 fighters whose founder was trained in Libya and
fought in Afghanistan. It is a group whose trademark is bloodshed
rather than policy _ it is known for kidnappings, church bombings
and the massacre of 53 people in 1995 _ and it counts other Islamic
groups, as well as Christians, among its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Abu Sayyaf are bandits masquerading as religious
fundamentalists, giving Muslims a bad name,'' said Col. Hilario
Atendido, a military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The current standoff began when the children and teachers were
seized six weeks ago, along with the priest, from two schools on
the small island of Basilan, in the Sulu Sea, where pirates and
bandits have held sway for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   At first the kidnappers seemed to be demanding certain fishing
rights and a large sum of money. Then they insisted that a popular
action-movie actor, Robin Padilla, act as a negotiator. He posed
for photographs with them and won the release of two hostages.
Then, in what seemed to be an attempt to gain support from Islamic
militants abroad, they demanded that the United States release
Ramzi Yousef, who is serving a 240-year sentence for the bombing of
the World Trade Center in New York in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   When the president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, brusquely
rejected that demand, they announced that they had beheaded two
hostages, a claim that is widely doubted here. They have since
threatened to behead some of their foreign hostages if the
government does not withdraw its troops.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, the army launched a major ground and air assault on
the Abu Sayyaf camp deep in the jungles of Basilan. One day later,
six men with AK-47 assault rifles landed in a motor launch on the
tiny Malaysian island of Sipadan, an exclusive diving resort with a
coral reef that the explorer Jacques Cousteau once called ``one of
the 10 wonders of the underwater world.''
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers arrived at dinner time, bursting into a dining
hall and shouting, in English and Malay, ``Be quiet or we will
shoot you all!''
</P>
<P>
   An American couple escaped but the other tourists, along with a
dozen local workers, were herded onto the boat and taken one hour
across the sea to the island of Jolo, some 50 miles from Basilan
island.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the age-old bloodletting of Mindanao was an
international affair. Foreign governments began to press the
Philippines to tread gently, but the government has taken a hard
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military will never retreat,'' said Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado. ``If the military withdraws, the Abu Sayyaf will
be in control.''
</P>
<P>
   So the foreigners _ along with the local schoolchildren and
their teachers _ find themselves pawns in a nightmare of ancient
hatreds and rivalries, strange foreign creatures who cannot begin
to comprehend this brutal, insular world.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages are accustomed to a European life with European
comforts, said Marie Michel Moarbes, a Lebanese hostage, on the
videotape. Now, ``it's getting very, very hard,'' she said. ``We
don't have enough food. We don't have anything to drink. We don't
have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I will never go to another Asian place, starting
from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The local hatreds and rivalries have produced a bizarre
counterkidnapping in which a group of anti-rebel vigilantes seized
nearly a dozen members of the family of the Abu Sayyaf leader,
Khaddafi Janjalani, last month.
</P>
<P>
   When Abu Sayyaf freed 18 of the hostages from the school, the
vigilantes freed Janjalani's mother, pregnant wife and 1-year-old
daughter. But they still hold nine other relatives.

   All of this may be little more than a violent sideshow to the
main Muslim insurgency in Mindanao, carried out by the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front. That group of about 15,000 fighters was formed 22
years ago as a splinter from what was then the mainstream Moro
National Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the latter group reached an accommodation with Manila.
The group's leader, Nur Misuari, is now a government go-between
with the Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front broke down in
mid-March, and, coinciding with the Abu Sayyaf kidnappings, that
group has begun a new campaign of violence that has included a
series of bombings and the brief kidnapping of 100 people on a
pineapple plantation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government, that separate surge of violence has
taken more than 300 lives and has forced more than 100,000 people
to flee their homes to escape the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   As the different local groups circle one another and the
military mounts its separate counterinsurgency campaigns, the
hostages are marched from one hideout to another, their feet
bruised and bleeding, as they comfort one another and capture
rainwater to drink, according to some of the rescued victims.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, just one step behind them, the military seized a
bamboo hut where the foreign hostages had been held. They found
some medicine that had been brought by a doctor, evidence of a
hasty departure. And they found three room keys from the Malaysian
diving resort.

LONELY BOWLERS, UNITE: MEND THE SOCIAL FABRIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ohio, N.J.)   By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert D. Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University,
is a big, red-faced, enthusiastic man with the Amish whiskers and
explosive gestures of a 19th-century fundamentalist preacher _
useful characteristics for the ``hell will get us if we don't mend
our ways'' thesis that has taken over his life in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   His message, familiar to millions of Americans, is that the
civic engagement _ the neighborhood friendships, the dinner
parties, the group discussions, the club memberships, the church
committees, the political participation; all the involvements, even
the street protests, that make a democracy work _ have declined
over the last 30 years. Trust and reciprocity, which Putnam calls
social capital, have been damaged, he says, and the nation has
grown cantankerous and less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Being a spiritual man, deeply committed to his own findings, he
proselytizes. Tapping foundations for funds, Putnam organizes
seminars, surveys ``social connectedness'' in numerous cities (the
hope being that local groups will then fix the shortcomings),
speaks tirelessly, and generally tries to recreate a modern version
of the community bonds that flourished at the turn of the 20th
century and again after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that I am a Jane Addams or a John Dewey,
but I aspire to that role,'' Putnam said, naming two
turn-of-the-century social reformers who were both scholars and
doers. ``In academia now it has become a less prestigious activity
to be concerned about social reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Putnam put forth his message, in an academic
article published five years ago, he caught lots of attention, as
much for the title, ``Bowling Alone,'' as for the findings. People
bowled more frequently than before, he had learned, but they bowled
with their children or with a few friends: basically alone. What
had declined were the organized leagues and the lively
conversations and social interaction over beer and pizza that the
leagues fostered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowling Alone'' touched a public nerve and became a metaphor
for a much larger national malaise. Putnam suddenly found himself
profiled in People magazine. He appeared on talk shows, and
President Clinton invited him to Camp David. Most recently both Al
Gore and George W. Bush have tapped him for advice, or their aides
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know perfectly well, these politicians, that Americans
are worried about their communities,'' Putnam said over lunch
recently, putting down his fork to emphasize his point forcefully
with both hands. ``They know that if they could come up with some
coherent response, there is a market for that politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political appeal, that first paper drew plenty of
criticism. His evidence was faulty and too sparse, some said. He
failed to appreciate the new forms of civic participation that had
emerged in the late 20th century, others argued. There was concern
that the decline in church activity, for example, once a big source
of civic engagement, might only mean that organized religion no
longer spoke to people's needs as did, say, self-help groups like
Gamblers Anonymous or Weight Watchers. (These have proliferated.)
</P>
<P>
   But now Putnam, after five more years of research, has
reaffirmed his original conclusions and supported them with greatly
expanded data, all presented in a new book, ``Bowling Alone: The
Collapse and Revival of American Community'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster),
sent to stores this week. The criticism has not gone away, but
critics of Putnam's concepts who read galley proofs of the book
said it would almost certainly become the framework for a revived
debate about civic engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is definitely right that a lot of our connections with one
another are more tenuous than they used to be, and he is right, in
his final chapter, to call us to task,'' said Robert Wuthnow, a
Princeton University sociologist. ``But he has a single-minded
thesis that fails to paint the complex picture that actually
exists.''
</P>
<P>
   He ignores, for example, the proliferation of nonprofit
organizations, ``from soup kitchens to private schools to
foundations to think tanks to social welfare organizations,''
Wuthnow said. ``These are mostly small, and they function like the
civic groups that Putnam says are declining.''
</P>
<P>
   Some nonprofits do function that way, but others are created in
wills to avoid estate taxes, Putnam replies. At 59, he has sampled
the post-World War II stages of civic engagement, from its heyday
in the late 1940s and '50s, when he was growing up in Port Clinton,
Ohio, a rural town on Lake Erie, to its decline, which he has
experienced mostly as a resident of Lexington, Mass., a Boston
suburb. As a teen-ager he bowled on Saturdays in a league.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of his five-member team, recently found among his
mother's belongings, decorates the jacket of his new book. Two of
the boys are black. (Putnam is white.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that bowling leagues, even in the
1950s, did bring people together, across class lines; it is the
least class-specific sport in America,'' he said. ``You need this
sort of bridging social capital for civic engagement to really
work.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the virtues of bowling, Putnam was not particularly
good at it, with scores averaging less than 150 a game. As an adult
he has rarely bowled, apart from occasional outings when his two
children, now married, were still young: family bowling, not league
bowling. Lately, however, in recognition of the publicity his
research has brought to the sport, his students celebrate the end
of a semester with a bowling party, or by giving him bowling
knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   Others have, too. He ticks them off: bowling salt and pepper
shakers, bowling towels and shoes, books about bowling, jokes about
bowling, a tie decorated with a bowling lane. Tchotchkes, he calls
them, invoking a Yiddish word, and a reminder that religion has
played a big role in civic engagement and his life. Raised a
Methodist, he converted to Judaism, his wife's religion, when they
married 37 years ago. ``We agreed it was important that we have one
religion,'' Rosemary Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rosemary Putnam, 59, a public school special-education
teacher, is the one who is civically engaged: playing French horn
in the Lexington band, active in her temple's sisterhood, member of
a book group, volunteer tutor of immigrants in English, active in a
teachers association. Her husband sang in the town chorus for a
year or two; but absorbed in his teaching, research and writing, he
withdrew, becoming an example of the disengagement he now
chronicles.
</P>
<P>
   The Putnam thesis dwells on the precipitous decline since 1970
of community groups: the Elks, the Rotary, the Masons, the Boy
Scouts and Girl Scouts, the American Legion, parent-teacher
associations, local chapters of political parties, religious
institutions, softball teams, art groups, union locals, town bands
and scores of others. Apart from not joining, people vote less,
give fewer dinner parties, are more likely to have unlisted phone
numbers, to sue and to rely on security guards. Trust, in effect,
has declined, and trust is a big element of social capital fostered
by civic connectedness, Putnam argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connectedness really matters,'' he said at a White House
conference last month. ``Wonderful studies, controlling for your
blood chemistry and how old you are and your gender and whether you
jog and whether you smoke and so on, show that your chances of
dying over the next year are cut in half by joining one group. Cut
in a quarter by joining two groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Putnam's evidence for the decline in civic engagement
came from a huge mass of previously untapped lifestyle surveys
compiled over the years by Roper and DDB Needham. Polls designed
for marketing and then stored away became in Putnam's hands
historical data on civic engagement. ``If the client was Hallmark,
it wanted to know about churchgoing, and food companies wanted to
know about family dinner trends,'' Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Other community activities have grown, of course. Volunteering
is one. Children play soccer more than ever, on teams organized by
parents, although Putnam found that ``if every single soccer mom
and dad in America went to every single soccer game, that would not
be as large a number as the number of people who stopped bowling in
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Theda Skocpol, a Harvard sociologist, says that beyond the
community, advocacy groups _ organizations like the Sierra Club,
the Children's Defense Fund, the American Association of Retired
Persons _ have become a new form of social connectedness. They are
an outgrowth of the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam War
protests, women's liberation: issues that the old civic engagement
failed to address.
</P>
<P>
   She adds that rather than fostering give-and-take conversation,
the advocacy groups are run by ``elite people more than ever,''
while the millions of members mail in their dues and contributions.
It is a system that ``contributes to the sense of most Americans
that everything is going on above their heads,'' Skocpol said,
causing them to pull back from public life.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Internet communication can reverse this trend,
recreating the old conversation in a new format, Putnam says he
does not know. He guesses that the Internet will complement rather
than replace face-to-face communications. But he is not sure. ``I
am worried,'' he said, ``that I will end up in the long sweep of
history having written a book about disconnection at the very
moment that technology was changing the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Putnam acknowledges that the rise of the two-earner
family cuts into time available for civic engagement, economics
plays a relatively small role in his scheme. Electronic
entertainment, mostly television, gets 25 percent of the blame.
People increasingly watch television alone. It isolates. So does
suburban sprawl and the additional commuting time, alone in a car,
that sprawl requires. People increasingly live in one suburb, work
in another and shop at malls in a third location, Putnam finds.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest culprit, however, is generational change, he
concluded. The Depression and World War II produced a generation of
civic-minded Americans. As that generation has aged, giving way to
less trustful more isolated Americans, civic engagement and social
capital have declined. Still, Putnam is optimistic. Just as the
mass immigration in the late 19th century and the shift from farms
to cities resulted in the creation of the community groups and ties
now in decline, the new circumstances should create new
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   That leap of faith is greeted with skepticism by Skocpol and
other social scientists. But Putnam, in his enthusiasm, sees his
own efforts and those of a few others engaged in community
organization as the beginning of a revival of the old connectedness
in new ways not yet evident. Or as he puts it in the last sentences
of his book: ``Henry Ward Beecher's advice a century ago to
`multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do
this, ironically, not because it will be good for America _ though
it will be _ but because it will be good for us.''

 &HT;    Siren song of cybersex strengthens
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They just can't pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   Cybersex has gone beyond a flirtatious romp online for many
Internet users, with more than 2 million users now considered
serious addicts _ people who chat or visit pornography sites so
often it interferes with their off-line lives.
</P>
<P>
   And with more than 60 million Internet users tapped in at work
stations, on laptops and, soon, through their microwaves, that
number is expected to explode, experts said during a daylong
symposium in Atlanta, part of the National Council on Sexual
Addiction and Compulsivity annual conference.
</P>
<P>
   Women and gay men appear to be more susceptible to the
cyber-siren's song because the Internet gives them the ability to
experiment and explore their sexuality with less fear of disease,
abuse or discovery, panelists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a great equalizer,'' said Al Cooper, clinical
director of the San Jose Marital and Sexuality Centre and author of
one of the most comprehensive studies of cybersex. ``The Internet
provides a way that women can experiment and be free to explore,
but it's also getting a lot of them in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Children are also vulnerable, still too young to understand and
fear the deep waters they're trolling. For example, Vermont
counselor Robert Freeman-Longo discussed how he ventured into
sexual chat rooms under various identities to test the
participants' response. When he identified himself as a 15-year-old
boy in search for adult women, he was chastised and told to get
out. But when he identified himself as a 14-year-old girl, one man
_ in a different state _ said he would arrange to meet
Freeman-Longo (posing as the girl) at her school.
</P>
<P>
   And the ones who are hooked are wrecking careers, marriages and
family lives. A primary cause: an increasing lack of, as experts
say, face-to-face time.
</P>
<P>
   And society is still grappling with what exactly is a violation
of marital trust. Initially, husbands and wives tend to play down
their spouses' interactions on the Internet, thinking it's
harmless. But then they discover a cache of e-mail or pornographic
material, it leaves them devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Young, director for the Center for On-Line Addiction,
said she had one client, married 38 years, who discovered six
months after her husband's death explicit e-mail he had written to
27 women.
</P>
<P>
   And many partners believe their fight doesn't involve real
people but fantasies created within their own home. ``I felt like
he was choosing between me and it,'' one woman wrote in a survey
about cybersex. ``And it usually won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you're doing something that you and your spouse
can't talk about, you've got a problem,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment for such addicts needs to model treatment for food
addiction, experts say. And often that means users need to move the
computer back into a public place _ such as the den or living room
_ dismantle bookmarks and subscriptions, install software or use a
server that will filter out porn sites, and strictly monitor time
spent on the computer with an alarm clock if they need to use it
for work or other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshot of cybersex
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Of those who participated in cybersex activities, 91.7 percent
reported they spent less than 11 hours a week in online sexual
pursuits. Of those, half spent less than an hour a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  70 percent of e-porn activity occurred between 9 a.m. and 5
p.m. workdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  49.9 percent of the men who engage in cybersex activities look
at visual erotica; 23 percent of women did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  48.6 percent of women preferred sexually explicit chat rooms;
22.8 percent of men did.

U.S. JOBLESS RATE DROPS BELOW 4 PERCENT

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States' unemployment rate fell below 4 percent in
April for the first time in 30 years, the Labor Department
announced Friday, as employers hired, among others, tens of
thousands of census takers, restaurant employees and temporary
workers in a boom that showed no signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was little evidence in the employment numbers _ a
total of 340,000 new jobs last month and a jobless rate of 3.9
percent _ that the 9-year-old expansion, the longest period of
uninterrupted growth in U.S. history, might be weakening in
response to the Federal Reserve Board's attempt to slow the economy
by raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you look, you see the supply of people available
for work continuing to shrink pretty rapidly,'' said John
Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. ``Although there
is not much pressure yet on companies to raise prices, the
inflation rate has begun to creep up and the Fed must think about
where we will be a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy may be in its best shape since the 1960s, but the
Fed's great fear, often expressed by its chairman, Alan Greenspan,
is that job shortages will eventually give workers enough
bargaining power to push up labor costs ahead of productivity
gains.
</P>
<P>
   While wage gains remained relatively modest and many of the
latest jobs _ including those created by the Census Bureau _ are
temporary, employers may still raise prices because of the higher
costs resulting from the tight labor market _ or simply because the
strong economy allows them to.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted as if the Fed would be successful in
containing any inflationary threat, even if that meant it would
have to be more aggressive in raising interest rates. Stock prices
shot up, instead of tanking, as they often do in reaction to a
strong employment report. The Dow Jones industrial average gained
more than 165 points to close above 10,577, the Nasdaq rose 2.6
percent and bond yields edged up only modestly.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, the consensus among analysts and brokers was
that the Fed's policy-makers would probably raise the short-term
interest rates that it controls by one-quarter of a percentage
point to 6.25 at their May 16 meeting. That would be the sixth such
increase since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts now expect a half-percentage-point increase in
rates in May, with more increases likely to follow later. Wall
Street's exuberance, however, seemed to reflect a view that half a
percentage point in midmonth should be enough to finally make a
dent in the robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``God only knows why the markets are doing what they are
doing,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI.
``All I can figure is that they figure the Fed is going to do a
half-point and that will be it. Get the tightening over, and they
can go back to business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wyss and other economists noted that a booming stock
market complicates the Fed's task by encouraging the all-out
consumer spending that has kept the economy booming. ``The stock
market certainly did not help the Fed out,'' Youngdahl said,
referring to Friday's jump.
</P>
<P>
   April's employment report was striking for the evidence it
offered that the nation's pool of people still available for hire
is drying up fast. That pool shrank by 426,000 to under 9.9 million
last month, the lowest level since the Labor Department began to
track it in 1994. Greenspan pays particular attention to this
statistic because with fewer people available, existing workers _
in theory at least _ are in a better position to demand and receive
strong wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   With the unemployment rate falling from 4.1 percent to 3.9
percent _ the lowest since January 1970 _ the pool now consists of
5.5 million people labeled as officially unemployed because they
are actively looking for jobs, and 4.4 million others who tell
Labor Department surveyors that they want to work but are not
currently looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly some evidence of accelerating wages and
prices,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic
Policy Institute, noting that labor costs, by several measures, are
growing at an annual rate of at least 3.6 percent, and the consumer
price index is rising at a similar pace.
</P>
<P>
   But he wondered whether wages were pushing prices, or the other
way around. ``If you track this month to month,'' he said, ``it
looks more like tight labor markets are allowing workers to press
for wage gains to keep up with prices that reflect the rising cost
of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause and effect, the average hourly wage of
production workers rose 6 cents last month, to $13.64, up 3.6
percent over the past 12 months. That is roughly in line with the
gains recorded month after month for more than a year. But broader
measures, covering benefits as well as wages, show a recent jump in
what companies pay for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the Clinton administration's concern that an overly
aggressive Fed could damage the economy in an election year, Alexis
Herman, the secretary of labor, argued that labor productivity is
rising quickly enough to offset rising wages. ``In the midst of
this debate over interest rates,'' she said, ``we must keep the
focus on the nation's strong productivity to absorb any pressure on
wages.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   President Clinton, pointing to the social benefits of a strong
economy, called attention to ``the lowest unemployment rate for
blacks and Hispanics ever recorded.'' For Hispanics, unemployment
dropped to 5.4 percent from 6.3 percent in March, and for blacks
the rate edged down to 7.2 percent from 7.3 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   While spread broadly across business and government, job
creation was particularly strong at the Census Bureau, which added
73,000 part-time census takers last month on top of the 115,000
added in March. But that hiring will taper off quickly. To count
the population, the bureau has hired 500,000 workers this year and
now is up to full strength, a spokesman for the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the employment gains of 340,000, while strong, were
down from an even stronger 458,000 advance in March. But job
creation in the private sector remains robust, averaging 222,000 a
month since January, up from 198,000 a month last year. Total
employment rose to 131.1 million in April.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants made the the biggest contribution, adding 80,000
jobs, while temporary-help agencies added 46,000 jobs. ``Companies
cannot find people, so they turn to the temp agencies, which are
luring the elderly back into the work force, kids into part-time
work and housewives into work,'' Wyss said.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of the population now holding jobs edged up last
month to a record 64.9 percent, from 64.7 percent in March. Only
one industry lost ground: Employment in construction fell by 55,000
after having risen by 90,000 the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers also increased their rolls, but by only 11,000
jobs, although the work week in manufacturing rose by nearly half
an hour, and overtime pay also rose.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, May 3,
about demonstrations against United States military operations on
the island of Vieques referred incorrectly to the earlier prison
release of one protester, Lolita Lebron. Convicted in the attack by
Puerto Rican nationalists on Congress in 1954, she was granted
clemency by President Carter in 1979. She was not pardoned by
President Clinton last fall.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, May 4,
about the Boston Herald's suspension of a consumer affairs
columnist, Robin Washington, misstated his account of the cause.
Washington has said publicly that he believes he was originally
demoted after a bank, the FleetBoston Financial Corp., complained
about his columns on its fee structure. He said he was then
suspended after asserting publicly that the bank influenced
coverage. He did not say he believed he was suspended because of
pressure from the bank.

   LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash. _ For roughly half of the millions of
salmon born on the Snake River that set out each spring for the
Pacific Ocean, the journey past four federal dams is an arduous and
often lethal one. They can be whacked to death by giant blades of
the dam turbines, knocked out from collisions with concrete
spillways, or succumb to a fatal condition not unlike the bends.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the salmon have a much simpler trip: They get
to take the boat.
</P>
<P>
   But this annual free ride, by which the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers loads the young fish on barges and totes them around the
dams, is coming under scrutiny like never before. And for
scientists, lawmakers, farmers, fishermen, American Indians, barge
shippers, environmentalists and a breathtaking array of other
interested parties, the assessment is most likely the key to a
momentous decision that will ultimately fall to Congress: whether
to take down the Snake River dams altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The job of protecting the baby salmon, so they can mature and
breed, is a remarkable feat of engineering and an expensive _
critics say outlandish _ accommodation to man's demands for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fish a day are diverted to a channel leading to a
pipe that runs into a trailer downstream of this dam, the first of
the four, which is near the Idaho border. In the trailer, a busy
assembly line of seasonal workers briefly anesthetizes the salmon
and then injects a computer chip the size of a rice grain into
their bellies so they can be tracked over the years. They are
barged for a 36-hour, 300-mile trip, bypassing the dams on the
Snake and four more on the Columbia River. More salmon are
collected at two other dams on the Snake and one on the Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of the government's bid to keep both salmon and
dams _ ``to find a way to have our cake and eat it, too,'' said Jim
Anderson, a fisheries professor at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But with the river's coho salmon already declared extinct, and
every other species of Snake River salmon and steelhead now listed
under the Endangered Species Act, the once-unthinkable idea of
breaching the dams has emerged in several federal studies as the
action with the best chance of restoring healthy salmon runs. The
Corps of Engineers is to recommend by the end of the year whether
to propose such a step.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching of the dams is bitterly opposed by many people as an
assault on the area's agricultural economy, and the proposal has
already emerged as a hot-button issue in the Northwest in this
year's presidential race. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas vowed in the
primary campaign here never to allow the dams to be breached, while
Vice President Al Gore, part of an administration that is intensely
debating the issue, has taken no public position.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching the dams would mean removing the earthen portions,
restoring a 140-mile section of the Snake to its wild, free-flowing
condition and thus make salmon barging both impossible and
unnecessary. It would also mean that the 4 percent of the
electricity the dams provide in the Northwest would have to be
supplied by other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the 20-year-old barging program for juvenile salmon,
known as smolts, is just part of the more than $3 billion the
government has spent over that period trying to save salmon on the
Snake and Columbia Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The barging program is derided by critics as a ``techno-fix''
that harms fish, interfering with their natural migration rhythms,
causing them to die early, and perhaps interfering with their
fabled and mysterious ability to find their way back home to spawn
in their native river after spending years and traveling thousands
of miles in the Pacific Ocean, as far north as Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of barging defend it as a kind of magic solution that
could allow the salmon and the dams to coexist.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the National Marine Fisheries Service, one of several
federal agencies that must weigh in on the fate of the dams,
recently said that a decision on breaching could be put off for 5
to 10 years if barging was continued and other aggressive
conservation measures undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the results are hardly encouraging. While a
corps brochure boasts that the barging system is ``custom-made to
make the trip as safe and comfortable as possible,'' and while 98.5
percent of smolts survive the trip, the salmon themselves remain in
decline.
</P>
<P>
   In most recent years, just 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all Snake
River salmon have made it out to the ocean and all the way back,
jumping through a ladder system that bypasses the dams, to their
original spawning grounds. That is much less than the roughly 4
percent that scientists say the salmon stocks would need to recover
fully.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are unsure what percentages of barged and nonbarged
fish are making it back, a question that the microchips implanted
in recent years are supposed to help answer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   (Some fish implanted with the chips are caught years later by
fishermen, and ultimately served in restaurants; corps biologist
said the chips are implanted in a part of the fish that is not
consumed by humans.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But for many environmentalists, the numbers suggest that the
barging efforts are not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, this issue about the difference in survival of
transported fish versus fish that migrate through the river is a
red herring,'' said Rob Masonis, regional director of hydropower
programs for American Rivers, a conservation group. ``The
fundamental question is whether either of those classes of fish are
making it back to the Snake River at levels that would lead to
survival or recovery. And the answer is clearly no.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no scientific consensus on how large a culprit
the dams are in the salmon's decline. Other factors include
cyclical ocean conditions, commercial fishing and erosion of
habitat all along the rivers where the salmon spawn, which is
caused by construction and run-off from farms.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the dams on the Columbia are not candidates for
breaching.
</P>
<P>
   And early counts indicate that the Snake River may see some of
the highest numbers in recent years of returning adult chinook
salmon this year, a result that would not take them off the
endangered listing, but might lead supporters of barging to argue
for more time to see if the program can work.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, no scientist can guarantee that taking the dams down
would revive the salmon runs the explorer William Clark found in
the Snake River two centuries ago, when he wrote in his diary that
the river was ``crouded with salmon.'' (At that time, biologists
estimate, about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the epic
journey back to their spawning grounds; in most recent years, that
number has been measured in the thousands or only the hundreds for
some types of salmon.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that, compared with those fish that have to
navigate through the dams, a much higher percentage of salmon
survive the barge trip, which drops them off just downstream of the
Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, the last man-made impediment
before the fish can reach the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But as the tugboat Umatilla made its way down the Snake the
other day, pushing a barge loaded, by the government's count, with
254,317 smolts, corps biologists said they were still gathering
data on whether barging contributed to a much higher rate of what
they termed ``delayed mortality'' among salmon transported that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one big caveat, if I were a fish, I'd rather be here than
there,'' said Doug Arndt, chief of the regional fish management
division for the corps, standing aboard the barge and pointing to
the dam on the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that caveat is disease transmission,'' Arndt said. ``Is
this program enhancing disease in these fish? We just don't know
enough about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Baker, the Northwest salmon campaign coordinator for the
Sierra Club, said there were many ways in which barging could be
harmful to fish, despite the fact that such high percentages
survive the short trip itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, these barges are running on a human schedule,
rather than the fishes' schedule,'' Baker said. ``There's a great
deal of evidence that these fish are released too soon below the
Bonneville Dam, so that they enter a salt water estuary too early
in their development.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson of the University of Washington says that there is not
enough research to show if barged fish die in much greater numbers
than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of hypotheses and no real ways to measure the
mechanisms that might be producing this extramortality,'' Anderson
said. ``So people are really making arguments on things for which
we don't have enough information yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The fish transportation program started on an experimental basis
in 1968 with trucks, and has been in full operation with barges
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The breaching issue represents a political juggling act for
Gore, the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democrats, and
there are strong indications that the process leading to a corps
recommendation will extend, not at all coincidentally, until just
beyond the Nov. 7 election.
</P>
<P>
   It is a clearer political call for Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, who ran radio commercials in the
primary declaring that the dams ``will stay right where they are''
if he is elected. In February, he told a cheering crowd at Columbia
Basin College in Pasco, Wash.: ``I grew up in West Texas. It's a
part of the world without much water. I understand the importance
of water.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fisheries service is expected to recommend waiting for
several years before a decision is made, the Environmental
Protection Agency told the corps recently that the four dams harmed
the river's water quality, endangered the salmon and might have to
be breached to comply with the federal Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions remain impassioned on both sides. The Columbia River
Alliance, representing other commercial users of the river, said
the breaching proposal was ``an economic dark cloud hanging over
these communities that depend on dams.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a hearing on dam breaching in Seattle this winter, one
fisherman said he did not want delays or stop-gap measures or
``Army Corps of Engineers Rube Goldberg barges.'' The solution, he
said, was to ``let the Snake River flow.''

among the characters of ``Gilligan's Island'' about the new trend
toward ``reality-based game programming.'' CBS maroons a group of
real people, contestants, on an island and keeps hundreds of
cameras and microphones pointed at them 24 hours a day to record
everything they say and do. People are voted out of the group one
by one. After a few weeks their small society, a microcosm of the
world at large if you will, devolves into something out of ``Lord
of the Flies.'' CBS awards the final contestant a million dollars
or something. By Jeff MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   E-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For more than a year, I've been
experimenting with electronic books. The various e-book devices
felt like solid hardcovers in hand, but the first generation seemed
stiff to me, somehow nerdy and bulky. The cold gray screens of text
didn't offer the hypnotic calm of vanilla rag paper. Reading books
on a PC felt too much as if I was working, chained upright to a
desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback revolution. I
was drawn to the devices that offered one of the basic elements of
pocketbook design: portability. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-OBSTACLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The debacle of the Sierra
Leone peacekeeping mission and the awkward U.S. response
demonstrate again that Africa takes more than good intentions. Now,
the likelihood of deployment of even the modest force for Congo
looks very distant. And even as the House approved a trade bill
granting new trading privileges to Africa, there are some doubts
whether many African countries have the economic capacity to take
advantage of it. The fact remains that sub-Saharan Africa is so
poor, that McDonald's cannot find enough of a customer base to open
one outlet in even one nation. By Jane Perlez. (Moving in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A tempest is brewing in
Washington, all because of an 11-inch blond bombshell. Mattel, in
association with two nonprofit women's groups, recently announced
plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll. Almost immediately the
protests sounded. But why shouldn't American children learn about
civics and the virtues of public service via their favorite
playthings? By Bruce Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   SWORD&AMP;SANDAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ To mark the opening of
``Gladiator'' and the passing of Hercules actor Steve Reeves,
earlier sword-and-sandal epics are recalled for their memorable
utterances. It didn't matter whether the plots were derived from
the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of ancient Rome _ or, more
typically, some unholy mixture of the three. The dialogue
frequently managed to range from the ponderous to the purple, and
sometimes to the preposterous.

   &UR; COVER STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOGUL-IMAGE-FILMS (Hollywood) _ When Budd Schulberg dreamed up
Sammy Glick _ the ultimate Hollywood wheeler-dealer, back in the
1930s, he meant his novel, ``What Makes Sammy Run?,'' to be seen in
part as a cautionary tale. Back then, Sammy Glick was the villain
of the piece, the awful example of what might happen if you let
individualism and free-enterprise run away with you. But Not until
the 1970s did Schulberg notice the beginnings of a ``180-degree
turn in our national attitude toward Sammy.'' By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENT-TV (Los Angeles) _ For more than two decades, Robert
Greenwald, a prolific television producer, has owned the films he
made, which gave him the leverage to do such Emmy Award-winning
shows as ``The Burning Bed'' and ``A Woman of Independent Means.''
But now Greenwald and virtually every other producer of films and
series is under powerful pressure to yield to the networks and
allow them to own the shows. By Bernard Weinraub.

<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HAMLET-FILM (Undated) _ Given the story's familiarity, it seemed
altogether natural to locate a new ``Hamlet'' in the immediate
present, to translate the Danish kingdom into a multimedia
corporation, and to watch the story unfold in penthouse hotel
rooms, sky-level office corridors, a coffee shop, an airplane, the
Guggenheim Museum. Director Michael Almereyda discusses his
decision to bring Hamlet into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   HEART-FILM (Undated) _ The first-time writer-directors Anthony
Stark and Sean Smith, best friends since high school, are in a
difficult position when they talk about their new movie, ``Into My
Heart,'' a dark story about two men, best friends since childhood,
whose relationship takes a tragic turn after they grow up and get
married. Stark and Smith's reluctance to admit that their art may
imitate life could be more than the usual insistence by writers
that their creation is a work of fiction. By Dana Kennedy.

</P>
<P>
   LANCASTER-FILM (Undated) _ In many ways, Burt Lancaster is the
antithesis of the modern leading man. Today's young actors build
themselves the bodies of athletes. He was an athlete who built
himself into an actor. Lancaster was both of his time _ a
golden-age Movie Star _ and way ahead of it. As an independent
producer, he helped sabotage the studio system that made him, at
one time, the highest-paid actor in the world. By Rick Marin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY-REUNION-THEATER (London) _ T.S. Eliot's ``Family
Reunion'' has risen greatly in critical esteem since it flopped in
the West End 60-odd years ago. Many now regard the poet's story of
the English lord impelled by updated Furies to atone for his wife's
dark death as the nearest to a theatrical masterpiece Eliot ever
wrote. New Yorkers will make up their own minds when the Royal
Shakespeare Company's revival opens at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music on Wednesday. By Benedict Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   ORESTEIA-THEATER (Undated) _ Murder. Adultery. Courtroom drama.
A fugitive's hair-raising flight from implacable justice. With
super-heated elements like these to work with, it's no wonder
modern playwrights keep rewriting Aeschylus' ``Oresteia,'' the
fifth-century B.C. dramatic trilogy about a family ensnared in
guilt and violence. By Celia Wren.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE-THEATER (New York) _ John Guare's play ``Gardenia'' begins
in 1875 with Joshua Hickman reading from Walt Whitman's poem ``On
the Beach at Night Alone'': ``A vast similitude interlocks all.''
That quotation about the interconnectedness of humanity is the
central theme of the 1982 play and of the cycle of plays of which
``Gardenia'' is a part. Whitman's line was also at the heart of
``Six Degrees of Separation,'' Guare's 1990 play about the idea
that ``everybody on this planet is separated by only six other
people.'' In the world of Guare, a vast similitude interlocks all.
After years of revising that earlier cycle, he has reordered it
into two plays under the collective title ``Lydie Breeze.'' By Mel
Gussow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-COMEDY-TV (Undated) _ The proportion of viewers
admitting that they get their politics from television comedy may
not be overwhelming. But considering that the 1996 presidential
election was decided by a mere eight percentage points, what each
and every consumer of comedy on television takes away from the
experience can be highly significant. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JOPLIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ When the directors of Opera Theater of
St. Louis began planning its 25th anniversary season, the idea of
presenting Scott Joplin's ``Treemonisha'' as its opening production
seemed a natural. It was in St. Louis that Joplin conceived and
largely composed ``Treemonisha,'' a tender story of a Negro
community on a plantation abandoned to its former slaves in
Reconstruction-era Arkansas. And yet, the directors of the Opera
Theater hesitated for some time about presenting ``Treemonisha''
out of concern for the Joplin's text, which is riddled with what
audiences today might consider demeaning Negro stereotypes and
dated dialogue. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   BEETHOVEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ When in the course of human events,
musicians feel impelled to declare to the world and to themselves
the highest ideals of which the individual and humanity are
capable, the composer to whom they are most apt to turn is
Beethoven. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

improvisation is a growing phenomenon in the music world. By Ben
Ratliff.

   ABT-DANCE (New York) _ With the turn of the millennium, American
Ballet Theater moved into overdrive on its new production of ``Swan
Lake.'' The production will have its New York premiere at the
Metropolitan Opera House on May 19 and is expected to be the
blockbuster of the company's 60th-anniversary season, which opens
with a gala performance May 8 and runs through July 1. By Iris
Fanger.

</P>
<P>
   SCHWARTZ-PHOTOGRAPHY (New York) _ When he saw a camera obscura
on the roof of a private museum in Kyoto in 1991, Charles Schwartz
knew he had to have one. So now, poking through the roof of his
staid apartment building on the Upper East Side, is a jaunty,
medieval-looking turret that holds the telescopic lens and mirror
of what surely is the only camera obscura of its size in Manhattan,
and one of the very few private devices of its kind in the world.
By Grace Glueck.

   CALIF-CHINA-ART (Santa Ana, Calif) _ The opulence of China's
last imperial rulers is an ever-present thread in the largest-ever
exhibition of national treasures from China's Imperial Palace,
installed in February at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, a
Spanish-style hacienda near downtown Santa Ana, Calif. By Andrea
Adelson.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-COMMUNE-ART (Paris) _ The Paris Commune of 1871 is one of
those smoldering ruins in French history. As the first news event

 &HT;    New strains of Love Bug virus surfaceBy Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At least seven variations of the devastating
``Love Bug'' virus floated through cyberspace Friday, one
masquerading as a virus warning and another pretending to be an
electronic receipt for a diamond Mother's Day present.
</P>
<P>
   But as they scrambled to track the new bugs, anti-virus
researchers braced themselves for a fresh bout with the old one.
This weekend, experts say they expect to see a smaller-scale flurry
of Love Bug attacks caused by people who didn't check their e-mail
during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of home computer users wait to read messages until the
weekend, so we speculate that there will be a spike in virus
reports,'' said Eddy Hsia of McAfee.com Corp., part of anti-virus
software maker Network Associates Inc. ``Corporate reports have
tapered, but who knows what will happen (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   The new strains have different names, but the damage reportedly
remains the same as Love Bug which ravaged e-mail servers Thursday
by clogging them with ILOVEYOU messages that carried a lethal
love-letter attachment. It also ruined sound and video files.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread among virus variations is a ``.vbs'' at the
end of the document name, an almost surefire sign that it's a
troublesome attachment. The key to avoiding the fast-morphing virus
strains is to ignore any ``.vbs'' files.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 45 million people received the infected ILOVEYOU
e-mail Thursday, according to California-based research company
Computer Economics. The CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, Pa. estimated as many as 600 million
computers worldwide had been affected by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations from government agencies to small businesses to
universities spent the day assessing the damage. Taking into
account the number of ruined files and the time wasted by shutting
off e-mail servers, Computer Economics pegged the damages at $2.6
billion _ but said that total could skyrocket to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, total damages from all virus attacks in 1999 was
estimated at $12.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators continued scouring the Love Bug code,
having found clues that hint at a 23-year-old from The Philippines,
code-named Spyder, who included that name and little notes like ``I
hate go to school'' in the text of the virus program.
</P>
<P>
   The question, then, is whether investigators can trust what they
read.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hokey and obvious, but it is also pretty common
for virus writers to leave their name in the code for notoriety,
even though it's like signing their own arrest warrant,'' said Matt
Yarbrough, a Dallas attorney who once worked on the Justice
Department's CyberCrimes Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It either is this 23-year-old kid or someone sophisticated who
wanted everyone to think it's a kid. It has to be either one _
nothing in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, a new message circulated claiming to be a
virus warning and asking readers to click on
``viruswarning.jpg.vbs'' to somehow view the bug. That file is
infected just like Love Bug and its less-than-loving letter.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Mother's Day Order Confirmation, tells recipients that
their credit card has been charged $326.92 for a diamond gift to
their mother. A fake invoice is attached, and if puzzled readers
download it, they too will catch the bug. Other variations include
JOKE and a sentence written in Lithuanian that translates as an
invitation to go out for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The point of changing the message title, or the name of the
attached document, is to evade special filters set up to detect the
ILOVEYOU messages and block them from arriving in mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally see a surge of variations, but it usually drops
back down again,'' Leibrock said. ``It's like a flu attack.''
</P>
<P>
   So as the bug keeps crawling, Leibrock said he's trying to
dispel myths he's heard from people who think they're invulnerable
simply because the Love Bug didn't bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some remarkably stupid comments, like, 'It only
affected one type of e-mail server,' `` Leibrock said. ``That's
like saying that if a car has a collision, then only that make and
model of car will ever have collisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's immune _ that's what we should learn from this.''

   INTERNET-PRIVACY (Undated) _ There has been no shortage of

lots of companies are trying to peer back through the glowing

implants, and nothing else. And if Anderson, Dow Corning's chief
executive, were an irritable kind of fellow, that would irk him
mightily. But irritability is not Mr. Anderson's style. A product
that never accounted for more than 1 percent of its sales blackened
the name of Dow Corning in the public mind like few others in

Protesters decry globalization, the process whereby dastardly
capitalists provide paying jobs to starving Third Worlders who were
previously without hope. But their choice of targets is puzzling:
they vent spleen at the World Bank and the IMF, while letting

   BIZ-HEALTH-COLUMN (Undated) _ Money &AMP; Medicine: Ask people how
money is wasted in the health care system, and their tone of voice
will undergo an interesting change. Doctors huff and puff about the
squadrons of workers they have had to hire to meet the paperwork
demands of managed care. Patients complain about the $60 they shell
out for three-minute appointments during which doctors seems to do
little more than blink at them. Insurance companies bemoan
unnecessary tests. In fact, there are many quantifiable ways that
millions of dollars go up in smoke each year. Patients are

<P>
   ABOUT-CARS (Undated) _ Since ``sport utility vehicle'' entered
the common lexicon, the taxonomists of the auto business have been
pulling out their wiry hair trying to keep up with the diversity of
the four-wheeled kingdom. Should one, for instance, accept BMW's
classification of its X5 as a ``sport activity vehicle''? Is that
different from an ``all activity vehicle,'' which is what Mercedes
calls its M-Class? Whatever term should come of age, it had better
grow up quick, since five- and six-passenger pickups with four
sedan-style doors and shortened cargo beds are barging into the
market like an enraged SWAT team. By Dan Neil.

<P>
   CAR-SHORTAGES (Undated) _ With auto sales booming along with the
economy, consumers who want a hot-selling vehicle are struggling to
find the unfindable, which this spring includes eye-catching models
like Chrysler's PT and the Toyota MR2 Spyder sports car, the
eminently practical Honda Odyssey minivan and luxury vehicles like
BMW's X5 sport utility and Mercedes' flagship S-Class lineup.

   COURTING-BOUQUETS (New York) _ An unsuspecting woman received a
bouquet of flowers recently at her Fifth Avenue home. Set in a
silver-plated urn, the $350 arrangement was lush with romantic pink
roses, Italian poppies, deep-purple sweet peas, calla lillies and a
card that read, ``We'd be a good match.'' Her secret admirer? A
floral designer named David Beahm, whose intentions were not
particularly romantic. The object of his attentions is a member of
the organizing committee for a fall fund-raising gala for the
Metropolitan Opera, with the unofficial position of flower
chairwoman: she picks the florist who picks the flowers. The
unsolicited arrangement was ``a courting bouquet.''By Monique P.

told herself soothingly, ``but who remembers what her mother wore?
Nobody pays attention to the mother of the bride.'' Mrs. Beckerman

   FRAGRANCE-BOUTIQUES (Undated) _ While customization has proved
popular recently in everything from suits to ice cream, it is
taking off in the top tiers of the fragrance industry. Creed, the
very upscale European fragrance house, whose perfumer is the
sixth-generation Oliver Creed, offers custom scents. There are also
Creed master blenders at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman and
Neiman Marcus, who can blend five or six of the existing 100 Creed
scents for customers in an hour, for the more affordable fee of
$400 to $1,000. On the West Coast there are a growing number of

   NITEOUT-OSCAR-JOKE-WRITER (New York) _ The packed house at last

said one audience member, sensing that Bruce Vilanch, the show's
author and star, has already crossed the threshold from wannabe to
being there. Vilanch, the New Jersey-born quipmeister who has
written for Bette Midler and Robin Williams, currently pens

   FASHION-COPY-EDITORS (New York) _ Being a copy editor at a

``Daaahling'' or air-kiss the French photographers when they come

   MOTHERHOOD-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Political strategies come
and go, but a few endure: Never underestimate the political potency
of motherhood. The leaders of the Million Mom March for ``sensible
gun control'' next Sunday, Mother's Day, have an appealing web
site, a shrewd media effort and an aggressive grass-roots
organizing campaign. But above all, they are invoking a very old

women as mothers. By Robin Toner.

   ANTIQUES-STOCKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nasdaq gave amateur investors

Meanwhile, the antiques world gave amateur appraisers the

allowed Web surfers to go antiquing over high-speed access lines,

   NATIONAL-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Defining national security:
Just when does a big problem turn into a national security threat?
If Eisenhower were alive today, he might be amused or puzzled by
the Clinton administration's linkage of national security to issues
like trade privileges for China, AIDS in Africa and global warming.
But it is possible that after a decade of unchallenged power and
prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national
security in broader terms. BY David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTS-JOB-BIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A good job on the night
shift opens up. A mother with young children is not offered the
job, which would be a promotion, because her supervisor assumes _
wrongly _ that her family responsibilities prevent her from working
nights. Did the supervisor act properly? Hardly anyone would say
so. Should the supervisor's action be against the law? Absolutely,
in President Clinton's view. Is the problem pervasive? No one
knows. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CELLPHONES-CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the use of
cellular phones as crime-fighting devices. Since the early 1990s,
cell phones have increasingly become the all-purpose, cure-all
solution for individual safety. The notion of being wired in the
electronic age is shared shared by both parent and child, salesman
and client, cop and felon. The issue, however, is whether people
are really safe, or merely think they are. By Jason Blair.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-TECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ For believers in technology's
implied promise of an information utopia, in which people can see
or hear or read whatever they want (and show or tell or write
whatever they want), the Disney-Time Warner battle over ABC
transmission was an uncomfortable lesson that the more information
available, the more places in which it is available, the more the
logic of economics and egos will come into play to restrict it. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN'S-REALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ An imaginary discussion
among the characters of ``Gilligan's Island'' about the new trend
toward ``reality-based game programming.'' CBS maroons a group of
real people, contestants, on an island and keeps hundreds of
cameras and microphones pointed at them 24 hours a day to record
everything they say and do. People are voted out of the group one
by one. After a few weeks their small society, a microcosm of the
world at large if you will, devolves into something out of ``Lord
of the Flies.'' CBS awards the final contestant a million dollars
or something. By Jeff MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   E-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For more than a year, I've been
experimenting with electronic books. The various e-book devices
felt like solid hardcovers in hand, but the first generation seemed
stiff to me, somehow nerdy and bulky. The cold gray screens of text
didn't offer the hypnotic calm of vanilla rag paper. Reading books
on a PC felt too much as if I was working, chained upright to a
desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback revolution. I
was drawn to the devices that offered one of the basic elements of
pocketbook design: portability. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-OBSTACLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The debacle of the Sierra
Leone peacekeeping mission and the awkward U.S. response
demonstrate again that Africa takes more than good intentions. Now,
the likelihood of deployment of even the modest force for Congo
looks very distant. And even as the House approved a trade bill
granting new trading privileges to Africa, there are some doubts
whether many African countries have the economic capacity to take
advantage of it. The fact remains that sub-Saharan Africa is so
poor, that McDonald's cannot find enough of a customer base to open
one outlet in even one nation. By Jane Perlez. (Moving in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A tempest is brewing in
Washington, all because of an 11-inch blond bombshell. Mattel, in
association with two nonprofit women's groups, recently announced
plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll. Almost immediately the
protests sounded. But why shouldn't American children learn about
civics and the virtues of public service via their favorite
playthings? By Bruce Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   SWORD&AMP;SANDAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ To mark the opening of
``Gladiator'' and the passing of Hercules actor Steve Reeves,
earlier sword-and-sandal epics are recalled for their memorable
utterances. It didn't matter whether the plots were derived from
the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of ancient Rome _ or, more
typically, some unholy mixture of the three. The dialogue
frequently managed to range from the ponderous to the purple, and
sometimes to the preposterous.

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert D. Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University,
is a big, red-faced, enthusiastic man with the Amish whiskers and
explosive gestures of a 19th-century fundamentalist preacher _
useful characteristics for the ``hell will get us if we don't mend
our ways'' thesis that has taken over his life in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   His message, familiar to millions of Americans, is that the
civic engagement _ the neighborhood friendships, the dinner
parties, the group discussions, the club memberships, the church
committees, the political participation; all the involvements, even
the street protests, that make a democracy work _ have declined
over the last 30 years. Trust and reciprocity, which Putnam calls
social capital, have been damaged, he says, and the nation has
grown cantankerous and less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Being a spiritual man, deeply committed to his own findings, he
proselytizes. Tapping foundations for funds, Putnam organizes
seminars, surveys ``social connectedness'' in numerous cities (the
hope being that local groups will then fix the shortcomings),
speaks tirelessly, and generally tries to recreate a modern version
of the community bonds that flourished at the turn of the 20th
century and again after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that I am a Jane Addams or a John Dewey,
but I aspire to that role,'' Putnam said, naming two
turn-of-the-century social reformers who were both scholars and
doers. ``In academia now it has become a less prestigious activity
to be concerned about social reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Putnam put forth his message, in an academic
article published five years ago, he caught lots of attention, as
much for the title, ``Bowling Alone,'' as for the findings. People
bowled more frequently than before, he had learned, but they bowled
with their children or with a few friends: basically alone. What
had declined were the organized leagues and the lively
conversations and social interaction over beer and pizza that the
leagues fostered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowling Alone'' touched a public nerve and became a metaphor
for a much larger national malaise. Putnam suddenly found himself
profiled in People magazine. He appeared on talk shows, and
President Clinton invited him to Camp David. Most recently both Al
Gore and George W. Bush have tapped him for advice, or their aides
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know perfectly well, these politicians, that Americans
are worried about their communities,'' Putnam said over lunch
recently, putting down his fork to emphasize his point forcefully
with both hands. ``They know that if they could come up with some
coherent response, there is a market for that politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political appeal, that first paper drew plenty of
criticism. His evidence was faulty and too sparse, some said. He
failed to appreciate the new forms of civic participation that had
emerged in the late 20th century, others argued. There was concern
that the decline in church activity, for example, once a big source
of civic engagement, might only mean that organized religion no
longer spoke to people's needs as did, say, self-help groups like
Gamblers Anonymous or Weight Watchers. (These have proliferated.)
</P>
<P>
   But now Putnam, after five more years of research, has
reaffirmed his original conclusions and supported them with greatly
expanded data, all presented in a new book, ``Bowling Alone: The
Collapse and Revival of American Community'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster),
sent to stores this week. The criticism has not gone away, but
critics of Putnam's concepts who read galley proofs of the book
said it would almost certainly become the framework for a revived
debate about civic engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is definitely right that a lot of our connections with one
another are more tenuous than they used to be, and he is right, in
his final chapter, to call us to task,'' said Robert Wuthnow, a
Princeton University sociologist. ``But he has a single-minded
thesis that fails to paint the complex picture that actually
exists.''
</P>
<P>
   He ignores, for example, the proliferation of nonprofit
organizations, ``from soup kitchens to private schools to
foundations to think tanks to social welfare organizations,''
Wuthnow said. ``These are mostly small, and they function like the
civic groups that Putnam says are declining.''
</P>
<P>
   Some nonprofits do function that way, but others are created in
wills to avoid estate taxes, Putnam replies. At 59, he has sampled
the post-World War II stages of civic engagement, from its heyday
in the late 1940s and '50s, when he was growing up in Port Clinton,
Ohio, a rural town on Lake Erie, to its decline, which he has
experienced mostly as a resident of Lexington, Mass., a Boston
suburb. As a teen-ager he bowled on Saturdays in a league.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of his five-member team, recently found among his
mother's belongings, decorates the jacket of his new book. Two of
the boys are black. (Putnam is white.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that bowling leagues, even in the
1950s, did bring people together, across class lines; it is the
least class-specific sport in America,'' he said. ``You need this
sort of bridging social capital for civic engagement to really
work.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the virtues of bowling, Putnam was not particularly
good at it, with scores averaging less than 150 a game. As an adult
he has rarely bowled, apart from occasional outings when his two
children, now married, were still young: family bowling, not league
bowling. Lately, however, in recognition of the publicity his
research has brought to the sport, his students celebrate the end
of a semester with a bowling party, or by giving him bowling
knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   Others have, too. He ticks them off: bowling salt and pepper
shakers, bowling towels and shoes, books about bowling, jokes about
bowling, a tie decorated with a bowling lane. Tchotchkes, he calls
them, invoking a Yiddish word, and a reminder that religion has
played a big role in civic engagement and his life. Raised a
Methodist, he converted to Judaism, his wife's religion, when they
married 37 years ago. ``We agreed it was important that we have one
religion,'' Rosemary Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rosemary Putnam, 59, a public school special-education
teacher, is the one who is civically engaged: playing French horn
in the Lexington band, active in her temple's sisterhood, member of
a book group, volunteer tutor of immigrants in English, active in a
teachers association. Her husband sang in the town chorus for a
year or two; but absorbed in his teaching, research and writing, he
withdrew, becoming an example of the disengagement he now
chronicles.
</P>
<P>
   The Putnam thesis dwells on the precipitous decline since 1970
of community groups: the Elks, the Rotary, the Masons, the Boy
Scouts and Girl Scouts, the American Legion, parent-teacher
associations, local chapters of political parties, religious
institutions, softball teams, art groups, union locals, town bands
and scores of others. Apart from not joining, people vote less,
give fewer dinner parties, are more likely to have unlisted phone
numbers, to sue and to rely on security guards. Trust, in effect,
has declined, and trust is a big element of social capital fostered
by civic connectedness, Putnam argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connectedness really matters,'' he said at a White House
conference last month. ``Wonderful studies, controlling for your
blood chemistry and how old you are and your gender and whether you
jog and whether you smoke and so on, show that your chances of
dying over the next year are cut in half by joining one group. Cut
in a quarter by joining two groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Putnam's evidence for the decline in civic engagement
came from a huge mass of previously untapped lifestyle surveys
compiled over the years by Roper and DDB Needham. Polls designed
for marketing and then stored away became in Putnam's hands
historical data on civic engagement. ``If the client was Hallmark,
it wanted to know about churchgoing, and food companies wanted to
know about family dinner trends,'' Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Other community activities have grown, of course. Volunteering
is one. Children play soccer more than ever, on teams organized by
parents, although Putnam found that ``if every single soccer mom
and dad in America went to every single soccer game, that would not
be as large a number as the number of people who stopped bowling in
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Theda Skocpol, a Harvard sociologist, says that beyond the
community, advocacy groups _ organizations like the Sierra Club,
the Children's Defense Fund, the American Association of Retired
Persons _ have become a new form of social connectedness. They are
an outgrowth of the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam War
protests, women's liberation: issues that the old civic engagement
failed to address.
</P>
<P>
   She adds that rather than fostering give-and-take conversation,
the advocacy groups are run by ``elite people more than ever,''
while the millions of members mail in their dues and contributions.
It is a system that ``contributes to the sense of most Americans
that everything is going on above their heads,'' Skocpol said,
causing them to pull back from public life.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Internet communication can reverse this trend,
recreating the old conversation in a new format, Putnam says he
does not know. He guesses that the Internet will complement rather
than replace face-to-face communications. But he is not sure. ``I
am worried,'' he said, ``that I will end up in the long sweep of
history having written a book about disconnection at the very
moment that technology was changing the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Putnam acknowledges that the rise of the two-earner
family cuts into time available for civic engagement, economics
plays a relatively small role in his scheme. Electronic
entertainment, mostly television, gets 25 percent of the blame.
People increasingly watch television alone. It isolates. So does
suburban sprawl and the additional commuting time, alone in a car,
that sprawl requires. People increasingly live in one suburb, work
in another and shop at malls in a third location, Putnam finds.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest culprit, however, is generational change, he
concluded. The Depression and World War II produced a generation of
civic-minded Americans. As that generation has aged, giving way to
less trustful more isolated Americans, civic engagement and social
capital have declined. Still, Putnam is optimistic. Just as the
mass immigration in the late 19th century and the shift from farms
to cities resulted in the creation of the community groups and ties
now in decline, the new circumstances should create new
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   That leap of faith is greeted with skepticism by Skocpol and
other social scientists. But Putnam, in his enthusiasm, sees his
own efforts and those of a few others engaged in community
organization as the beginning of a revival of the old connectedness
in new ways not yet evident. Or as he puts it in the last sentences
of his book: ``Henry Ward Beecher's advice a century ago to
`multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do
this, ironically, not because it will be good for America _ though
it will be _ but because it will be good for us.''

GORE OFFERS PLANS TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND PAY OF TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (SUBS to insert new material on Bush after 6th graf; new quotes
from teachers' union officials after original 11th graf) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. _ In a speech here outlining his proposals to
improve the quality of the nation's public school teachers, Vice
President Al Gore offered a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine
go down.
</P>
<P>
   He said that as president he would spend $8 billion over 10
years to recruit 1 million new teachers and another $8 billion over
10 years to increase teacher salaries if the states and teachers'
unions agreed that all new teachers submit to testing and meet
rigorous national standards and if teachers are hired on the basis
of expertise and not seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will ensure that
there is a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every single
classroom, everywhere in this nation, before the next four years is
out,'' he declared in a speech here to the Michigan Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   His proposals are based on the theory that the quality of
teachers is the most significant factor within a school's control
in improving student achievement. And education ranks near the top
of voter concerns, especially in important battleground states like
Michigan, where Gore conducted his fourth ``school day'' Friday,
spending an entire day at the high school in nearby Holt. (He also
conducted his first ``school day'' in Michigan, in McComb County.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's give every teacher a $5,000 raise,'' the vice president
said in Lansing on Friday. ``Let's give $10,000 to master
teachers,'' he said, vowing: ``I will combine greater
accountability with greater investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that by 2004, he would require states to make sure
that teachers are fully qualified to teach the subject they are
teaching. As of now, he said, only 36 percent of teachers consider
themselves to be very well-prepared to meet the standards of their
state or school district. In high-poverty areas, as many as 50
percent of the math teachers have not studied math.
</P>
<P>
   Education is an area to which Gore's Republican rival, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, has devoted considerable attention in
hopes of wooing swing voters. Polls show he has been successful in
this attempt, which is uncharacteristic for a Republican. The Gore
campaign is countering Bush's initiatives with proposals that do
not just allocate federal money but also make demands of teachers
and school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes to require teachers to have majored in their
subject area in college or pass a competency test in it. And he
would reward outstanding teachers and help schools improve or
remove bad teachers quickly, within the academic year as opposed to
the three years that such a process can take now, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``While we absolutely must respect due process, we have to put
an end to endless delays in removing those few teachers who really
do need to be removed,'' Gore said. He also said principals should
be allowed to hire teachers for reasons other than seniority. ``No
teaching contract should be a lifetime job guarantee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Teacher testing and seniority hiring are highly controversial
matters among educators and have been strongly resisted by the
teachers' unions, which believe that standardized testing does not
measure the intangibles of good teachers. Others object to
standardized testing of both teachers and students as a step toward
giving up local control of education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the teachers' unions have heartily endorsed Gore's
presidential candidacy. Against that backdrop, his speech Friday
was intended to be seen as a daring, principled stand, the kind
that his political advisers have been eager for him to take to
demonstrate that, contrary to the popular impression as registered
in public opinion polls, Gore does not just blow with the political
winds and pander to every group he addresses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was what Gore aides called a ``Sister Souljah Moment,'' a
reference to Bill Clinton's tough speech during the 1992
presidential campaign when he took on the black singer face to face
for lyrics he said were offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech comes after the American Teachers Federation, the
nation's second-largest teachers' union, endorsed the idea last
week of toughening teacher standards.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory King, a spokesman for Sandra Feldman, the president of
the American Federation of Teachers, said Gore consulted with Ms.
Feldman on his proposals. He said that she was heartened that Mr.
Gore would cede some decisions on teacher hiring to ``principals
working with teams of teachers, and not just principals.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth Teasley, the director of government relations for
the nation's largest teachers' union, the National Education
Association, said her union was comfortable with Gore's suggestion
that seniority not be the only criterion in teacher hiring. She
emphasized that Gore was not dismissing seniority as a
qualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what he is putting forth is the notion that we
should consider credentials and expertise, and that seniority could
be a factor, it's just not the only factor,'' she said. ``We can
work with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been trying to demonstrate his commitment to education
in multiple ways, including by spending a full day at a school
somewhere in the country every week or so. He spent Friday at Holt
High School after spending the night with Margot Strong, a computer
teacher, her husband, Jay, who teaches first grade, and their two
children, Nick, 10, and Anna, 6. Gore arrived at their house after
midnight Wednesday night and stayed up late enough to watch four of
the five overtimes in the hockey playoffs on television.
</P>
<P>
   Holt was the first high school Gore has visited during this
campaign, and the older age of the students was evident in some of
their by-play with the vice president. In a morning physics class,
when Gore asked the students what the most interesting thing was
they had learned, Tonia Van Every, 18, called out: ``About Mr.
Pulver's personal life,'' a reference to the teacher, Eric Pulver.
``I'm one of the sarcastic kids,'' she told a reporter later.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the school newspaper, Gore was asked about
abortion. He said he believed it was up to a woman to decide what
to do, but he said he also believed in abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   And he revealed that his glory moment in high school was
shooting _ and sinking _ a long shot at the final buzzer, but only
after the basketball hit the backboard. Asked to list his favorite
sports, he said: ``Football, basketball, track, art.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his most difficult moment as vice president has been,
he answered without much hesitation: ``The day our soldiers in
Somalia were killed.''

 &HT;    Weary Pacers face ailing 76ers
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ From a visual standpoint, the
Indiana-Philadelphia second-round playoff series promises to be an
eyesore. But the competitive nature of the battle ought to make up
for any unsightly play.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, coming off a difficult and emotional five-game
series with Milwaukee, play host to the 76ers in Game 1 tonight at
Conseco Fieldhouse. And the No. 1-ranked team in the Eastern
Conference might have an edge in health but maybe not in energy.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana outlasted the Bucks and had just one day to shake the
effects before facing the 76ers, who are battered but determined.
It is a test that beaten Milwaukee coach George Karl said the
Pacers can pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're declining,'' Karl said. ``Have they
plateaued? Is Toronto catching them a little bit? Have we caught
them a little bit? Has Philly caught them a little bit? I would
view anybody that puts 55 wins up as having not declined.'' Indiana
actually won 56 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they walk out there, they're a team and they don't want
to lose, and I really respect that,'' Karl said. ``The character of
that team, to me, is as scary as their talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers' most talented player, all-star guard Allen Iverson,
continues to be hampered with injuries. ``I've never had this many
injuries in one year in my life,'' Iverson said. ``I guess I'm not
drinking enough milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson has a chip fracture in his right ankle that can be
stablized with heavy taping. He has a toe injury and problems with
his right rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, starting point guard Eric Snow, who missed the last
two games of the first round against Charlotte with a bad ankle,
said he is optimistic that he will be able to play tonight. The
76ers advanced to the second round on the strength of their tough
defense and valuable play from their bench. In particular, Aaron
McKie, a defensive specialist, was important on offense in the
decisive game.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' bench has been less productive, although former
Georgia Tech star Travis Best did hit the game-winning and
series-clinching shot against Milwaukee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been up and down,'' coach Larry Bird said about his
reserves. ``Just like our starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a new series now.''

MARATHON ON ICE AS TIRED TEAMS SKATE INTO THE WEE HOURS
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ In the two dressing rooms, during the many
intermissions, the players consumed what was to have been their
post-game pizza. They munched on nutritional energy bars, washing
it all down with water and other healthy beverages. They stretched
to ward off muscle cramps. They talked among themselves about who
would get the winning goal that would allow everyone to finally go
home.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, less than half full at the end but
standing-room-only many hours before, a few fans slept while
waiting for the third, fourth and fifth overtime periods of Game 4
of the second-round playoff series between the Pittsburgh Penguins
and the Philadelphia Flyers. Other fans visited refreshment stands
that were still open but out of everything but nachos and peanuts.
``Let's Go Pens!'' some chanted, rooting for the home-town
Penguins. ``Let's Go Home!'' one fan shouted in retort.
</P>
<P>
   This was early Friday morning in the Mellon Arena, site of the
third-longest game in the history of the NHL. It began at 7:39 p.m.
on Thursday night and ended at 2:35 a.m. the next morning on a goal
by Keith Primeau of Philadelphia. Primeau said he suffered leg
cramps before the start of the final period and that he lost track
of periods and the time of night. ``If I thought of what period it
was or what time it was it would throw me off,'' Primeau said.
</P>
<P>
   His goal, ending a game that lasted 152 minutes and 1 second on
the scoreboard clock, gave the Flyers a 2-1 victory that tied the
best-of-7 Eastern Conference semifinal at two games apiece. Game 5
will be on Sunday in Philadelphia. It begins around noon, so it
should be over before dark.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL said the 6-hour, 56-minute length in real time was the
longest game in its history. In that same time span, the fastest
runners could complete the Boston, New York and Olympic Marathons
and still have time for sprints; horses could run 210 Kentucky
Derbys.
</P>
<P>
   For four-plus overtime periods, in a sudden death situation in
which the next goal would clinch the game, players strived in vain
to muster a winning shot. Toward the end, with no strength or
speed, they looked like the middle-aged men who sometimes pool
their money to rent rinks in the middle of the night for what are
sometimes called beer leagues. Ron Tugnutt, the Pittsburgh goalie,
said ``everything seemed to be in slow-motion. This is the wildest
thing I've ever been through. The mind kind of shuts down on you. I
was just in a daze.''
</P>
<P>
   He had his reasons. In a normal three-period game, a goalie
might face 25 to 35 shots; Tugnutt faced 72, stopping 70 of them,
and his teammates blocked another 42. Seven of those were blocked
by Darius Kasparaitis, the Pittsburgh defenseman who at the end was
victimized by Primeau's smooth move that created shooting space in
the right-wing faceoff circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each overtime you go on it's getting ridiculous,'' Kasparaitis
said. ``Some guys are not even hitting anybody, just falling apart.
It was tough, but it was a good experience. Sometimes, it was
funny. John LeClair was falling all over the place. Both benches
were laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaromir Jagr, the Pittsburgh captain who was last season's Most
Valuable Player and is this season's scoring champion, said when a
game goes this long, ``You don't even play hockey. It's just
skating. I was so tired I didn't feel anything.'' Jagr led his team
in minutes played with 59:08, twice what he might play in a
regulation game.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair, Philadelphia's star left wing, caused the overtime by
scoring the tying goal early in the third period. Nobody was
certain, but video review suggested the puck might have entered the
net after bouncing off a Pittsburgh stick and then LeClair's
helmet. ``Something dinged my head,'' LeClair said. ``I didn't
touch it with my stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Alexei Kovalev had scored on the first Pittsburgh
shot of the game, before sunset, at 2:22 of the first period, then
the Penguins didn't score again the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not even thinking about what you're doing,'' Kovalev
said of the overtime. ``Your body is playing for you. When you go
that long, it's all about luck. You start making moves on
defensemen and you can see they're not even reacting. What else can
you do?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Kasparaitis reacted to Primeau's move and Primeau wristed a
rising shot over the glove of Tugnutt to end the longest game since
March 24, 1936. That was when Mud Bruneteau of the Detroit Red
Wings scored after 176:30 to beat the Montreal Maroons by 1-0. In
second place is Toronto's 1-0 victory over Boston on April 3, 1933.
That one lasted 164:46.
</P>
<P>
   After his teammates mobbed him and left the ice, Primeau
stripped off his uniform and stood in the corner of the locker room
wearing a weary smile and gray underclothing, soaked in
perspiration. In his hand he held a half-filled bottle of water.
``I definitely feel dehydrated,'' Primeau said. ``It was a lot of
fun to play in that game. I was surprised that it was only the
third-longest game. It felt like an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no timeouts for television commercials after
regulation time, the pace of the game seemed brisk even as the
skating of the players slowed down. One whole overtime, the second,
was free of icing, a play in which a defending team relieves
pressure by clearing the puck down to the other end, resulting in a
faceoff back up ice in its own zone. It seemed as if neither team
had the will or energy to skate that far to retrieve the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Although he put nine shots on goal and created several scoring
chances with passes in overtime, Jagr said he could put no power
into his shots. ``I know it's tough for the goalies to stand
there,'' Jagr said, ``but it's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The goalie he tried to beat, Boucher of the Flyers, said players
were joking that if they won they would get Friday off from
practice. He said his body was cramping and that his skates held so
much perspiration that he could ``feel it squashing around in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Primeau beat Tugnutt at the other end, Boucher said he
heard the ``ping'' of the puck hitting the metal part in the back
of the net but could barely see the little, red light bulb behind
the cage that signaled the goal. Then came the sound of near
silence. ``You could hear that the crowd was so disgusted,'' he
said. And the crowd could hear the shouts of happy Flyers gathering
around Primeau, and their tired hands pounding him on his broad
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going down in hockey history,'' Primeau said.

CLUES POINT TO PHILIPPINE STUDENT AS VIRUS AUTHOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and computer security investigators
focused on the Philippines Friday in their search for the author of
a software program that convulsed the world's computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in both Asia and the United States said clues
appeared to point to a college student in his early 20s using a
Philippine Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The rogue program, borne as an attachment to an e-mail with the
subject line ``I Love You,'' surfaced in Asia on Wednesday. It
moved from there to Europe and the United States on Thursday,
clogging or disabling corporate e-mail systems and destroying data
on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the spread of the infection appeared to slow Friday, at
least eight variations of the original program had been identified
by antivirus firms.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is launched, the ``I Love You'' program, among other
things, tries to fetch an additional program from a Philippine Web
site enabling it to steal passwords from the victim's computer.
American security experts said they had found evidence that a
person using the ``spyder'' alias found in the ``I Love You''
program had written two versions of a password-stealing program
found in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our theory is that he had written this program twice and was
looking for a way to get broader distribution for it,'' said Peter
S. Tippett of ICSA.net, a computer security firm based in Reston,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Fredrik Bjorck, a Swedish computer security
researcher who last year helped identify the author of a similar
program called Melissa, told Swedish television that he had
identified the perpetrator of the latest attack as a German
exchange student named Mikael.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Mikael was in his 20s and that he had used Internet
service providers in the Philippines to spread his programs. Bjorck
said Mikael had published information on how to get rid of the ``I
Love You'' program. He did not identify Mikael's location.
</P>
<P>
   The ICSA.net researchers said they had disassembled one of the
four components of the ``I Love You'' program and had discovered
that its instructions closely matched two similar programs that
they had captured last fall and in January.
</P>
<P>
   Once a computer was infected, the program was set up to fetch
the password-stealing component from a Philippine Web site. After
it was installed in the computer it was programmed to relay the
stolen passwords to an e-mail account also in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   But after the ``I Love You'' outbreak was detected on Wednesday,
the company running the Philippine Web site, Sky Internet, quickly
removed the password program from its system.
</P>
<P>
   Computer investigators said that both the ``I Love You'' program
and the password-stealing modules discovered earlier had references
to Amable Mendoza Aguiluz Computer College, which they said had
seven campuses in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been subpoenas issued for an American computer
server and elsewhere in an effort to get log files and compare
times,'' Tippett said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Sky Internet told reporters Friday that authorities
had informed them that a warrant would be served in the
investigation to find the creator of the program. The executives
said they believed the author of the program _ it has attributes of
both a virus and what is known as a computer worm _ had tried to
break in to the Internet service provider's computers and that they
had blocked access from his phone number on April 1. But the
attacker apparently then entered their system through another
service provider. The company said it was cooperating with the
Philippine National Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman in Washington said last night that he was not
aware of any suspects in the case.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators pursued leads, antivirus companies said that
the infection was coming under control.
</P>
<P>
   `Things are quieter today than yesterday,'' Carey Nachenberg,
chief researcher for the Symantec Anti-Virus Research Center, said
Friday. He said that on Thursday the company's Web traffic had more
than doubled as users sought updated antivirus software.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the copycat programs that surfaced Friday came
masquerading as a Mother's Day transaction. The message reads in
part:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proceeded to charge your credit card for the amount of
$326.92 for the Mother's Day diamond special. We have attached a
detailed invoice to this e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on the attachment will launch the malicious program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears that the rogue program might cause huge losses of
data such as MP3 audio files that are popularly traded by college
students and others, digital music companies said there was no
evidence the infection had targeted music files.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of Napster, a service that makes software used
to share MP3 files over the Internet, said the company had heard of
no problems with the service related to the program, has not
received complaints or heard of widespread loss of files.

COMMENTARY: GHOSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENT, Ohio _ The National Guardsmen were walking up a hill when
they suddenly wheeled around and fired into a group of unarmed
students. That was how four students died at Kent State University
on May 4, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   To see the site is to know that the guardsmen were not under
threat. The closest student killed, Jeffrey Miller, was 85 to 90
yards away, Allison Krause 100 yards, William Schroeder and Sandra
Scheuer 130 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did it happen? The Guard was ill trained and ill led,
mainly working-class young men resentful of the seemingly
privileged students. Nothing can excuse the undisciplined shooting.
But the deeper reasons lay in our national leadership: its
obsessive pursuit of the Vietnam War, its paranoia, its mendacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an invasion of Cambodia,'' President Nixon had
told the nation on April 30 as he disclosed that U.S. troops were
invading Cambodia. A president who had campaigned on a promise to
end the war was widening it. If he did not, he said, America would
be ``a pitiful, helpless giant.''
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence, we were told, had located a major North
Vietnamese headquarters in Cambodia, and U.S. forces were going to
seize it. What they found was a bunch of huts.
</P>
<P>
   Americans who were not alive in 1970 must find it hard to
understand why students at Kent State and other universities
protested so emotionally over Vietnam. There were various reasons.
But the underlying one was the government's persistence in a war
whose futility was so overwhelmingly evident by then.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon administration had begun to reduce the American force
in Vietnam that at its peak had exceeded 550,000. That was a
creditable policy. But the administration confounded it by
pretending that somehow South Vietnam could prevail without us.
</P>
<P>
   The country was divided. Nixon did not want to alienate those
who believed in the war. But, fatally, he did not educate the
country to understand the war's futility. To the contrary, he
implied that victory was essential to our credibility _ to our not
being seen as a pitiful, helpless giant.
</P>
<P>
   In the years of the first Nixon administration, 1969 through
1972, the United States dropped 4 million tons of bombs on
Indochina, and lost 20,492 American lives. Many times that number
of Vietnamese were killed. To what end?
</P>
<P>
   There was another, profound cost to the United States: the
further polarization of our society, the shattering of common faith
in government. Those wounds have not yet healed.
</P>
<P>
   The attitudes that did such damage persist, too. They can be
seen in the leading survivor among the policy makers of 1970, Henry
Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Newsweek on the legacy of Vietnam, Kissinger painted
the critics of the war policy then as radical extremists who
``challenged the very essence of American foreign involvement.''
Their legacy, he suggested, is in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusions that many in the Clinton administration _ and
in the liberal community _ have drawn from the Vietnam War,'' he
wrote, ``present a profound challenge to traditional American
foreign policy. They treat the Cold War as a misunderstanding, if
not an American creation.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, liberals and the Clinton administration are soft
on Communism. Try saying that to Madeleine Albright, Dr. Kissinger.
Of course the overwhelming majority of liberal Americans supported
the West's staunch and successful resistance to Soviet communism,
and look back at the policy with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger always thought that criticism of U.S. foreign policy
was somehow unpatriotic. The irony is that, out of office, he has
become the most nagging of critics. Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor: He
has opposed one after another intervention to save human lives.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism is valuable because it helps to correct public
policies. That is a great advantage of open societies. But the
system works only if those in charge are wise enough to recognize
when a policy, however well intentioned, has gone wrong. The
Vietnam War and its leaders are a monument to the failure of that
necessary wisdom.

JUDGE APPROVES PROSECUTION OF TRIPP, BUT RESTRICTS LEWINSKY
TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for additional details, clarification and rewriting
throughout; story grows by 550 words)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Maryland judge ruled Friday that the state could
proceed with its prosecution of Linda Tripp on charges that she
broke the law when she secretly tape-recorded conversations with
Monica Lewinsky about Lewinsky's relationship with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Diane O. Leasure of Howard County Circuit Court,
also dealt a severe blow to the case by suppressing the testimony
of Lewinsky and another witness that may be crucial in obtaining a
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure ruled that the testimony of Lewinsky on one critical
point was not credible. The judge dismissed as implausible
Lewinsky's statements to the court in December about why she was
certain that a specific conversation secretly tape-recorded by
Tripp had occurred on Dec. 22, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The date of the conversation is pivotal because the Maryland law
under which Tripp is charged specifies that a person is guilty only
if it can be shown that she knew at the time of the taping that it
was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tripp recorded more than 20 hours of her telephone
conversations with Lewinsky, the one that occurred Dec. 22 was the
only one that took place after prosecutors believe Tripp was
definitively informed by her lawyer that it was illegal to tape
phone conversations in Maryland without the consent of the other
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Ms. Lewinsky has admitted that she lied under
oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a
part of her life does not enhance her credibility as a witness,''
Judge Leasure wrote in her 41-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Leasure ruled that prosecutors could not use the
testimony of another witness, Mary Catherine Friedrich, the only
other person who might have been able to identify the time period
in which Tripp secretly tape-recorded her conversations with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The chief state prosecutor in the case, Stephen F. Montanarelli,
acknowledged in an interview that while the ruling allowed him to
go forward, ``We now have a very serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli said he would review the ruling and make a decision
whether to pursue the prosecution without the testimony that
Leasure barred in her ruling Friday. He said he would decide before
the scheduled trial date of July 10.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tripp said Friday that she believed a decision by Montanarelli
to go forward after Friday's ruling would be especially vindictive
and malicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to indict me was politically motivated and
wrong,'' she said in a statement. ``This case is being prosecuted
solely because I blew the whistle on President Clinton's attempt to
fix a court case.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to Paula Jones' sexual misconduct lawsuit in
which Clinton and Lewinsky both denied having had a sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The issue decided Friday involved whether the Maryland
prosecutors could demonstrate that their evidence against Tripp was
developed independently of and did not rely on the work of Kenneth
W. Starr, the federal prosecutor who investigated Clinton on
Whitewater and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   That is because when Tripp became an informer for Starr, telling
him of the president's relationship with Lewinsky, she was given a
grant of immunity. Although Leasure sharply limited the scope of
the immunity agreement earlier, prosecutors still had to
demonstrate that their witnesses and evidence were not derived from
or tainted by knowledge of Starr's findings.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dec. 22 conversation, Tripp and Lewinsky discussed the
subpoenas they had just received in the Jones lawsuit. Lewinsky
talked about whether she could lie for Clinton, and they discussed
gifts he has given her.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified that she did not rely on her association with
Starr's investigators to identify the tape recording as having
occurred on Dec. 22, 1997, as the investigators had concluded. She
said she recognized the conversation as having occurred a few days
before Christmas of that year because it coincided with other
memorable events.
</P>
<P>
   But Leasure said there was no question that Lewinsky had been
exposed greatly to Starr's investigation, even seeing testimony as
to the date of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense argues that Ms. Lewinsky is `bathed in
impermissible taint,''' Leasure wrote. ``The court agrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Murtha, Tripp's lawyer, said that while he had hoped
Judge Leasure would have dismissed the case, he believed her ruling
``significantly hobbled the state's ability to prosecute.''
</P>
<P>
   Leasure ruled that prosecutors could not use Friedrich's
testimony because they only learned of her through the Starr
investigation. Friedrich said Tripp played some of the tapes for
her and she knew that one occurred around Christmastime because it
had Tripp yelling at her daughter for knocking down the Christmas
tree.
</P>
<P>
   If Montanarelli decides to go forward, Leasure ruled, Lewinsky's
testimony will be limited to her assertions that she never gave
consent to have her conversations with Tripp recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling appears to leave the prosecutors with only the
testimony of some of Tripp's partners in a weekly bridge game and a
neighbor, all of whom seemed aware that she was secretly taping
conversations with a woman named ``Monica'' who was having an
intimate relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The women testified that Tripp sometimes boasted of secretly
taping the other woman and even invited Lewinsky to a Christmas
party at her Columbia, Md., home so the others could gaze upon the
woman she had told them about.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure ruled Friday that the testimony of those women could be
used by the prosecution. But none of them seemed able to recollect
exactly when they learned of the taping and none are able to
identify the date of the crucial Dec. 22, 1997, conversation.

 &HT;    No computer vaccine in sight
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Experts warned Friday that only dramatic improvements
in defenses will keep computers safe from costly, annoying
assaults, even as the worst of this week's computer attack was
fading.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: Learn to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, yet another clever mischief-maker will pump a
new virus or worm into the Internet, infecting millions of users
just like the computer ``worm'' that Thursday slithered into
millions of machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say there will be another one in six months,'' said Chris
Rouland, director of the X-Force, research arm of Internet Security
Systems in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Love Letter, I Love You or the Love Bug, the computer
worm that popped up Thursday was generally regarded as the worst
cyber-assault ever, choking e-mail systems, rewriting software,
erasing photos and music and stealing passwords.
</P>
<P>
   The attack caused no bloodshed, toppled no governments and
darkened no cities, but it almost certainly cost hundreds of
millions of dollars in lost opportunities and wasted resources.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, weaker copycat versions were circulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just a speed bump,'' said Roger Thompson, director of
malicious code research at Virginia-based ICSA.net. ``There will be
other speed bumps. It's a cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-attacks are so frequent that most go unreported in the
national media. Among those doing enough damage to receive public
notice was last year's Melissa virus, which temporarily clogged
e-mail systems. Then, a few months ago, someone harnessed thousands
of computers across the Internet and programmed them to pour data
at major Web sites _ freezing them.
</P>
<P>
   Love Letter was an escalation _ Melissa on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the attack was a worm, a self-replicating bit of
software that also tried to rewrite some files and purloin
passwords. Using the come-on of romance in the subject line, Love
Letter invited recipients to open an attachment. If they did, it
grabbed e-mail addresses stored on Microsoft Outlook, cloned itself
and sent copies to each address.
</P>
<P>
   Spared were computers using Linux or Apple Computer systems _
and not necessarily out of respect.
</P>
<P>
   As any Justice Department attorney will tell you, most of the
world's computers run Microsoft Windows. So that's the best way for
hackers to get maximum damage _ or publicity. Most bugs target
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   As Love Letter swept across the Net, fixes were rushed onto
various anti-virus Web sites, some so jammed with traffic that they
could not be reached. Users were told to distrust all e-mails with
attachments, even those they thought came from friends.
</P>
<P>
   In a kind of arms race, Internet security companies have dueled
for years with the mostly faceless hackers and ``script kitties,''
who copy viruses and ship them out into the Net. One side produces
a bug, the other responds quickly with a fix _ because much
anti-virus software cannot stop a brand new bug. The result is that
the Internet remains less reliable than the phone or power system
even as the world relies on it more.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the Net's technology gets stronger, so do the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As new functions are added, more gaps for mischief are created,
said Thompson. ``The better the functionality, the worse the
security. We have a world that demands power. That gives the bad
guys one more thing they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ocean of computer viruses is constantly swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred are cascading around the Net and are potentially
dangerous _ right now. Plus there are about 50,000 known computer
viruses drifting through cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Why do they persist? For one thing, the pool of people who enjoy
fiddling with them is continually restocked with the young and
restless, many of whom have the time it takes to concoct an attack.
They tend to be male, young and isolated. Unlike hackers
intercepting messages or manipulating data, they're not doing it
for money, but for fun or the pursuit of notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Internet bugs _ like cockroaches in the real world _ are awfully
tenacious. Like the chain letters and uncountable bad jokes
circulating the Net, viruses seem to survive even determined
efforts to squash them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is a big place,'' Thompson said. ``There's always a
copy on a floppy disk in somebody's briefcase somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a physical virus, a computer bug must be passed somehow
from one individual to the next. Before the Internet's surge, that
happened only with floppy disks being moved from one machine to
another _ and it could take years to cross the world.
</P>
<P>
   Love Letter moved in hours across five continents _ thanks to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In general, a bug that doesn't get off to a quick start never
becomes a global threat. And even with the Net, not every bug
bursts into prominence. Experts this week said the fast-moving worm
was lucky: In its early hours, Love Letter may have snagged a huge
network _ perhaps a multinational bank or the U.S. military. It was
the cyber-equivalent of a flu-sufferer walking through rush hour at
Grand Central Station shaking hands and sneezing.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking a computer bug may be easier than finding the original
sneeze. On the Net, there are footprints and fingerprints,
remaining for months or even years, something that pranksters often
forget.
</P>
<P>
   While the Net may seem anonymous, it's not _ at least not to
determined hackers, researchers with resources or law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Netizens bent on mischief in many ways mimic the deceptions of
criminals in the physical world. They pose behind many different
identities. They cover their tracks, use false addresses and steal
the addresses of the law-abiding.
</P>
<P>
   And most get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Of 419 cases of alleged computer fraud referred to federal
prosecutors in 1998, just 83 were prosecuted, according to the
Electronic Privacy Information Center. Most cases were dismissed
for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Of those the 83 cases that went to trial in 1998, 47 people were
convicted of federal computer crimes, 20 went to prison and 10 were
found innocent of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Security companies and law enforcement often reserve their
resources for big cases, and they are definitely not helpless.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ICSA.net has a team of faux-hackers who don
cyber-disguises and infiltrate the world's hacker communities.
Information is shared with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is confident that the Love Letter perpetrator will be
caught. A look at Love Letter's path and source code and the Web
sites used as part of the program quickly led investigators to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   How long can the game go on?
</P>
<P>
   Until computers have ``immune systems'' like animals do, they
will be vulnerable, said Steve White, manager of anti-virus
research at IBM's Watson Research Center. ``It just takes too long
for companies to come up with the fix and the virus moves too
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Symantec Corp. have written software aimed at
recognizing anything virus-like, putting it into ``quarantine'' and
transmitting a copy via the Net to a central computer for analysis.
If the suspect is dangerous, it can be wiped out _ perhaps without
the user even knowing there was a problem, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Even immune-like systems will not put an end to cyber-crime or
cyber-sickness, but they can mount defenses strong enough to keep
attacks from endangering the Net, White said. ``We still need
doctors and we still need medicine. But without our immune system,
we would never have survived as a race.''

<P>
   Even immune-like systems will not put an end to cyber-crime or
cyber-sickness, but they can mount defenses strong enough to keep
attacks from endangering the Net, White said. ``We still need
doctors and we still need medicine. But without our immune system,
we would never have survived as a race.''

COMMENTARY: HOW FLEETING IS INFAMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There haven't been raves like this since ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best events that I've ever seen!'' _ Regis Philbin
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any better!'' _ Sam Donaldson
</P>
<P>
   ``Give that guy another term!'' _ Entertainment Weekly
</P>
<P>
   The show that earned these cheers was Bill Clinton's stand-up
comedy routine at the White House correspondents' dinner last
Saturday. If it had been rerun any more often, it might have turned
C-Span into E! The president easily bested Jay Leno, the other act
on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   As if to ratify Clinton's triumph, The Washington Post ran a
front-page headline on Monday: ```Clinton Fatigue' Yields to
Nostalgia.'' The Post cited polls showing that not only would
Democrats vastly prefer Clinton to Al Gore as a candidate this year
but that in a recent match-up the president pulled even with George
W. Bush nationwide. Granted, this country has a short memory, but
isn't Bill Clinton the same guy who was impeached and tried only 15
months ago? It's almost an insult to call him the comeback kid.
He's had more comebacks than Elizabeth Taylor, Liza Minnelli and
Richard Nixon combined.
</P>
<P>
   Or were they really comebacks? Writing in The New Republic two
months ago, Sean Wilentz declared ``Clinton fatigue'' to be ``an
utter hoax'' and ``the latest sign of the growing gap between what
the public actually thinks and what the pundits claim the public
thinks.'' He pointed out that the president's job-approval ratings
_ the numbers most predictive of election results _ have been
higher than those at equivalent dates in Ronald Reagan's lame-duck
term, even during (or especially during) impeachment. The American
historian Alan Brinkley notes that ``if you take away the first two
years'' of the first Clinton term, ``he'd have the highest ratings
in the postwar era'' of any president. ``It really is remarkable,''
Brinkley adds. ``For someone who has a hostile Republican Congress
to deal with, he seems to exercise more power over Congress than
most presidents have had over Congresses of their own party.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was this more evident than in the Elian Gonzalez
denouement. Immediately after Janet Reno's Miami raid, the
now-familiar political arsenal of the anti-Clintonistas was rolled
into place. Tom DeLay denounced federal agents as ``jackbooted
thugs'' _ bizarrely reviving the NRA's incendiary pre-Oklahoma City
rhetoric for the fifth anniversary of the bombing. The Wall Street
Journal editorial page floated conspiracy theories in line with its
tortuous efforts to link Clinton to drug-running at an obscure
Arkansas airport; this time it speculated that the president might
have been blackmailed by Fidel Castro and that Elian might have
been drugged ``while in U.S. government custody.'' Enter the
auxiliary troops, Matt Drudge and Lucianne Goldberg, whose Web
sites offered painstaking exegeses of how the government doctored
the photos of Elian and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet there'll be congressional hearings,'' stormed DeLay on
``Meet the Press,'' echoing cries by Trent Lott and Orrin Hatch.
And they'd be run by Henry Hyde, no less! The only missing element
from this picture of Clinton hatred in full cry was the corpse of
Vincent Foster.
</P>
<P>
   But where, pray tell, are those hearings? Apparently Clinton
nostalgia trumps whatever remains of his opponents' testosterone.
Reflecting the president's clout, polls showed that 60 percent
approved of the raid and 68 percent didn't want any hearings _
numbers consistent with those balking at impeachment hearings and
the congressional release of the Starr report two years ago. No
sooner did the Elian inquisition flame out than Jim Kolbe, an
Arizona congressman, also decided not ``to pursue any more
hearings'' on Hillary Clinton's government-paid transportation for
her Senate campaign. Such is Clinton's political potency that James
Rogan, a House impeachment prosecutor now battling for re-election
in California, popped up with the impeached president in a White
House rally for gun control. Surely it's only days before William
Bennett concedes to Larry King that, all in all, the Clintons'
marriage is more credible than that of the other aspiring
senatorial couple, the Giulianis, who can't even fake a truce for
the sake of their kids after a cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   My first sighting of conspicuous Republican nostalgia for
Clinton was in March, when Ben Stein, the former Nixon speechwriter
and host of TV's ``Win Ben Stein's Money,'' praised the president
in USA Today for showing ``a lot of heart'' by sending top
administration officials to the funeral of his father, the GOP
economist Herbert Stein. Ben Stein dislikes Clinton, writes for the
Clinton-bashing journal American Spectator and is solidly behind
Bush. And yet he had this to say over the phone this week: ``I will
miss Clinton's humanity like I miss Nixon's humanity. You know a
person is a person by his failings, and Clinton has a lot of
failings. Without that human touch, you lose an important ability
to connect with the body politic. Two machines are running to
replace him _ the Gore machine, in which everything is calculated
and calibrated, and the Bush machine, which is even more so. I
don't like the idea of being governed by a machine. I like being
governed by someone who has as many failings as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Hammond, the Clinton impersonator on ``Saturday Night
Live,'' has a not dissimilar take on Clinton nostalgia: ``I never
met anyone who touches people as much as he does ... Here was a man
caught lying on camera by an entire planet and got away with it and
talked his way out of it. He's a scalawag, but darn, he does a good
job! Crime's down, jobs are up, the budget's balanced. Who wouldn't
miss him? When he gets that little crinkle in his voice, he's
selling it to you and you're going to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Hammond is ready to go with his impersonation of Al Gore but is
mindful of the vast difference between the two men. ``Clinton only
shows you what he wants you to see,'' he says. ``Gore shows you
what he wants to show you and everything else. You see the puppet
and the puppetmaster. You see the ventriloquist's mouth move. The
poor guy is trying too hard. So much preparation, so earnest, so
much fumbling and stumbling. He should go out and say I can't act,
I can't dance _ or nothing _ but I really want to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   This shortfall makes it unlikely that Clinton nostalgia will
automatically benefit Gore come fall. If anything, the closest heir
to Clinton so far is Bush. The president indicated as much in his
stand-up routine, when he joked that the Texas governor had
hijacked his old Dick Morris campaign strategy of ``moving toward
the political center, distancing himself from his own party (and)
stealing ideas from the other party.'' The parallels don't end
there, or with the unsubstantiated drug rumors that have stalked
both men without ever denting their political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   In the '92 campaign, Clinton said that ``the most important
thing'' he had accomplished as governor of Arkansas was improving
education _ a claim no more borne out by Arkansas' dismal rankings
in students' test scores than are Bush's hyperbolic claims for
Texas. Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' _ in which the federal
government plays bite-sized roles in helping to feel and soothe
Americans' pain _ lifts specific ideas from Clinton's New Democrat
policies. Both men also have in common the repellent trait of
advertising their toughness on crime by savage brandishing of the
death penalty as governors: Clinton refused clemency to the
brain-damaged Rickey Ray Rector; Bush denied clemency to Karla Faye
Tucker and then mocked her in a Talk magazine interview with Tucker
Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that Bush is remotely in the Clinton league as
entertainer in chief; no one is. Reading up for his game show on
presidents who ``were grossly overweight, got drunk and went to
all-night parties,'' Ben Stein ruefully observed, ``Clinton will be
the last of the rollicking over-the-top characters for the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   If we hadn't gotten off the phone soon after, I fear we both
would have been in tears.

GORE AND BUSH CLASH FURTHER ON FIREARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The lines that divide the presidential candidates on
the issue of gun control came into sharper focus Friday, as Vice
President Al Gore vowed to veto any measure prohibiting cities from
suing gun manufacturers, and Gov. George W. Bush suggested that he
might support such a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gun manufacturers have been lobbying federal lawmakers for such
legislation; Gore, in an interview Friday, pledged to block that
effort and questioned whether Bush would do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge Governor Bush to make the same pledge,'' Gore said
in an interview with Political Points, the Web-cast of The New York
Times and ABC News. ``Will he veto any bill that lets gun
manufacturers off the hook? Will he fight for the gun industry or
for America's families?''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush was asked about that at a subsequent news conference
here, he said, ``It depends on what's in the legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the Texas governor added, ``You can get a feel for my
position by looking at what I've done in office, and what I did in
office was sign a bill that made it very difficult for local
municipalities to sue manufacturers of a legal product.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was referring to a 1999 law that required lawsuits on
behalf of Texas cities or counties against gun makers to be filed
by the state attorney general, who might or might not support that
course of action. The measure was similar to ones supported by
other Republican governors and reflected their general push to curb
civil litigation in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent statements of Gore and Bush continued an often
tense back-and-forth over gun control that has lasted several days
and signaled the potential potency of the issue in the 2000
elections. Each candidate has been trying to cast doubt on his
opponent's commitment to gun control, and each has been trying to
tar the other by linking him to the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Bush said that Gore had a voting history
in Congress of support for the NRA's positions and had a good deal
of explaining to do.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's aides circulated a brief document titled ``Al Gore &AMP;
Guns,'' which cited examples from the 1980s of Gore's agreements
with the gun lobby, the governor used a news conference here Friday
to cast the vice president as a candidate whose current advocacy of
more stringent restrictions on firearms was simply the latest
fashion, not a matter of steadfast principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was convenient politically, he voted one way,'' Bush
said, ``and when it's convenient politically, he's changed his
tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also refused to back off his suggestion on Thursday that
Gore was once a member of the NRA and, when challenged Friday to
say how he knew that, offered no proof.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he reminded reporters that he ended his statement about
Gore and the NRA with the phrase ``if I'm not mistaken'' and told
them it was their job to verify the assertion and Gore's
responsibility to show that he was not a member of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about where he had gotten the idea in the first place,
the governor responded, ``A little birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   William Powers, a spokesman for the gun organization, said he
had found no evidence that Gore had been a member. But he said that
when Gore was a congressman from Tennessee, ``he certainly received
very high ratings from the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said that
it could not find any record of Gore's ever being a member of the
NRA and that the vice president ``doesn't have any recollection of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's an irrelevant issue, anyway,'' Hattaway added. ``Al
Gore is standing up to the NRA's leadership and its increasingly
extreme agenda, while Bush is doing their bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges between the Bush and Gore campaigns were touched
off in part by a gun-control group's distribution this week of a
television commercial featuring footage of an NRA official saying
that if Bush became president, the organization would be working
out of the White House. Bush said that was not true.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts on Friday to turn the tables on Gore seemed to
reflect not only the ascendancy of gun control as a political issue
but also Bush's desire to court swing voters, many of whom favor
greater regulation of firearms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Bush took his swipes at Gore during his third day of
campaigning in California, a state full of such voters. In fact,
Bush's campaign schedule here this week represented an especially
aggressive attempt to portray himself as a progressive, open-minded
Republican by emphasizing his sensitivity to religious and ethnic
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of Cinco de Mayo, a Mexican-American holiday,
Bush delivered a long address here Friday morning on the shared
values of Latinos and other Americans. In it Bush used more Spanish
phrases and sentences than he had previously used on the campaign
trail this year.
</P>
<P>
   And he made a plea for greater acceptance of new immigrants,
recalling his introduction, during a walk through Santa Ana on
Thursday, to a grocery-store owner who had come to California from
Mexico with very little except a ``sueno,'' or dream.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks, delivered to hundreds of people at a ``breakfast
fiesta'' sponsored by a private group called the U.S.-Mexico
Foundation, followed a series of events, encounters and photo
opportunities _ many of them filmed by the candidate's advertising
team _ that put Bush together with Latino and Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The first group is crucial to Bush's hopes of winning
California. The second is key to his success nationwide, and Bush
has been working especially hard to appeal to Catholics since his
controversial appearance in February at Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, a school with a history of anti-Catholic bias.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also said Friday that Bush would postpone a
speech about Social Security, scheduled for Monday, so that he
could attend the funeral Mass for Cardinal John O'Connor in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bush campaign document about Gore's record on
gun control in Congress, Gore supported a measure to remove a ban
on interstate sales of rifles, shotguns and handguns; opposed a
14-day waiting period for handgun purchases; and cast votes between
1985 and 1990, as a senator from Tennessee, that were in line with
the wishes of the NRA three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway did not dispute that, saying that Gore's positions had
evolved with the growing prevalence of gun-related violence in the
country. He also said that the NRA is more extreme now than it was
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway noted that Gore now advocates a much wider array of
restrictions on firearms than Bush, who signed legislation in Texas
that permitted people to carry concealed handguns and seemed in
other ways to agree with the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, Bush chastised an official with the
organization for making inflammatory statements about President
Clinton. He also signaled a slightly greater receptiveness to some
gun-control proposals. And he has tried to link Gore to the NRA.

NEW VERSIONS OF COMPUTER VIRUS WREAK HAVOC &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER MONTGOMERY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   (Undated) New strains of the Love Letter e-mail virus attacked
computers around the world Friday, some disguised as jokes or
Mother's Day gift orders.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's uproar over the most far-reaching and destructive
virus yet inspired copycat vandals to spend the night playing with
the destructive code in their own e-mail files or at hacker sites
on the Internet. The code is simple to copy, change slightly, mask
with a new subject line and deliver worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, 45 million people have probably received original
or copycat versions of the virus, according to Computer Economics,
a research firm in Carlsbad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a genius to replicate this kind of virus,''
says Samir Bhavnani, a research analyst with Computer Economics.
``You or I could spend a day researching it and replicate it
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up with each variation isn't as simple, however.
Software security firms are scrambling to develop antidotes for at
least eight versions of the ``VBS.LoveLetter.A'' virus, which was
distributed in e-mail attachments with the subject line
``ILOVEYOU.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the new versions enticed e-mail recipients to open
attachments by suggesting that they confirm a Mother's Day order
for diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Another variation appeared to be a forwarded joke with the
subject line ``very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Others purported to contain programs to kill the Love Letter
virus, and one contained a message in Lithuanian.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most of the variations involve only cosmetic
changes, such as the subject line, there are small changes in the
coding that require antivirus software makers to keep coming up
with new fixes, says Laura Garcia Manrique of the Symantec
Antivirus Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on commerce could be severe. Computer Economics
estimates that $2.6 billion in damage has been done, and the bill
could reach $10 billion by the middle of next week. That would make
it even more destructive than the infamous Melissa virus that
spread in a similar fashion early last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melissa was verging on economic terrorism,'' says Bhavnani.
``This is beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the original virus, the copycat versions begin wreaking
havoc when an e-mail recipient using Microsoft's Windows operating
system opens an attachment to his e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   They overwrite system, image and music files and download a
program from the Internet that allows them to steal passwords. Then
they replicate themselves by e-mailing copies to everyone in the
computer's Microsoft Outlook address book.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing flood of e-mail messages has clogged up computer
networks and forced many businesses to shut down their e-mail
operations while making repairs and installing security measures.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, thought to have originated in the Philippines, first
appeared Thursday morning in Asia, then spread rapidly across
Europe and into the United States. It has infected corporations
from Ford to Kmart and government agencies from the Chicago Public
School System to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Even though antivirus software makers continued to post new
fixes at their Web sites Friday, some companies are going so far as
to temporarily block all e-mail attachments, says Sharon Ruckman at
Symantech, which makes the Norton Antivirus. It was a strategy that
some companies adopted the first week of 2000 because of fears
about Y2K vandalism, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts expect trickier variations of the virus to
appear as vandals find time to play with it over the weekend.
Ruckman expects the viruses to mutate for about a week before
enough computer users get the security in place to lock them out.
</P>
<P>
   Most makers of popular antivirus software will post fixes at
their Web sites daily until the threat has abated.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, e-mail recipients should delete _ without opening the
attachment _ any messages from unknown senders as well as e-mail
from known senders if the subject line is suspicious, like a love
note or a Mother's Day message from a co-worker. PC users also
should empty their computers' recycle bins.

   MONTREAL _ St. Catherine's Street, this city's fabled
entertainment and shopping artery, once boasted the highest rents
in Canada. But 25 years ago, after separatist governments mandated
French supremacy in commercial signs, English-speakers sourly noted
that the most common sign on the street was ``A louer'' _ ``For
Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Rue Ste. Catherine has a new face. Vacant storefronts
have been filled with high-fashion boutiques, restaurants and
``exotic dancing'' clubs that are attracting crowds that spill off
sidewalks into the street. At one end, the old hockey rink is being
transformed into a multimedia entertainment center with 5,000 movie
theater seats. At another end, the old Loews Theater is to reopen
next year as entertainment salad of circus stages, restaurants and
night clubs, the second ``Club Med World'' after Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is coming back after years of fray and decay. Once the
eastern shipping hub of the country, Montreal has reinvented itself
as a center for biotech, telecommunications and information
technology companies. Rents are rising along with construction
cranes, tourists are packing hotels, and this city of 3.3 million
people has become the third most popular site in North American for
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Toronto is still No. 1, the pendulum is swinging back to
Montreal,'' Gillian Cosgrove, a business writer, lamented recently
in The National Post, a newspaper edited in a city stuck with such
labels as ``Toronto the Good'' and ``Toronto the Clean.'' The
rivalry between Montreal, the fun center, and Toronto, the
financial center, compares with the rivalries between Rome and
Milan, or between Rio and Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time anyone can remember, Montreal's unemployment
rate has dipped below Toronto's, hitting 6.5 percent in January,
the lowest level in a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Quebec province registered 4 percent economic growth last year,
higher than the rest of Canada for the first time in more than a
decade. While poverty still blights many communities, Quebec's
welfare rolls have dropped by about a quarter in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Where once construction cranes were an endangered species, more
than a billion dollars worth of construction is under way. The
convention center is being doubled, and the downtown airport is
expanding. Near the river, workers are finishing Cite Multimedia, a
huge incubator for high-tech start-up companies. Later this summer,
work is to begin downtown on a new $150 million baseball stadium
for the city's Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shooting to get the shovels in by June,'' Stephen
Bronfman, the 36-year-old co-chairman of the Expos who is member of
the wealthy Bronfman clan, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Montreal hotels enjoyed their best occupancy rates
since Expo 67, the world's fair 33 years ago that marked the city's
last economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it `Paris without jet lag,''' said Marie-Josee
Allaire, spokeswoman for the Ritz Carlton Montreal, one of several
Montreal hotels that have spent a total of $150 million for
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The floods of New Englanders and New Yorkers booking rooms in
Montreal this summer follows a 20 percent jump in foreign tourism
that Canada has enjoyed for two years. As airlines add new flights
this year between the United States and Montreal, the tourist boom
is partly built on bargains to be had with the weak Canadian
currency, which trades at almost 1.50 for one American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Montreal has also reinvented itself as a major center for higher
education. The city now edges out Boston for the highest percentage
of college students in North America's largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal to is to have 25 percent of our students coming from
outside of Canada,'' said Bernard J. Shapiro, principal of McGill
University, which is the largest predominantly English-language
school in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage French-speaking bonds, a student from Senegal,
where France was the colonial power, often pays less state tuition
to study in Montreal than a student from neighboring,
English-speaking Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   This concentration of brain power has helped to move Montreal
away from its old industrial base into a mix of biopharmaceutical
companies and other technology-based concerns. In Montreal's
suburbs, the shift can be most visible at ``pill hill,'' where 40
percent of Canada's pharmaceutical companies are based. Bombardier,
a Montreal company that many Americans associate with snowmobiles,
has become the world's third largest aircraft manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new economy is multimedia, we are No. 1 in research and
development,'' said Montreal's mayor, Pierre Bourque, in an
interview. Reflecting the economic dynamism here, the Quebec
government and the Nasdaq Stock Market announced plans a week ago
to open Nasdaq Canada this fall, a new electronic exchange based
here. That would return company stock trading to the city since the
Montreal Stock Exchange closed last year.

<P>
   Spending by American filmmakers has also been a source of
economic growth, jumping four-fold in the last five years to $200
million a year. American directors have discovered that this
gracefully aging city with its stately churches and quaint public
squares offers discount locations that can pass for European or
American.

   Attracting American startup companies is the fact that
electricity, office rents and industrial construction costs are
about half those of New York and Boston. The downside is that
Quebec has North America's highest income tax rates; combined
federal and provincial rates top out at 51.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rents are extremely cheap relative to the horror stories
I've heard about Manhattan,'' said David E. Pawsey, a 24-year-old
digital editor. Referring to the American equivalent of $550, he
added, ``You can get a three bedroom place downtown for $800, and
that's considered expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   With free trade, Quebec is increasingly oriented south,
expanding the part of its economy devoted to trade with the United
States to 25 percent today, from 10 percent a decade ago. If Quebec
were a nation, it would now be the United States' fifth largest
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montreal is losing Canada as its hinterland and focusing on
the U.S.,'' said Raphael Fischler, a Belgian immigrant who teaches
urban planning at McGill. ``The francophones have reconquered
Montreal. Now, the great tension in Quebec is between linguistic
nationalism and economic globalization.''

<P>
   Although red and white maple leaf flags generally fly only over
federally owned buildings here, separatist passions and linguistic
tensions seem increasingly relaxed. In the last vote on Quebec
separation from Canada, in 1995, the separatists narrowly lost.
</P>
<P>
   After the French-supremacy language laws were imposed, about 40
percent of Montreal's English-speaking population decamped for
Ontario and points west. Those remaining are more culturally and
linguistically supple. The Gazette, the city's English-language
newspaper, recently published a series on ``the new Anglos,''
noting that in one generation, the percentage of bilingual
English-speaking residents had doubled, to about two-thirds today.
While ethnic politicians often demonize the other group, bicultural
marriages now outnumber marriages between two English-speakers.
</P>
<P>
   While English-speakers in Montreal may sometimes feel as
beleaguered as English-speakers in Miami, there is no sign that the
English presence is going to disappear here. Indeed, in one of the
biggest investments in the Canadian newspaper world this year, The
Gazette plans to inaugurate a $50 million, full color printing
press in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely an endorsement of the city and, frankly, of
the English-reading audience,'' Alan E. Allnut, editor of the
222-year-old newspaper, said over lunch in a French restaurant in
the gradually gentrifying Vieux Port neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, Montreal, with its improving economy, European
style and cheap real estate, is looking more and more attractive.
Bronfman, the co-chairman of the Expos, said of friends who left,
``There are a lot of people who are in Toronto who are dying to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Life magazine committed a very public hara-kiri for a
boosterish city monthly. The cover of an issue last fall was
devoted to a photograph of a smoked meat sandwich, with the title:
``Where to find Montreal in Toronto: the food, the fashion, the
booze, the fun _ a guide to all things Montrealish.''

 &HT;    Black happy just to be riding
 &HT;    By Carrie Teegardin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dressed in top hat and tails and riding a bold bay
horse named Hyde Park Corner, Julie Black of Newnan finished the
first phase of competition Friday at the Foxhall Cup and let loose
with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   Her dressage test, the first element of the equine triathlon in
which horses demonstrate grace and discipline, had gone well. Black
stood in 12th place with Hyde Park Corner and in 21st on
Bartolomeo.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger victory for Black was that she was in the ring at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Black is one of the equestrian world's rising stars, and
everything appeared to be on track for her to make a strong bid for
the U.S. equestrian team headed for the 2000 Games in Sydney,
Australia. But two weeks ago, while preparing for an Olympic trial
in Kentucky, Black took a nasty fall. Doctors told her she had
suffered a major back injury. The pain was so bad, if it persisted,
there could be no riding, no competing, and no chance at the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   More tests, however, showed Black's injury wasn't that bad,
after all. And maybe, just maybe, the doctors told her, she could
ride in the Foxhall Cup, another Olympic selection trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real blessing that we're here,'' said Black, 29.
``Without this event my chances of going to the Olympics, or even
letting these horses compete in something we've been working for
all spring, were just going to be nothing.'' The Foxhall Cup is
what is knows as an ``eventing'' competition, one of three Olympic
equestrian sports. The triathlon's first phase is dressage, in
which horses demonstrate grace and discipline, not unlike the
compulsories that figure skaters used to perform. The heart of the
event is today's test _ the cross-country run in which horses and
riders must navigate a grueling course of gigantic, immovable jumps
positioned over the fields and waterways of Foxhall Farm. The final
stage is the stadium jumping, where horses must show the
athleticism and endurance to jump the day after the cross-country
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   After the first phase, Tiffani Loudon of South Carolina and
Makabi are in the lead. One of Australia's top riders, Phillip
Dutton, is in second place, followed by David O'Connor, a U.S.
rider who was a silver medalist in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While the dressage results are significant, anything can happen
on the cross-country course. ``The course is beautiful and my
horses are really fit and prepared,'' Black said. ``It should be a
fun day.''

NEW YORK LEGALIZES OVER-THE-COUNTER NEEDLE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York State Legislature passed a measure
Friday that permits the sale and possession of hypodermic needles
without a prescription, a move intended to slow the spread of the
AIDS virus among addicts who inject drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation overturns the state's longstanding prohibitions
against needle sales, making New York the 43rd state that does not
require prescriptions to buy needles.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has provoked heated debate in other states, where
opponents of over-the-counter needle sales have argued that such
sales will encourage drug use. But here, no organized opposition
surfaced, enabling the bill to pass with little public debate or
even notice.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was buried in one of the hundreds of spending bills
passed shortly after midnight as lawmakers rushed to enact a budget
and head home for the weekend. Gov. George E. Pataki had submitted
the measure, so it does not need his signature to become law.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature completed passing the budget late Friday
morning. It calls for spending $77.5 billion, with large spending
increases for education, health care and transportation. It also
includes nearly $1.5 billion in new tax cuts to be phased in over
the next four years. The budget was due April 1. But for the 16th
straight year, the governor and the Legislature missed the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The needle bill had strong support from some of Albany's most
influential groups, including doctors, pharmacists, hospitals and
groups representing people with AIDS. The groups argued that the
measure would greatly reduce needle-sharing among drug addicts,
along with the transmission of H.I.V.
</P>
<P>
   The groups immediately praised the action, though many said that
Albany's leaders should have acted years ago because the virus has
spread among intravenous drug users and their partners. Michael
Kink, the legislative director for Housing Works, an advocacy group
for people with AIDS, said the law would help stem the spread of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence has existed for years that H.I.V. spreads swiftly among
addicts who share contaminated needles. More than 50 percent of the
new AIDS cases diagnosed each year in New York are found to have
been connected to intravenous drug use, according to the New York
State Aids Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most significant public health legislation in the
history of fight against AIDS in New York,'' said Ana Oliveira,
executive director of Gay Men's Health Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is similar to a law that Connecticut enacted in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly approved the measure shortly after midnight, after
receiving it from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The New York law permits people 18 or older to buy up to 10
nonprescription needles at a time from a pharmacist. The law goes
into effect in January, giving state health officials time to put
regulations in place. The governor and the Legislature must renew
the law in March 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Gottfried, a Democrat who is the main sponsor of the
legislation, said the price of needles on the black market was so
high that addicts felt the need to share them.
</P>
<P>
   For years, New York's leaders have been under pressure to change
the state law banning the sale or possession of syringes without a
prescription. The law was originally adopted to combat drug abuse.
But critics argued that making needles more readily available did
not appear to encourage drug use in places like Buffalo, Rochester
and New York City, where officials have been running
needle-exchange programs with waivers from the state.

FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATE EX-CIA DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department and the FBI have begun a
criminal investigation to determine whether the former d CIA
Director John M. Deutch mishandled classified material by placing
it on unsecure computers in his home, government officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a complete reversal of her earlier decisions about Deutch,
Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the new inquiry to determine
whether her initial decision not to prosecute him was in error and
whether he should now face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   She decided against prosecution last year, officials said,
without ordering any investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is the result of an internal review of the
case ordered earlier this year by Reno.
</P>
<P>
   For the new criminal investigation, officials said, the Justice
Department has assigned a prosecutor to work directly with FBI
agents. They are pursuing an inquiry that focuses on whether Deutch
should face criminal charges for having retained highly classified
information on his unsecured home computers while he was leading
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, officials said, a special White House intelligence
panel presented President Clinton with a toughly worded report that
is critical of current and former CIA officials for failing to
follow through adequately on the evidence against Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board was presented to Clinton personally earlier this week by the
board's chairman, former Sen. Warren Rudman.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings, they said, were similar to those of the
CIA's inspector general, who also found that senior CIA officials
failed to aggressively investigate Deutch when the computer lapses
were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential board's findings remain classified,
officials described its report as sharply critical of the roles
played by several of the agency's most senior officials, including
some who had worked closely with Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Deutch's lawyer were not immediately returned Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the board's report was particularly critical
of the roles played in the investigation by the former CIA
executive director, Nora Slatkin, and the former CIA general
counsel, Michael O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin comes in for the heaviest criticism, officials said,
because she was effectively in charge of the CIA's botched initial
investigation. Both Slatkin and O'Neil had been brought to the CIA
by Deutch and had close relationships with him.
</P>
<P>
   Others cited in the report include former CIA Inspector General
Frederick Hitz and Richard Calder, now the CIA's deputy director
for administration. Hitz began the inspector general's
investigation of the Deutch matter but it was completed last year
by his successor, L. Britt Snider. The presidential board also
criticized CIA Director George Tenet for allowing Slatkin to take
charge of the Deutch investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential board began its review of the way the CIA
handled the Deutch matter at the request of Air Force Gen. John A.
Gordon, deputy director of the CIA, who was dissatisfied with the
CIA's own efforts to review the matter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has received a copy of the presidential board's report
and will now try to determine whether any further disciplinary
action is required at the CIA against those involved in the Deutch
case.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the Deutch case has been highly controversial
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The case began just as Deutch was leaving office in December
1996, when an agency computer security specialist discovered that
Deutch had placed large volumes of classified material on unsecure
computers in his home, including information about some of the
government's most sensitive covert operations.
</P>
<P>
   The material included detailed personal journals about Deutch's
activities at the CIA and memos prepared for Clinton. Placing
classified material on these unsecure computers represented
potential violations of both agency rules and federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the classified material was detected, Deutch
deleted more than 1,000 files from his personal computers,
according to the inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's security staff began a probe of the matter, but before
long it bogged down, and some CIA security officials became
convinced that senior CIA officials were attempting to protect
Deutch from a thorough investigation. The security staff wrote a
report on its investigation in 1997 without ever questioning
Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   No action was taken against Deutch for more than a year, when
the CIA's inspector general was told by an agency employee that the
earlier investigation had not been handled properly. Until the CIA
inspector general launched his own investigation in early 1998,
Tenet had not taken any action to reprimand Deutch or discipline
any other current or former CIA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet had said there was never any attempt by anyone at the CIA
to constrain the internal inquiry into the Deutch matter.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's inspector general notified the Justice Department of
the Deutch matter in 1998. The delay in notifying the Justice
Department about the case allowed a one-year time limit on
appointing an independent counsel to lapse, according to the
inspector general's report. The independent counsel act was still
in effect at the time. ``Application of the Independent Counsel
statute was not adequately considered'' by CIA officials handling
the case, the report says. ``Given their failure to report to the
Department of Justice on a timely basis, this in effect avoided the
potential application of the Independent Counsel statute.''
</P>
<P>
   But in April 1999, Reno decided not to prosecute Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Officials now say that the Justice Department decided not to
prosecute without any FBI investigation of the matter. The decision
to decline prosecution was also made before the CIA's inspector
general had issued its report on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, after the inspector general finally issued his
classified report on Deutch's actions, Tenet, the CIA director,
suspended Deutch's CIA security clearances. At the time, Deutch
issued a statement apologizing for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report recommended that a special CIA
accountability review planel be created to examine whether Tenet
and other top CIA officials properly handled the agency's internal
investigation. That accountability review panel issued a classified
report earlier, and presented it to Gordon for use in determining
disciplinary action. But officials said Gordon was not pleased with
the accountability review panel's report, apparently because it was
too soft on agency officials involved in the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Gordon asked the presidential board to conduct an
independent review. The presidential board interviewed Deutch
during its review of the matter, officials said. The White House
has rejected a request from the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence for a copy of the presidential board's report, but
Rudman has briefed the committee on his findings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the government's handling of the Deutch case have
tried to draw a comparison between the gentleness of it and the
harsher treatment of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos scientist who has
been indicted on charges of downloading and copying files
containing nuclear secrets with the intention of aiding a foreign
country and damaging national security.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has dismissed the comparison, telling a Senate panel that
while Mr. Deutch was ''sloppy'' in his handling of classified
documents, there was no evidence that he had intended to aid a
foreign country by handing over American secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think there is a great difference in the two
cases,'' Tenet said. ''In both cases there was a referral made to
the Department of Justice. In one case, the Department of Justice
declined any action, in the case of the director. In the case of
Wen Ho Lee, there is an indictment pending.''

   U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DECLINES TO A 30-YEAR LOW
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the United States'
unemployment rate fell below 4 percent in April for the first time
in 30 years, as employers hired tens of thousands of census takers,
restaurant employees and temporary workers, and the robust economy
showed no signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   There was little evidence in the numbers _ a total of 340,000
new jobs last month and a 3.9 percent unemployment rate _ that the
record 9-year-old expansion might be weakening in response to the
Federal Reserve Board's attempt to slow the economy by raising
interest rates five times since last June.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK GAUGES RISE IN LIGHT TRADING
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose on the lowest trading volumes of the year as
investors seemed to ignore the decline in the U.S. unemployment
rate. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 165.37 points, or 1.6
percent, to 10,577.86. The Nasdaq composite index finished up 96.58
points, or 2.6 percent, to 3,816.82, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 23.06 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,432.63.

   Four drug companies agreed to plead guilty and pay $33 million

the latest to plead guilty in the Justice Department's
investigation of the vitamin industry.

   PHONE COMPANIES END MERGER TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Talks about a merger between two leading European
telecommunication companies _ Royal KPN of the Netherlands and
Telefonica of Spain _ broke down. The companies said that a
majority of the Telefonica board backed the deal but that
opposition ``by an important minority group within the board''
undermined KPN's confidence in the chance for success of the new
company.
</P>
<P>
   CISCO IN STOCK DEAL FOR ARROWPOINT
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems agreed to buy ArrowPoint Communications in a stock

SUIT AGAINST DeLAY SIMILAR TO ONE AGAINST CLINTON 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democrats who sued House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay this week for alleged campaign-finance improprieties used
legal arguments similar to those in a lawsuit that an anti-Clinton
group filed against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's racketeering
claim against the Texas Republican reads like allegations of
fund-raising irregularities the conservative group Judicial Watch
has pending against the DCCC, President Clinton, his staff and
party contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch chairman Larry Klayman, an outspoken critic of
Democratic campaign tactics, said Friday that the similarities
between the lawsuits are too strong to be merely coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently they thought highly of our lawsuit,'' Klayman said
of the DCCC's attorneys. ``Imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery.''
</P>
<P>
   But the DCCC's chief lawyer and its spokesman said Judicial
Watch's lawsuit in no way inspired the claim against DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't generally tend to imitate Larry Klayman,'' attorney
Robert Bauer said of his courtroom nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Added DCCC spokesman Erik Smith: ``Our suit's completely
unrelated to that suit.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether by accident or design, the commonalities between the
lawsuits are rooted in the deep partisan differences between
Democrats and Republicans, said political science professor George
Edwards III of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases allege violations of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, a law generally aimed at combating
organized crime and corporate fraud.
</P>
<P>
   That the statute, widely known as RICO, has been used in a
fund-raising context is unusual. That it has been used in two such
cases appears to be more than happenstance, Klayman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer dismissed Klayman's copycat view of the origin of the
case against DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said racketeering was the appropriate claim to make
against DeLay's alleged use of three organizations, set up by close
advisers to the Houston area Republican, to evade fund-raising
disclosure laws and to strong-arm contributors. The DCCC claims
that DeLay solicited campaign contributions by promising corporate
donors that their largess would be rewarded with favorable
legislation from the GOP-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who said he intends to fight the lawsuit, called the
allegation ``frivolous'' and a ``pretty pathetic ... act of
desperation'' by the Democrats to disrupt legitimate GOP
fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch, in its similar lawsuit filed in November 1998,
claims that Clinton and the DCCC violated RICO in securing more
than $1 million in contributions from Loral Space and
Communications Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Klayman, representing Loral shareholders in the lawsuit, says
the DCCC, Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and White House staff
violated the law by soliciting $1.46 million in contributions from
the company. In return for the donations, Clinton issued a
presidential waiver to Loral that allowed the high-tech company to
launch a communications satellite from China, Klayman alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The DCCC and the other defendants counter that they operated
within the law.
</P>
<P>
   In another similarity, both lawsuits have drawn heavy fire from
Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Each party has accused the other of being more interested in
scoring political points with their claims than in trying to stop
illegal campaign fund-raising. The parties argue that the aim of
the lawsuits is not to win but to enable each side to subpoena
campaign staff and documents in an effort to upset each other's
fund-raising operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two groups bringing the lawsuits have a history
of trying to embarrass the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Klayman and Judicial Watch have been a constant thorn in the
president's side, as they have sued, subpoenaed and deposed White
House staff regarding genuine and alleged Clinton scandals. The
group has questioned staff and sought documents related to
Clinton's tryst with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and
about alleged campaign finance irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the DCCC has been aggressive in going after DeLay.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Mich. _ Gary E. Anderson knows what most people think
of when they hear the name Dow Corning: breast implants, and
nothing else. If Anderson, Dow Corning's chief executive, were an
irritable kind of fellow, that would irk him mightily.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Dow Corning makes 10,000 products for more than
30,000 customers, and it never derived more than 1 percent of its
sales from breast implants. These days, operating earnings are
growing robustly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the impact of implant-related class-action suits has kept
Dow Corning operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws since
1995. Because Dow Corning is owned by the Dow Chemical Co. and
Corning Inc., not directly by shareholders, and because it sells no
consumer products, neither the business press nor securities
analysts have paid much attention to the company's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But irritability is not Anderson's style. A soft-spoken,
easygoing man who does not wait for Fridays to dress casually, he
patiently discusses the implant issue when asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, Dow did not lose customers, suppliers or employees when the
implant debacle hit. Yes, he stands by subsequent studies that
absolve silicone from blame in autoimmune and other diseases. Yes,
he had hoped that Dow Corning would have emerged from bankruptcy by
now, but no, it probably will not for another couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Only after answering such questions does Anderson turn to the
subject that really makes his juices flow: Dow Corning's mainstay
silicone business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell something to every SIC code,'' Anderson said,
referring to a common classification system for industries.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder. Silicones are remarkably inert materials; they do
not conduct electricity, they are resistant to heat and cold, and
they don't react with most chemicals. They are thus ideal
insulators, protectants and additives.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning routinely pumps about 8 percent of sales into
research _ a high percentage for a materials company _ and its
roster of patents and products keeps swelling. Its silicones add a
soft, nongreasy feel to skin lotions and help shampoos leave behind
high-gloss hair. They provide leak-proof seals for automobile
engines and coatings for air bags.
</P>
<P>
   The company just introduced a new line of silicone adhesives and
protective sealants that make it possible to reduce the size of
computer chips without risk that they will short out. The latest
PlayStation from Sony already uses the chips, and Dow Corning
executives predict that the semiconductor market, now accounting
for about 2 percent of sales, will bring as much as 15 percent of
sales and 20 percent of profits by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of huge settlements over the breast implant issue
keeps Dow Corning in bankruptcy. But as Siegfried Haberer, a
30-year Dow Corning veteran and now its executive vice president,
said, ``I haven't seen major impact from the bankruptcy on our
business in the last five years, and I don't think I'll see it in
the next five.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning's fiscal health _ not to mention a study last year
that seemed to clear breast implants in health problems _
infuriates its legal antagonists. Sybil Niden Goldrich, co-founder
of the Command Trust Network, which distributes silicone implant
information, and a self-described ``silicone breast implant
survivor,'' has long been critical of the scientific studies of
implants. ``It seems unfair that you can do business as usual under
the protection of bankruptcy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the same factors that have kept Dow Corning's
rebound a secret have given it a certain immunity to public anger.
Started in 1943 by Dow Chemical and Corning, it has never had to
contend with skittish shareholders. Because its customers are other
businesses, its sales have not been affected by any emotional
backlash. ``The guy ordering silicone sealants isn't thinking of
negative public relations,'' said J. Jeffrey Cianci, an analyst at
Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said customers have rallied round him. ``I got tons of
reassuring calls from customers and suppliers,'' he said. ``You
could tell they were thinking, `There but for the grace of God go
I.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There has been no mass flight of employees; in fact, the list
has grown with newcomers _ including many women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm sympathetic to the women who've gone through
this,'' said Denise L. Wiggins, who joined as global marketing
communications manager in 1997. ``But during the interviews, I got
the sense of a company with high integrity and a solid base of
employees. The breast implant situation just wasn't top of mind for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``situation'' has given Dow Corning a rough financial ride,
though. Before its bankruptcy filing, the company took nearly $2
billion in pretax charges to reflect its liability under an
industrywide settlement agreement. As of Dec. 31, 1999, Dow Corning
was named in 25,000 pending lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Asian economic meltdown sent Dow
Corning's sales and profits into a nosedive in 1998. Its revenues
have been stuck at around $2.6 billion for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, last year the company was back to $220 million in
operating income _ a nice rebound from the $831 million operating
loss in 1998. Net income was back to $109.7 million, a lot better
than the net loss of $598 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dow Corning were publicly traded, it would be one of the
better-regarded specialty chemical companies on the street,'' said
Mark Gulley, an analyst with Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning's parents have offered not just sympathy, but
empathy. Dow Chemical, after all, went through its own tumult when
dioxin, a byproduct of its defoliant Agent Orange, was branded a
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them, get some high-level people to focus on the
implant issue, and let everyone else focus on the rest of the
business,'' said William S. Stavropoulos, chief executive of Dow
Chemical. In 1992 Keith McKennon, a Dow Chemical executive who had
coordinated much of Dow's public response to the Agent Orange
litigation, joined Dow Corning as interim chief executive. One of
the first things he did was to plead the company's case on ``Larry
King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dow Chemical and Corning emphatically deny persistent
rumors that Corning is losing interest in the venture and that Dow
will buy its share. ``Dow Corning has focused all of its energies
on one field of science, and we're enjoying the fruits of that, so
why mess with it?'' Stavropoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   Corning, meanwhile, has moved heavily into fiber optics, an area
that makes great use of silicone coatings. Thus, Dow Corning's
products ``are in high demand in many of the same growth markets
Corning is pursuing,'' said Keith Horn, technical director of
organic materials in Corning's science and technology group.
</P>
<P>
   But one high-growth industry is conspicuously absent from Dow
Corning's to-do list. The company is soured, perhaps forever, on
medical applications, which in 1990 represented 7 percent of sales.
Dow Corning sold its line of implants for knees, hips and the like
soon after the first breast implant suits, and has scuttled
research into synthetic skin, eye fluids and artificial eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have continued the evolution toward a bionic person,
so society has lost out,'' Anderson said. ``But until trial lawyers
are reined in, and we get better laws, it's just not worth the
aggravation of making anything that goes into the body.''

U.N. REPORTS REBELS NOW HOLD 300 OF ITS TROOPS IN SIERRA LEONE
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for complete write-thru, byline addition)  
(Eds.: Includes story budgeted earlier as SIERRA-LEONE-U.S.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN and JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Rebels have taken more than 300 U.N. troops
hostage in Sierra Leone, U.N. and Clinton administration officials
said Friday, and some peacekeeping units have lost contact with
their command posts.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,300-member U.N. force, composed mainly of African and
Indian troops, was rapidly losing confidence under the assault, a
Western diplomat reached by telephone in the capital of Freetown
said. He added that after the latest captures, on Thursday, the
entire mission, meant to secure the peace after eight years of
civil war, was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   He described the chances of an effective continuation of the
mission, one the most ambitious peacekeeping efforts by the United
Nations, as only ``50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks were underway in Freetown between several commanders of
the insurgent Revolutionary United Front and Western diplomats to
try and stop the fighting, the diplomat said. But it was unclear
what progress was made.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hostages was a contingent of about 200 Zambian
soldiers, a U.N. spokesman said. Their weapons were taken and they
were stripped of their clothes, this spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen armored vehicles belonging to the Zambians were
also confiscated and were now being driven by the rebels, according
to reports from the field. Another contingent of more than 100
Nigerian peacekeepers was stripped of weapons and then released,
said the spokesman, Fred Eckhart.
</P>
<P>
   Further undermining the morale of the U.N. effort,
parliamentarians in Kenya Friday called for the withdrawal of the
Kenyan contingent of the peace force after four of their soldiers
were missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers were also taken hostage by the hundreds during
the Bosnian war. In May 1995, Bosnian Serbs held more than 350
peacekeepers, some for several weeks, as insurance against air
strikes by NATO. Under a peace accord signed last July, the rebel
leader, Foday Sankoh, whose forces have terrorized the country with
a campaign of chopping off hands, feet and arms, was brought into a
new national government.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some U.S. officials questioned the wisdom of
bringing such a violent leader, who has become rich from plundering
Sierra Leone's diamond mines, under the government umbrella. It was
now becoming obvious, some officials said, that Sankoh was using
his new government position as a temporary breather before making
more war.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the assault by the rebels, who began their
operation on Tuesday, seemed very precise, several administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's troops _ assumed by the administration to number about
6,000, with many of them unemployed teen-agers _ chose a window of
opportunity just after many Nigerian troops had withdrawn from
Sierra Leone and before the U.N. force was up to full strength.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also took advantage of a U.N. force that appeared to
be ill-trained, easily intimidated and equipped with only light
infantry armor, administration officials said. Some of the troops
were not following elementary military rules such as securing the
perimeters of their bases, barracks and offices, one official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the field in the last few days showed that some
U.N. troops were so frightened by the reputation of the rebels that
they abandoned their vehicles as soon as they were stopped at a
roadblock by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Describing how the U.N. troops gave up so easily, the official
said: ``Some will say that's what you get by hiring third world
armies. But in Somalia we had the same with first world armies.''
This was a reference to U.S. forces who withdrew from Somalia in
the first year of the Clinton administration after 17 soldiers were
killed in a firefight.
</P>
<P>
   As the situation in Sierra Leone continued to deteriorate,
senior Clinton administration officials met at the White House to
assess options.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a senior State Department official said that a team
of British military experts would arrive in Sierra Leone on
Saturday to review the U.N. operation from ``top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are continuing to do is look very carefully at whether
the forces there and the reinforcements that can be brought in can
have a useful effect,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has said it is considering a request from the
United Nations to provide transport planes to ferry some of the
3,000 Jordanian, Bengladeshi and Indian troops still scheduled to
go to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   There was absolutely no consideration of sending U.S. soldiers,
officials said. In similar situations in the past, though, the use
of U.S. transport planes has required U.S. troops to help secure
the airport to ensure that the aircraft and military personnel
involved do not come under attack.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, Washington was asking regional leaders,
including the president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, to put
pressure on Sankoh to stand by the peace agreement of last July,
officials said. The State Department also asked the Rev. Jesse
Jackson to ask President Charles Taylor of Liberia to call for the
rebel leader, who is a colleague, to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, diplomats described how the Zambian
convoy of 208 soldiers, who had arrived in Sierra Leone only two
days earlier, was overwhelmed, and lost its 13 armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were dispatched Thursday from Lungi, a port north of
Freetown, to reinforce beleaguered peacekeeping troops at Makeni in
the northern hinterland. But they lost radio contact with the U.N.
headquarters in the capital. The Zambians passed through two rebel
checkpoints and then at a third found themselves boxed in by a
force of heavily armed guerrillas. The convoy's commander, faced
with a battle that he felt he was sure to lose, negotiated a
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 208 Zambian soldiers, an estimated 110 other
U. N. peacekeepers, military observers and civilian workers are
being held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandate authorized by the Security Council for Sierra
Leone, the peacekeepers may defend themselves but are not equipped
for conventional combat.
</P>
<P>
   A former U.S. assistant secretary for Africa, Henry J. Cohen,
said Friday that the peacekeepers should have been more robustly
equipped, including with artillery, to be able to give a ``show of
strength.'' Cohen said the peacekeeping force now faced two
options: ``appease and lose face'' or use strong force against the
rebels, including helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that if the U.N. force pulled out as it had in
Somalia in 1993 and several years later in Rwanda, then Sankoh's
forces would ``sweep into power.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, the immediate task, according to the Western
diplomat in Freetown, was to see what ``you can do for the
battalions that are not affected. The key is to get the rebels to
turn it off and to resolve some of the U.N. problems of
organization and communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyans, who were the first target of the rebels, appeared
to have encountered rebels who were ``more numerous, more
committed.'' But why the Kenyan unit unraveled so quickly was not
clear, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said the peacekeepers were surrounded in
unfamiliar terrain by armed adversaries. ``They're authorized to
defend themselves but they're not required to fight to the last
man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some embassies in Freetown began evacuating dependents and
nonessential people. More than 100 workers for nongovernment relief
organizations were also reportedly been evacuated by U.N.
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed concern in Paris on
Thursday that the deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone might
have a ripple effect in making member countries hesitate to
contribute troops to a more complex peacekeeping operation being
assembled for Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The efforts right now are political in nature: to get anybody
who has influence on Foday Sankoh to convince him to come back into
compliance with the peace agreement,'' Eckhard said Friday. ``If
that fails, I don't want to speculate what could happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leader, who remains at his residence in Freetown,
continued to deny Friday that his fighters have taken any U.N.
peacekeepers hostage, asserting that they must have gotten lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here was that there are people missing in the
area because they are not familiar with the terrain, so I ordered
my commanders to try and search for them,'' Sankoh said, according
to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Four U.N. helicopter gunships were supposed to have arrived last
month, the diplomat said, but as of several days ago had still not
shown up. Whether the gunships would have been useful in the clash
between the Kenyans and the rebels or the Zambians or the rebels
was an open question, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rather indiscriminate,'' the diplomat said of the
helicopters. ``As long as U.N. troops are with rebels I'd be more
cautious than sending up gunships to do their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the options being discussed at the State Department in
the last several days has been charging Sankoh with war crimes and
trying to remove him from the scene, several officials said. But
this seemed an unlikely outcome, especially while Sankoh's forces
controlled U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said they were concerned that if Sankoh was
removed, the rebel group would become even less manageable because
it would fall into the hands of a number of disparate commanders.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the peace accords of last summer, Sankoh was given a
position as head of a commission designed to control the flow of
illegal diamond exports from Sierra Leone. The U.S. contributed $1
million to setting up the commission, an administration official
said.

(REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING)  
 FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATE EX-CIA DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department and the FBI have begun a
criminal investigation to determine whether the former d CIA
Director John M. Deutch mishandled classified material by placing
it on unsecure computers in his home, government officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a complete reversal of her earlier decisions about Deutch,
Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the new inquiry to determine
whether her initial decision not to prosecute him was in error and
whether he should now face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   She decided against prosecution last year, officials said,
without ordering any investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is the result of an internal review of the
case ordered earlier this year by Reno.
</P>
<P>
   For the new criminal investigation, officials said, the Justice
Department has assigned a prosecutor to work directly with FBI
agents. They are pursuing an inquiry that focuses on whether Deutch
should face criminal charges for having retained highly classified
information on his unsecured home computers while he was leading
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, officials said, a special White House intelligence
panel presented President Clinton with a toughly worded report that
is critical of current and former CIA officials for failing to
follow through adequately on the evidence against Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board was presented to Clinton personally earlier this week by the
board's chairman, former Sen. Warren Rudman.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings, they said, were similar to those of the
CIA's inspector general, who also found that senior CIA officials
failed to aggressively investigate Deutch when the computer lapses
were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential board's findings remain classified,
officials described its report as sharply critical of the roles
played by several of the agency's most senior officials, including
some who had worked closely with Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Deutch's lawyer were not immediately returned Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the board's report was particularly critical
of the roles played in the investigation by the former CIA
executive director, Nora Slatkin, and the former CIA general
counsel, Michael O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin comes in for the heaviest criticism, officials said,
because she was effectively in charge of the CIA's botched initial
investigation. Both Slatkin and O'Neil had been brought to the CIA
by Deutch and had close relationships with him.
</P>
<P>
   Others cited in the report include former CIA Inspector General
Frederick Hitz and Richard Calder, now the CIA's deputy director
for administration. Hitz began the inspector general's
investigation of the Deutch matter but it was completed last year
by his successor, L. Britt Snider. The presidential board also
criticized CIA Director George Tenet for allowing Slatkin to take
charge of the Deutch investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential board began its review of the way the CIA
handled the Deutch matter at the request of Air Force Gen. John A.
Gordon, deputy director of the CIA, who was dissatisfied with the
CIA's own efforts to review the matter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has received a copy of the presidential board's report
and will now try to determine whether any further disciplinary
action is required at the CIA against those involved in the Deutch
case.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the Deutch case has been highly controversial
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The case began just as Deutch was leaving office in December
1996, when an agency computer security specialist discovered that
Deutch had placed large volumes of classified material on unsecure
computers in his home, including information about some of the
government's most sensitive covert operations.
</P>
<P>
   The material included detailed personal journals about Deutch's
activities at the CIA and memos prepared for Clinton. Placing
classified material on these unsecure computers represented
potential violations of both agency rules and federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the classified material was detected, Deutch
deleted more than 1,000 files from his personal computers,
according to the inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's security staff began a probe of the matter, but before
long it bogged down, and some CIA security officials became
convinced that senior CIA officials were attempting to protect
Deutch from a thorough investigation. The security staff wrote a
report on its investigation in 1997 without ever questioning
Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   No action was taken against Deutch for more than a year, when
the CIA's inspector general was told by an agency employee that the
earlier investigation had not been handled properly. Until the CIA
inspector general launched his own investigation in early 1998,
Tenet had not taken any action to reprimand Deutch or discipline
any other current or former CIA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet had said there was never any attempt by anyone at the CIA
to constrain the internal inquiry into the Deutch matter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's inspector general notified the Justice Department of
the Deutch matter in 1998. The delay in notifying the Justice
Department about the case allowed a one-year time limit on
appointing an independent counsel to lapse, according to the
inspector general's report. The independent counsel act was still
in effect at the time. ``Application of the Independent Counsel
statute was not adequately considered'' by CIA officials handling
the case, the report says. ``Given their failure to report to the
Department of Justice on a timely basis, this in effect avoided the
potential application of the Independent Counsel statute.''
</P>
<P>
   But in April 1999, Reno decided not to prosecute Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Officials now say that the Justice Department decided not to
prosecute without any FBI investigation of the matter. The decision
to decline prosecution was also made before the CIA's inspector
general had issued its report on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, after the inspector general finally issued his
classified report on Deutch's actions, Tenet, the CIA director,
suspended Deutch's CIA security clearances. At the time, Deutch
issued a statement apologizing for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report recommended that a special CIA
accountability review planel be created to examine whether Tenet
and other top CIA officials properly handled the agency's internal
investigation. That accountability review panel issued a classified
report earlier, and presented it to Gordon for use in determining
disciplinary action. But officials said Gordon was not pleased with
the accountability review panel's report, apparently because it was
too soft on agency officials involved in the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Gordon asked the presidential board to conduct an
independent review. The presidential board interviewed Deutch
during its review of the matter, officials said. The White House
has rejected a request from the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence for a copy of the presidential board's report, but
Rudman has briefed the committee on his findings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the government's handling of the Deutch case have
tried to draw a comparison between the gentleness of it and the
harsher treatment of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos scientist who has
been indicted on charges of downloading and copying files
containing nuclear secrets with the intention of aiding a foreign
country and damaging national security.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has dismissed the comparison, telling a Senate panel that
while Mr. Deutch was ''sloppy'' in his handling of classified
documents, there was no evidence that he had intended to aid a
foreign country by handing over American secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think there is a great difference in the two
cases,'' Tenet said. ''In both cases there was a referral made to
the Department of Justice. In one case, the Department of Justice
declined any action, in the case of the director. In the case of
Wen Ho Lee, there is an indictment pending.''

THE TEMPTATION OF THE MARKET TIMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 7) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the volatility of technology stocks is on the rise. But what
_ if anything _ can investors do about it?
</P>
<P>
   In an April 30 research report, Edward Kerschner, chief
investment strategist at PaineWebber, offers this advice: Grin and
bear it.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kerschner, the average daily price change of the
technology sector, as tracked by Standard &AMP; Poor's, was 1.07
percent from 1993 through 1999, though it rose steadily over that
period. This year through April, it was 2.29 percent, or more than
twice that figure.
</P>
<P>
   As volatility increases, creating more peaks and valleys in
stock prices, so does the temptation for investors to time the
market. To see the potential, consider the path of the technology
sector. From 1993 through April of this year, its compound annual
growth rate was 38.6 percent, more than double the 17.8 percent of
the S&AMP;P 500-stock index. But say an investor was a perfect market
timer over that period _ putting all of his or her portfolio into
technology stocks, but switching to the broader market every month
the technology stocks underperformed. Bingo! That growth rate rises
to 59.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is when to jump and when to sit tight.
Despite all the investor talk of ``January effects'' and ``summer
doldrums,'' Kerschner says that there appears to be no seasonality
in the technology stocks' outperformance of the broader market.
</P>
<P>
   Without a methodology to help decide when to trade out of
technology stocks, market-timing is even more difficult. As
technology stocks' volatility has risen, so has the implied cost of
a wrong market-timing decision.
</P>
<P>
   Say a market-timing technology investor switched into the S&AMP;P
500 for just one month in a given year, but that month happened to
be the one in which technology stocks performed best. Back in 1993,
such a mistake would have shaved 5.1 percentage points of the
market-timers' returns for the year. In 1996, 9.6 percentage points
would have been sacrificed. In 1999, the error would have cost a
fat 20.1 percentage points in potential gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the information age,'' Kerschner wrote in his
report. ``Tech stocks define that age. And just as they offer
unprecedented growth opportunities, they also offer unprecedented
volatility.'' In other words, caveat trader. ``How to play?'' he
asked. ``Don't try to time it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ RICHARD TEITELBAUM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FUNDS WATCH: THE PAYOFF FROM AT&AMP;T'S FALL
</P>
<P>
   Last Nov. 23, shares of AT&AMP;T hit $53, and Donald L. Luskin,
manager of the $35 million OpenFund, was engulfed in doubt. A month
and a half earlier, he had sold the stock short at $46.50, betting
that it would fall.
</P>
<P>
   But it was heading up. Moreover, Luskin lives in a glass house,
by mutual fund standards: OpenFund, which started last year, posts
all its investment decisions on its Web site daily, lets the public
post opinions of its performance and even has a Webcam on its
trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   Now the public was talking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to eat crow and cover the short,'' one visitor
wrote. ``I'm thinking about it, I'm thinking about it!'' Luskin
wrote back.
</P>
<P>
   He has added to and covered part of the short position at
various times over recent months. On March 29, when AT&AMP;T hit $61,
another visitor accused Luskin of being ``obsessed'' with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Luskin was vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T announced that its earnings and revenue growth for the
remainder of the year would fall short of analysts' expectations.
The stock fell 18 percent for the week, closing on Friday at
$38.4375, and Luskin, who had last added to his short position when
the stock hit $58.50 on March 29, had a tidy $98,983 profit as of
Friday, not including trading costs.
</P>
<P>
   He is maintaining a short position on the stock. ``The company
is sitting on a huge legacy of network architecture,'' Luskin said
in an interview. ``Everything about the way it connects people is
three or four generations old. It's America's most unnecessary
company.''

FRAM'S LUNCH SPECIAL: AIR-FILTER MARINARA

<P>
   It's about as unlikely a promotional gimmick as you can find. To
publicize the advantages of the Triad fibers used in its automotive
air filters, the Fram unit of Honeywell is handing out packages of
deep red ``A Taste of Triad'' pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Labeled in Fram's signature orange-and-black style, the ``100
percent edible'' noodles are ``a fun way to see what a difference
shape can make,'' according to the package. The pasta's unusual
cross-section _ a bit like a Star Wars TIE fighter with an extra
wing _ is said to hold a lot more sauce than plain old spaghetti.
Demonstrating the principle in the kitchen is meant to help
retailers and sales representatives remember the company's
assertion that similarly shaped and colored fibers in the new air
filter hold 48 percent more dirt than ordinary fibers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Heather Gillette, a spokeswoman for Fram, a
packaging designer at the company first suggested the metaphoric
macaroni. Marketing executives turned up an artisan pasta maker in
Rhode Island who could manufacture it in the unusual shape; the
correct red food coloring had to be imported from Italy. All the
effort paid off in the attention the new Fram filter garnered at
the latest Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week trade show. ``The
pasta was a big hit,'' Gillette said.

EX-DEA AGENT APOLOGIZES FOR HIT MAN PLOT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK SMITH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ A former federal drug agent stood before a judge
Friday and turned down a chance to prove his innocence, apologizing
for trying to hire a hit man to avenge the 1995 slaying of his
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador Martinez's sentence of seven years in prison was the
result of a guilty plea three months earlier. This could be the end
of a tragic and complex border family saga.
</P>
<P>
   But it probably isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Another cousin of Martinez's is the retired head of the Dallas
office of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Phil Jordan. It was
the shooting death five years ago of Jordan's younger brother,
Bruno, that Martinez was trying to avenge.
</P>
<P>
   The way Jordan sees it, there are now two injustices: the murder
of his 27-year-old brother, which he believes was financed by a
drug cartel, and the prosecution of his cousin, Sal, the result of
an ongoing feud between the DEA and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the FBI first got wind that Sal was talking recklessly,
they should have notified the DEA, and Sal should have been ordered
to return immediately to the United States, where he would have
been disciplined and received counseling,'' Jordan said. ``The FBI
should have handled this much like they have for their own agents _
keeping the matter internal.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said that Martinez's plot was outrageous and
demanded criminal prosecution. Said FBI Special Agent John De Leon
in McAllen, Texas: ``We took the facts that were brought about
originally, (and) we did what we felt we had to do to bring the
case to where it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 37, with an eight-year track record for the DEA, was
an agent working in Monterrey, Mexico, when he was arrested last
December.
</P>
<P>
   He said he still remembers distinctly the day his cousin, Lionel
Jordan, whom they all called Bruno, was murdered. He heard it on
television on his wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators called it a carjacking, because Bruno Jordan, a
college student, had been dropping off a new Chevy Silverado truck
for a friend. He was confronted in a store parking lot in El Paso,
Texas, and shot with a handgun. The truck was stolen. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The killing happened just days before Phil Jordan was to take
over El Paso's high-tech intelligence center, a move that would
bring him back home from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who for five years has been obsessed with the motives
behind his brother's slaying, is convinced that it was an effort by
high-powered drug lords to intimidate him.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he is now convinced the prosecution of his cousin, Sal,
is the result of the FBI's desire to damage the DEA's reputation as
part of ``a petty turf war'' for drug-related funding.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken critic of corruption within the Mexican government
and the U.S. government's renewed certification that allows Mexico
to receive federal anti-drug funding, &UR;  &LR; Jordan said he believes that
FBI agents were motivated by mistakenly thinking that Martinez's
case would lead back to him. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence against his cousin in the murder-for-hire case
is not insubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Bruno Jordan was killed, a suspect was arrested.
The alleged killer was a 13-year-old from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico,
named Miguel Angel Flores, who police said was working for a car
theft ring.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was convicted of the murder on June 1, 1995, and
sentenced to 20 years. But the judgment was overturned and after
two retrials ended in mistrials, Flores was finally freed last year
and deported to Mexico at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez found out where Flores lived. The agent arranged to
meet one of his drug informants last Sept. 24 at a gas station in
McAllen, according to his plea agreement. There, he gave the
informant an envelope with a photograph of Flores and his name and
address.
</P>
<P>
   As payment for the murder, Martinez promised a government-issued
Colt pistol and up to $10,000 from DEA investigative funds.
</P>
<P>
   The informant went to the FBI, whose officials asked him to
tape-record further conversations with Martinez. Court records said
secretly recorded conversations between the informant and Martinez
from October through December ``substantiated the existence of the
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was arrested Dec. 15 in Brownsville, Texas, where he
had been summoned by federal agents for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A Dec. 20 search of his office at the U.S. Consulate in
Monterrey uncovered a semi-automatic pistol, a photograph of Flores
and a typewritten chronology of events regarding the murder
of &UR;  &LR; Bruno Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   At his sentencing Friday, Martinez told U.S. District Judge
George Kazen that his cousin's slaying was ``a tragedy that spurred
me to think with my heart instead of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazen asked Martinez if he wanted to reconsider his guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think you were entrapped, then take back your plea,''
Kazen said. ``I'll give you a change right now; we'll go to trial.
But if that's not the case, then you ought to level with your
friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Martinez said he decided to plead guilty
because he did not want to put his family through more of the
emotional and financial stress they already had been through when
Bruno Jordan was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had given priority to my own self-interest, many people
would have suffered through an agonizingly painful and expensive
jury trial, the public image of federal agents on the Southwest
border would have been tarnished, U.S.-Mexican diplomatic relations
would have been further strained, and U.S. drug interdiction
efforts would have taken a giant step backwards,'' his statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kazen appeared to be torn over whether to accept the plea deal.
He told Martinez he could have received a stiffer sentence, but he
also said he had received many letters attesting to his fine
character. He said he sentenced him ``with a heavy heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge advised Martinez to do the best he could, to take
advantage of learning opportunities while in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not think so,'' he said, ``but you are still a very
young man.''

U.N. REPORTS REBELS NOW HOLD 300 OF ITS TROOPS IN SIERRA LEONE
</HEADLINE>
  (DELETES dateline)  
(Eds.: Includes story budgeted earlier as SIERRA-LEONE-U.S.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN and JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rebels have taken more than 300 U.N. troops hostage in Sierra
Leone, U.N. and Clinton administration officials said Friday, and
some peacekeeping units have lost contact with their command posts.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,300-member U.N. force, composed mainly of African and
Indian troops, was rapidly losing confidence under the assault, a
Western diplomat reached by telephone in the capital of Freetown
said. He added that after the latest captures, on Thursday, the
entire mission, meant to secure the peace after eight years of
civil war, was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   He described the chances of an effective continuation of the
mission, one the most ambitious peacekeeping efforts by the United
Nations, as only ``50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks were underway in Freetown between several commanders of
the insurgent Revolutionary United Front and Western diplomats to
try and stop the fighting, the diplomat said. But it was unclear
what progress was made.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hostages was a contingent of about 200 Zambian
soldiers, a U.N. spokesman said. Their weapons were taken and they
were stripped of their clothes, this spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen armored vehicles belonging to the Zambians were
also confiscated and were now being driven by the rebels, according
to reports from the field. Another contingent of more than 100
Nigerian peacekeepers was stripped of weapons and then released,
said the spokesman, Fred Eckhart.
</P>
<P>
   Further undermining the morale of the U.N. effort,
parliamentarians in Kenya Friday called for the withdrawal of the
Kenyan contingent of the peace force after four of their soldiers
were missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers were also taken hostage by the hundreds during
the Bosnian war. In May 1995, Bosnian Serbs held more than 350
peacekeepers, some for several weeks, as insurance against air
strikes by NATO. Under a peace accord signed last July, the rebel
leader, Foday Sankoh, whose forces have terrorized the country with
a campaign of chopping off hands, feet and arms, was brought into a
new national government.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some U.S. officials questioned the wisdom of
bringing such a violent leader, who has become rich from plundering
Sierra Leone's diamond mines, under the government umbrella. It was
now becoming obvious, some officials said, that Sankoh was using
his new government position as a temporary breather before making
more war.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the assault by the rebels, who began their
operation on Tuesday, seemed very precise, several administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's troops _ assumed by the administration to number about
6,000, with many of them unemployed teen-agers _ chose a window of
opportunity just after many Nigerian troops had withdrawn from
Sierra Leone and before the U.N. force was up to full strength.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also took advantage of a U.N. force that appeared to
be ill-trained, easily intimidated and equipped with only light
infantry armor, administration officials said. Some of the troops
were not following elementary military rules such as securing the
perimeters of their bases, barracks and offices, one official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the field in the last few days showed that some
U.N. troops were so frightened by the reputation of the rebels that
they abandoned their vehicles as soon as they were stopped at a
roadblock by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Describing how the U.N. troops gave up so easily, the official
said: ``Some will say that's what you get by hiring third world
armies. But in Somalia we had the same with first world armies.''
This was a reference to U.S. forces who withdrew from Somalia in
the first year of the Clinton administration after 17 soldiers were
killed in a firefight.
</P>
<P>
   As the situation in Sierra Leone continued to deteriorate,
senior Clinton administration officials met at the White House to
assess options.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a senior State Department official said that a team
of British military experts would arrive in Sierra Leone on
Saturday to review the U.N. operation from ``top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are continuing to do is look very carefully at whether
the forces there and the reinforcements that can be brought in can
have a useful effect,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has said it is considering a request from the
United Nations to provide transport planes to ferry some of the
3,000 Jordanian, Bengladeshi and Indian troops still scheduled to
go to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   There was absolutely no consideration of sending U.S. soldiers,
officials said. In similar situations in the past, though, the use
of U.S. transport planes has required U.S. troops to help secure
the airport to ensure that the aircraft and military personnel
involved do not come under attack.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, Washington was asking regional leaders,
including the president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, to put
pressure on Sankoh to stand by the peace agreement of last July,
officials said. The State Department also asked the Rev. Jesse
Jackson to ask President Charles Taylor of Liberia to call for the
rebel leader, who is a colleague, to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, diplomats described how the Zambian
convoy of 208 soldiers, who had arrived in Sierra Leone only two
days earlier, was overwhelmed, and lost its 13 armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were dispatched Thursday from Lungi, a port north of
Freetown, to reinforce beleaguered peacekeeping troops at Makeni in
the northern hinterland. But they lost radio contact with the U.N.
headquarters in the capital. The Zambians passed through two rebel
checkpoints and then at a third found themselves boxed in by a
force of heavily armed guerrillas. The convoy's commander, faced
with a battle that he felt he was sure to lose, negotiated a
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 208 Zambian soldiers, an estimated 110 other
U. N. peacekeepers, military observers and civilian workers are
being held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandate authorized by the Security Council for Sierra
Leone, the peacekeepers may defend themselves but are not equipped
for conventional combat.
</P>
<P>
   A former U.S. assistant secretary for Africa, Henry J. Cohen,
said Friday that the peacekeepers should have been more robustly
equipped, including with artillery, to be able to give a ``show of
strength.'' Cohen said the peacekeeping force now faced two
options: ``appease and lose face'' or use strong force against the
rebels, including helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that if the U.N. force pulled out as it had in
Somalia in 1993 and several years later in Rwanda, then Sankoh's
forces would ``sweep into power.''

</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, the immediate task, according to the Western
diplomat in Freetown, was to see what ``you can do for the
battalions that are not affected. The key is to get the rebels to
turn it off and to resolve some of the U.N. problems of
organization and communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyans, who were the first target of the rebels, appeared
to have encountered rebels who were ``more numerous, more
committed.'' But why the Kenyan unit unraveled so quickly was not
clear, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said the peacekeepers were surrounded in
unfamiliar terrain by armed adversaries. ``They're authorized to
defend themselves but they're not required to fight to the last
man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some embassies in Freetown began evacuating dependents and
nonessential people. More than 100 workers for nongovernment relief
organizations were also reportedly been evacuated by U.N.
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed concern in Paris on
Thursday that the deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone might
have a ripple effect in making member countries hesitate to
contribute troops to a more complex peacekeeping operation being
assembled for Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The efforts right now are political in nature: to get anybody
who has influence on Foday Sankoh to convince him to come back into
compliance with the peace agreement,'' Eckhard said Friday. ``If
that fails, I don't want to speculate what could happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leader, who remains at his residence in Freetown,
continued to deny Friday that his fighters have taken any U.N.
peacekeepers hostage, asserting that they must have gotten lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here was that there are people missing in the
area because they are not familiar with the terrain, so I ordered
my commanders to try and search for them,'' Sankoh said, according
to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Four U.N. helicopter gunships were supposed to have arrived last
month, the diplomat said, but as of several days ago had still not
shown up. Whether the gunships would have been useful in the clash
between the Kenyans and the rebels or the Zambians or the rebels
was an open question, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rather indiscriminate,'' the diplomat said of the
helicopters. ``As long as U.N. troops are with rebels I'd be more
cautious than sending up gunships to do their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the options being discussed at the State Department in
the last several days has been charging Sankoh with war crimes and
trying to remove him from the scene, several officials said. But
this seemed an unlikely outcome, especially while Sankoh's forces
controlled U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said they were concerned that if Sankoh was
removed, the rebel group would become even less manageable because
it would fall into the hands of a number of disparate commanders.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the peace accords of last summer, Sankoh was given a
position as head of a commission designed to control the flow of
illegal diamond exports from Sierra Leone. The U.S. contributed $1
million to setting up the commission, an administration official
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Free of the illness that sapped his energy and
ultimately his life, Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor's body was
returned to St. Patrick's Cathedral on Friday, beginning a final
farewell to the eloquent, unswerving archbishop of New York from
the millions of Roman Catholics he led.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral's great double doors were thrown open for the
arrival at 4 p.m., as a solemn procession of seminarians, priests,
nuns and auxiliary bishops, led by altar boys bearing the
archbishopric cross, marched toward the mahogany coffin that held
the cardinal's body.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet incense floated over the coffin and rose toward the
heavens, as the faithful believe that the cardinal's soul now does.
In a greeting, Bishop Patrick J. Sheridan, the cardinal's vicar
general, who had been his right-hand man, sprinkled holy water over
the bier of his friend of many years and then covered it with a
white funeral pall _ both acts reminiscent of baptism.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing death was near, the cardinal had said his formal
goodbyes several times since he underwent surgery for a brain tumor
last August: in a note to his fellow bishops last fall, when he
visited the pope in February, and in a letter to the 875 or so
priests of his archdiocese in the same month.
</P>
<P>
   But those messages seemed powerless to counter the quiet grief
as the cardinal's coffin glided past the pews for the last time,
carried on the shoulders of sad-eyed men wearing dark gray gloves.
</P>
<P>
   The mourners in the pews sang a processional hymn as they
watched the cardinal's coffin move past them. ``He who is throned
in heaven, takes up his dwelling place,'' they sang. ``No sound is
heard of weeping, for pain and sorrow cease. And sin shall reign no
longer, but love and joy and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith McGowan, 80, prayed the rosary as she waited in the pews,
and said she felt the sadness welling inside her throughout the
half-hour ceremony. ``He was such a beautiful man,'' said McGowan,
who met the cardinal last year. ``So gentle speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Ohuche, 28, from Harlem, was sitting in one of the last
pews, a black lace scarf falling over her face. She prayed for
mercy for O'Connor as his soul reached judgment. ``I'm grateful to
God for all the things the cardinal has done for us,'' she said.
``He was a strong defender of the Holy Father.''
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, Sheridan spoke of O'Connor not only as his bishop
but as ``my brother and my friend.'' He said that next door to the
cardinal's spare bedroom in his Madison Avenue residence was a
small private chapel. And on the other side of the chapel was
Sheridan's room. He said the two men often joked that ``The only
one who ever came between us was Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever O'Connor's far-flung travels took him, Sheridan added,
the cardinal always made sure he was home by Saturday night, so he
could celebrate the 10:15 Mass at St. Patrick's the following
morning. ``His work is done, and now he is home,'' Sheridan said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As pallbearers removed the top of the cardinal's coffin to begin
the public viewing, those in the pews sang ``Morning Has Broken,''
a hymn to earth's capacity for renewal and rebirth, made famous by
Cat Stevens. The cardinal had specifically requested that the song
be sung at the moment New Yorkers would view his body for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the music had ended, the cardinal could be seen
dressed as he would be if he were about to celebrate Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He wore the scarlet cassock of the cardinal, covered by a white
flowing gown, or alb. Over his alb was the cardinal's chasuble, and
flowing in a line down the front and back of the chasuble was his
white woolen pallium, the symbol of his archbishop's office. Around
his neck the cardinal wore a stole, the symbol of the priesthood,
and the pectoral archbishopric cross, with its double crossbeams.
In his hands he clasped a rosary.

 &HT;    Schilling shoulders Phillies' aspirations
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An hour before Friday's game, Philadelphia pitcher
Curt Schilling stretched carefully in front of the Phillies'
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Forty feet away, Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga was
approached by Hal McRae, Philadelphia's hitting instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's the swing going?'' McRae asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too good,'' Galarraga replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' McRae said with a grin, ``you better get it (Friday)
because you won't (today).''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies coach was referring to Schilling, who has nearly
fully recovered from a shoulder injury that caused the former
All-Star to miss part of the 1999 season and the first 23 games
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (0-1, 6.00 ERA) will make his second start of the
season when he faces the Braves at 7:10 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've leaned on (Schilling) more than what has been fair the
last couple of years,'' Philadelphia manager Terry Francona said.
``Now that we have him back in the rotation, it's nice. We've
really got a chance to have a pretty respectable rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling returned to the mound last week against the St. Louis
Cardinals, striking out eight batters over the first five innings,
including Mark McGwire twice. However, McGwire launched a two-run
homer for a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to be back out there again, but we lost,''
Schilling said. He had the velocity on his fastballs, but the
off-speed pitches weren't as sharp. Most important, the pitcher
said his shoulder felt fine after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back with good velocity. He's not rehabbing any more;
he is pitching and that is good,'' Francona said.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox is aware of Schilling's capabilities,
selecting the right-hander for the All-Star Game in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can tell you about Curt Schilling is that he
had been one of the horses in the National League for a long time
now,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   I wish he wasn't pitching against us, but I am glad his arm is
back. He can really pitch, he's outstanding.''

FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATE EX-CIA DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: 3 new graphs, tones down ``complete reversal'' in 2nd graf;
picks up ``She decided...'') 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department and the FBI have begun a
criminal investigation to determine whether former CIA Director
John M. Deutch mishandled classified material by placing it on
unsecure computers in his home, government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which amounts to a change of course by the
Justice Department, is the result of an internal review of the case
ordered in February by Attorney General Janet Reno, following
criticism of the CIA's handling of the case and of her initial
decision not to prosecute Deutch for the security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ordered the new inquiry to determine whether her initial
decision not to prosecute him was in error and whether he should
now face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   She decided against prosecution last year, officials said,
without ordering any investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is the result of an internal review of the
case ordered earlier this year by Reno.
</P>
<P>
   For the new criminal investigation, officials said, the Justice
Department has assigned a prosecutor to work directly with FBI
agents. They are pursuing an inquiry that focuses on whether Deutch
should face criminal charges for having retained highly classified
information on his unsecured home computers while he was leading
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, officials said, a special White House intelligence
panel presented President Clinton with a toughly worded report that
is critical of current and former CIA officials for failing to
follow through adequately on the evidence against Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board was presented to Clinton personally earlier this week by the
board's chairman, former Sen. Warren Rudman.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings, they said, were similar to those of the
CIA's inspector general, who also found that senior CIA officials
failed to aggressively investigate Deutch when the computer lapses
were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential board's findings remain classified,
officials described its report as sharply critical of the roles
played by several of the agency's most senior officials, including
some who had worked closely with Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Deutch's lawyer were not immediately returned Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the board's report was particularly critical
of the roles played in the investigation by the former CIA
executive director, Nora Slatkin, and the former CIA general
counsel, Michael O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin comes in for the heaviest criticism, officials said,
because she was effectively in charge of the CIA's botched initial
investigation. Both Slatkin and O'Neil had been brought to the CIA
by Deutch and had close relationships with him.
</P>
<P>
   Others cited in the report include former CIA Inspector General
Frederick Hitz and Richard Calder, now the CIA's deputy director
for administration. Hitz began the inspector general's
investigation of the Deutch matter but it was completed last year
by his successor, L. Britt Snider. The presidential board also
criticized CIA Director George Tenet for allowing Slatkin to take
charge of the Deutch investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential board began its review of the way the CIA
handled the Deutch matter at the request of Air Force Gen. John A.
Gordon, deputy director of the CIA, who was dissatisfied with the
CIA's own efforts to review the matter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has received a copy of the presidential board's report
and will now try to determine whether any further disciplinary
action is required at the CIA against those involved in the Deutch
case.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the Deutch case has been highly controversial
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The case began just as Deutch was leaving office in December
1996, when an agency computer security specialist discovered that
Deutch had placed large volumes of classified material on unsecure
computers in his home, including information about some of the
government's most sensitive covert operations.
</P>
<P>
   The material included detailed personal journals about Deutch's
activities at the CIA and memos prepared for Clinton. Placing
classified material on these unsecure computers represented
potential violations of both agency rules and federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the classified material was detected, Deutch
deleted more than 1,000 files from his personal computers,
according to the inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's security staff began a probe of the matter, but before
long it bogged down, and some CIA security officials became
convinced that senior CIA officials were attempting to protect
Deutch from a thorough investigation. The security staff wrote a
report on its investigation in 1997 without ever questioning
Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   No action was taken against Deutch for more than a year, when
the CIA's inspector general was told by an agency employee that the
earlier investigation had not been handled properly. Until the CIA
inspector general launched his own investigation in early 1998,
Tenet had not taken any action to reprimand Deutch or discipline
any other current or former CIA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet had said there was never any attempt by anyone at the CIA
to constrain the internal inquiry into the Deutch matter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's inspector general notified the Justice Department of
the Deutch matter in 1998. The delay in notifying the Justice
Department about the case allowed a one-year time limit on
appointing an independent counsel to lapse, according to the
inspector general's report. The independent counsel act was still
in effect at the time. ``Application of the Independent Counsel
statute was not adequately considered'' by CIA officials handling
the case, the report says. ``Given their failure to report to the
Department of Justice on a timely basis, this in effect avoided the
potential application of the Independent Counsel statute.''
</P>
<P>
   But in April 1999, Reno decided not to prosecute Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Officials now say that the Justice Department decided not to
prosecute without any FBI investigation of the matter. The decision
to decline prosecution was also made before the CIA's inspector
general had issued its report on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, after the inspector general finally issued his
classified report on Deutch's actions, Tenet, the CIA director,
suspended Deutch's CIA security clearances. At the time, Deutch
issued a statement apologizing for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report recommended that a special CIA
accountability review planel be created to examine whether Tenet
and other top CIA officials properly handled the agency's internal
investigation. That accountability review panel issued a classified
report earlier, and presented it to Gordon for use in determining
disciplinary action. But officials said Gordon was not pleased with
the accountability review panel's report, apparently because it was
too soft on agency officials involved in the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Gordon asked the presidential board to conduct an
independent review. The presidential board interviewed Deutch
during its review of the matter, officials said. The White House
has rejected a request from the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence for a copy of the presidential board's report, but
Rudman has briefed the committee on his findings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the government's handling of the Deutch case have
tried to draw a comparison between the gentleness of it and the
harsher treatment of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos scientist who has
been indicted on charges of downloading and copying files
containing nuclear secrets with the intention of aiding a foreign
country and damaging national security.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has dismissed the comparison, telling a Senate panel that
while Mr. Deutch was ''sloppy'' in his handling of classified
documents, there was no evidence that he had intended to aid a
foreign country by handing over American secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think there is a great difference in the two
cases,'' Tenet said. ''In both cases there was a referral made to
the Department of Justice. In one case, the Department of Justice
declined any action, in the case of the director. In the case of
Wen Ho Lee, there is an indictment pending.''

 &HT;    For Bodine, return to racing is a victory in itself
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Geoffrey Bodine won't be on the pole for
tonight's Pontiac Excitement 400. No bulletin there: That spot went
to Rusty Wallace in the No. 2 Ford with a top lap of 124.740 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the bigger news: Bodine will be starting.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he qualified fourth (124.161 mph) makes his
comeback from the fiery truck crash at Daytona three months ago all
the more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine returns to Winston Cup racing tonight for the first time
since February when his truck flipped end over end, nearly
disintegrating in a ball of fire. He broke a wrist, injured his
back and missed the first 10 races of the season while three
drivers substituted in the No. 60 Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst accident of Bodine's 538-race Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in some accidents where I thought I would kill
myself,'' Bodine said. ``There was a time at Watkins Glen at the
end of the back straightaway when my brake rotor blew up. I thought
I was going to hit a tree. I thought I was going to kill myself
that day. I had some time to think about it so it was real scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This accident happened quickly and I thought it was going to
be a normal accident. I had no idea it was going to be as dramatic
as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine, 51, said he has no fear returning to the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no apprehension whatsoever,'' he said. ``It might be
normal to have some apprehension, but racers aren't normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine tested here a couple of weeks ago with Ken Schrader and
Ward Burton. ``We ran faster than both of them,'' he said. ``It was
a little uncomfortable getting in the car with my back brace on,
but once I fandangled my way into the car, I was 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll wear the back brace in the car tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback adds another chapter to Bodine's story of the
successful underdog. He came into the sport as an outsider from New
York, was the 1982 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year, bailed out of a
brief try as an owner-driver and was fortunate to hook up with Joe
Bessey.
</P>
<P>
   He's won 18 races in his career, none in four years and 106
starts. Now his story is one of courage and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a remarkable story that I'm here, and I'm very
fortunate and thankful for that,'' Bodine said. ``It certainly
wasn't luck that I survived. It was the grace of God that saved me.

U.N. REPORTS REBELS NOW HOLD 300 OF ITS TROOPS IN SIERRA LEONE
</HEADLINE>
  (REVERSES byline)  
(Eds.: Includes story budgeted earlier as SIERRA-LEONE-U.S.) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   and CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rebels have taken more than 300 U.N. troops hostage in Sierra
Leone, U.N. and Clinton administration officials said Friday, and
some peacekeeping units have lost contact with their command posts.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,300-member U.N. force, composed mainly of African and
Indian troops, was rapidly losing confidence under the assault, a
Western diplomat reached by telephone in the capital of Freetown
said. He added that after the latest captures, on Thursday, the
entire mission, meant to secure the peace after eight years of
civil war, was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   He described the chances of an effective continuation of the
mission, one the most ambitious peacekeeping efforts by the United
Nations, as only ``50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks were underway in Freetown between several commanders of
the insurgent Revolutionary United Front and Western diplomats to
try and stop the fighting, the diplomat said. But it was unclear
what progress was made.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hostages was a contingent of about 200 Zambian
soldiers, a U.N. spokesman said. Their weapons were taken and they
were stripped of their clothes, this spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen armored vehicles belonging to the Zambians were
also confiscated and were now being driven by the rebels, according
to reports from the field. Another contingent of more than 100
Nigerian peacekeepers was stripped of weapons and then released,
said the spokesman, Fred Eckhart.
</P>
<P>
   Further undermining the morale of the U.N. effort,
parliamentarians in Kenya Friday called for the withdrawal of the
Kenyan contingent of the peace force after four of their soldiers
were missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers were also taken hostage by the hundreds during
the Bosnian war. In May 1995, Bosnian Serbs held more than 350
peacekeepers, some for several weeks, as insurance against air
strikes by NATO. Under a peace accord signed last July, the rebel
leader, Foday Sankoh, whose forces have terrorized the country with
a campaign of chopping off hands, feet and arms, was brought into a
new national government.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some U.S. officials questioned the wisdom of
bringing such a violent leader, who has become rich from plundering
Sierra Leone's diamond mines, under the government umbrella. It was
now becoming obvious, some officials said, that Sankoh was using
his new government position as a temporary breather before making
more war.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the assault by the rebels, who began their
operation on Tuesday, seemed very precise, several administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's troops _ assumed by the administration to number about
6,000, with many of them unemployed teen-agers _ chose a window of
opportunity just after many Nigerian troops had withdrawn from
Sierra Leone and before the U.N. force was up to full strength.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also took advantage of a U.N. force that appeared to
be ill-trained, easily intimidated and equipped with only light
infantry armor, administration officials said. Some of the troops
were not following elementary military rules such as securing the
perimeters of their bases, barracks and offices, one official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the field in the last few days showed that some
U.N. troops were so frightened by the reputation of the rebels that
they abandoned their vehicles as soon as they were stopped at a
roadblock by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Describing how the U.N. troops gave up so easily, the official
said: ``Some will say that's what you get by hiring third world
armies. But in Somalia we had the same with first world armies.''
This was a reference to U.S. forces who withdrew from Somalia in
the first year of the Clinton administration after 17 soldiers were
killed in a firefight.
</P>
<P>
   As the situation in Sierra Leone continued to deteriorate,
senior Clinton administration officials met at the White House to
assess options.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a senior State Department official said that a team
of British military experts would arrive in Sierra Leone on
Saturday to review the U.N. operation from ``top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are continuing to do is look very carefully at whether
the forces there and the reinforcements that can be brought in can
have a useful effect,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has said it is considering a request from the
United Nations to provide transport planes to ferry some of the
3,000 Jordanian, Bengladeshi and Indian troops still scheduled to
go to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   There was absolutely no consideration of sending U.S. soldiers,
officials said. In similar situations in the past, though, the use
of U.S. transport planes has required U.S. troops to help secure
the airport to ensure that the aircraft and military personnel
involved do not come under attack.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, Washington was asking regional leaders,
including the president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, to put
pressure on Sankoh to stand by the peace agreement of last July,
officials said. The State Department also asked the Rev. Jesse
Jackson to ask President Charles Taylor of Liberia to call for the
rebel leader, who is a colleague, to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, diplomats described how the Zambian
convoy of 208 soldiers, who had arrived in Sierra Leone only two
days earlier, was overwhelmed, and lost its 13 armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were dispatched Thursday from Lungi, a port north of
Freetown, to reinforce beleaguered peacekeeping troops at Makeni in
the northern hinterland. But they lost radio contact with the U.N.
headquarters in the capital. The Zambians passed through two rebel
checkpoints and then at a third found themselves boxed in by a
force of heavily armed guerrillas. The convoy's commander, faced
with a battle that he felt he was sure to lose, negotiated a
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 208 Zambian soldiers, an estimated 110 other
U. N. peacekeepers, military observers and civilian workers are
being held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandate authorized by the Security Council for Sierra
Leone, the peacekeepers may defend themselves but are not equipped
for conventional combat.
</P>
<P>
   A former U.S. assistant secretary for Africa, Henry J. Cohen,
said Friday that the peacekeepers should have been more robustly
equipped, including with artillery, to be able to give a ``show of
strength.'' Cohen said the peacekeeping force now faced two
options: ``appease and lose face'' or use strong force against the
rebels, including helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that if the U.N. force pulled out as it had in
Somalia in 1993 and several years later in Rwanda, then Sankoh's
forces would ``sweep into power.''

</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, the immediate task, according to the Western
diplomat in Freetown, was to see what ``you can do for the
battalions that are not affected. The key is to get the rebels to
turn it off and to resolve some of the U.N. problems of
organization and communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyans, who were the first target of the rebels, appeared
to have encountered rebels who were ``more numerous, more
committed.'' But why the Kenyan unit unraveled so quickly was not
clear, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said the peacekeepers were surrounded in
unfamiliar terrain by armed adversaries. ``They're authorized to
defend themselves but they're not required to fight to the last
man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some embassies in Freetown began evacuating dependents and
nonessential people. More than 100 workers for nongovernment relief
organizations were also reportedly been evacuated by U.N.
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed concern in Paris on
Thursday that the deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone might
have a ripple effect in making member countries hesitate to
contribute troops to a more complex peacekeeping operation being
assembled for Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The efforts right now are political in nature: to get anybody
who has influence on Foday Sankoh to convince him to come back into
compliance with the peace agreement,'' Eckhard said Friday. ``If
that fails, I don't want to speculate what could happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leader, who remains at his residence in Freetown,
continued to deny Friday that his fighters have taken any U.N.
peacekeepers hostage, asserting that they must have gotten lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here was that there are people missing in the
area because they are not familiar with the terrain, so I ordered
my commanders to try and search for them,'' Sankoh said, according
to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Four U.N. helicopter gunships were supposed to have arrived last
month, the diplomat said, but as of several days ago had still not
shown up. Whether the gunships would have been useful in the clash
between the Kenyans and the rebels or the Zambians or the rebels
was an open question, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rather indiscriminate,'' the diplomat said of the
helicopters. ``As long as U.N. troops are with rebels I'd be more
cautious than sending up gunships to do their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the options being discussed at the State Department in
the last several days has been charging Sankoh with war crimes and
trying to remove him from the scene, several officials said. But
this seemed an unlikely outcome, especially while Sankoh's forces
controlled U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said they were concerned that if Sankoh was
removed, the rebel group would become even less manageable because
it would fall into the hands of a number of disparate commanders.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the peace accords of last summer, Sankoh was given a
position as head of a commission designed to control the flow of
illegal diamond exports from Sierra Leone. The U.S. contributed $1
million to setting up the commission, an administration official
said.

ISRAELI SPY INQUIRY FINDS NOTHING, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal authorities conducted a highly
classified espionage investigation into whether Israeli
intelligence agents used a software company in Missouri to
intercept telephone conversations from the White House, the State
Department and other agencies, government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The counterintelligence inquiry did not find evidence that
government telephone systems were penetrated, the officials said.
The investigation focused on Amdocs Corp., a publicly traded
corporation founded by Israelis, but failed to unearth evidence
that anyone at the company or connected to it had tried to listen
to government communications illegally, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just weren't any facts to support a penetration,''
said a government official who closely followed the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the inquiry emerged Friday after Insight
Magazine, which is published by The Washington Times, reported that
the investigation had uncovered a security breach in the White
House telephone system. Other news organizations quickly spread the
story over their Web sites, but the accusation of a major espionage
problem collapsed almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials denied the account, and their comments
were immediately followed by denials from representatives of other
intelligence, national security and law-enforcement agencies. These
officials confirmed that an inquiry had been carried out, but said
that it had led nowhere and was currently inactive, although as one
official put it, ``You can never say `never' in these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials also denied that the Israeli government had
intercepted phone conversations of U.S. officials. A spokesman for
the Israeli Embassy was quoted by The Associated Press as saying,
``I don't listen even to the phone conversations of my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel does not spy on the United States,'' the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ginsburg, a spokesman for Amdocs, said Friday night that the
company was unaware of any FBI investigation ``until we heard about
it from reporters last evening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that,'' Ginsburg said, ``we'd welcome the opportunity
to work with any investigators or any investigation from any kind.
We have not been contacted by the FBI or any other government
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began several years ago as an offshoot from
another inquiry at the State Department. That inquiry prompted
law-enforcement and intelligence officials to suspect that Israeli
spies might be capable of using technology that was so
sophisticated that they could overhear conversations of specific
U.S. officials in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation shifted to the White House in September 1998
when Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, reported in
his impeachment referral to Congress that the Israelis might have
listened to amorous conversations between President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky. The White House and the Israelis dismissed the
reports.

<P>
   In using office telephones, top officials conduct conversations
over unsecure phones, which can be tapped by outsiders, and secure
phones that use sophisticated electronic scrambling techniques to
deter eavesdropping. Most conversations are held over open phones,
which were the ones that the authorities feared might have been
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Amdocs is the world's largest telecommunications billing
services company, providing software that allows phone companies to
prepare bills for millions of customers.

U.S. JOBLESS RATE DROPS BELOW 4 PERCENT

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States' unemployment rate fell below 4 percent in
April for the first time in 30 years, the Labor Department
announced Friday, as employers hired, among others, tens of
thousands of census takers, restaurant employees and temporary
workers in a boom that showed no signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was little evidence in the employment numbers _ a
total of 340,000 new jobs last month and a jobless rate of 3.9
percent _ that the 9-year-old expansion, the longest period of
uninterrupted growth in U.S. history, might be weakening in
response to the Federal Reserve Board's attempt to slow the economy
by raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you look, you see the supply of people available
for work continuing to shrink pretty rapidly,'' said John
Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. ``Although there
is not much pressure yet on companies to raise prices, the
inflation rate has begun to creep up and the Fed must think about
where we will be a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy may be in its best shape since the 1960s, but the
Fed's great fear, often expressed by its chairman, Alan Greenspan,
is that job shortages will eventually give workers enough
bargaining power to push up labor costs ahead of productivity
gains.
</P>
<P>
   While wage gains remained relatively modest and many of the
latest jobs _ including those created by the Census Bureau _ are
temporary, employers may still raise prices because of the higher
costs resulting from the tight labor market _ or simply because the
strong economy allows them to.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted as if the Fed would be successful in
containing any inflationary threat, even if that meant it would
have to be more aggressive in raising interest rates. Stock prices
shot up, instead of tanking, as they often do in reaction to a
strong employment report. The Dow Jones industrial average gained
more than 165 points to close at 10,577.86, the Nasdaq rose 2.6
percent and bond yields edged up only modestly.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, the consensus among analysts and brokers was
that the Fed's policy-makers would probably raise the short-term
interest rates that it controls by one-quarter of a percentage
point to 6.25 at their May 16 meeting. That would be the sixth such
increase since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts now expect a half-percentage-point increase in
rates in May, with more increases likely to follow later. Wall
Street's exuberance, however, seemed to reflect a view that half a
percentage point in midmonth should be enough to finally make a
dent in the robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``God only knows why the markets are doing what they are
doing,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI.
``All I can figure is that they figure the Fed is going to do a
half-point and that will be it. Get the tightening over, and they
can go back to business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wyss and other economists noted that a booming stock
market complicates the Fed's task by encouraging the all-out
consumer spending that has kept the economy booming. ``The stock
market certainly did not help the Fed out,'' Youngdahl said,
referring to Friday's jump.
</P>
<P>
   April's employment report was striking for the evidence it
offered that the nation's pool of people still available for hire
is drying up fast. That pool shrank by 426,000 to under 9.9 million
last month, the lowest level since the Labor Department began to
track it in 1994. Greenspan pays particular attention to this
statistic because with fewer people available, existing workers _
in theory at least _ are in a better position to demand and receive
strong wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   With the unemployment rate falling from 4.1 percent to 3.9
percent _ the lowest since January 1970 _ the pool now consists of
5.5 million people labeled as officially unemployed because they
are actively looking for jobs, and 4.4 million others who tell
Labor Department surveyors that they want to work but are not
currently looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly some evidence of accelerating wages and
prices,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic
Policy Institute, noting that labor costs, by several measures, are
growing at an annual rate of at least 3.6 percent, and the consumer
price index is rising at a similar pace.
</P>
<P>
   But he wondered whether wages were pushing prices, or the other
way around. ``If you track this month to month,'' he said, ``it
looks more like tight labor markets are allowing workers to press
for wage gains to keep up with prices that reflect the rising cost
of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause and effect, the average hourly wage of
production workers rose 6 cents last month, to $13.64, up 3.6
percent over the past 12 months. That is roughly in line with the
gains recorded month after month for more than a year. But broader
measures, covering benefits as well as wages, show a recent jump in
what companies pay for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the Clinton administration's concern that an overly
aggressive Fed could damage the economy in an election year, Alexis
Herman, the secretary of labor, argued that labor productivity is
rising quickly enough to offset rising wages. ``In the midst of
this debate over interest rates,'' she said, ``we must keep the
focus on the nation's strong productivity to absorb any pressure on
wages.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   President Clinton, pointing to the social benefits of a strong
economy, called attention to ``the lowest unemployment rate for
blacks and Hispanics ever recorded.'' For Hispanics, unemployment
dropped to 5.4 percent from 6.3 percent in March, and for blacks
the rate edged down to 7.2 percent from 7.3 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   While spread broadly across business and government, job
creation was particularly strong at the Census Bureau, which added
73,000 part-time census takers last month on top of the 115,000
added in March. But that hiring will taper off quickly. To count
the population, the bureau has hired 500,000 workers this year and
now is up to full strength, a spokesman for the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the employment gains of 340,000, while strong, were
down from an even stronger 458,000 advance in March. But job
creation in the private sector remains robust, averaging 222,000 a
month since January, up from 198,000 a month last year. Total
employment rose to 131.1 million in April.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants made the the biggest contribution, adding 80,000
jobs, while temporary-help agencies added 46,000 jobs. ``Companies
cannot find people, so they turn to the temp agencies, which are
luring the elderly back into the work force, kids into part-time
work and housewives into work,'' Wyss said.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of the population now holding jobs edged up last
month to a record 64.9 percent, from 64.7 percent in March. Only
one industry lost ground: Employment in construction fell by 55,000
after having risen by 90,000 the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers also increased their rolls, but by only 11,000
jobs, although the work week in manufacturing rose by nearly half
an hour, and overtime pay also rose.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ For Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston,
Cardinal John O'Connor was a friend to whom he spoke nearly every
day by telephone, a rare colleague with whom he could share the
distinctive and unusual concerns that come with being one of the
most public figures in the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could share honestly what we were facing,'' said Cardinal
Law, in an interview at a downtown hotel here this evening, three
days before he was to give the homily at O'Connor's funeral Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Law said he had flown to New York to be with O'Connor as the
cardinal lay dying Wednesday, and spent the day at his bedside,
praying with a small group of his friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Law came to Chicago on Friday to participate in a long-planned
gathering of American cardinals, an occasion made poignant by the
death of a man so well known to each of the church leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the annual American Cardinals Dinner, an event
held to benefit student scholarships to the Catholic University of
America in Washington. In the brief interval since O'Connor's
death, the university's president, the Rev. David M. O'Connell,
dedicated the event to the cardinal's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Eight cardinals have come to the event, six of them Americans,
and one of them Irish. The eighth is Cardinal Pio Laghi, a man
deeply familiar with the United States and its hierarchy through
his service as the Vatican's apostolic delegate to the American
church in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In individual interviews, several cardinals said O'Connor had
helped them with suggestions or ideas about their roles as public
figures and managers of archdioceses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I became archbishop of Chicago,'' said Cardinal Francis
George, who was appointed to that position by Pope John Paul II in
1997, ``he gave me some very good advice, just sharing it, as an
older brother would.'' Although he did not specify what precisely
O'Connor told him, George said, ``I looked to him to give me some
clues as to how you handle the public role.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles had been head of the
diocese in Fresno, Calif., for several years before O'Connor was
appointed to his first diocesan position. Mahony became Los
Angeles' archbishop a year after O'Connor became archbishop of New
York. Outside of their work on issues at the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, the two found common ground in sharing their
concerns as administrators of vast, urban jurisdictions. They would
sometimes discuss how to raise money to keep their inner-city
Catholic schools open and available to the children of poorer
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the insights he gave me,'' Mahony said, ``which I never
thought of, was to utilize the corporate community'' in finding
supporters for inner-city Catholic schools. Corporations tended to
donate to colleges, but, said Mahony, ``you can't get anybody into
college unless they finish high school.''
</P>
<P>
   The two cardinals also talked about books. ``We would try to
remain as current as we could'' with theological publications,
Mahony said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cardinals who came here said they had known Cardinal
O'Connor for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him 20 years ago,'' said Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua,
archbishop of Philadelphia, recalling a time before he and O'Connor
were appointed to their respective archdioceses. Back then, said
Bevilacqua, a Brooklyn native, O'Connor used to take him to dinner
at an Italian restaurant in Manhattan that both of them enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them were attending a bishops' meeting in 1983,
Bevilacqua said, when O'Connor came over and announced, with some
surprise, it seemed, that Laghi had just informed him that the
Vatican had picked him to be the next bishop of Scranton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, congratulations,'' Bevilacqua said. (Scranton turned
out to be but a brief stop for O'Connor, as the pope appointed him
archbishop of New York the next year.)
</P>
<P>
   As for Law, he said he came to New York to visit O'Connor just
after O'Connor had undergone his surgery late last summer for
removal of a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him how he felt,'' Law said, ``how he was dealing with
it, because it was obvious what the course of that was going to
be.'' He said that O'Connor replied that he felt a ``great peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I spoke with him was the Friday before he
died,'' Law said. ``We had a great youth event, and I asked him for
his prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he received a call from O'Connor's staff on Wednesday
morning, telling him that the cardinal's health was deteriorating.
``I cleared off my schedule and flew to New York and spent the day
with him,'' Law said. ``I led the prayers for the dying. We went
through them twice. We finished with them just as he died.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CHARACTERS IN THE ANNUAL DERBY DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ If you love horses, the smells, the sights and
the sounds never get old; if you love the Kentucky Derby, the
pre-race excitement never loses its electricity. At 6 a.m. Friday,
the darkness at Churchill Downs was defined by shadows, with
grooms, trainers and riders moving in a haphazard choreography of
chores in the refreshing chill of spring air. Through the muddy
maze of walkways and stables, Wayne Kotcamp led the way.
</P>
<P>
   He was taking part in a Derby ritual, the first hours of the
Kentucky Oaks Day races, the elaborate prelude to the Kentucky
Derby. As such, Kotcamp was one of hundreds of thousands of
characters in the Derby drama.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, he and his wife, Eileen, will meet with
friends by 10 and have brunch by 10:30. Then they'll proceed to
Churchill Downs and watch the first Kentucky Derby of the
millennium. Kotcamp is an orthopedic surgeon by training, the owner
of a horse by choice. But not a high-stakes owner. On the drive
over to the track Friday, he talked about the high cost of
maintaining a horse and wisely advised: ``You can't own racehorses
and have children.''
</P>
<P>
   I reminded him that he raised four children. ``I was an
orthopedic surgeon,'' he said, by way of explaining how he defied
his own advice. ``A hard-working orthopedic surgeon.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two main attractions in Louisville _ the Ohio River
and the horses. For Kotcamp, who was born in Greenup, Ky., in 1928,
the track has been an emotional outlet much more than a succession
of financial windfalls. As such, the pursuit of the ultimate horse
is really background music for relationships forged over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The first person to greet Kotcamp Friday was Robbie O'Connor,
who trains Kotcamp's horse, Divet. O'Connor's primary client is Jim
Bohanon, but his relationship with Kotcamp has deep roots. Kotcamp
owned horses with O'Connor's father, a psychiatrist, and has known
the son since he was a teen-ager. O'Connor said that the track was
his second home growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the track a lot with my dad,'' he said. ``That was
our quality time. They had an old place, an old track that raced at
night. We'd go out there in the evening and watch races. So I got
kind of smitten by the bug.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of college, O'Connor dropped out of school to
make the track his life. He made up his mind to leave after a trip
to New Orleans. He emptied his bank account, put $400 aside for
expenses and bet $1,600 on a horse that his mentor, the trainer
Billy Ashenbrener, felt had potential. ``I got back $16,000,''
O'Connor said. ``I didn't want to be a doctor anymore; I thought
I'd be a horse trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that once he left school and became an assistant
to Ashenbrener, his parents put him out of the house. O'Connor's
father owned horses but wouldn't give any to his son to train.
Kotcamp came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called his dad, asked if it was OK to give him one of my
horses,'' Kotcamp said. ``He said it was OK, and that's how we
started.'' O'Connor smiled. ``When I started doing well, picking up
clients, my dad gave me horses,'' he said. ``The rest of it's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, Kotcamp spotted Angel Montano and went over to
greet him. Montano is a trainer who arrived at Churchill Downs by
way of Mexico in 1956, when he was still a jockey. The track helped
put five children through college and provided Montano and his
family with a comfortable life. He celebrates each Derby with a
Saturday feast on the backside of the track. This year, he has
prepared 250 chickens, crawfish from New Orleans and barbecue ribs
from Evansville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to haul me off the racetrack,'' he said.
``I won't retire.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m., Kotcamp and I left the insular world of Derby racing
and headed for Memorial Park, about 10 minutes south of Churchill
Downs. The Rev. Al Sharpton, Dick Gregory and Martin Luther King
III had scheduled an Oaks Day rally to highlight accusations by
local African-American groups that Louisville police and other
local government bodies have racist hiring policies. They
intentionally chose Derby week for the protest. Gregory stood in
the hot sun, his face covered with a costume horse mask. ``I had to
take a walk this morning, someone suggested I'd be safe wearing
this,'' Gregory said. ``The police won't shoot a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotcamp, asked if he thought Louisville was being treated too
harshly, said of the protesters: ``Maybe they need to be harsh.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rally broke up, Kotcamp drove back through the bubbly
Derby crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisville, there's the track, but there's also the race of a
different color.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department and the FBI have begun a
criminal investigation to determine whether John M. Deutch, a
former director of the CIA, mishandled classified material by
placing it on unsecured computers in his home, government officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which amounts to a change of course by the
Justice Department, is the result of an internal review of the case
ordered in February by Attorney General Janet Reno after criticism
of the CIA's handling of the case and of her initial decision not
to prosecute Deutch for the security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ordered the new inquiry to determine whether her initial
decision not to prosecute him was in error and whether he should
now face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   She decided against prosecution last year, officials said,
without ordering any investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is the result of an internal review of the
case ordered earlier this year by Reno.
</P>
<P>
   For the new, criminal investigation, officials said, the Justice
Department has assigned a prosecutor to work directly with FBI
agents. They are pursuing an inquiry that focuses on whether Deutch
should face criminal charges for having retained highly classified
information on his unsecured home computers while he was leading
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, officials said, a special White House intelligence
panel presented President Clinton with a toughly worded report that
is critical of current and former CIA officials for failing to
follow through adequately on the evidence against Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board was presented to Clinton personally this week by the board's
chairman, former Sen. Warren B. Rudman.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings, they said, were similar to those of the
CIA's inspector general, who also found that senior CIA officials
had failed to aggressively investigate Deutch when the computer
lapses were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential board's findings remain classified,
officials described its report as sharply critical of the roles
played by several of the agency's most senior officials, including
some who had worked closely with Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Deutch's lawyer were not immediately returned Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Deutch has apologized for the security lapses.
Critics of the Justice Department have questioned what they
describe as the lenient treatment of Deutch in light of its highly
publicized prosecution of Wen Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos National
Laboratory scientist who has been charged with transferring and
copying secret nuclear data from the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the board's report was particularly critical
of the roles in the investigation played by the agency's former
executive director, Nora Slatkin, and the former general counsel,
Michael O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin receives the heaviest criticism, officials said, because
she was effectively in charge of the agency's botched initial
investigation. Slatkin and O'Neil had been brought to the CIA by
Deutch, and had close relationships with him.
</P>
<P>
   Others cited in the report included Frederick Hitz, the agency's
former inspector general, and Richard Calder, currently the deputy
director for administration. Hitz began the inspector general's
investigation of the Deutch matter but it was completed last year
by his successor, L. Britt Snider. The presidential board also
criticized the agency's current director, George Tenet, for
allowing Slatkin to take charge of the Deutch investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin, O'Neil and others criticized in the new report have
previously denied that they took any actions to impede the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential board began its review of how the CIA handled
the Deutch matter at the request of Gen. John A. Gordon, the
agency's deputy director, who was dissatisfied with the internal
efforts to review the matter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has received a copy of the presidential board's report
and will try to determine whether the agency should take any
further disciplinary action against those involved in the Deutch
case.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the Deutch case has been highly controversial
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The case began as Deutch was leaving office in December 1996,
when an agency security specialist discovered that Deutch had
placed large volumes of classified material on unsecured computers
in his home, including information about some of the government's
most sensitive covert operations.
</P>
<P>
   The material included detailed personal journals about Deutch's
activities at the CIA, and memos prepared for President Clinton.
Placing classified material on these unsecured computers
represented potential violations of both agency rules and federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the classified material was detected, Deutch
deleted more than 1,000 files from his personal computers, the
inspector general's report said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA security staff began an investigation, but before long
it bogged down, and some security officials became convinced that
senior agency officials were trying to protect Deutch from a
thorough inquiry. The security staff wrote a report on its
investigation in 1997 without ever questioning Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   No action was taken against Deutch for more than a year, when
the agency's inspector general was told by an employee that the
earlier investigation had not been handled properly. Until the
inspector general started his own investigation in early 1998,
Tenet had taken no action to reprimand Deutch or discipline any
other current or former agency officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has said there was never any attempt by anyone at the CIA
to constrain the internal inquiry intentionally.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general notified the Justice Department of the
Deutch matter in 1998. The delay in notifying the Justice
Department about the case allowed a one-year time limit on
appointing an independent counsel to run out, the inspector
general's report said. The independent counsel act was still in
effect at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Application of the Independent Counsel statute was not
adequately considered'' by agency officials handling the case, the
report says. ``Given their failure to report to the Department of
Justice on a timely basis, this in effect avoided the potential
application of the independent counsel statute.''
</P>
<P>
   But in April 1999, Reno decided not to prosecute Deutch.
Officials now say that decision was reached without any FBI
investigation and before the agency's inspector general had issued
its report on the case.
</P>
<P>
   After the inspector general issued his classified report on
Deutch's actions last August, Tenet suspended Deutch's CIA security
clearances. At the time, Deutch issued an apology.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report recommended that a special CIA
accountability review panel be created to examine whether Tenet and
other top officials properly handled the internal investigation.
That review panel issued a classified report earlier this year, and
presented it to Gordon for use in determining disciplinary action.
But officials said he was not pleased with the report and in
February, Gordon asked the presidential board to conduct an
independent review. The presidential board interviewed Deutch
during its review of the matter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has rejected a request from the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence for a copy of the presidential board's
report, but Rudman has briefed the committee on his findings,
officials said.

THE DEPUTY IS A SMART PICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The Kentucky Derby is to the typical big-money
horse race what a presidential campaign is to an Assembly election
or a Picasso is to a paint-by-numbers. Different not merely in
degree but in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the Derby is out of proportion and skewed: It's
run too early in the season for its 3-year-old contestants to be
counted on for their best. It crowds the largest field of the
American racing season into a sharp clubhouse turn. It's run at a
distance none has attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the people who know how to get horses ready for the
Derby seem to operate by different rules. There's a reason the past
five Derby winners were trained by either D. Wayne Lukas (Thunder
Gulch, Grindstone, Charismatic) or Bob Baffert (Silver Charm, Real
Quiet) and two of the four before that were trained by Nick Zito
(Strike the Gold, Go for Gin).
</P>
<P>
   Of course they're given talented horses to train. But they also
know exactly what to do with them with the Derby in mind.
</P>
<P>
   They begin testing and seasoning their prospects as 2-year-olds.
They run them hard and work them hard and fast as the Derby season
builds. If their horses make it to Churchill Downs healthy, they
are as ready for a 1-mile battle as their pedigrees will allow.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, the heavy favorite for today's 126th running
of America's greatest horse race, has come to the first Saturday in
May in a decidedly different way under Neil Drysdale. We'll find
out this afternoon if the Derby gods respect the kinder, gentler
approach.
</P>
<P>
   It says here they'll take that mouthful of a name -
Foo-saw-ee-chee - and spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   It would be absurd for a writer to second-guess the methods of a
Drysdale, a Belmont Stakes winner, a five-time Breeders' Cup winner
and a newly elected Racing Hall of Famer - if history didn't back
up the skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus is bucking several Derby traditions: Horses who
start their careers late (Dec.11, in his case) and don't have a lot
of experience (five races, in his case) don't win.
</P>
<P>
   A stat from Andy Beyer of the Washington Post: In the past 30
years, 63 horses who began their careers after Nov.1 ran in the
Derby - all of them lost.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale's training of Fusaichi Pegasus and War Chant at
Churchill Downs was described by a local analyst as the ``trot to
the Derby'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   Add the possibility that the rambunctious Fusaichi Pegasus will
spend his energy in the post parade and you have the very picture
of a vulnerable favorite.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard enough to take 9-5 - Fusaichi Pegasus' morning line -
on any horse in a race where the post-time favorite hasn't won in
20 runnings. To take 9-5 on a horse with demonstrable shortcomings
is insane.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm looking elsewhere for my Derby horse and have settled,
not far from home, on the Santa Anita Derby winner, The Deputy.
</P>
<P>
   If Fusaichi Pegasus is UCLA, then The Deputy is Princeton,
likely to outsmart him with fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy won't pitch a fit on the way to the starting gate.
The Deputy won't be wishing in midstretch that he'd had one more
fast workout. The Deputy won't be intimidated by the large field -
he ran against 20 other horses last September on English turf in
his fifth and last start before coming to Jenine Sahadi in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy won't be unable to recover if traffic takes him out
of his game - he has proven his tractability by winning races wire
to wire and from off the pace (the only horse in this Derby to have
done both in races of 1 mile or more). Chris McCarron can position
The Deputy wherever is comfortable as the jockey seeks his third
Derby victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi has had exactly as many horses as Drysdale in past
Kentucky Derbies: zero. But the issue isn't the trainer's Derby
experience. It's a matter of learning from history.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a bettor trying to beat Fusaichi Pegasus, you have a
lot of rational ways to go. I've marked six other horses in my
program.
</P>
<P>
   Give me $100 to bet on the Derby, and I'll spend it this way:
</P>
<P>
   --$50 to win on The Deputy.
</P>
<P>
   --$1 trifectas linking The Deputy (on top) with Aptitude, High
Yield and More Than Ready (in second) and those three plus Hal's
Hope, Captain Steve, China Visit and Fusaichi Pegasus (in third) -
a total of $18.
</P>
<P>
   --$1 trifectas connecting Aptitude, High Yield and More Than
Ready (on top) with The Deputy (in second) and the top three plus
Hal's Hope, Captain Steve, China Visit and Fusaichi Pegasus (in
third) - also $18.
</P>
<P>
   --$14 to buy the biography of Fusaichi Pegasus if he wins. He'd
have to be one for the books.

 &HT;    Davies and Turner have eyes on the prize
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Laura Davies took off most of April so she could
spend time hanging out in her hometown of West Byfleet, England. In
her four-week respite from the LPGA Tour, she never picked up a
club, preferring to play soccer, roughhouse with her two dogs and
shop.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted to mostly shopping, with her most expensive
purchase being a black, two-seater Mercedes. She traded in her
Ferrari to get the Benz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the fun of having any money if you can't spend it?''
said Davies, whose career winnings of $4.87 million rank 10th all
time.
</P>
<P>
   Given that shopping mind-set, Davies definitely has eyes set on
the top prize of $127,500 that comes with winning the Philips
Invitational Honoring Harvey Penick.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, the longest hitter on tour, shot a 3-under-par 67 Friday
afternoon for a two-day total of 135, 5 under par at Onion Creek
Club. Coming into today's third round, Davies and first-round
co-leader Sherri Turner top a congested leader board, with six
golfers one stroke back in third place and another four golfers
within three shots of Davies and Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Akiko Fukushima shot a 67 Friday to put
herself in that crowded group one back of Turner and Davies.
Meanwhile, Sherri Steinhauer, the first-round co-leader with
Turner, suffered through a miserable afternoon, shooting a 76.
Steinhauer, a former University of Texas All-American,
double-bogeyed her second hole Friday and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauer made the cut along with 76 others. The cut was at
4-over 144.
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable players who were trimmed from the field were
Becky Iverson, Maria Hjorth and Leta Lindley. Iverson is 17th on
this year's money list, Hjorth 19th and Lindley 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Former Longhorns Kelli Kuehne, Heather Bowie and Nancy
Ramsbottom also did not make today's field.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were much tougher Friday, with a swirling south wind
gusting in excess of 20 mph. The pin placements weren't as
difficult as Thursday, but the greens still were slow and mushy
from this week's rain.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the low scores came in the afternoon, although Jean
Bartholomew had the best performance of the day with a 6-under 64,
which she finished just after noon.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Dawn Coe-Jones and Alicia Dibos of Peru created the
most buzz in the gallery late in the day when they each carded a
hole in one within 20 minutes at No. 8, a 156-yard par 3.
</P>
<P>
   The holes in one vaulted both players into contention at 4-under
136.
</P>
<P>
   Coe-Jones, who played collegiately at Lamar University in
Beaumont, didn't realize she had a hole in one until she saw the
reaction from the people around the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it hit, and it rolled the rest of the way,'' she said.
``Everyone was saying `Come on, come on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coe-Jones used an 8-iron from the tee. The ball carried about
140 yards, hit the green, then slowly climbed uphill another 45
feet until it softly landed in the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Dibos used a 7-iron. Her shot hit about 10 feet closer to the
hole than Coe-Jones. And like the Canadian's shot, it then slowly
climbed the slope before finding the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Davies finished just after Coe-Jones. If not for a three-putt
bogey performance on her final hole, Davies would have been the
outright leader. She has already won once this year (the Los
Angeles Women's Open) to break a two-year championship drought.
She'll be looking for career LPGA victory No. 19.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in her storied career, the affable Davies has
opted to practice before tournaments, although she refuses to play
an actual pre-tournament round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing a practice round ... you might as well have your
fingernails slowly pulled out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, she took several baskets of balls to the driving range
and practice green at Onion Creek this week, hitting for two to
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Turner, a 43-year-old veteran, is trying desperately
to regain her winning form that made her the LPGA player of the
year and leading money winner in 1988. This is the first time in 11
years she has led a tournament after two days. On Friday, she shot
an uneventful 70.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said she hoped someone else would come behind her on
Friday with a lower overall score so she wouldn't feel so much
gnawing pressure when she tees off this morning. She got at least
part of her wish hours later when Davies finished her round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, long time since I've led a tournament,''
Turner said. ``The main thing, what I'll probably do (Friday night)
is to try and not talk about golf. But I've got some friends coming
in from Corpus Christi, and that's all they'll want to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most recent tournament (where she was in
contention) was last year at the (U.S.) Open. I was a little
nervous before Saturday's round. I couldn't sleep. I was tossing
and turning. I finally fell asleep. Hopefully that won't happen

 &HT;    Braves lose Perez for season
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves' fears were confirmed Friday. Or as Eddie
Perez put it, ``No mas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gone,'' said the backup catcher, who will miss the rest of
the season after an MRI test revealed a torn rotator cuff in his
right shoulder. Perez and shortstop Walt Weiss (strained left
hamstring) were placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Weiss is expected back promptly, Perez will be operated on
Monday by team orthopedists Marvin Royster and Xavier Duralde, who
repaired Perez's left shoulder and right knee during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say four, five months (rehabilitation). But the pain, I
can't take it any more,'' said Perez, who aggravated a
spring-training injury Wednesday night in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For now, this leaves 19-year-old rookie Rafael Furcal as the
starting shortstop and the Braves seeking an experienced backup
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a lot of calls,'' said manager Bobby Cox.
``Lunar's the guy for now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves bought the contracts of catcher Fernando Lunar from
AA Greenville and infielder John DeRosa from AAA Richmond. Both
joined the team Friday when the Braves opened a weekend series with
Philadelphia at Turner Field. For Lunar, who was hitting .213 at
Greenville with four RBIs in 23 games, this is his first time on
the major-league roster. His stay might be brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to take care of Javy,'' Cox said of Lopez, the
starting catcher who missed almost half of last season after July
26 knee surgery. ``We're using him too much as it is.'' Yet, Lunar
hardly seems a long-term replacement for Perez, Greg Maddux's
regular catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Eddie's a No. 1 catcher backing up,'' Cox said.Perez
was the MVP of last season's NLCS when he hit .500. ``He's been
important to us for a long time. We lost a lot there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing, especially with this team we have
right now,'' said Perez, who was hitting .182 in seven games this
season. ``Everybody wants to be a part of this team. It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux said of Perez:``It's too bad. Eddie's been a big part of
our success,'' Maddux said. ``He brings a lot of things to the
club, and you can't replace his leadership.''

TALKS RESUME BETWEEN WPP GROUP, YOUNG AND RUBICAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite 7th and 8th grafs with different emphasis.)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The on-again, off-again merger talks between WPP Group
of Britain and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. are on again. A week after
negotiations between the two advertising companies broke down, WPP
said Friday that it had returned to the bargaining table in hopes
of reviving a takeover of Y&AMP;R, which is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Young &AMP; Rubicam continues to be courted by
Publicis SA, the French advertising company. According to
executives close to the talks, the chief executive of Y&AMP;R, Thomas
D. Bell Jr., is negotiating with both companies again, seeking to
take advantage of each company's ambition to add Y&AMP;R to its
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bell has two suitors for Y&AMP;R, he may be able to
instigate a bidding war between them.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between WPP and Y&AMP;R, which has already been derailed
twice, would create the world's largest advertising company in
billings and revenue and would be the richest agency-company
takeover in history. WPP, which owns Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, J.
Walter Thompson and the public relations agency Hill &AMP; Knowlton, is
keen to take control of Y&AMP;R to add even more mass and scale to its
ever-growing operations as the industry continues to consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R is one of the last few big independent agency companies,
which makes it particularly attractive to Sir Martin Sorrell, the
acquisitive, ambitious chief executive at WPP.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the talks ended, both sides wagged their fingers
at the other in a public scuffle with conflicting versions of who
was at fault. Executives from WPP accused Y&AMP;R executives of
changing the terms of the deal at the 11th hour, contending that
the lawyer representing Y&AMP;R wrote new details into the merger
document by hand. Y&AMP;R executives, for their part, asserted that WPP
made oral and written assurances that were then not included in the
document.
</P>
<P>
   The debate centered on to what extent WPP could make changes to
Y&AMP;R operations in the first year after the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy also arose over Sorrell's plan to discourage Y&AMP;R's
top executives from leaving the combined agency company by
instituting a noncompete provision that would have effectively kept
departing employees from working in the industry for a year. Y&AMP;R
managers considered the provision too harsh. Other disagreements
occurred over severance packages and contractual matters.
</P>
<P>
   But on the most important issue, price, both sides had different
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at WPP said they believed Y&AMP;R had agreed that its
British suitor would pay about $5 billion. Executives at Y&AMP;R said
no deal had been struck on the price of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what changed to bring WPP back to the bargaining
table, but executives close to the talks said both agency companies
might be willing to make more concessions. Sorrell, the executives
say, wants desperately to agree to a friendly deal with Y&AMP;R, though
they portrayed him as not averse to a hostile bid. Indeed, it was
through a hostile takeover of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather that Sorrell turned
WPP into what is now the world's third-largest agency company.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's interest in a deal with WPP has also been reignited,
though executives close to the talks said Bell and Sorrell still
had disdain for each other.
</P>
<P>
   A tie-up between WPP and Y&AMP;R is more compelling than a deal with
Publicis, an executive close to Y&AMP;R said, because both WPP and Y&AMP;R
serve some of the same clients _ like Ford, Kraft, Mattel and Sears
_ and do not have major client conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Y&AMP;R and Publicis could have a major client
conflict because Y&AMP;R works for Ford Motor and Publicis works for
General Motors (through an American agency, Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney in
San Francisco) and for Renault.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Young &AMP; Rubicam rose
$4.50, or 9 percent, to $54.125. American depository receipts of
WPP _ with each ADR representing five shares of the British company
_ fell $5.50, or 6.8 percent, to $75.50. Publicis shares fell 18
euros, or 3.3 percent, to 534 euros on the Paris bourse.

MERCKER TO GET FIRST START OF SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This is the start Kent Mercker never thought he would
get.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker will get his first start of the season today against the
Mariners because Jason Dickson is out with a strained left hip
flexor. Mercker was so disappointed he didn't win a spot in the
rotation at the end of spring training he said he didn't expect to
get another chance.
</P>
<P>
   But that was unrealistic, considering the chance for injury or
lack of production from one or more of the pitchers. So now he has
his chance, but he says he isn't looking at it as more than just
one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about five days from now, 10 days from now,''
he said. ''I'm not making the decisions, I'm a player. If I throw a
shutout or give up eight runs, it's not going to change their long-
or short-term plans for me one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker is 0-1 with a 6.61 ERA in 10 relief appearances, but has
made it clear he prefers starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' he said. ``There's no sense in wondering why.
I've pretty much blocked it out. ... I was honestly disappointed
coming out of spring, but I'm not one to pout or create waves.
There's a political side to this game, there are politics
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia, however, simply wants to put his best
pitchers out there. He chose Scott Schoeneweis over Mercker and
Schoeneweis is 4-0 with a 3.43 ERA. As for today, Scioscia would
like to see Mercker pitch deep into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate some of Kent's outings have stretched him out
some,'' Scioscia said. ``He's thrown some three-innings-plus stints
and his pitch counts have been high enough to think six innings is
not unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   DISARCINA ENCOURAGED: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina worked out
Friday, fielding ground balls and making throws to test his sore
right shoulder. He said it went well, but Scioscia implied it will
probably be a few more days before DiSarcina is back in the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great day today as far as getting his confidence
back,'' Scioscia said. ``We're much more encouraged that this will
be short-term rather than long term.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina said he's not going to rush himself back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel it tighten up again I'll stop,'' DiSarcina said.
''It's too early in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   BELCHER THROWS: Pitcher Tim Belcher played catch Friday, but the
next course of action in his recovery from elbow surgery has not
been determined. Belcher is probably still at least a week away
from making another rehab start.

O'CONNOR FUNERAL PREPARATIONS: LITURGY TO LOGISTICS, HUNDREDS OF
DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are very few differences, ritually speaking,
between a funeral for a cardinal and one for any other Catholic.
One is that a cardinal, like other priests, lies in state in his
church before burial. In this case, of course, the cardinal is John
O'Connor, who died at 80 on Wednesday night, and the church is St.
Patrick's Cathedral, the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   As mourners pay their respects to O'Connor this weekend, they
will see him dressed in the same vestments he would use when
celebrating a Mass on Easter or Christmas, with the white bishop's
miter that is reserved for the holiest days. . On his wedding
finger, there is a ring that symbolizes devotion to his flock.
</P>
<P>
   Before he is placed in the crypt underneath the high altar, a
final commendation will be spoken, most likely by one of the three
cardinals who will preside over the funeral Mass. After another
rite, the Prayer of Entombment, the cardinal's family and the
clergymen will file out of the crypt, and the cardinal will be
entombed in private, said the Rev. Eric Raaser, dean of students at
the St. John Neumann Seminary Residence. There the cardinal will
rest, unless there is a motion to canonize him and his coffin is
disinterred to check whether, by chance or miracle, his body has
remained ``incorruptible.''
</P>
<P>
   As the funeral weekend progresses, there are hundreds of details
to be taken care of. But the liturgical ones are almost rote,
compared with the logistical ones.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some matters were far from the spiritual. And many of them were
attended to by Joseph Zwilling, the press spokesman who had played
straight man to the quip-loving cardinal for 16 years. No, he did
not remember saying NY1 could set up a camera stand on the steps of
the cathedral, Zwilling almost sighed into a walkie-talkie after a
news briefing Friday, a few hours before the cardinal's body was
due to arrive there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be as dignified as possible,'' he said
patiently. ``If it's what I'm picturing in my mind, I probably
wouldn't have agreed to it.'' Then, almost in the same breath, he
agreed to the camera stand if someone at the cathedral said it
looked acceptable. A television journalist rushed in, late, and
asked him how he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``About to fall over,'' Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the funeral Mass, more than 3,500 tickets will be issued for
a cathedral that seats 2,300. President and Clinton will attend,
Secret Service in tow. Vice President Al Gore, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani plan to
come, as well. During the Mass at 2 p.m. Monday, the streets around
St. Patrick's will be closed to traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation, the Catholic Center on First Avenue has
suspended all its normal operations. An ad hoc office was created
to help with hospitality arrangements. A command center was set up
to handle calls. The director of human resources, Deacon Randy
Velez, spent Friday manning one of six urgently ringing phones,
talking to everyone from a new convert in Denver who wanted to
express his condolences, to the archbishop of Northern Ireland
calling about his trip.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Archdiocese faxed forms to every bishop asking
for their RSVPs and travel requirements. All eight U.S. cardinals
will be at the funeral, along with the Vatican's secretary of
state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, who will preside over the Mass.
``Every bishop I can think of will be attending,'' Velez said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mass, the priests will gather at the Palace Hotel,
across the street from the cathedral buildings, to put on their
robes for the procession of concelebrants, or clergy. The bishops
will dress downstairs at the cathedral, and exit through the side
door to join the procession, which will be arranged by rank.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no altar boys; instead the altar will be manned,
as it is every third Sunday, by seminarians from St. Joseph's
Seminary of Dunwoodie, N.Y. The Rev. Tom Lynch, the seminary's
master of ceremonies, said that all 40 seminarians would be on hand
to help the concelebrants, but only eight would serve at the altar.
There was not much debate over which eight would have the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I just look at who's better at pushing priests
around, and doing it nicely,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   While Sodano will preside over the Mass, two men who were at the
cardinal's deathbed will, according to his request, take part.
Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of Boston, will deliver the
homily, and Cardinal William Wakefield Baum, a Vatican official,
will give an address.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for such requests to be made, even when they
break with the tradition of bishops preaching at bishops' funerals.
At the funeral for Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, archbishop of
Chicago, in 1996, a monsignor who had long been his secretary gave
the homily. At St. Patrick's, multiple Masses will be held all
weekend for groups of special concern to Cardinal O'Connor,
including children and the disabled. Those Masses are all open to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``What was really our overriding concern was that as many people
be given an opportunity to pay their respects,'' Zwilling said.

BRITAIN AND IRELAND AGREE ON NEW START FOR ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British and Irish governments announced late Friday
night that they had agreed on a new formula to restart the
suspended power-sharing government in Belfast, Northern Ireland,
this month and urged Ulster's Roman Catholic and Protestant leaders
to endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan envisages resumption on May 22 of the government
that was suspended in February, after only eight weeks of activity.
And it sets a new date of June 2001 for putting in place all the
steps of the flagging Northern Ireland peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise announcement followed 30 hours of negotiations by
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, with the Northern Ireland political leaders at
Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast. It was made at a moment when
there appeared scant hope of a breakthrough in the impasse over
disarmament that has continually blocked progress.
</P>
<P>
   May 22 is the date set out in the April 1998 accord by which all
disarmament by Northern Ireland's paramilitary groups was to have
been accomplished, and although that possibility has faded, the
date has taken on the symbolism of a deadline by which there has to
be some progress to avert a total collapse of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern met last week in London and this week for two
days in Belfast under increasing pressure to produce something to
keep alive the settlement that had raised hopes of an end to 30
years of sectarian violence that has cost more than 3,600 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the new blueprint were not made public. But an
eight-point statement issued just before midnight on Friday
indicated that the governments had dropped the demand for
disarmament itself, which was long the barrier to progress in
putting the settlement into place, and that they were instead
looking for a declaration from the Irish Republican Army and
Protestant paramilitary groups that would rule out any future
resort to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``With confidence that there are clear proposals for
implementing all other aspects of the agreement, the governments
believe that paramilitary organizations must now, for their part,
urgently state clearly that they will put their arms completely and
verifiably beyond use,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army, has in recent weeks
discouraged hope of any such declaration from the IRA. But in
comments early Saturday, he sounded more conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   When Britain suspended the home-rule government on Feb. 11, it
said it was taking the action because the IRA had failed to make
expected moves on disarmament. Since then, Sinn Fein has been
adamant that Britain bears the sole responsibility for getting the
government up and running again.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling a possible change in attitude Saturday morning, Adams
said, ``This is a decisive moment,'' and he called on everyone
supporting the peace accord to ``rally behind this initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting what he had been able to extract as grounds for
moving forward, Adams said his people would ``particularly welcome
commitments on human rights and equality, demilitarization, the
Irish language and support for the families of all the victims of
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the Ulster Unionists, the
province's main Protestant party. But its leader, David Trimble,
has suggested for the last two months that he may be willing to
enter government with Sinn Fein if it gave ironclad assurances that
violence was at an end.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's party is divided over disarmament, with a substantial
minority demanding that there be an actual turnover of weapons
before members agree to sit in the government with members of Sinn
Fein. Trimble overcame that opposition in November and took his
party into the government. But when the IRA failed to make the
weapons moves expected in early February, his leadership was
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The British, who consider Trimble the essential person on the
Protestant side in the peace talks, then suspended the government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern said they could not force the Protestant
politicians to resume sharing power with Sinn Fein. But Blair, with
Ahern at his side, said, ``It's now incumbent upon the parties and,
perhaps in particular, the paramilitary organizations to give their
response to the proposals we've made. ``I very much hope that that
response is positive, and in particular that we can make sure that
the arms issue is dealt with completely and verifiably.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern, considered the principal interlocutor with Sinn Fein and
its IRA allies, added, ``I'd be very disappointed if the response
from the paramilitaries was not extremely positive.''

   Prime Minister Tony Blair promised to work with Ken Livingstone,
the left-wing maverick he tried to keep off the ballot but who won
the race for London's first elected mayor with 58 percent of the
final vote. Blair also acknowledged that Conservative success in
winning back some 600 of the 3,300 local council seats across
England represented ``some bad results.'' But Conservatives

   A court has sentenced the former first lady Rosane Collor de
Mello to an 11-year prison term on charges of taking kickbacks and
diverting money from the relief agency she ran during her husband's
presidency. Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached in 1992 after
his brother accused him of taking millions of dollars from
companies bidding for government contracts. Lawyers for Collor, who
has been in exile in Miami with her husband, said she would appeal.

<P>
   In a major advance for the government's effort to bring budget
deficits under control as promised in a 1998 accord with the
International Monetary Fund, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
has signed a ``fiscal responsibility law'' that puts strict limits
on spending by states. The law caps government salaries, sets fines
for officeholders who violate those ceilings and prohibits state
governors from increasing budget outlays unless there is a rise in
tax revenues.

FOUR DRUG COMPANIES TO PAY $33 MILLION IN FINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ind., Germany)   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four drug companies have agreed to plead guilty to
taking part in an international conspiracy to fix vitamin prices,
and two former executives agreed to prison terms, Justice
Department officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the companies _ Nepera Inc. of Harriman, N.Y.;
Reilly Industries of Indianapolis; and Merck KgaA and Degussa-Huls
of Germany _ agreed to pay a total of $33 million in fines, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The four companies are the latest to plead guilty in the Justice
Department's long-running investigation of the worldwide vitamin
industry, whose leaders colluded for more than a decade to increase
the prices of bulk vitamins used in everything from breakfast
cereal to animal feed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general responsible for
antitrust prosecutions, has called the price-fixing operation _
which has snared some of the world's best-known drug companies _
``the most pervasive and harmful criminal antitrust conspiracy ever
uncovered.''
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy, which officials traced to executives at Roche of
Switzerland and BASF of Germany, began in 1989 and grew to include
French and Japanese drug concerns. Because those companies have
operations in the United States, they were subject to prosecution
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, seven companies have agreed to pay nearly $2 billion in
government and class-action settlements for fixing the prices of
vitamins in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials accused the four companies named
Friday of sharing sales and customer information, fixing prices and
carving up the market for common products like Vitamin C, niacin
and Vitamin B3.
</P>
<P>
   Merck KgaA, which is based in Darmstadt, Germany, and is
unrelated to the U.S. pharmaceutical company of the same name, has
agreed to pay a $14 million criminal fine for taking part in a
Vitamin C cartel between 1991 and 1995, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Degussa-Huls, of Frankfurt, acknowledged setting prices of
Vitamin B3 for three years ending in 1995 and accepted a $13
million fine.
</P>
<P>
   Nepera, a unit of the Cambrex Corp., agreed to a $4 million
criminal fine for fixing prices of Vitamin B3 and niacin. Roger
Noack, the former president of Nepera, agreed to serve eight months
in prison and pay a $50,000 fine. David Purpi, a former vice
president of Nepera, agreed to serve one year and a day in prison
and pay a $100,000 fine, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly Industries accepted a $2 million fine for taking part in
the Vitamin B3 conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The companies divided up lucrative markets around the world and
held regular budget meetings to prevent cheating, officials said.

ARBORISTS TRY TO TRACE DEADLY OAK MALADY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A mysterious blight that has decimated oak trees
from Mendocino to Monterey may have claimed its first casualties in
Los Angeles, four oak trees in Topanga Canyon, officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists and arborists said the cause of what they call
``sudden death'' is unknown, but the disease moves with such
stunning speed that it can kill a tree in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Northern California, they are calling it an epidemic,''
said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district
includes Topanga and the Santa Monica Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In areas where the disease has been identified in Northern
California, it has afflicted 30 percent to 48 percent of oak trees,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Because so little is known about the blight, the Board of
Supervisors is expected to vote Tuesday on Yaroslavsky's motion to
ask for an urgent investigation of the Topanga tree deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously our oak woodlands are very precious and we cannot
afford to lose them,'' Yaroslavsky said. ``We need to do everything
we can to save them. Some of these oaks are hundreds and hundreds
of years old. Before this becomes an epidemic here, if there is
anything we can do to prevent this, I want our experts to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosi Dagit, a certified arborist and senior conservation
biologist for the state Resource Conservation District of the Santa
Monica Mountains, said the death of the Topanga trees is unusual
and scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quick death is uncommon and a very frightening thing,''
Dagit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went from full, green, healthy trees to absolutely brown
in a month or less,'' she said. ``I didn't believe it initially.
That is very uncharacteristic of oaks. But several homeowners had
photos that were dated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dagit called a plant pathologist at the University of
California, Davis, who is studying the disease that first appeared
in Marin County in the mid-1990s and has since spread to Mendocino,
Sonoma, Marin, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found were infestations of bark beetles,'' she said.
``But what came first - the dead trees or the beetles? Did the
beetles kill the tree, or did something kill the tree and the
beetles came in? We were not able to conclusively answer that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Since finding the trees, Dagit has not received any more reports
of oak deaths in the Topanga area. The four dead trees were removed
and burned, with twig samples sent to UC Davis for study.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, the disease has not discriminated,
killing tan oak, coast live oak, black oak and canyon wild oak
trees, said Rick Standiford, associate dean of the College of
Natural Resources at the University of California, Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The possible causes include beetles, fungi and weather.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have differences in opinion about whether the deaths are
the result of a single pathogen or oaks weakened by drought or
other environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees have a weepy, black sap, which is usually the first
symptom,'' Standiford said. ``Then they get attacked by a couple of
different species of beetles. They get a secondary pathogen. And
then they go from green to suddenly brown. That's how the name
`sudden death' was attributed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standiford said scientists are considering using pesticides on
the trees near homes to kill the beetles, but it would be
impractical to use on hundreds of thousands of oak trees throughout
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Their work is important not only because oak trees provide food
and shelter for wildlife, but because oak trees are a treasured
resource in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people think about the California landscape, they think
about spreading oaks and golden hills. I think oaks have a certain
tie with our cultural psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before this disease, oak trees have been endangered and
subject to tough restrictions. Homeowners and developers must seek
permission to cut them down or even prune live branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oak trees are fairly limited in Los Angeles County. Out of
152,000 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area, fewer than 16,600 acres remains of oak woodlands,'' Dagit
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider that when the Spanish came through here in
the 1700s, they described coming over the pass and seeing
magnificent trees stretching all the way to the ocean. We have
changed things fairly dramatically.''

FUSAICHI PEGASUS: MYTH OR MASTER?
</HEADLINE>
 PEGASUS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Racehorses _ fast racehorses, fortunate
racehorses _ win the Kentucky Derby. The winner isn't always the
best racehorse _ he's sometimes the luckiest _ but there's no doubt
about it. He, and occasionally she, is a racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus (pronounced Foo-saw-EE-chee) might be the
favorite once the horses are loaded into the starting gate for the
126th Kentucky Derby at about 4:25 p.m. Saturday. But he doesn't
always act like a racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at Churchill Downs more than two weeks ago, he
has sometimes looked more like the rank animal that comes out of
chute No. 3 in the saddle-bronc contest at Will Rogers Memorial
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   After one of his less-eventful mornings at Churchill, when he
bucked only a few times, trainer Neil Drysdale smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was full of beans this morning,'' Drysdale said. ``He's
throwing in a few bucks, playing out there, feeling good about
himself. We let him do it because he's such a big horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm very happy with the way he's training. He's had strong
gallops. He's been on the bit and maintained good pull. There's no
maliciousness in him at all. I'd be worried if he'd go out there
and be placid.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his bucking, rearing and kicking, Fusaichi Pegasus puts
on a game face when the starting gates open. He has lost only one
race, his career debut five races ago, when he lost a slim lead
late in the stretch. Since then, he has won four in a row, by an
average margin of 2 1/2 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   That includes a winning effort in the Wood Memorial Stakes for
his final Derby prep. He balked going to the starting gate before
the race and reared away from his escort pony going back to the
winner's circle. In between, he drilled the field, winning by 4 1/2
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   But his victory didn't make believers of everyone. A favorite
hasn't won the Derby in 20 years, since Spectacular Bid in 1979. D.
Wayne Lukas has trained four Derby winners, and he says the media
creates false favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys put so much importance on that last prep race,'' he
said. ``But what the horse does in the three weeks between that
last prep race and the Derby is the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas points to Arazi in 1992. Arazi went off as an odds-on
favorite in the Derby largely because he was a runaway winner in
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile the year before at Churchill. A a
3-year-old, he had one prep race in France before shipping to
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes walking by here every day on his way to the track,
looking less than perfect,'' Lukas said at his barn. ``He dumps
(jockey) Pat Valenzuela off one morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they finally get him to the track, he bolts to the
outside. Yet, nobody thinks anything of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas won't pinpoint Fusaichi Pegasus as this year's Arazi, who
finished eighth. He said he'll only make specific comments about
his own horses.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Fusaichi Pegasus is the real deal. Chris McCarron
rides The Deputy, who's second on the morning line behind Fusaichi
Pegasus. Both horses raced in the San Felipe Stakes in March at
Santa Anita, and Fusaichi Pegasus edged away to win by nearly a
length despite jockey Kent Desormeaux not touching him with the
whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled up alongside him that day, and it was clear Kent
wasn't even trying to get to the bottom of his horse,'' McCarron
said. ``That was scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I watched him race in the Wood on TV. I see Kent take him
back behind horses on that wet track and hope to see that horse's
head fly up in the air because he doesn't like the dirt in his
face. But he handled it beautifully. My horse can win. But I think
Kent's on a really good horse.'' nn

TIME WARNER OFFERING REFUNDS FOR ABC FLAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Time Warner Cable subscribers will get a free
month of a company-owned premium channel and credit for two days'
worth of basic service because of this week's 36-hour ABC blackout,
officials announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And KABC (Channel 7) said it has given away thousands of
vouchers for free satellite television systems - an anti-cable
retaliation strategy that it will continue through the weekend,
further escalating the battle of the entertainment titans.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Brown, Time Warner Cable's division vice president, said
the two-day rebate amounts to roughly one dollar each for 150,000
Time Warner households in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and San
Gabriel valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The refund, which varies slightly among areas of service and
even between neighbors (an apartment complex may have a group rate
and therefore a lower refund for each tenant than the house next
door), will be posted automatically on customers' bills. Similar
offers were made to customers in New York City, Houston and other
affected markets.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California customers will also receive one free month
of HBO Family, a premium channel showing G-rated movies, Brown
said. Customers will be advised by ads and mailers of the start
date and other details about HBO Family, valued at about $10 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise that Time Warner chose a direct
competitor of The Disney Channel, one of the services at the heart
of the adversarial contract talks between The Walt Disney Co. and
Time Warner that led to Monday's ABC blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at KABC reported brisk demand for its rebates for
purchase and installation of DirecTV satellite dishes. Station
spokesman Bill Burton said the company gave away all 1,000 of its
$198 rebates for DirecTV within 25 minutes of the launch Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Thursday) we upped it to 2,000 and that sold out in about two
hours, and today we're just about to sell out,'' Burton said midday
Friday. KABC will continue offering 2,000 rebate certificates per
day at least through Monday and will consider extending the plan if
demand warrants it.
</P>
<P>
   The two media giants had been negotiating for several months
over the fees Time Warner Cable must pay Disney - parent company of
ABC, ESPN, The Disney Channel and other TV networks - for the right
to carry its cable channels. Their latest extension expired April
30 at midnight, and while Disney wanted to keep ABC running until
the end of the current ratings sweeps, Time Warner pulled the ABC
signal for 3.5 million households nationwide. Some 350,000 in the
Los Angeles area were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner reinstated the signal Tuesday afternoon under a
temporary extension that lasts until July 15. Executives from both
sides have been comparing their schedules and may resume talks as
soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout threw a spotlight on the acrimonious negotiations,
which started late last year. Time Warner contends that Disney is
trying to overcharge the cable company for its channels, which
would drive up customer rates.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has accused Time Warner of acting like a monopoly and
throwing its weight around in anticipation of its merger with
America Online, which will make it the world's largest
entertainment corporation.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown of Time Warner said the apparent success of the
satellite rebate program indicates otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sort of refutes some of the statements about us
being a monopoly,'' he said. ``People do have choices as to where
they get their nonbroadcast channels.''

GINO BARTALI, 85, A HERO IN ITALY FOR HIS CYCLING CHAMPIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Gino Bartali, an Italian cycling champion whose victory
in the 1948 Tour de France helped unite his politically torn
country, died Friday at his home in Florence, his son Andrea
Bartali said. He was 85. Bartali, who also won the Tour de France
in 1938 and the Giro D'Italia in 1936, 1937 and 1946, was nicknamed
the Iron Man of Tuscany for his endurance. Bartali, who was
Catholic, was also known as Gino the Pious, especially after he
surged ahead of the pack on the stage to the pilgrimage city of
Lourdes in the 1948 Tour de France, a lead he maintained all the
way to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For older Italians, Bartali's victory was memorable for its
soothing effect on one of the most politically edgy moments in
post-war Italian history. Bartali's 1948 triumph occurred on the
same day that the Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti was shot and
wounded, an assassination attempt that brought Italian communists
to the brink of insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that civil war was averted by a Tour de France victory
is surely excessive,'' said the former prime minister Giulio
Andreotti, 81, who at the time was a young Christian Democrat
politician. ``But it is undeniable that on that 14th of July of
1948, day of the attack on Togliatti, Bartali contributed to ease
the tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartali, who fought with the partisans during the last year of
World War II, competed in 988 races between 1931 and 1954, winning
184.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Adriana, two sons and a daughter.  &QL;

NETS HAVE KUPCHAK ON LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets have received permission from the Los
Angeles Lakers to speak with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak
about the Nets' director of basketball operations position, an
Eastern Conference executive said. Neither Lewis Katz, the Nets'
principal owner, nor Kupchak would comment, nor was it clear
whether the parties had already talked about the job.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak, in his sixth season as the Lakers' general manager, is
one of several candidates the Nets view as a possible head of
basketball operations. Others the Nets are known to have an
interest in include Lenny Wilkens, John Thompson and Isiah Thomas,
though Thomas is thought to have more of an interest in coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak, 46, has been a member of the Lakers' front office since
retiring after a 10-year playing career in 1986. He signed a
long-term contract extension in 1998, but would perhaps consider
joining the Nets because of his East Coast background. He was born
in Hicksville, N.Y., and starred at Brentwood High School on Long
Island before embarking on an all-America career at the University
of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are hoping to fill their director's position before the
NBA draft on June 28. The director's priorities will be to
determine whether to keep John Nash as the general manager and to
lead the search for a new head coach.

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ There are many stories of horses who were
bought for relatively bargain prices winning the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, the Derby winner two years ago, cost about $17,000
when he was a yearling. Seattle Slew, the Triple Crown winner of
1977, cost about the same. Last year's winner, Charismatic, was
running in a claiming race for $62,500 just a few months before he
improved enough to hit the Derby trail.
</P>
<P>
   But it's money, serious money, that is homing in on the 126th
running of the Kentucky Derby contested Saturday at Churchill
Downs. Derby favorite Fusaichi Pegasus took $4 million from the
account of Japanese businessman Fusao Sekiguchi when the colt was
purchased at a yearling auction two years ago. And The Deputy, the
second choice on the morning line, was brought from Great Britain
late last year and syndicated for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes costs that much to satisfy Derby Fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business for a long time, and I really never
was that interested in the Derby,'' said Barry Irwin, the managing
partner of the Team Valor syndicate that owns The Deputy. ``But our
clients \Rin Team Valor\S are diseased with Derby fever. They want
to do this, so we supply them with the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a Cinderella story, go to the barn of Harold Rose.
He's 88 years old and has been training for more than 40 years. His
wife is writing a book about his experiences. His jockey, Roger
Velez, is a recovering alcoholic, and Rose underwent quadruple
bypass heart surgery last year.
</P>
<P>
   He has Hal's Hope in the race, a horse he bred, raised and
trains. He has been at the barn every morning, but the busy
schedule finally got to him late in the week. He had to take a seat
in a chair rather than stand up as he had been doing while talking
with the media outside his barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs are getting just a little bit tired, what with keeping
up with this horse and all you guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those old legs could handle another walk, right over to the
winner's circle.

that when he went around two turns for the first time in his most
recent start in the Flamingo.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Strengths: Might be improving, though it's tough to tell from
his most recent race. He had a troubled trip in the Lexington

<P>
   Earnings: $1,170,196
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Showed some talent as a 2-year-old and has turned
into a real pro at 3. Not short on fight, he has been first or
second in his past five races.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Though Derby winners have come from outside posts,
that starting spot doesn't help his get-to-the-front running style.

   Strengths: Appears remarkably talented. Broke maiden in first
try at classy Deauville meet in France. Won easily in Dubai.
</P>

halfway-around-the-world trip to get here. Looked tired after
Wednesday's workout.

<P>
   Strengths: His sire _ Go For Gin _ won the Derby in 1994. That's
not always a sign of success. Ran second to China Visit in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Looks as if he came over from Dubai with China Visit
just to fill a spot in the plane. He has shown little talent.

</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Appears to run his best races away from his base in
Southern California. He usually tries to close on the
front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: He won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, and no horse has
been able to maintain that excellence as a 2-year-old into their
3-year-old season.

</P>
<P>
   Strengths: In all three of his races this year, he has shown
great eagerness to keep running despite traffic problems in the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: He lacks seasoning. Though he broke his maiden in
his first try on dirt, he has not won a stakes race.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Strengths: Has freakish speed away from the gate, and he has
been able to maintain that at distances longer than a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Last prep race into the Derby was a clunker _ he
finished last, beaten 15 lengths, in the Blue Grass Stakes.
</P>

   Strengths: Trainer has won Derby twice. This colt loves
Churchill, winning by five at the track last year and turning in
some nice workouts this week.

   Weaknesses: Had some slight foot injuries this year and seems to
be hitting the wall late in his races.

<P>
   Career record: 4 3-1-0
</P>
<P>
   Earnings: $372,200
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Extremely well bred (he's out of Breeders' Cup winner
Hollywood Wildcat) and gets blinkers for the first time after only
career loss.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Very lightly raced. No horse has won the Derby off
four races since 1918. The Deputy ran right by him in the Santa
Anita Derby.

</P>
<P>
   Earnings: $670,229
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Flashed considerable talent as a 2-year-old before a
slight injury. He's taking to the longer distances. Won at
Churchill last year.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Pedigree analysts have doubted his bloodlines and
wondered if the 1 1/4 miles is up his alley. He seems to be putting
doubts to rest.
</P>
<P>
   No. Horse Odds 10 The Deputy 4-1
</P>

   Career record: 9 4-2-3
</P>
<P>
   Earnings: $817,258
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Seemingly unflappable, a cool demeanor. He's the only
horse to have raced against a field of 19 horses. He can stay close
and pounce.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Hardly any. The only suspense is how he reacts to a
big field on a dirt track (his other big-field race was on grass).
</P>
<P>
   No. Horse Odds 11 Graeme Hall 20-1
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: Shane Sellers (Derby record, 10 0-0-1)

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Can either go to the lead or rate off of it. He lost
the Rushaway Stakes by a head _ the only loss in three starts this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Won the Arkansas Derby with a jockey known for being
effective on the lead. That jock took Captain Steve for the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   No. Horse Odds 12 Fusaichi Pegasus 9-5

   Strengths: Powerfully built, he seems to rush up on his
opponents and dominate them. He has won his races by an average
margin of 2 1/2 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: He lacks experience, and he often shows a lack of
discipline. He can be a handful before a race.
</P>

   Jockey: Calvin Borel (Derby record, 1 0-0-0)

</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Has breeding for the classic distances. He has shown
an ability to close against quality horses.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Last two races have been duds. Lukas blames it on a
lung infection that now has passed.
</P>
<P>

   Career record: 5 2-1-1

<P>
   Earnings: 189,760
</P>
<P>
   Strengths: Pedigree dictates late physical development and
fondness for the Derby's 1 1/4 miles (he's by Unbridled). He has
tactical speed.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses: Lone stakes victory came against an unaccomplished
group. He didn't race as a 2-year-old.

his past four races, his best finishes are two fourths.

AFRICAN-AMERICAN JOCKEY GLAD FOR DERBY SHOT, EVEN A LONG ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Marlon St. Julien is accustomed to making
history. He was the winning jockey for the first race at Lone Star
Park at Grand Prairie in 1997, and he was the leading rider at the
track the first two years.
</P>
<P>
   And when St. Julien rides Curule on Saturday in the Kentucky
Derby, he'll be the first African-American to be in the race in 79
years. The last time it happened was 1921, when Henry King rode
Planet to a 10th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Curule might not do any better. Along with stablemate China
Visit, Curule is listed as 50-1 in the morning line. Owned by the
Godolphin Stable of Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum of Dubai,
Curule (it's pronounced Koo-RULE) has never raced in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's a way, way long shot,'' St. Julien said. ``But I'm
going to just ride this race with confidence. You gotta be in it to
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien, 28, said he wasn't surprised when the news got out
that it had been almost 80 years since an African-American has
ridden in the Derby. He said he has been studying the history of
the Derby and the heritage of black riders since he moved from Lone
Star to ride in New Orleans and on the lucrative Kentucky circuit
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the first running of the Kentucky Derby in 1875, 13 of the 15
jockeys were African-American. And 15 of the first 28 runnings of
the Derby were won by African-American jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the most-famous African-American jockey was Isaac
Murphy, who was the first jockey _ no matter the skin color _ to
win the Derby three times and also in consecutive years. His three
Derby winners ranks in a tie for fourth behind Eddie Arcaro, Bill
Hartack and Bill Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien, a native of Lafayette, La., is hoping his appearance
in the race will help him get another ride in future years. He also
rode Zoftig to a fifth-place finish in Friday's Kentucky Oaks,
which is considered the Kentucky Derby for fillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My business (as a jockey) is good,'' said St. Julien, who also
appears in various print ads with other jockeys promoting cellular
phones in the Louisville area. ``But maybe people will pay more
attention to me. And maybe it will bring in some other
African-American riders who have been struggling to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that things have been this way, no African-American
rider in the Derby for this long. Anyone who works hard deserves a
shot.'' nn

INJURIES GIVE RANGERS A BIT MORE PAIN

By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers' bewildering injury news
got worse Friday.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui was out of the lineup with a strained hip flexor and
Justin Thompson couldn't throw in the bullpen as scheduled because
of continued soreness in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder:
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates looked at the sky around 6 p.m. and said,
``Come on rain!''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin, fighting a nasty cough said, ``I
need to go on the disabled list but there's no room for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Esteban Loaiza sat on the bench before the game, shook
his head and said, ``I've never seen this many injuries before.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the day-to-day troubles, Thompson is the biggest
concern. Thompson said he felt good enough to throw Friday, but
reported some soreness while going through some range-of-motion
tests with Dr. John Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Conway then decided Thompson should hold off a couple more days
before his next bullpen session. Thompson will play catch Saturday
and be re-examined by Conway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come this far without any major setbacks; we didn't want
to push it,'' trainer Danny Wheat said. ``So we decided to give him
an extra couple days.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui is listed as day-to-day but is still ``pretty sore'' and
is questionable for Saturday night's game. He injured himself
running to first base while hitting into the crucial ninth-inning
double play in Thursday's 8-7 loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro is struggling with a strained hamstring muscle
but did start at designated hitter. He, like Oates, was hoping for
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team could definitely use an extra day,'' Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sheldon started at first base Friday night, an ironic
twist considering the great debate in spring training and the start
of the season over how much Segui and Palmeiro would split time
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also had Luis Alicea in the lineup despite his calf
muscle injury. But Segui's problems kept the Rangers from calling
up outfielder Scarborough Green from the minor leagues. Instead the
Rangers went with the extra infielder and three outfielders for the
third consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would like to get Rusty Greer back, but, while he
has recovered from his ankle surgery, he is bothered by a pulled
hamstring. The Rangers thought the ankle would take longer.
</P>
<P>
   Greer said he's not sure when he'll be ready to play, but the
Rangers are hoping to send him on a medical rehabilitation
assignment next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you a watch a game and see teammates getting
injured, and you can't do anything about it,'' Greer said. ``The
thing you focus on is trying to get well and get off the disabled
list.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy for Greer ... or anybody else. nn

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ As Howdy Doody cooled his heels in a secret
Rhode Island bank vault, two lawyers tried Friday to persuade a
U.S. District Court judge here to grant their clients custody of
the famous puppet.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the Howdy lawsuit is the family of his former
master, the puppeteer Rufus Rose; they believe that the marionette
belongs to them. On the other side is the Detroit Institute of
Arts, which claims that Rose, who died in 1975, had agreed to hand
over Howdy when he retired.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy was the star of ``The Howdy Doody Show,'' a television
program for children which ran from 1947 to 1960.Friday, lawyers
for the Rose family and the museum filed motions for summary
judgment, a way of asking Judge Christopher Droney to decide who
owns Howdy without calling in a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Droney allowed each side two more weeks to submit supporting
documents. After that, he will issue a decision, a process that
could take weeks or even months, lawyers said.

GIULIANI CALMER AMID TURBULENCE IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been one of the most turbulent weeks in Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's 55 years. He met with more doctors to determine
his treatment for prostate cancer, acknowledged at a news briefing
that he has a ``very good'' female friend, fended off questions
about his wife's postponement of her starring role in ``The Vagina
Monologues,'' and stepped outside the gates of Gracie Mansion
shortly before midnight on Wednesday to talk of his sadness at the
loss of a friend, Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   And, not least, he made two trips upstate in his campaign for
U.S. Senate against the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Next week promises more. Giuliani's advisers say the mayor's
campaign schedule and four big California fund-raisers in mid-May
give him until late next week to announce his plans for treatment
and indicate which way he is leaning about staying in the race.
Most of his advisers say his concerns about his health have made
the Senate race and the news about his female friend of the last
year, Judith Nathan, less important for now.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said as much on Friday during his weekly radio call-in
show. In response to a question from ``Keith from Washington
Heights,'' Giuliani recounted how he had been asked during a
campaign stop last week in Saratoga Springs whether he saw his
cancer as an opportunity to get out of the Senate race and run for
governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how profoundly off base all that is,''
Giuliani said. ``If you understand anything about someone that is
trying to focus on cancer, what it means, how to deal with it, how
to deal with it effectively, you would know that that becomes the
thing that you focus on as intelligently and as focused a way as
you possibly can. And that's what I'm doing. And it puts everything
almost in a sense of perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, City Hall advisers describe the self-contained
and often short-tempered mayor as unusually warm, solicitous and
even affectionate. ``He comes in in the morning and he'll throw his
arm around one of the deputy mayors and give him a hug,'' said one
mayoral adviser who requested anonymity because he did not want to
be identified as passing on City Hall secrets, even ones flattering
to the mayor. ``He says hello to everyone and shakes everyone's
hands. He seems happier. It's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers say that since Giuliani's announcement of his
diagnosis, he is listening more to them at staff meetings, thanking
them for their contributions and asking about their welfare. And
while no one is predicting that Giuliani's mood will last, he
himself addressed the change after his diagnosis in one of his
increasingly reflective, and friendly, comments to reporters last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it has changed me in any way,'' he said at a
campaign stop last weekend in Buffalo. ``I think when you face news
like this, and you absorb it, it changes you. I think it changes
you in a good way.''
</P>
<P>
   But his advisers, who last week said the mayor's battle with
cancer could give him the kick and focus he needed for the race,
are now saying they have no idea what he will do. Giuliani, they
said, does not yet know himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the advantages that I have, and it gets you through all
kinds of difficulties and problems and maybe it's the only way to
get through them, is to just be honest,'' Giuliani said in a long,
introspective answer to ``Keith from Washington Heights'' on his
radio show. ``You know, like, be honest with yourself, say what you
think, and then you can reflect on it that way personally, and you
don't end up dividing yourself into two or three different
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that he had spent most of Thursday ``going though
evaluations'' for his treatment, that he ``would very much like''
to run, and that he expected to raise as much as $32 million for
the race _ he already has $20 million. He added, ``I am not
thinking about any other office.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was a ``very, very strong supporter'' of Gov.
George Pataki, who ``in this difficulty'' had been ``very kind and
generous to me, above and beyond everything else.'' He added: ``If
you know me at all, you know that personal loyalty is the single
most important thing. Nothing is more important than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers and associates of the mayor say Giuliani, in
acknowledging his relationship with Nathan earlier this week,
evidently wanted it to become known, because he was taking her to
such highly public events as town hall meetings and the annual
Inner Circle dinner, which is attended by reporters, politicians
and hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers say that the acknowledgment was timed to get the
matter out in the open a full six months before the election, and
that it came at a time when Giuliani's battle with cancer had
generated much sympathy, even among his longtime enemies. Giuliani,
they said, could not be charged with political hypocrisy, because
he has not made ``family values'' a part of his campaign, and has
made no secret of his estrangement from his wife, Donna Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Minarik, the Monroe County Republican chairman, said
Friday in Rochester that Giuliani's relationship with Nathan was
getting no coverage in Rochester and that it would not matter to
voters. ``People don't care about the personal stuff,'' Minarik
said. ``I don't know what the mayor's relationship is with his
wife. I've never asked him. It's none of my business.''
</P>
<P>
   But one political consultant to Democrats and Republicans in New
York City said Friday that the mayor's relationship with Nathan
could harm him with women and Catholics upstate. ``I think there's
a tendency for women to look askance upstate in heavily Catholic
areas,'' the consultant said.

DIRT-TRACK MOTORCYCLE RACING STRIVING TO REGAIN RECOGNITION
</HEADLINE>
 TRACKS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Dirt-track motorcycle racing has a history
that predates the debut of the Indianapolis 500 in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   There is even some dirt track, or flat track, history in North
Texas, where motorcycle fans speak about Ross Downs with reverence.
Formerly located in Colleyville, Ross Downs was the training ground
for dirt-track motorcycle national champions Mike Kidd and Bubba
Shobert and the center of the sport in the Southwest through the
1970s. The quarter-mile track closed in the 1980s, and the land has
become one of the many subdivisions in ever-expanding Colleyville.
</P>
<P>
   This year finds dirt-track motorcycle racing at a crossroads.
Places such as Ross Downs are memories, and a form of motorcycle
racing that has a rich tradition and history is not experiencing
the type of growth as other forms of motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   When people think of motorcycle racing today they think of
Jeremy McGrath leaping on his Yamaha over a high jump at a
Supercross event, not Chris Carr sliding through a turn in excess
of 120 mph on his 750cc Harley-Davidson at a dirt-track race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an opportunity here to take a sport that is in need
of some repair and build it to what we have done with Supercross,''
said Kidd, a Fort Worth resident who is vice president of PACE
Motorsports. ``We need to have (dirt track motorcycle racing) in
the big venues, the nice venues in the major markets. In the long
run that will rebuild the grass roots of dirt racing and rekindle
places like Ross Downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is hoping that the Formula USA-sanctioned Wrenchead.com
National Dirt Track Series will be the tool that helps start the
repair work on dirt-track motorcycle racing.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural season for the series starts Saturday at the Texas
Motor Speedway Dirt Track with ``Motorcycle Mania.'' Saturday
night's event, which will feature motorcycle racing in the National
Championship and Pro Singles divisions, will be the first in an
11-race schedule that will run through October.
</P>
<P>
   Formula USA is part of PACE Motorsports, which has helped move
Supercross into the national spotlight by running at venues such as
Texas Stadium and the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. A crowd in
excess of 40,000 saw the Supercross event at Texas Stadium in early
April.
</P>
<P>
   That level of attendance in dirt-track motorcycle racing is
rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``PACE is a company that has a proven track record promoting
motorcycle races,'' said Carr, the 1999 American Motorcyclist
Association Grand National Dirt Track Series champion. ``There is
going to be some growing pains, but the racers understand that.
PACE is going to get it right and can take it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until this year, dirt-track races in the United States were
exclusively sanctioned by the long-established AMA. But many in the
dirt-track community feel the AMA has not been aggressive enough in
promoting the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Others have complained the prize money has not increased.
</P>
<P>
   That can't be said for the Wrenchead.com Series. Saturday's race
on the four-tenths mile dirt track features a purse in excess of
$40,000, with $7,500 going to the winner. In addition, the series'
points champion will earn $50,000 from a $150,000 fund.
</P>
<P>
   On 1-mile dirt tracks, riders will race for $50,000 in total
prize money. The winner will take home $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been talking about this for the last year, and about
five months ago they said they were going to have their first race
(in May),'' said Carr, of Fleetwood, Pa. ``The purse money has
almost doubled in the five months since PACE got involved. But you
cannot blame the AMA for the lack of growth. It was a combination
of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd said the Wrenchead.com Series was not formed to compete
directly against the AMA's established Grand National Series, as
only two race weekends conflict with the AMA schedule. Kidd said he
wants to show people other than motorcycle fans that dirt-track
motorcycle racing is exciting and give the sport its proper
recognition, starting with Saturday's event here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AMA is loyal to the historic dirt tracks and there are
some markets that I feel there is not growth potential,'' Kidd
said. ``This is a key event for us and we would like to be able to
show the motorcycle fans, the stock car fans (and) the football
fans that motorcycle racing is exciting.'' nn

KINGS OWNER GETS HIS PHIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings
could settle their differences on the court Friday, there was one
more volley in the battle of words. A day after Lakers coach Phil
Jackson called Sacramento fans ``semi-civilized'' and ``rednecks,''
Kings owner Joe Maloof took a few shots at the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Jackson is so damn arrogant,'' Maloof told Bloomberg
News. ``Wouldn't it be fun to see him at the podium explaining why
he lost? Would he ever say that he got outcoached? Would he say
that? I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Kings went down 0-2 in the series, Maloof took great
joy in seeing his team stun the Lakers - and Jackson - with two
straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil was just so cool the first two games, just having a ball
over there, standing up and doing that little whistle of his,''
Maloof said. ``When we beat him the first game, he was cowering in
the corner. When we beat him the second time, you should've just
seen his face.''
</P>
<P>
   In a final shot at Jackson - who coached Michael Jordan and the
Chicago Bulls to six championships - Maloof said, ``I'd like to see
Phil coach Vancouver. He's always had the greatest players in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson grinned slightly when asked to respond before Game 5 on
Friday. His thoughts? ``None,'' he said. ``I don't know the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this guy a gambler? Is that where he makes his money?''
Jackson said of Maloof, whose family owns a Las Vegas casino.
``He's a character builder.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the source of such venom from a team owner, Jackson said,
``I'm curious about that, too. Right now it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns sit: The Phoenix Suns are a big beneficiary of the Kings'
comeback in this series. They finished off the San Antonio Spurs on
Tuesday, then awaited the winner of the Lakers-Kings series. The
second round begins Sunday, giving the Suns' opponent precious
little time to recuperate and prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned about a long week with a layoff (of six days,
had the Lakers swept the series), and here I am playing right up
until Friday,'' Jackson said before tipoff. ``I think it's better
off to do it this way this time of year sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   A benefit for the Suns? ``Yeah, it is for them,'' Jackson said,
``but they don't know are we home or are we away?''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, of course, wouldn't say who they wanted to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people aren't fooled by the regular-season records,''
said Phoenix coach Scott Skiles. ``We were 0-4 against the Lakers
and 4-0 against the (Kings), but those things don't mean a thing
this time of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clutch appearance: A smiling Lakers executive Jerry West made a
quick trip through the locker room before the game, shaking hands
with Shaquille O'Neal, Glen Rice and Robert Horry.

ALL EYES ON FUSAICHI PEGASUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ When Fusaichi Pegasus, the would-be
superhorse, arrives at the starting gate for today's Kentucky
Derby, he will find it filling up with worthy foils - and some of
the meatiest subplots in years.
</P>
<P>
   Or should that say, if Fusaichi Pegasus arrives at the starting
gate?
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese-owned colt is known as much for his temperament
(unpredictable) as for his astounding yearling-auction price ($4
million) and his 3-year-old campaign (spotless, so far).
</P>
<P>
   He bucks playfully during morning gallops - he dumped a rider
and toppled over harmlessly last week - and can be a handful before
and after races. Jockey Kent Desormeaux had trouble getting him to
the starting point before the smashing Wood Memorial victory in New
York that stamped Fusaichi Pegasus as a solid Kentucky Derby
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus trainer Neil Drysdale accuses the press of
``hyperbole'' in describing the risk the horse's behavior will
hinder his chances or those of the other 18 Derby horses. But rival
trainers are thinking about it, especially as they picture 140,000
fans making noise in the Churchill Downs stands and infield on a
hot, sticky afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be the first time in history that we have to van
one to the gate,'' joked D. Wayne Lukas, the four-time
Derby-winning trainer who has High Yield, Exchange Rate and
Commendable in the 1-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want that horse to go over there (to the gate)
trouble-free,'' Lukas added. ``A, it's good for the game if he
runs. B, I'll have two of them (horses) back there waiting to
load.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, Fusaichi Pegasus could be ordered scratched by
the stewards if he threatened to hold up the start of the race. But
now we are guilty of hyperbole. That's highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, elected to the Racing Hall of Fame earlier this week,
insists he doesn't envision a problem. He said Fusaichi Pegasus is
an intelligent horse who ``just likes to look at things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got only 2 furlongs (one-quarter mile) between where he
gets on the track and the gate, and he's got 12 minutes to get
there,'' the trainer said. ``I think we can manage that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus will start from post 15. Drysdale selected an
outside post so the colt wouldn't have to stand in the gate for too
long. Other horses' handlers tried to avoid the slots next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Derby horses enter the gate in pairs - post 1 and 11, then 2 and
12, and so forth - so he'll load in the middle of a process that
can take a couple of minutes. He'll have to stay calm until the
starter lets the doors spring open.
</P>
<P>
   Then that subplot will end and the rest will take their shots -
Jenine Sahadi (The Deputy), trying to be the first female trainer
to win the Derby; Marlon St. Julien (Curule), the first
African-American jockey in the Derby since 1921; 88-year-old
trainer Harold Rose (Hal's Hope); the Dubai-based mystery horses
(China Visit and Curule); Lukas protege Todd Pletcher's foursome
(More Than Ready, Trippi, Graeme Hall, Impeachment); and Drysdale's
other horse (War Chant).
</P>
<P>
   This Derby would be intriguing enough without subplots. Fusaichi
Pegasus, 9-5 on the morning line, figures as the most popular
favorite since Arazi started at 9-10 and finished eighth in 1992.
``This is the first time in a long time that people are talking
about a Triple Crown ahead of time,'' said Tom Meeker, Churchill
Downs' CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a freak,'' said Alex Hassinger, trainer of Anees.
``Look how easy he's won.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus would be the first winning favorite in the
Derby since Spectacular Bid in 1979. He also would be the first
horse without a win at age 2 to win the Derby since Proud Clarion
in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Should he win, his reputation will be bolstered by the quality
of his opponents. If Fusaichi Pegasus doesn't fire - because of his
relative inexperience or because he's distracted - major prep
winners The Deputy (Santa Anita Derby), High Yield (Blue Grass
Stakes) head the list of logical beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Front-running Trippi, Hal's Hope, High Yield and Graeme Hall
figure to force a fast pace, stretching out the field and
preventing the kind of first-turn traffic jam that jumbled the 1999
Derby won by Charismatic. Fusaichi Pegasus and The Deputy figure to
be among those tracking the leaders. Aptitude, Anees, Deputy
Warlock and Impeachment will try to make late impacts.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus' balkiness on the way to the starting gate is
matched by his antics on the way to the winner's circle. But
significantly, he has visited that circle four times in five
starts, meaning he's acting just fine during his races. Drysdale
has sounded optimistic as he prepares to run his first Derby
horses, having had to scratch a sore-footed A.P. Indy on the
morning of the race in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be good to be back,'' Drysdale said, ``when they're both
in the gate.''

POLLARD STEPS UP FOR BURN DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Burn defender Brandon Pollard admits his excitement last
week about his first significant playing time of the season might
have been a bit overzealous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off,''
Pollard said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard's window of playing opportunity opened for the same
reason he had been on the bench this season: an injury. When Eric
Dade went down with a strained back in the 20th minute Saturday
against Columbus, Pollard got his chance and saw his first
significant playing time since breaking his right leg during last
season's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard eventually settled down and helped stifle the Crew in
the Burn's 2-1 victory. And he has had plenty of time to prepare
for his role as a starter in Saturday's game at Tampa Bay. Four of
the Burn's defensive players will likely be out with injuries,
leaving Pollard and Ricardo Iribarren as the only two healthy
defenders available.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Farrer's strained back kept him out of training all
week, and Dade isn't likely to be available. The Burn is also
missing two defensive midfielders, Sergi Daniv (fractured rib) and
Mark Santel (strained quadriceps). Santel could be out two more
weeks, Burn coach Dave Dir said. Defender Jorge Rodriguez is with
the El Salvador national team.
</P>
<P>
   The patchwork back line, which might also tap the services of
midfielders Chad Deering or Ted Eck, hasn't played a full game
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly can't expect there to be much rhythm in a lineup
that hasn't been together much before,'' Pollard said. ``But in
situations like these, you have to concentrate on being very
disciplined and not taking too many chances. Certainly
communication is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Dir noted improved chemistry in the defense Saturday,
specifically good communication from Rodriguez, who filled in at
sweeper for Farrer.
</P>
<P>
   Deering might fill that role today because he has some
experience playing defense. He trained at sweeper this week and
seemed to be a good fit, Pollard said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important for the Burn will be the overall ability of
the rest of the team to play with a focus on defense. The Mutiny
(4-4) has outscored opponents 14-3 in four games at Raymond James
Stadium and boasts a midfield that includes dangerous playmakers
Carlos Valderrama and Steve Ralston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take all 10 guys defending smartly, and helping
one another out,'' said Eck, who might have to mark Valderrama.
``If one side doesn't get closed off, they'll go down the other
side, and attack out of the back as well. It's going to be a key
that all 10 of us defend.'' nn

BILL MUSSELMAN, 59, INTENSE BASKETBALL COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ore., Minn., Ala.)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Musselman, who in the last 35 years held 13 head coaching
jobs in college and professional basketball and left an imprint
everywhere as a volatile, intense taskmaster, died Friday at the
Mayo Clinic's St. Marys Hospital in Rochester, Minn. He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   A Mayo Clinic spokesman said the cause of death was heart and
kidney failure related to liver disease. Musselman suffered a
stroke last October. Last month he received a diagnosis of multiple
myeloma, cancer of the bone marrow. His doctors said he also had
amyloidosis, which causes the liver to produce an abnormal protein
that attacks body organs.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three seasons, he was an assistant coach of the
Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA. When the Trail Blazers played
the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of this year's
playoffs, he wanted to sit behind the Trail Blazers' bench, but his
doctors would not let him leave the hospital. On Tuesday night,
when the Trail Blazers won the series, their players and coaches
signed the game ball as a gift to him.
</P>
<P>
   His biography, by Bill Heller, was aptly titled ``Obsessed.'' He
slept three to five hours a night because he would not spare more
time from work. For four years he kept a VCR at the foot of his bed
so he could watch game film until he drifted off to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Musselman became the head coach at Ashland University in
Ohio, where his team set an NCAA record by allowing an average of
only 33.9 points a game over a season. In six seasons at Ashland
(1965-71), four at Minnesota (1971-75) and two at South Alabama
(1995-97), his teams won 233 games and lost 84.
</P>
<P>
   He brought Minnesota its first Big Ten title in 53 years,
sold-out arenas, 127 NCAA violations and a 1972 brawl that sent
three Ohio State players to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, he coached the Cleveland Cavaliers for two seasons
(1980-82) and became the first coach of the expansion Minnesota
Timberwolves (1989-91). His NBA record was 78-180. He also coached
professionals in the American Basketball Association, the Western
Basketball Association and the Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   William Clifford Musselman was born Aug. 13, 1940, in Wooster,
Ohio. He was a decent high school athlete whose basketball team
fared well against a neighboring team led by Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   At Wittenberg University, Musselman, 5 feet 10 inches and 175
pounds, lettered in basketball, football and baseball. He received
a bachelor's degree from Wittenberg and a master's in education
from Kent State.
</P>
<P>
   One regret, he said, was not spending more time with his family.
He is survived by his wife, Julie; their son, Max; and a son, Eric,
and a daughter, Nicole, from a previous marriage. Eric is an
assistant coach for the Orlando Magic of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Musselman's players enjoyed him. Sidney Lowe, an
assistant coach of the Timberwolves who played on three of
Musselman's CBA champion teams, said he liked the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a Bill Musselman player to play for him,'' Lowe
once said. ``He wants guys he can put together like a chain,
linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Musselman once explained his intensity this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love competition. I don't know why. A lot of people don't
like competition. They'd rather go set up a business down the block
where there's no competition. I want my business where there's
three other guys doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the intense man could laugh at himself, too. Once, he was
asked the most irrational thing he had ever done. The answer came
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach basketball,'' he said.

REPUBLICANS WEIGHING BUDGET PROPOSALS; LEADING THE RACE FOR NO. 2;
A QUESTION OF INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS WEIGHING BUDGET PROPOSALS
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas began a news conference in San
Diego on Friday with some heavy lifting: He waved two thick books
that represented budget proposals he had sent to the Texas
Legislature in 1997 and 1999, and he lit into Vice President Al
Gore anew for suggesting that he did not produce such extensive
spending blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   The props in his hand, Bush said, proved otherwise, and featured
``a lot of line items _ there's a lot of pages, there's a lot of
numbers.'' Only the day before, Gore had pulled from his pocket a
three-page document that he said was a copy of Bush's 1995 budget,
telling a reporter that ``if you think that's a budget, then maybe
I can convince you it's a duck.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush turned to examples from later years and said that he was
wishing fervently for a campaign ``not full of hyperbole and
distortion.''
</P>
<P>
   LEADING THE RACE FOR NO. 2
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore remain
tight-lipped about running mates, but an NBC News-Wall Street
Journal poll has found that most voters have already made up their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans and independents, 40 percent want Bush to pick
Colin Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 20
percent favor Sen. John McCain of Arizona and 15 percent favor
Elizabeth Dole, the former president of the Red Cross. (Both Powell
and McCain insist that they are not interested.)
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats and independents, 33 percent want Gore to pick
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and 18 percent favor Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California. The poll surveyed 1,003 registered
voters from April 29 to May 1. It has a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A QUESTION OF INFLUENCE
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly this year, interest groups as prominent as the
National Rifle Association and as obscure as Republicans for Clean
Air are running television commercials intended to influence
elections.
</P>
<P>
   This week Karl J. Sandstrom, a Democratic member of the Federal
Election Commission, proposed that these groups be required to say
whom they represented and where the money came from to pay for the
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will provide grist for a commission discussion
later this month. But do not count on the matter going anywhere.
Experts on election law say the commission probably has no
authority to order the interest groups to report on their affairs.
And if the commission tried to exercise the authority, Congress
would probably block the move.

D.A. RAIDS OFFICERS' HOMES IN RAMPART PROBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT AND GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over LAPD's objections, gun-toting teams of
district attorney's investigators swept Friday into the homes of at
least 17 LAPD officers in search of evidence of crimes related to
the Rampart Division corruption scandal, the police union and
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The raids were carried out by the District Attorney's Office,
which obtained search warrants after police investigators
reportedly refused to go before a judge to request them - the usual
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD investigators balked because they didn't feel the searches
were merited and wouldn't gather significant evidence to support
charges against the officers, sources said. Officers went on the
raids as observers only, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the items seized during the searches
characterized them as mostly ``trinkets'' of seemingly minimal
value to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't appear to be items of significance,'' one source
said.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin said the
raids were a joint operation in which LAPD detectives accompanied
county investigators. She declined comment as to whether the police
had refused to sign the warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were executed as part of the ongoing corruption probe,''
she said. Investigators were looking for notes, photographs,
T-shirts, plaques, mugs and other paraphernalia that could link the
officers to suspected crimes committed by the now infamous Rampart
Division anti-gang unit, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The raids came two weeks after District Attorney Gil Garcetti
filed criminal charges against three former Rampart officers, the
first such charges related to the worst police scandal in city
history. At least an additional 20 officers are under investigation
and more charges are expected to be filed in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part Friday, the searches were handled quietly.
During at least one raid, however, guns were drawn; at another, an
officer was forced to leave his home wearing only his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's Office initiated the coordinated raids
across the region at 7 a.m. and also searched the officers' lockers
at Los Angeles Police Department divisions across the city.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive move prompted an immediate outcry from the Los
Angeles Police Protective League and the officers' attorneys, who
called the searches heavy-handed and abusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a naked abuse of power and authority,'' PPL
President Ted Hunt charged, adding that investigators came away
with ``really trivial stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the searches an ``egregious and blatantly political act
on the part of the district attorney,'' Hunt added in a statement
that the investigators acted in an ``unprofessional and brutish''
manner despite the officers' full cooperation in the past and their
presumption of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, the district attorney ordered his investigators
to present themselves with guns drawn in a combat stance in front
of children; forced an officer to stand outside on his front lawn
in his undershirt and shorts; and an officer's elderly father was
physically pushed around. Another officer's home was searched
without a proper search warrant,'' a search that was therefore
illegal, Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Protective League president said the items taken
included ``T-shirts, personal notes, photographs and family
financial records.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyola Law School Professor Laurie Levenson said the raids were
consistent with - though not necessarily indicative of - a tactic
to gather the kind of evidence that might bolster a conspiracy
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an aggressive investigative technique,'' Levenson said.
``It does seem to indicate a broad scope to the investigation, and
while one can't say for sure, it would be consistent with a
conspiracy charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys and sources told the Los Angeles Daily News
the district attorney's investigators were running the operation,
with LAPD detectives acting only as observers.
</P>
<P>
   In most search warrant applications, police investigators go
before the judge. But in this case it was prosecutors who asked
that the warrants be issued, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish declined comment, referring
inquiries to the District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were not notified prior to the raids, their
attorneys said. But other private defense lawyers indicated they
have been told similar searches would continue over the weekend.
Defense attorney Barry Levin said his client was told to expect his
home to be searched Friday afternoon or later.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Paul DePasquale confirmed the homes of fired cop Brian
Hewitt and Sgt. Brian Liddy, who was charged last month with
criminal wrongdoing, were raided. DePasquale said he had not seen
the warrants but had spoken with at least one of his clients. Both
officers have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surmise it was anything that relates to Rampart CRASH,''
DePasquale said, referring to the now disbanded Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums anti-gang unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand, for example, it was interpreted so widely as to
include pirate flags from Disneyland and T-shirts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said his client Sgt. Edward Ortiz was expecting his home
to be searched Friday afternoon. Ortiz also has been charged with
criminal wrongdoing, which he has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Levin called the searches ``hysterical vengeance'' on the part
of the District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like a one-man band; they seem to be doing everything
humanly possible to prejudice a potential jury determination by the
people of this county,'' Levin said. ``I think their actions are
going to result in the deprivation of the citizens of Los Angeles
deciding this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaks they've been responsible for in the media, the
extreme position they're taking in respect to this case, the
reckless and irresponsible statements, all are trampling all over
the due process rights of individuals who enjoy the presumption of
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin charged the District Attorney's Office has gone beyond its
prosecutorial responsibilities and is acting as a law enforcement
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the searches, he said, teams of district
attorney's investigators staked out Ortiz's home during the days
before he was charged on April 24 with a criminal conspiracy to
commit perjury and falsify a police report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The D.A. wanted to make a real spectacle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Levin, Ortiz will cooperate with the search. He
said he expects the investigators will look for ``junk, knowing how
the District Attorney's Office has operated so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be looking for the ridiculous to the sublime, from
mugs and patches to memorabilia given to officers for working
CRASH,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Joel R. Isaacson confirmed his client, Officer
Paul Harper, who also was charged with criminal misconduct last
month, had his home searched. Harper has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Another private defense lawyer, Patrick Thistle, confirmed the
home of one of his clients was searched, but he would not name the
officer. Thistle said he read one of the search warrants. The
document specified that investigators were searching for field
officers' notebooks, photographs and other documentation of the
officers' on-duty work at Rampart, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other search warrants were said to have specified plaques, as
well as mugs taken from beer parties in which the officers
supposedly took part after a few questionable shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously a D.A. operation,'' Thistle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to do what they're going to do,'' he added. ``I
think it's heavy-handed.''
