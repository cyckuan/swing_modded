   The Cat in the Hat's red-and-white-striped leaning tower of a
stove-pipe has become an American icon only slightly less
recognizable than the Disney mouse ears,'' contemporary cartoonist
Art Spiegelman (author of ``Maus'') writes in the introduction to
this eye-opening picture book for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the slightly battered lid on the Seuss bird that
represents the United States,'' Spiegelman writes, ``is
disorienting enough to bring on an epiphany: the prototype for the
cat's famous headgear is actually an emblem deployed in countless
political cartoons: Uncle Sam's red-and-white top hat! The Cat in
the Hat is America!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-necked ``Seuss bird'' is everywhere in this collection
of political cartoons, and so are prototypes of nearly all of the
other familiar Dr. Seuss characters, including Lorax and Yertl the
Turtle, the circus fish and the ubiquitous whale, but here they are
pressed into service as characters in single-panel political
satires.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss, it turns out, began his career as a cartoonist for
the famous experimental daily newspaper of New York in the 1940s,
``PM,''perhaps the last left-wing paper in the country of any
circulation before it turned toes-up in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known, as we read these books to our kids and
grandkids through the decades of the Cold War, that the long-necked
Seuss bird probably made his first appearance on Sept. 22, 1941,
with a sign, ``I am part Jewish'' hanging from his beak! For it
turns out that Theodor Seuss Geisel, son of German immigrant
Republicans, was an ardent anti-fascist and critic of
America-Firsters, anti-Semites and non-interventionists of every
stripe.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't remember America First, it was a group of
both conservatives and liberals who opposed getting into the war in
Europe, and among its leading members was Charles Lindbergh,
against whom Seuss directed volley after withering volley, as in
the cartoon of July 16, 1941, that featured the familiar whale with
the big eyes. Here the whale is presented as a fish out of water,
an ``isolationist'' whale who lives way up on top of a mountain:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(EDITOR: QUOTED LINES:) Said a whale, ``There is so much commotion,
</P>
<P>
   Such fights among fish in the ocean,
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving my scalp
</P>
<P>
   Living high on an Alp . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Dear Lindy! He gave me a notion!)''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eight years after his death, Dr. Seuss still has more than 50-plus
titles still in print, and, in fact, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' is said
to be the third-largest selling book in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   This collection, with commentary by Richard H. Minear, is an
illuminating look at the politics of the early 1940s from an oddly
familiar voice, and it may even provide some clues to the deeper
meanings of the good doctor's less obviously political children's
tales. &QL;

REPUBLICANS CANDIDATES GATHER FOR COURTEOUS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Resisting their first opportunity to spar directly
with each other on national television, six Republican presidential
candidates instead treated each other on Monday night rather
courteously as they touted their stands on foreign policy, taxes,
education and campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in a Republican forum in New Hampshire last week, where
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas shared the stage for the first time
with his rivals, this time the contenders were far more subtle in
contrasting themselves with the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush drew criticism in that event for too often
drawing from his stump speech, he did not put those questions to
rest on Monday night. He appeared a bit more at ease this time but
still offered rather rote responses on matters from his tax-cutting
plan to foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he had learned about foreign policy from a biography
of Dean Acheson _ Bush said last week he was reading the book _ the
goveor repeated from his standard speech and gave no specifics
about Acheson, the secretary of state from 1949 to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, he said, ``is that our nation's greatest export to
the world has been, is and always will be the incredible freedoms
we understand in the great land called America.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Sen. John McCain of Arizona seized the
opportunity to demonstrate his mastery of foreign affairs and
history. He answered a question by saying: ``Let me talk about Dean
Acheson for a second. When Dean Acheson walked into Harry Truman's
office in June of 1950 and said, `North Korea's attacked South
Korea,' Harry Truman didn't take a poll. Harry Truman knew what we
had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For about half of the debate at the Orpheum Theater, the
competitors were allowed to quiz one another. But mostly their
questions sounded like recitals of their own credentials. The
event, which lasted about 75 minutes, was carried live on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeatedly talked about recasting the image of the
Republican Party as a compassionate party that cared about everyone
_ and he underscored his concern for the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has emerged as a potent rival to Bush in New
Hampshire, trumpeted his prescriptions to reform the campaign
finance system. Although he was hooked up to the event by satellite
from a television studio near Boston, McCain _ as he did last week
_ seemed particularly comfortable fielding questions.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher, sought to establish his
conservative credentials and hawk his plans for the economy. Gary
L. Bauer, who headed a grass-roots conservative group, played up
his crusade against most-favored-nation status for China because of
human rights abuses. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah spoke often about his
seasoning after years in the Senate. And Alan Keyes, a former State
Department official, pressed his conservativism.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidates had the opportunity to ask questions, it was
no surprise that the first up, Bauer, turned his attention to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer asked Bush why he, like President Clinton, favored more
open trade with China, as opposed to a sharper confrontation with
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give people a breath of freedom, a taste of freedom, I
think you'll be amazed, Gary, at how soon democracy will come,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer asked, ``Is there no atrocity that you can think of that
would tell you to put trade on the back burner?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in perhaps his most spirited answer, replied: ``If we turn
our back on China and try to isolate China, things will get worse.
Imagine if the Internet took hold in China. Imagine how freedom
will spread.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor used his question, to Hatch, to boast about how in
Texas he had draw significant support from Hispanic voters. ``I
think Governor Bush deserves a lot of credit,'' Hatch said. But the
senator went on to say that many people had suggested that Bush
would be a perfect vice president given that Hatch had more foreign
policy experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have eight years with me,'' Hatch said to Bush.
``Boy, you'd make a heck of a president after eight years.'' The
audience erupted in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the good manners seemed forced. When Forbes told Bush
he could call him Steve, the governor _ who is not known as being
particularly fond of the publisher _ did not know quite what to
say. Later in the evening, McCain joked that he did not know
whether to call the governor ``George,'' ``W'' or ``Bush'' or
``whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   In his question for McCain, Bush promoted his proposal for tax
incentives for faith-based institutions. McCain complimented the
governor's proposal. But he tried to draw a contrast by suggesting
that Bush relied on rosy, and perhaps unrealistic, projections of
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference,'' McCain said. ``I do not envision
surpluses forever.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first round of questions for all six candidates concerned
education, and each candidate used his response principally as an
opportunity to state his general views on the federal government's
role in public education. Those views were alike to the point of
being nearly identical: all the candidates emphasized clear, finite
limits to federal involvement and many advocated at least some
experimentation with vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bauer and Keyes rued the flight of prayer and religion from
classrooms( with Bauer citing that as a reason for violence in
schools. ``I don't think this is a gun problem, as some might
suggest,'' Bauer said. ``I think it's a problem of the heart and
sOul.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes agreed, saying, ``Since we took prayer out, we seem to
have let violence and decline in.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hatch and Bush talked up the virtues of vouchers, although
Bush did not use that word. Bush reiterated his frequently stated
belief that schools that receive federal funds should face
consequences if the children in those schools are failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if the federal government spends money on the
poorest of the poor children, we need to ask a simple question,''
said Bush. ``What are the results? What are the results?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was reminded of a statement he has repeatedly made that
good teachers should make more than bad senators, whose salary will
raise to $140,000 in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that I would never allege that there are any bad
senators,'' McCain joked. Then, making light of questions that have
been raised about his temper, added: ``I win Miss Congeniality
every year in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a move to prevent his rivals from ganging up on Bush, CNN set
ground rules that prohibited the candidates from all using their
allocated question for another candidate on the same person.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not travel to Arizona to share the stage with his
competitors because, his campaign said, he had long-scheduled
events in New Hampshire and New York on Monday and Tuesday but CNN
agreed to include him by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the civility of the discourse compared to last week,
there were a handful of thinly-disguised digs at Bush. ``Instead of
running on their name or their wealth,'' Mr. Keyes said at one
point. ``Let's seem them run on their abilities, as I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen,'' Hatch said.

MIDWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE NAMES NEW PRESIDENT AND CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
<TEXT>
<P>
   James L. Spigarelli has been named the new president and chief
executive officer of Midwest Research Institute, the Kansas
City-based center for applied science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Spigarelli joined Midwest Research Institute in 1970 and has
held research and line management positions. He had served as chief
operating officer since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Spigarelli holds bachelor of arts and master of science degrees
from Pittsburg State University and a doctorate in chemistry from
Kansas State University, where he was a National Science Foundation
fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Kipp, chairman of the board of the research institute,
said Spigarelli's strong science and management background would be
important to the institute's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this quickly changing world, spurred on more and more by
sophisticated technologies, Spigarelli's science background will
ensure that Midwest Research Institute maintains and enhances its
highly respected position in the research community,'' Kipp said.
</P>
<P>
   Kipp said Spigarelli had demonstrated a keen ability to
establish business relationships and alliances with universities,
government and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Spigarelli succeeds John McKelvey, the institute's president and
CEO since 1975. McKelvey announced his end-of-the-year retirement
at the institute's annual meeting in May.

POLICE PLAN TO KEEP MIRANDA WARNING, WHATEVER COURT DOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE and TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be
used against you in a court of law....''
</P>
<P>
   The protection afforded by those words, perhaps the best-known
phrases in American police work, will be reviewed by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court on Monday decided to tackle the groundbreaking
question of whether its 1966 ruling that produced the Miranda
warning _ designed to stop forced confessions by giving suspects
the right to a lawyer's help _ was rendered moot by a long-ignored
law Congress passed in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Greg Mills, who oversees the Violent Crimes Division for
the Kansas City Police Department, argued that Miranda should
remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the Miranda ruling should be thrown out the
window,'' Mills said. ``I don't think...it's hampered our ability
to question suspects and get confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's Miranda decision, named for the late Ernesto
Miranda, a career criminal in Phoenix, flowed from the Fifth
Amendment's guarantee that no one ``shall be compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The court was more liberal then than it is today, and civil
rights advocates hailed the decision. Police and conservatives
argued it would hamstring crime-fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But the court never explicitly said the police warning was
required by the Fifth Amendment. In 1968, Congress passed a law,
known as Section 3501, that states that failure to issue a Miranda
warning does not mean that any evidence obtained must be tossed
out. However, that provision received little attention at the time
and has been ignored since.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they would rule by this summer whether Section
3501 effectively overruled the Miranda decision.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri and Kansas, prosecutors and defense experts say they
hope the Miranda ruling stands. Miranda, they argue, does not often
interfere with criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   They say Miranda is good public relations for authorities
because the public is aware that confessions and evidence must be
obtained according to certain standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more important than making sure people in law
enforcement are viewed as the good guys,'' said Cass County
Prosecutor Chris Koster. ``To go back to the days prior to Miranda
puts our credibility at risk, and no one wants to go in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the court does, law enforcement officials may
continue to recite the warning. Use of Miranda is one more sign
that a confession or piece of evidence is not obtained under
duress, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become as common as putting your seat belt on,'' said
Clay County Sheriff Bob Boydston. ``I don't see us giving it up
that easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Close, the lawyer for the Kansas City Police Department,
said he would recommend that officers continue reciting Miranda
even if the high court does not require it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better way do you have to go before a judge several
months later and say a confession was voluntary?'' Close said.
</P>
<P>
   The court might cut away at Miranda, ``but police will still say
it to be cautious and err on the side of safety and
admissibility,'' said Platte County Prosecutor Todd Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a suspect talked to investigators rarely hinged on
whether the Miranda warning was issued, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most know their rights, and they're either going to talk to
you or not,'' said Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison.

AUDIT QUESTIONS SICK-LEAVE EXPENSES IN POLICE DEPARTMENT  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Police Department spent almost $4 million
in the last two fiscal years compensating retiring officers on
accumulated sick leave, a figure MIssouri Auditor Claire McCaskill
called ``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clunky, aging cruisers _ some with far more than 100,000 miles _
are also fixed to the tune of thousands of dollars instead of being
replaced, she told the Board of Police Commissioners on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those areas _ in addition to trimming spending on department
gifts or tables at charitable functions _ topped McCaskill's list
of areas for improvement in the department's use of taxpayer
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The state audit focused on the two fiscal years that ended April
30, 1999. Police board members and department staff members have
pledged to look into the issues she raised and examine solutions
suggested by her staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years covered by the audit, the department spent
close to $4 million to compensate retiring employees for their
accumulated unused sick leave. In one case, the audit stated, a
retiree was paid $103,200.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill said she understood the department was probably using
the buyouts to prevent employees from using sick leave
inappropriately. She also acknowledged that the department was
following the city policy. There have been no department studies or
other evidence, however, showing that sick leave buyout programs
are an effective way to reduce use of sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other metropolitan law enforcement agencies in the
nation, Kansas City's policy is excessive, she said. Other
departments either offer less money for the accumulated sick leave
or have no buyout program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department's policy is liberal and an expensive one,''
said McCaskill. ``No other department had the buyout program
implemented here.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternatives to encourage employees not to use sick leave, she
said, could include continuing the buyout program but phasing in a
cap on maximum payouts, reducing the payout levels for sick days,
or counting unused sick leave as additional months of service
toward the calculation of retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The department could cut costs by one-quarter or even one-half
if it followed, for example, St. Louis' policy, which simply pays
less for accumulated sick days. Board members said the department
would take up the issue with the City Council at a Thursday
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, City Councilwoman Teresa Loar said that if
the council changed the sick-leave policy for the Police
Department, it should be changed for all departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to do it for specific departments,'' she said.
Some changes ``are certainly something we could take a look at, to
see if that would be beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   That sick-leave money saved, McCaskill said, could help the
department bolster other areas, such as replacing an aging fleet of
about 750 vehicles, from cruisers to motorcycles. An average
department vehicle is more than 6 years old, auditors noted, with
an odometer reading of about 100,000 miles. About 157 vehicles
exceed 150,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   In the years audited, the department spent about $2.5 million on
new vehicles, including 94 new cars and a $300,000 command-post
bus. That money is either approved by City Council or comes from
other grant sources. But the audit noted that ``the department has
not adopted a vehicle replacement plan which sets guidelines for
the retirement of police vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to maintaining the fleet, McCaskill told the
board, ``we found a number of instances that are particularly
troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the department spent about $10,000 to repair a 1996
Ford Crown Victoria with more than 77,000 miles. Another time the
department dropped $8,000 to fix another 1992 Ford Crown Victoria
that had exceeded 160,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the department has repaired vehicles which should
have been considered for retirement,'' the audit stated.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill recommended that the department look into buying
several used Highway Patrol vehicles, which are already fully
equipped and usually sell with 50,000 miles on them, because they
would be more cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   Department staff members responded in the audit that they had
raised the issue of an aging fleet with City Council, which funds
their department. The normal appropriation from the city for
vehicle appropriations is $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Loar, who sits on the Operations Committee that oversees the
fleet, said she would be in favor of providing the department with
more money for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any place I want to spend money, that is it,'' she
said. ``I want the fleet ready to go when we need them.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit also raised questions about the department's spending
on gifts and nonprofit functions. Department officials approved
spending about $50,000 in the audit period for items _ such as
flowers, cakes, cookies, fruit baskets and retirement rings _ where
a public purpose was not demonstrated or documented.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the items were for ``morale building'' events
from retirements to comforting a departed officer's bereaved
family, McCaskill said the command staff should look into ways to
offset those costs by tapping into staff good will or other private
sources.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, she noted, was money the department gave to
nonprofits _ $7,050 in the two years _ for annual dinner banquet
tables.
</P>
<P>
   Said McCaskill: ``It is frankly unnecessary for governments to
spend tax money on those types of activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidding practices also were not followed consistently, the audit
stated. The department requires competitive bidding for contracts
of $25,000 or more. But the department contracted with Arthur
Andersen for information technology services at a cost of $63,135.
Because the work was consulting, the department contended it did
not have to bid the work. Auditors disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Using consultants, McCaskill told the board ``does not relieve
you of the responsibility to bid out.''

MCCAIN IS FIERY, DRIVEN BUT `STABLE,' RECORDS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After his years as a Vietnam prisoner of war, John
McCain grappled with a quick temper and an ``unrealistically high''
need for achievement, but he was not diagnosed with any psychiatric
disorder, according to newly released medical records.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who had twice made feeble efforts at suicide when he
neared his breaking point in a Hanoi prison camp, was not inclined
to seek counseling after he was released in 1973, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an ``Arizona Republic reporter'' was given permission
to inspect the medical records but was not permitted to make
copies. Over the weekend, McCain showed his medical records to
selected reporters at the Associated Press and the ``New York
Times'' under the same conditions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ``will probably not seek psychiatric aid,'' said a 1973
psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He prides himself on handling his own problems although
underneath this is marked, unmet dependency,'' the report said.
``He would probably seek aid first if needed from various friends
and acquaintances.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual evaluations, which date back to 1973, indicate McCain
adjusted well after his release from a Hanoi POW camp and was
diagnosed as ``stable,'' but that he had some lingering issues
after his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1973 psychological questionnaire that had asked, ``What
traits do you have that others object to?'' McCain wrote, ``quick
temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Another psychiatric evaluation, this one from 1974, also
suggested McCain had problems controlling his temper, but concluded
that he had made progress during captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learned to control his temper better,'' said the evaluation
by Navy psychiatrist P.F. O'Connell. O'Connell wrote that McCain
had learned ``to not become angry over insignificant things: not
`to go to the mat' over some minor provocation by a guard that
resulted in needless torture.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also had an ``unrealistically high'' need for
achievement, the 1973 evaluation said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may tend to expect too much of himself and take it hard
when/if things don't go as planned,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Annual evaluations were conducted routinely on POWs by Florida's
Naval Aerospace Medical Institute, which has a center devoted to
POW studies.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluations were made available by McCain's presidential
campaign as part of about 1,500 pages of his medical records.
</P>
<P>
   The medical records also indicate that McCain has ``orthopedic
limitations'' resulting from his wartime injuries, but he is
generally healthy. He had a malignant melanoma, a form of cancer,
removed from his left shoulder in 1993, but there has been no
evidence of recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   He also suffers from arthritis in his shoulders and right knee,
which were injured when he ejected over North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's temper has become an issue in the presidential
campaign. His aides have noted that the evaluations were from long
ago, and that he has worked on preventing outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 26 years ago,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's
communications director. ``The most important part of these
records, as they relate to John McCain's temper, is the analysis
from, the psychiatrist (O'Connell) who says that Lieutenant McCain
learned to control his temper while in prison in order to avoid
unnecessary beatings at the hands of his guards.''
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as it was to be imprisoned and tortured, the
experience actually seems to have helped McCain, in an ironic way,
to establish his own identity apart from his father, who was a
four-star admiral, according to the records.
</P>
<P>
   As a POW, McCain ``learned more about himself, about others,
felt that he and his values had been tested, and was reassured that
he had met the challenge successfully and that he had finally
climbed out from under'' the shadow of his father, the 1974 review
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plane was shot down over Hanoi in October 1967. He was
held, often in solitary confinement, until March 1973.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's now-deceased father was devoted to the Navy, and became
head of the Pacific fleet while his son, now an Arizona senator and
presidential contender, was a POW.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he loved and admired his father, even if his dad
wasn't around much when his son was growing up. McCain was placed
in boarding school when he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since realizing that he was the son of a famous, highly
successful Naval officer and although proud of his father, he has
been preoccupied with escaping being in the shadow of his father
and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of
others,'' O'Connell wrote. ``He feels his experiences and
performance as a POW have finally permitted this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluations continued into the 1980s. In 1979, when McCain
was 42, the review concluded he was proceeding ``confidently'' and
``with a touch of aggressiveness that suggests a little
compensation or Oedipal rivalry, but also with a great deal of
moral concern and feeling of responsibility for the world he lives
in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oedipal rivalry'' refers to tension between a son and his
father.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the McCain campaign showed signs of temper-fatigue.
Several surrogates for the senator took the stage in the press room
at the Arizona debate to let reporters know it was time to back
off.
</P>
<P>
   `We think it's time to put that issue to rest,'' said Sen. Jon
Kyl, McCain's national campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't think it's any longer relevant to the campaign,''
Kyl said. &QL;

BLUE CROSS SENDS CONTRACT AMENDMENTS TO ALL PLAN DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH and PAUL WENSKE  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In its most far-reaching effort in recent
memory to renegotiate physician contracts, Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Kansas City on Monday mailed contract amendments to all
3,200 doctors in its health plan networks.
</P>
<P>
   The area's largest health insurer took the action after at least
1,000 of the doctors, in a rare show of protest, declined to sign
or delayed signing the contracts that govern how they work with
Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Mascotte, president and chief executive officer of Blue
Cross, told reporters that the health-care insurer was ``trying to
demonstrate to doctors that we are willing to make changes _ to
work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors reacted with cautious optimism, viewing the move as an
assurance that Blue Cross intended to work through sticking points
without disrupting patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no small thing for Kansas City,'' said Deborah
Jantsch, president of the Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater
Kansas City. ``In some ways, this is a landmark event. Let's not
make light of it. We were at an impasse.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the changes is a guarantee that payments to
physicians will not decline for one year. Blue Cross officials also
said they were open to ideas on whether doctors or insurers should
decide what constitutes medically necessary care. However, changes
may not be made in that area before the deadline for doctors to
sign and return their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross emphasized that coverage of doctor bills for its
750,000 members in about 30 counties would not be interrupted
during the negotiations, which could continue for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent a great deal of time listening to physicians,
discussing their concerns and looking for ways to address those
concerns,'' Tom Bowser, Blue Cross's executive vice president and
chief operating officer, said in a press release Monday. ``That has
resulted in the contract adjustments we are announcing today.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who declined to renew their contracts had said that the
contracts unfairly restricted their medical practices. Those
doctors had been scheduled to get termination notices in early
December, with the notices taking effect in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the amendment mailed Monday, Blue Cross said doctors now
had until January to sign their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who are sent termination notices after that still will
have 90 to 120 days to reconsider. They also will remain in Blue
Cross network directories through the grace period, allowing them
to continue caring for Blue Cross subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The delay ``is a very positive thing,'' said Jantsch, ``because
it will give individual practice groups time to discuss changes
with the plan without the threat of termination hanging over their
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   It also gives assurance of care to patients, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients have been very alarmed by this since it became
public,'' she said. Some had written their congressional
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The contract amendment includes these changes:
</P>
<P>
   - Blue Cross guarantees that doctors' payments will not decline
for one year.
</P>
<P>
   - Blue Cross clarifies requirements on physicians ``personally
performing'' services. This involves situations such as doctors
supervising nurses who give injections.
</P>
<P>
   - Blue Cross limits its authority to require continuing medical
education beyond state requirements.
</P>
<P>
   - Blue Cross will pay for copies of certain records, such as
reports on surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross is inviting doctors to submit ideas for resolving the
medical-necessity issue. This has been a concern of doctors who
think that Blue Cross and other insurance companies wield too much
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new physician agreements have essentially the same
definition of medical necessity as the existing agreements,'' said
Bowser. ``Our language is consistent with that used by other
insurance companies and by Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bowser said Blue Cross agreed with doctors that
``improvements in medical-necessity administration may be
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to reach a conclusion on these improvements and
communicate any changes by the second quarter 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowser said Blue Cross officials remained ``very optimistic that
these changes will encourage doctors to move forward to sign the
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Richard Hellman, president-elect of the medical
society, said some ambiguities remained in the proposed contract
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope doctors read them carefully and consult their
lawyers,'' he said. ``It's a fairness issue, and an issue of
whether doctors think they can provide the care their patients
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can, the doctors will feel good about it. If the issue
is still ambiguous, I think there still will be some doctors who
will not sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellman said he was concerned that doctors were being asked to
sign their contracts before the medical-necessity issue had been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials said the matter needed study and open
dialogue free of the contract talks. They suggested one resolution
might include having physician peer groups review treatment and
decide what is medically reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman said he thought that doctors would be open to peer
groups reviewing medical care issues rather than having insurers
decide the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased,'' he said. ``This is a step they are making in
the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hellman said, ``This issue has little to do with money
and more to do with the public interest and fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials acknowledged that the changes were
influenced in part by a national backlash against managed care. For
example, UnitedHealthcare recently said it no longer would require
doctors to seek approval before recommending medical treatment or
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are important issues,'' said Mascotte. ``In fact, the
system is evolving, and we want to be part of that evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Mascotte said he was confident that most of the doctors would
sign over the next three or four months _ all of them, he hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross said members who were undergoing medical treatment
would continue to be covered even if their doctors did not renew by
the end of the grace period.
</P>
<P>
   Bowser said that since Thanksgiving, 115 more doctors had signed
Blue Cross contracts, leaving about 900 who had yet to sign. He
said 300 were close to signing.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials said doctors who had signed their contracts
were being asked to sign and return the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials said one concern over which Blue Cross had
little control was the complexity of the contracts. A doctor who
wants to be in every plan, for example, must read 92 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This recontracting process is primarily driven by our need to
comply with federal and state regulations, as well as requirements
placed upon us by the many customers we serve,'' Bowser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acknowledge that our new contracts are lengthy and complex.
However, this complexity is unavoidable since these new contracts
govern over $120 million in annual physician payments in six
managed-care programs.''

MARKETING MILLENNIUM HYPE IS STARTING TO FIZZLE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millennium this, millennium that. Are you tired of all the
millennium marketing yet?
</P>
<P>
   MMG Worldwide President Clayton Reid certainly is. ``There's so
much millennium advertising out there, specifically from big
advertisers,'' he said. ``It's difficult for a small advertiser to
break through.''
</P>
<P>
   From new-millennium cereal boxes on grocers' shelves to
millennium eve parties with price tags up to six digits, American
businesses are hoping to cash in on the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But all this new millennium fun and hype is starting to get old,
Reid said, and the millennium ad message may no longer be working.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the dawn of a new age ``has not turned out to be the
windfall that a lot of companies thought it would be,'' said Reid,
whose Kansas City ad agency specializes in the hospitality
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Local merchants report that consumers are increasingly blase
about anything Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Many heavily promoted holiday travel packages and New Year's
parties at exotic locales have fizzled, flopped or failed to sell
out, said Reid, in part because of mostly exaggerated fears of
computer meltdowns that might strand travelers or have them
dropping from the skies.
</P>
<P>
   A survey this fall by the Travel Industry Association of America
found that 46 percent of Americans thought computer woes would
cause at least some problems for New Year's weekend travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling over the holidays is difficult enough without
worrying about Y2K computer glitches,'' Reid said. ``A lot of
airline seats, cruise ship cabins and hotel rooms are going to be
empty'' over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean resorts are only about 70 percent filled for the New
Year's holiday despite a recent marketing blitz, said Bear Stearns
&AMP; Co. analyst Jason Ader. Normally those sun-drenched island rooms
are 90 percent booked this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of hotels in hot spots such as Las Vegas
and New York, we believe that most hotels will not reach the
expectations set for the holiday weekend,'' Ader said.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K fears are certainly part of the reason, but Ader also blames
inflated hotel, airline and cruise fares for applying the brakes to
international holiday travel this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising said its
surveys in 19 countries found that people were genuinely tiring of
New Year's and millennium hype. The agency is encouraging such
clients as Coca-Cola, General Motors and Nestle to go easy on such
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a fun product, and you want to just have fun, then
it's fine,'' said Joseph Plummer, a McCann executive vice
president. ``But on a deeper level, we're saying to try to
associate with it in a bigger, more long-term way.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, for instance, McCann urged some clients to sponsor
the Millennium Wheel or the Millennium Dome, both in England, as a
way to tie in to the New Year in a positive and meaningful way. The
Millennium Wheel in London is a 1,500-ton Ferris wheel, offering
25-mile views, that was built for the millennium and will remain a
permanent tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Dome is a huge exhibition space being constructed
in Greenwich, England. Both are taking corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, the M word is ubiquitous _ sometimes for no
apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   - Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel just launched a
``Millennium Rush Hour'' contest for December that seems to have no
connection to the new era except that the winner's name will be
drawn from a drum Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   - The Missouri Lottery is running a contest that will select one
``lucky daily game'' player as the winner of its ``Millennium World
Traveler'' contest that will award a 24-day trip for two around the
world _ in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   - An ad for KMBZ-980 AM promotes the station as ``News Radio for
the New Millennium.'' Does that mean it wasn't the station for this
millennium?
</P>
<P>
   - One group marketing an honest-to-goodness real millennium
product is the American Heartland Theatre at Crown Center. Its
``Millennium Musical'' opens Jan. 14 and parodies ``1,000 years of
history in 100 minutes,'' said spokesman Robert Barrientos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Mel Brooks meets Monty Python,'' said Barrientos of the
nutty stage production that spoofs civilization from the
Inquisition to bungee jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Kansas
City has rushed into print with a special millennium brochure that
outlines hotel, restaurant and other New Year's Eve parties and
special events in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where will you be when the clock strikes twelve, ushering in
the new millennium?'' it asks.
</P>
<P>
   The list of parties is impressive. So are some of the price
tags.
</P>
<P>
   - One of the costliest gigs will be at Station Casino Kansas
City, where a $3,000, two-night weekend package for two includes a
suite, a bottle of Dom Perignon champagne, two complimentary robes,
plenty of food and passes to the movie theaters. A standard room
package and modest perks for the big night go for $500.

   ``We don't have a lot of rooms left,'' said John V. Finamore,
Station's Midwest president.
</P>
<P>
   - What absolutely has to be the priciest millennium package in
Kansas City is at the Ritz-Carlton on the Country Club Plaza, and
is being sold just once in every Ritz-Carlton hotel city.
</P>
<P>
   That ultimate experience, $100,000-per-couple weekend is nothing
less than full immersion in unabashed luxury. Millennium souvenirs
include exquisite things made of gold, calfskin and sable _ for
starters. Private chefs and butlers will be on hand, of course,
along with masseuses, limousines, private helicopter rides and
more.
</P>
<P>
   The package is still available in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   - Back to earth, the Embassy Suites in Overland Park is having a
Masquerade Millennium Ball featuring a swing band and souvenir
millennium sweat shirts for $275 a couple.
</P>
<P>
   - Party goers at Kansas City's venerable Italian Gardens
restaurant will receive handmade millennium plates and glasses. At
Historic Suites of America in Kansas City they'll get a
``one-of-a-kind Millennium Champagne gift basket.''
</P>
<P>
   - Kansas City's Science City at Union Station millennium party
has a little something for everyone, with price tags to match.
There's a $1,000-a-couple black-tie dinner and dance, or the
$100-a-couple laser light show and party in the Grand Hall, or the
$10-a-head celebration outside, where there will be fireworks,
music and vendors peddling plenty of hot stuff to drink and eat.
</P>
<P>
   - In St. Louis, the official gathering is a Millennium on the
Mississippi party with fireworks framed by the Gateway Arch for
those who get there early for a good seat.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium marketing has attached itself to plenty of mundane
products too.
</P>
<P>
   Registered trademarks for 272 goods or services bearing the word
millennium _ or, in 21 cases, the misspelled ``millenium'' _ have
been granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and the
agency is reviewing requests for 1,415 others.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of 2000 also deck the malls, where shops offer everything
from Millennium Monopoly to Cabbage Patch Millennium babies. Barnes
&AMP; Noble has 113 Y2K titles in its database.
</P>
<P>
   One company expecting a boost in sales is the condom maker
Durex, which commissioned a worldwide survey of 4,200 young adults.
It found that more than half of men and 38 percent of women ages 16
to 21 expected to have sex New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Even food companies are in on the act, from General Mills'
brightly packaged Millennios cereal to Pepperidge Farm packages
that display its little cracker goldfish wearing party hats.
</P>
<P>
   For those with champagne incomes, there are Waterford crystal
millennium champagne flutes for $2,000 and a DeBeers millennium
diamond for $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   For those in the beer-budget set, a mere $4.95 will get you a
``2000 USA Candle'' and $7.95 will bring a ``Having one of those
millenniums'' coffee mug at www.year2000products.com, one of a
handful of Web sites specializing in year 2000 souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Some area retailers say there is no groundswell of interest in
millennium products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has pretty much fizzled,'' said Harry Lukas, owner of Lukas
Liquors Superstore in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Several distillers have come out with products with various
millennium marketing hooks or ``2000'' on the labels, but they
haven't aroused much interest from consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch is one of the few winners. Its millennium gift
packs include a supersize bottle of Budweiser and four glasses for
$40. It's become a popular gift item, Lukas said.
</P>

   Jane Schaumburg, co-owner of two area Last Chapter bookstores,
said most of the new-millennium books on her shelves had been met
by yawns from the reading public. One exception, she said, is the
My Millennium Memoir, a do-it-yourself journal to write about the
occasion and even record for all posterity what you were wearing.
</P>
<P>
   A millennium edition of the Guinness Book of Records is also a
big seller. Shoppers don't come looking for it but snap it up once
they spot it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the big winner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Or never mind Y2K.

<P>
   One American Express ad campaign is selling Y1K.

<P>
   The company's 36-page ``Mexico Millennium'' promotion in the
December issue of Travel &AMP; Leisure magazine offers package travel

   Meanwhile, the Bookspan Book of the Month Club is using a Y3K
marketing theme for its current catalog sale on the ``Top 10 books
they'll be reading in 3000.'' (Atlas Shrugged, The Autobiography of
Martin Luther King and The Complete Works of William Shakespeare
made the list, by the way.)

SANDERS MIGHT PROVIDE REMEDY FOR COWBOYS' OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Troy Aikman sees triple-threat Deion Sanders
providing a much-needed dual purpose for the Dallas Cowboys, if he
is moved to offensive side of the ball for the final quarter-season
stretch drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Sanders) can do some things that can be incorporated
into our offense that, hopefully, can help us, either getting the
ball to him or letting Deion draw attention his way and freeing up
some other (receivers),'' said Aikman, who said Monday that he has
grown wary of talking about an offense that, excluding the two
Washington games, is averaging only 1.6 offensive touchdowns per
game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably at a position offensively where we need to do
whatever we can to get as many playmakers on our side of the ball
as possible ... and Deion certainly is one of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   End of subject?
</P>
<P>
   You might think so.
</P>
<P>
   Especially after hearing owner Jerry Jones express his desire to
see Sanders get a chance to line up at wide receiver, sooner rather
than later, maybe even Sunday against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you see how much help this offense needs and
when you hear Sanders himself say that he is willing to add offense
to his list of duties to perform if it means helping the Cowboys
make the playoffs, which might require running the table over the
last four games.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Chan Gailey remained noncommital Monday, saying that
the team's braintrust will bat it around behind closed doors over
the next couple of days before deciding on whether to give the
NFC's leading Pro Bowl vote-getter in the fan balloting at ``both''
cornerback and kick returner what could amount to as many as 10-12
snaps on offense.
</P>
<P>
   With the possible exception of having only one road victory,
there is nothing more that the Cowboys' offense is lacking than
big-play ability.
</P>
<P>
   Since Michael Irvin was lost Oct. 10 with a cervical injury and
congenital condition, the Gailey offense hasn't had a consistent
big-play threat to complement Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail, who has
become less and less a deep threat, while still piling up twice as
many receptions (65) as the team's second-leading receiver Ernie
Mills (30).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our emphasis is as a running football team,'' said Aikman,
referring to Emmitt Smith's 1,053 yards and that he was on pace to
carry the ball a career-high 400 times before he broke his right
hand and missed 11/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put that much emphasis on the running game, then the
passing game is not going to be as sharp when you get into a
passing situation ... but we (in the pass offense) have to work
through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Sanders can provide some impetus.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there will be more changes than that. Gailey wouldn't
rule out the possibility of personnel moves this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that you can continue down this road and just
say, `Well, things are OK,' because they're not OK,'' Aikman said.
``I think everyone would expect to see some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't, or wouldn't speculate, adding that he hasn't been
told of any chances other than hearing Sanders' name mentioned as a
possiblity at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion could force defenses to cover us differently than
they're doing now,'' said Jones. ``I know I'm dreaming because it's
just one week after Deion has had full practice for the first time
this year, but I think he could help us in some of the offensive
packages.''
</P>
<P>
   About Sanders, Gailey said, ``He's the best corner and the best
punt returner in the league. So if now he's on the field for 10 or
12 more plays (at wide receiver), which is not his natural
position, you now put him in an unnatural situation ... (which is)
a possible health risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman emphasized that he has confidence in all his receivers,
even if he doesn't a chance to develop much of rapport with any of
them compared with Irvin, his teammate of 11 seasons, of whom he
said Monday: ``I think there are probably people in the
organization who underestimate what it meant to lose Michael. It
has had a tremendous impact ... (because) Michael is one guy who
had been in big games before, and had made big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been looking for big-play offense on a
consistent basis since the Sept. 12 season-opener at Washington. nn

FISET'S STATUS STILL UNCERTAIN FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stephane Fiset, the Los Angeles Kings'
opening-night goaltender, is back on the ice. When he gets back in
a game is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset practiced with the club Monday, the one-month anniversary
of the deep bone bruise he suffered on his right hand taking
back-to-back shots off his blocker in pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset had the hand packed in ice after Monday's workout and said
he has a little more strength and range of motion. But he is not
ready to squeeze a stick well enough to clear a puck in a game and
that is frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is stronger than it was, but still not right,'' said Fiset,
who last week showed no improvement after the hand was placed in a
cast for five days. ``This is something I figured would be better
in five or six days. Here it is a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Andy Murray said he hopes to have Fiset back within two
weeks, but he has been saying that since early November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky that Jamie Storr has been playing well,'' Murray
said. ``We've been overcoming injuries, but we're definitely
pushing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Payback time: There are a lot of Kings players who agree with
Murray that the power-play goal that gave Tampa Bay a 3-3 tie was a
gift from officials, who botched an earlier play that helped give
the Kings a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Rob Blake was whistled for cross checking even though
replays showed he never touched a Lightning player. That gave Tampa
Bay the man advantage and they scored with 23.8 seconds left to put
the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings claim it was payback for interference by linesman
Baron Parker five minutes earlier that allowed Glen Murray to score
his second goal of the game. Parker was standing along the right
boards when he was struck by a puck coming out of the Tampa Bay
end. Parker was on the Lightning side of the blue line, meaning
Murray picked it up without being offside. He scored an unassisted
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Murray said the biggest problem with his club
the past few weeks has been its disappearing act in the second
period. An example was the Nov. 27 game against San Jose. The Kings
won, but were outshot 19-4 in the second. Against Tampa, the Kings
had just seven of their 37 shots in the second and did not score
after taking a 2-0 lead.... One of the highlights of Saturday's tie
was the connection Luc Robitaille and rookie Jason Blake made on
the ice. Both worked out on the same line Monday and could be
together if Robitaille double shifts with the fourth unit.

DODGERS CEO DALY SEARCHING FOR STABILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the former head of a movie studio, Robert
Daly's seen high-priced box office flops. When he took over as
managing general partner, chairman and CEO of the Los Angeles
Dodgers on Oct. 28, he had first-hand experience with another one.
</P>
<P>
   In his first one-on-one interview since assuming the position,
Daly answered many questions about the Dodgers' past and future.
</P>
<P>
   It's been five weeks since the 62-year-old Daly bought a
minority share of the Dodgers and became the club's top executve.
And while the former Warner Bros. co-chairman admits there's much
more for him to learn, he recognizes the organization's
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think there's anything fundamentally wrong with
the organization,'' Daly said at his Dodger Stadium office. ``I
think there's been a lot of things that's taken place over the last
few years that you wish didn't take place. I think the bottom line
is I'd like to see the team win some more ballgames, and I don't
think there's any reason why we shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, what I would love to see is everybody go out there and
play to win and not get involved in any of these differences of
opinions. I think if everyone was rowing together, it would help a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly said the Dodgers need stability.
</P>
<P>
   Since Fox bought the team, the Dodgers fired a manager and
general manager, placed interim labels on their replacements and
then hired a new manager and GM. They revamped the coaching staff,
hired Bob Graziano as president and fired him only to have Daly
re-hire Graziano as the club's president.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox leadership was also faceless, nothing more than a
corporate entity that knew little of running a baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what has happened to the Dodgers was so
disruptive,'' Daly said. ``There was a tremendous amount of
distractions. Even if you go back to the time Peter O'Malley
announced he was selling the team (January 1996). There was so much
change that took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have the same general manager, the same manager, the
same coaches (that finished the season). You start off in such a
better position than you were in the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a diehard fan who called from around the globe to follow
the Dodgers, Daly also knows about the turmoil. It began when Mike
Piazza was traded after a contract squabble couldn't be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my understanding, nobody with the Dodgers ever sat down
to talk with Mike Piazza. It was all done through
representatives,'' Daly said. ``That won't happen while I'm here. I
would have looked Mike Piazza in the face and said, `Do please
understand, we would like to keep you but we can't afford the money
you're looking for,' and then we would have at least gotten his
response.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly pledged that before a decision is made on a player's
future, the two will sit and talk. He did it with Raul Mondesi, but
Mondesi still wanted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a very disruptive way to start next year if
Mondesi stayed here because he didn't want to stay here,'' Daly
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a year since the Dodgers signed Kevin Brown to a
record $105 million. It infuriated the rest of baseball, and giving
a then 33-year-old pitcher a seven-year contract added venom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for Los Angeles to have a successful team, not
only for Los Angeles but for baseball,'' Daly said. ``That doesn't
mean we should overpay or set precedents that people get upset by.
The (Kevin) Brown deal was a rich deal. The Green deal was a
totally different deal because, basically, we were getting rid of a
lot of payroll when we got Green, and getting rid of a player who I
personally love as a player but who did not want to play here next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly also heard of a rift between general manager Kevin Malone
and manager Davey Johnson, one that Malone and Johnson deny.
Players also complained about a lack of communication from the
manager, and as the offseason continued the coaching staff was left
wondering, somewhat perplexed, about their fate. Two weeks ago it
was announced the coaches would return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for communication to be picked up,''
Daly said. ``That means at all levels. From the players, the
coaches, the manager, the general manager, all the way up.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Daly won't do is predict a World Series title. He then
noted the harsh lesson Malone learned after similar comments last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Daly said is the Dodgers will be better than last
season's 77-85 fiasco, and will likely hike their payroll from $80
million to the mid-to-upper $80 million range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it would be hard to say the Dodgers will be a
profitable team in 2000, based upon the payroll,'' said Daly, who
added the Dodgers lost money last year. ``The payroll for 2000 will
be higher than '99, but we're trying to contain what the up is,
which is why we're looking at all the options.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimming payroll is paramount to turning profit, Daly said, but
it's not the only option.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger Stadium is undergoing a $50 million facelift that
includes luxury suites and club seating, which produces more
revenue sources. But it still won't match the ancillary revenue the
newer parks can produce, so the Dodgers' future at Chavez Ravine
will ultimately be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't project out to long term, but obviously there's no
plan on changing Dodger Stadium.'' Daly said. ``There's no talk
about moving at the present time. I don't know what will happen
with football in L.A., but this is still a perfect site for a
football stadium, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers' problems aren't only inherent in L.A. They
still own Dodgertown in Vero Beach, Fla., an extravagant spring
training home that costs millions of dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an economical place for us,'' Daly said. ``We're
still talking to the people at Vero Beach. Hopefully, by the start
of the season we're going to come to grips with whether we're going
to stay in Vero Beach or not. Right now, we don't have an
alternative in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgertown is a long way off. Pitchers and catchers are
still more than two months from reporting, and the Dodgers still
need to dispense salary, probably find a third baseman and
strengthen their bullpen and bench.
</P>
<P>
   In five weeks Daly's brought calm to an organization rife in
turmoil since media magnate Rupert Murdoch took over. Whether Daly
brings the other things needed is open to debate, though he did
say, ``I don't expect to be talking about this stuff in one year.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having finally figured out that a long-term
courtship would benefit both more than a nasty court battle, Major
League Baseball and ESPN announced a contract extension through
2005 on Monday, hours before a U.S. District Court trial on the
matter was to begin in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported the terms of the six-year
agreement _ which essentially extends the current deal three more
years _ to be in the $800 million ballpark. But neither baseball
commissioner Bud Selig nor ESPN president George Bodenheimer would
confirm the figure.
</P>
<P>
   Both also danced around questions that a judge's suggestion to
settle out of court had anything to do with the timing of the
announcement. Still, each were relieved to avoid the legal
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partners should do whatever they can to stay out of court,''
Bodenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased we avoided going to court today; I've tried to
eliminate as much of that as possible,'' said Selig.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the process unfolded, it became obvious this partnership
was under a significant amount of strain and this agreement was
frankly beneficial to both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much an about-face for Selig, who lashed out when
ESPN announced in 1998 that three Sunday night September games
would be moved to ESPN2 to accommodate a new $600 million-a-season
Sunday night deal with the NFL. Baseball's response then was
telling the network to return those games to the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Its louder response last April was to announce the termination
of the contract after the 1999 season. ESPN countersued in May to
force baseball to uphold the existing deal.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, and baseball, seemed more focused on the fact ESPN2 has
10 million fewer cable homes than ESPN and was being slighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset about it and I didn't hide it,'' Selig said. ``You
always learn, and I have in my lifetime, not to let personal events
cloud what we're trying to do. Once the negotiations began, it was
clear ESPN wanted to perpetuate this relationship, but under terms
we could agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to learn to disagree, but do it in a way as to not
affect your good judgment moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer also said he ``wouldn't characterize anything as a
tradeoff'' in the negotiations as far as the NFL was concerned.
``You have to evaluate this in total. I don't think you can focus
on small aspects of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   So while baseball got its point across with the loud lawsuit,
ESPN seems to have paid the price for hurting its feelings. For
starters, ESPN's cost per season just went up from $112 million to
$133 million over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise on the Sunday night baseball-football conflict
means ESPN and ESPN2, for the first two years of the deal, will
televise two games for every one moved. One of those two telecasts
will come on Fridays in September. The second will be Sunday night
games on ESPN2 earlier in the season. In those cases, it would
create simultaneous games on both channels.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the agreement means an increase from 90 to 108
regular-season games on ESPN and ESPN2. Also, ``Baseball Tonight,''
ESPN's daily studio highlight show, will expand and air
additionally on ESPN2, and there will be more baseball highlights
allowed to be shown on ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   That translates to, according to ESPN calculations, more than
800 hours of exposure a year for the game, up from 500 on both
networks in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN Radio, ESPN Classic and ESPN.com deals were also
extended in this package, as was ESPN's right to develop and market
baseball video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest assured, it leaves ESPN with a great deal of value for
us,'' said Bodenheimer, whose team of negotiators came to an
agreement early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net and TBS had made overtures about taking the cable
package if ESPN's relationship with baseball was ending. Selig said
that while other offers were comparable to ESPN's, baseball decided
to stay the course with the cable network as it has the past 10
years once differences of agreement were settled.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball now has deals with ESPN, Fox and NBC that bring the
sport nearly $2 billion, but this will set the groundwork for
baseball to ask for more from Fox and NBC when their regular- and
postseason deals expire at the end of the 2000 season.

COYOTES STEAL VICTORY FROM STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The game was all but over.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars simply had to go through their customary
ice-the-puck, seal-the-game final few minutes, and a gap-closing
victory against the Western Conference-leading Phoenix Coyotes
looked to be well in hand Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the time it takes an average commercial to run, the
game was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes scored twice in a 26-second span of the third period
to sneak out of Reunion Arena with a 3-2 victory, stopping the
Stars' season-best winning streak at four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we weren't playing bad. What was it 20 seconds or
so?'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher asked. ``It felt like 20
seconds. Bam, bam, you lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Phoenix forward Trevor Letowski deflected a Jyrki Lumme
shot past Stars goalie Ed Belfour with 3:25 remaining for the tying
goal. Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk had attempted to clear the
puck, but Lumme stopped it along the boards and fired it on net.
</P>
<P>
   Letowski tipped the puck in such a way that it dinged off the
post and in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked, and it was in the net it happened so fast,'' Hatcher
said. ``Maybe in the third period we didn't come at them hard
enough. Maybe, we let down a little bit. I think that's what's more
frustrating about it because there was a good thing, and in 26
seconds, it's a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   An all-too-familiar Coyotes face made sure of it 26 seconds
later.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes forward Jeremy Roenick, who had his jaw broken by a
Hatcher hit the last time he was in the building, scored the
game-winning goal at 17:01 of the third period. His shot sneaked
between Hatcher's skate, Belfour and the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't touch me,'' Hatcher said. ``It went in between my
skate and the post. Eddie said he thinks it hit his skate and kind
of just trickled over. You try that a thousand times, and it won't
go through. That's a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is it did go in, spoiling what had for 56 minutes been
a strong Stars performance and doing to the Stars what they had
done to them Nov. 5. In that game, the Stars scored five goals in
the third period to escape with a 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the Stars got scoring from their third and fourth
lines. They killed a four-minute penalty in the third period. They
were limiting the Coyotes' chances.
</P>
<P>
   They did everything they said they needed to do to win the game
except for win it despite having a power play in the final two
minutes. They couldn't even generate a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disappointing loss, especially for as well as we played
and as hard as we played,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We
made two mistakes along the wall, and it ended up in our net. ...
This was a huge game. This would've pulled us within five points of
these guys and would've made for a good run, and we didn't get it
closed off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were 38-2-5 last season when leading going into the
third period. They had that lead Monday night thanks to an unlikely
player _ winger Blake Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   In a game when the Stars couldn't muster a shot on a four-minute
power play, Sloan scored one of those goals usually scored by the
likes of a Mike Modano or a Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   He went wheeling around from behind the boards, circling into
the bottom edge of the face-off circle. He then released a pretty
shot that sneaked between Coyotes goalie Bob Essensa's arm and the
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to bite the bit a little bit,'' said Sloan, who
scored his only other goal this season Oct. 5. ``We put together a
solid 56 minutes or so. Unfortunately, this game was 60 minutes
long. Our stamina for the test wasn't as good as it should've
been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' other goal on the evening came from third-line center
Guy Carbonneau at 4:34 of the first period. Carbonneau took the
first shot. Essensa made the first save. The rebound stayed on the
tip of his skate. Carbonneau swiped down and knocked it in.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, however, didn't take long to answer. Phoenix winger
Mike Sullivan lifted a rebound of a Radoslav Suchy shot above a
sprawled out Belfour. The shot went straight up, knocking the water
bottle around at 5:48 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we did a lot of good things,'' Hatcher said. ``I
don't think the game was a total waste. I think that makes it a
little more frustrating to be honest. I don't think we took a step
back. It all comes down to what we do in our next game.'' nn

MAVS SUSPEND ROOKIE AFTER WARRANT ISSUED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After watching rookie Leon Smith spiral helplessly out
of control over the past three weeks, the Dallas Mavericks finally
made their move.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith reportedly in an undislcosed Dallas facility
receiving psychiatric treatment, the Mavericks removed the
6-foot-10 forward from the injured list Monday and placed him on
the suspended list for an indefinite period of time without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no longer a basketball issue,'' Mavericks president
and chief executive officer Terdema Ussery said. ``Leon must focus
on getting the care that he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action allows him to concentrate solely on that issue.
While we have been told that he is in Dallas and is in an
in-patient facility receiving care, we still don't know exactly
where he is, and accordingly, haven't been able to communicate with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Chicago, a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest
because he failed to appear at a hearing Monday morning. Smith's
bond was posted at $15,000 on Saturday after he was charged with
breaking the windows and ramming a car owned by Vanessa Pondexter,
the mother of his ex-girlfriend, Cappie Pondexter.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest warrant was ordered because Smith's bond slip states
that he was not to leave the jurisdiction of the court of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attorney, Dennis Berkson, said he doubted Smith would be
arrested in the Dallas facility where he is receiving treatment.
Berkson said he would try to get a court order blocking execution
of the warrant.
</P>
<P>
   However, Berkson said if the court insists that Smith come back
to Chicago to face charges, he would find a way to help Smith
surrender peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and a companion, Fred Shephard, flew to Dallas late
Saturday night, and Smith immediately checked into a treatment
facility. Shephard was an all-state basketball player for Martin
Luther King coach Landon Cox during the early 1980s, and has moved
into Smith's Oak Lawn apartment with strict orders from Cox to keep
an eye on Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Cox accused the Mavericks of not being concerned about
Smith, but only being concerned about finding a way to stop paying
Smith the $37,500 he was receiving every two weeks under terms of
the contract he signed Nov. 3. So far, Smith received two such
payments on the three-year, $1.447 million guaranteed contract that
he signed last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mavericks are just trying to find a way to void this kid's
contract,'' said Cox, who coached Smith at MLK High. ``That's all
they care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``They drafted him and now they don't want him. But the boy is
getting help, and he asked for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith tried to commit suicide on Nov. 14 when he swallowed
several bottles of aspirin and was found passed out in his
apartment by Dallas police. Then, Wednesday he threathened Cappie
Pondexter at Marshall High School with a gun after she spurned his
romantic advances.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was charged with aggravated assault for threathening
Cappie Pondexter, and spent Thursday night in a Chicago jail. Not
long after his bond was posted at $1,000, Smith was arrested again
for the incident involving Vanessa Pondexter's automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Ussery, speaking on behalf of a Mavericks organization that has
been criticized nationally for their handling of Smith, said it's
time for those who are closest to Smith and who really care about
his well-being to step up.
</P>
<P>
   Ussery said: ``We hope that Leon and those closest to him
understand that his playing in the National Basketball Association
is inconsequential at this point and that they'll devote their full
energies to helping Leon become a healthy, productive member of
society again.'' nn

Tech's top top choice bows out (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rich Rodriguez, the Clemson offensive coordinator identified by
Texas Tech officials as the leading candidate to replace departing
football coach Spike Dykes, withdrew his name from consideration
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a West Virginia native, said a desire to remain close
to family members and a belief that he would ``continue to be
marketable'' for future jobs if Clemson continues to have success
convinced him to remain in Clemson, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The decision surprised Tech officials, who had begun making
tentative plans for a news conference for Wednesday to present
Rodriguez as Dykes' successor. Now, the apparent front-runner is
Oklahoma offensive coordinator Mike Leach, the only one of three
confirmed candidates to interview with Tech officials who has not
removed his name from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State coach Tony Samuel, a former Nebraska assistant,
withdrew his name Friday. It remained unclear last night if
Rodriguez's decision might lead to reconsideration by Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Rodriguez's announcement, Tech athletic director
Gerald Myers said the school's search would focus on ``four or
five'' other candidates. Myers declined to identify them or
speculate on a timetable for selecting Dykes' successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you have top candidates, there's a possibility
these things can happen,'' Myers said. ``We accept that. We'll go
on. We have some other candidates who are going to be
outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach, who interviewed with Tech officials in Lubbock on Nov.
20, could not be reached for comment last night. Two other
high-profile offense coordinators, Mark Richt of Florida State and
Ralph Friedgen of Georgia Tech, have expressed interest in the Tech
vacancy. As of Monday, both said they had not been contacted by
Tech officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 36, said removing his name from consideration for the
Tech vacancy was ``the most difficult decision I've ever had to
make in my life.'' It came just two days after Tech chancellor John
Montford identified Rodriguez as ``certainly the leading
candidate'' in the school's search process.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 48 hours, I've gone back and forth,'' Rodriguez
said. ``This was by far the best opportunity that's presented
itself in my career and it's been very, very difficult ... to
decide if I wanted to keep pursuing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is very happy (at Clemson). That was a big factor in
the decision. My goal is still to be a Division I head coach. I
feel pretty good that if we continue to have success ... the right
opportunity at the right time may come up. I may get another chance
down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Rodriguez said his dream job would be to
succeed Don Nehlen, 63, as coach at West Virginia. Accepting a
long-term deal at another school, especially one with a punitive
buyout clause, could prevent Rodriguez from making that move if
Nehlen retires within the next two years. Sources close to the
search confirmed Tech plans to make a buyout clause part of its
agreement with Dykes' replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, however, said the desire for a West Virginia buyout
option never arose in negotiations with Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never mentioned that at all,'' Myers said. nn

OVERPRICED FREE-AGENT PITCHERS MAKE OFF-SEASON A BARE MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not entirely true that free advice is worth what it costs.
If it's acted on, it might be worth even less.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with that caveat in place, here's a snippet for the
Rangers' Doug Melvin and every other general manager: Don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Don't pay inflated prices for mediocre pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers _ along with every other major-league team with the
possible exception of the Atlanta Braves and the New York Yankees _
need pitching. There's precious little available on the free-agent
market.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching that's available isn't very good, but it is very
pricy, especially after David Cone, who wore down in the second
half last season and who will be 37 next season, signed a one-year
contract for $12 million to remain with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are interested in keeping Aaron Sele and in signing
Kenny Rogers and Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Sele wants a four-year deal worth between $36 million and $40
million. He might be worth it, considering he's 29, in the prime of
his career and won 37 games the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates continued to insist that after Pedro
Martinez, Sele was as good as any pitcher in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sele's earned-run average last season was
4.79, up from 4.23 in '98. The league hit .283 against him in '98
and a robust .293 in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Sele is an innings-eater who gives his team a chance to win, the
kind of pitcher who would be an asset on most staffs. But he's not
an ace, and even in this day and age, $10 million is ace money.
</P>
<P>
   Finley also wants $10 million a season but only for three years.
The length of contract is more palatable to Melvin, who's loath to
go longer than that for a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Finley turned 37 last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three seasons he was 13-6 with a 4.23 ERA, 11-9 with
a 3.39 ERA and 12-11 with a 4.43 ERA, decent numbers for the late
1990s. But is it worth taking a $30 million gamble that he'll
remain effective when he's pushing 40?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Rogers, who wants a five-year deal for at least $42
million and preferably $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the Rangers as a free agent after the 1995 season,
Rogers is 42-27 with a 4.26 ERA. He has hit double figures in wins
twice _ 12-8 in '96 and 16-8 in '98 _ and has topped 200 innings
once.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers turned 35 last month, meaning he'd also be pushing 40 at
the end of a five-year deal. At his best he's a very good pitcher,
but is he worth a $50 million gamble?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is no.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, Finley and Rogers are decent pitchers who can help a
staff. They are not difference-makers who can take a team to the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Decent should not cost $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Just say no. ROOKIE CLASS WEAK
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, when Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount
were elected in their first year on the ballot, this year's list of
first-time eligibles for the Hall of Fame is weak.
</P>
<P>
   It's headed by Jack Morris, who has marginal credentials. The
right-hander was the winningest pitcher in the '80s with 162
victories, was a 20-game winner three times and raised his game in
the postseason. Morris won both his starts as the Tigers won the
1984 World Series, and he was 2-0 with a 1.17 ERA _ including a
complete-game shutout in Game 7 _ to pitch the Twins over the
Braves in '91.
</P>
<P>
   However, his 254 victories are well short of the ``automatic''
number of 300. His career ERA was 3.90, and he was never below 3.00
in any season.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers leave Morris on the bubble and certainly aren't
good enough for a first-ballot election.
</P>
<P>
   The best bets to form the Class of 2000 are Carlton Fisk, the
all-time leader in games caught who fell 43 votes short last year,
and Tony Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots were mailed to 10-year members of the Baseball Writers
Association of America last week and must be returned by the end of
December. The results will be announced Jan. 11. NOT SO FAST
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were ready to announce the next piece in their
rebuilding plan. They reached agreement with free-agent closer Mike
Jackson on a three-year, $12 million contract and scheduled a news
conference to announce the signing. The news conference and the
deal were canceled, though, when a physical revealed possible
problems with Jackson's right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies jumped in and signed Jackson to a similar deal,
including option years. HOT STOVE EMBERS
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, reports or the ever-churning rumor mill:
</P>
<P>
   _Despite losing his closer's job to Armando Benitez, John Franco
decided not to ask the Mets to trade him. Franco, a 39-year-old
lefty, has 416 saves, 62 fewer than Lee Smith's career record. But
he said he'd rather stay with the Mets in a setup role. ``I could
go somewhere else and maybe get the saves record, but winning is
more important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _In perhaps the most shocking news so far this off-season, the
small-market, low-payroll Pirates decided to make a run at Ken
Griffey Jr. The Pirates are not on Griffey's list of approved
teams, though (as a 10-5 player he has veto rights), so talks never
got past the preliminary stage. The Reds are still in pursuit of
Griffey and talked to the Mariners early last week. However, the
Mariners insist on Pokey Reese being in any package, and the Reds
don't want to give him up.
</P>
<P>
   _Manny Ramirez might remain with the Indians beyond this season
after all. He switched agents to Jeff Moorad, who rekindled talks
about a contract extension beyond next season. Moorad, the sixth
agent of Ramirez's career, brokered the deal between the Dodgers
and Blue Jays for two of his clients, Shawn Green and Raul Mondesi,
and negotiated Green's contract with LA.
</P>
<P>
   _The Dodgers need to cut payroll after signing Green to a
six-year, $84 million contract and are talking to the Rockies about
a trade of Eric Young ($4.5 million the next two seasons) and
Ismael Valdes (due at least $4 million in arbitration) for young
right-handers Manny Aybar or Jose Jimenez and other players.

COWBOYS DEFENDERS WON'T POINT FINGERS (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ As bad as the mood was at the Dallas Cowboys'
Valley Ranch training complex Monday, things could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-6 loss to the Patriots on Sunday was the fourth game this
season that Cowboys' defense has held a team to one touchdown. For
the fourth time, the Cowboys lost the game because of an inept
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The environment was ripe for someone on defense to impersonate
Jessie Armstead, the Giants linebacker who created controversy
recently for criticizing his team's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys linebacker Randall Godfrey acknowledges there is some
frustration because the Cowboys are in the thick of a playoff race
and every game is important, but he said nobody is pointing
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play as a team,'' Godfrey said. ``We know the offense is
going to pick it up. And we got to do it in a hurry. But we really
do play as a team. No one will point fingers. We got too many
valuable players on offense. We know we can get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety George Teague agreed, saying ``we are staying away from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are frustrated themselves, they are not happy,'' Teague
said. ``We are all trying to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit for the Cowboys' unity goes to Cowboys coach Chan Gailey,
who has talked about winning and losing as team from the start of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about being a team every week,'' Gailey said. ``It's
never going to be a situation where everyone is pulling an equal
load on any team. So, you always talking about being a team. These
guys have pride and want to do well in their area. They want to
win. But you make sure you emphasize the team aspect at all times.
CORYATT BACK IN FOLD
</P>
<P>
   So, linebacker Quentin Coryatt didn't retire after all.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, 29, who walked away from football before the season
opener because of injury concerns, has regained his health and is
back with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Steve Zucker, said Coryatt and the Cowboys have
agreed to terms on the same three-year deal he signed as a free
agent during the off-season. He will get a prorated portion of his
original signing bonus _ roughly $300,000 _ and $23,529 per game
for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys released guard Chris Brymer to make room for
Coryatt. They are expected to sign Brymer to the practice squad if
he clears waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said Coryatt was frustrated by a chronic Achilles' tendon
injury that sidelined him for the bulk of training camp and didn't
want to play if he couldn't help the team. Coryatt, who was
originally drafted by the Colts after a stellar career at Texas
A&AMP;M, has spent the past three months getting treatment for the
injury and feels fit to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me back in September, `As soon as I get 100 percent, I
want to play,' '' Zucker said. ``We've kept in touch with the
Cowboys all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Darren Hambrick has played well in Coryatt's place at
strong-side linebacker and will likely keep the starting job, the
Cowboys welcome Coryatt's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plus for us,'' Godfrey said. ``He's a proven veteran in
the league. He gives us a lot of depth at linebacker. He can help
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning this season also benefits Coryatt, who hasn't played
in a game since 1997. Considering that his contract voids at the
end of the season, returning gives him a chance to use additional
playing time as a negotiating point when he becomes a free agent,
although Zucker said Coryatt only wants to play for the Cowboys.
INJURY UPDATES
</P>
<P>
   _Gailey said receiver Ernie Mills, who strained his left
quadriceps during pregame warmups Sunday, is a long shot to play
Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   _Gailey said center Mark Stepnoski (strained calf) could return
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _Guard Larry Allen, who has missed the past three games with a
sprained knee, will be sidelined another week, team officials said.

COWBOYS' DINK-AND-STINK OFFENSE MUST GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It's time to be straight up about this: Dallas
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman has developed a serious dinking
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion is as plain as the scars on his chin: The Cowboys
simply cannot dink and drive.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's best game-day execution Sunday night, in fact, actually
came ``after'' the Cowboys' abysmal 13-6 loss to the Patriots. No
excuses, he bravely told the assembled media.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent. None granted.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Dink King had thrown a pass long enough for a first
down.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like we're hip-shooting anything that moves today,
then you're reading this right. Aikman, as usual, is dead on the
money, but for once his completion went for more than 2 yards.
</P>
<P>
   There are no alibis left for this sorry excuse of an offense.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries? Other teams have key injuries and manage to score
points. Not the Cowboys. Four of their six losses have come when
the defense has allowed only 13 points. Pitiful.
</P>
<P>
   How is it that an offense with future Hall of Famers Aikman and
Emmitt Smith, with what is generally conceded to be the best
offensive line in the league, with a defense-stretching receiver
like Rocket Ismail, cannot score points?
</P>
<P>
   For answers, we go straight to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey, come on down.
</P>
<P>
   Coach, your offense dinks and stinks.
</P>
<P>
   You've taken arguably the best quarterback in the league, a
three-time Super Bowl winner, and turned him into the Dempster
Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   Your star running back is having a great season _ unless it's
third- or fourth-and-one, when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   Your team has rung up more penalties than the San Jose Sharks,
the NHL's resident cheap-shot artists.
</P>
<P>
   You have one of the best game-breaking receivers in the NFL at
your disposal, but he rarely goes deep, despite that defenses are
lining up in eight-man fronts to stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   It's way past time to make some changes.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few suggestions, but feel free to improvise on your
own as well:
</P>
<P>
   ``_ Do not make tight end David LaFleur the primary target in
critical first-down situations.'' He has consistently let you down
with dropped passes. It's time to go back to Eric Bjornson, or even
Mike Lucky, at least on most passing downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``_ Remove all dump-off options on third-down plays.'' Send
every receiver on routes beyond the first-down marker, forcing
Aikman to actually throw down field. And don't keep telling us he's
making good decisions. Good decisions lead to first downs and
victories, not punts and losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``_ Fire that sweetheart Richie Cunningham immediately.'' And
don't tell us there are no better kickers out there. He has lost
your confidence, the team's confidence and his own confidence.
Every kick he misses saps vital energy from the offense. You don't
have the luxury of being the patient Mr. Nice Guy any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``_ Go ahead and (sigh) put Deion into some of the offensive
packages.'' He has bad hands and will almost certainly get hurt
again, but that won't make him unique among your receivers.
Defenses will still have to respect his speed and perhaps that will
free up Ismail more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``_ Put in some plays that start with Emmitt Smith closer to the
line of scrimmage, especially on third and fourth downs when the
defenses are already keying on him anyway.'' Get rid of those slow
developing plays that give defenders ample time to line up on
Emmitt before he can gouge out a yard. Don't be afraid to put a
fullback in the backfield with him, giving defenses another option
to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``_ Back off on the intensity of the entry onto the field part
of the game plan.'' Ernie Mills, who pulled a quadriceps muscle,
was the second player injured this season by just walking down the
tunnel onto the Texas Stadium turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``_ Stop protecting players who are consistently screwing up,
even if it's a star like Aikman or Smith or a young offensive
lineman.'' The screw-ups are embarrassing your team. Don't be
afraid to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   The best starting point for salvaging this season is still with
Aikman. How many times have we heard Jerry Jones say that, as long
as Troy's on his feet the Cowboys are a Super Bowl contender?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the King of Dink was still standing Sunday night and the
Cowboys weren't even toilet bowl contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions (Aikman) made were based on the things HE
sees,'' Gailey stressed Monday at Valley Ranch. ``It's easy to put
on the film the day after and say, `Boy, it would have been nice to
try and throw the ball here or throw the ball there.' That's easy.
That happens in every film room every Monday around the NFL. But
for the most part, Troy makes good decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that we talk about and make a big deal about is
not turning the ball over. We are playing well on defense, and if
we don't turn it over on our end, you can play the field position
game and have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I get it now. Forget the scoreboard, the Cowboys won the
turnover game 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   I guess we're all supposed to dink to that. nn

PAULA AYALA HONORED, PLANS BUSY 2000 (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After receiving honors for both Fighter of The Year and Fight of
the Year from ``The Ring Magazine'' Monday in Las Vegas, boxer
Paulie Ayala of Fort Worth, Texas, learned he will follow a stellar
1999 in the ring with an even busier schedule in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to fight four times in 2000,'' said Bob Arum,
Ayala's promoter at Top Rank Inc. ``He's one of our stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Rank is seeking a TVKO pay-per-view fight date for Ayala in
March to be held either in Fort Worth or in Las Vegas. As headliner
of the card, a fight between super bantamweights Danny Romero and
Nestor Garza will precede Ayala's bout, Arum said. An opponent for
Ayala has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's pay-per-view bout will preface appearances on a national
cable network, Arum added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on getting Paulie on Showtime or HBO,'' Arum
said. ``We want to get him on one of those at least two times in
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala fought three times last year, but said he is willing to
fight more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to stay busy,'' Ayala, 29, said. ``I'm used to fighting
six times a year anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala (29-1, 12 knockouts) defeated then-undefeated champion
Johnny Tapia (46-1-2, 25 knockouts) for the World Boxing
Association's bantamweight title on June 23 for Fight of the Year.
He followed the victory with a unanimous decision against the WBA's
No. 1-rated contender, Saohin Srithai Condo, in Fort Worth on Oct.
23 in his first title defense.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Ring Magazine'' Fighter of The Year, Ayala joins a list
of former and current champions that includes Muhammad Ali, Julio
Cesar Chavez, Evander Holyfield and Fort Worth's Donald Curry, who
shared the honor with Marvin Hagler in 1985. Floyd Mayweather Jr.
won the award in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being nominated was satisfying enough, but this is
overwhelming,'' Ayala said. ``When he presented me with the
``Ring'' belt I thought about the famous fighters who have won
before me. It's hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good year. I had a beautiful daughter, and it just
kept on getting better and better in boxing. I just needed the
opportunity. Once I got it, I capitalized on it.'' nn

NORTHRIDGE BEATS ORAL ROBERTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't magic and it wasn't inspiration. More
like perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team, which put forth
what Matadors coaches said was an extraordinary effort in an
overtime loss two days earlier, beat Oral Roberts 72-59 Monday
night in front of 793 at Matador Gym.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (3-2) washed away memories of Saturday's loss at Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo with a scintillating first half against the Golden
Eagles, who dropped to 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby Braswell, the Matadors' head coach, said he didn't
forget the players' effort against Cal Poly, and he told them
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `I'll always tell you the truth,''' Braswell said.
``You guys played well (against Cal Poly). I was very, very pleased
with their effort, and if they showed the same kind of effort in
this game we would get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   That formula _ hard work _ paid off against Oral Roberts,
especially among the role players. Redshirt freshman center Dan
Read, who starts but plays fewer minutes than Brian Heinle, had six
points in 11 minutes and forward Whitney White had a season-high 10
points and five rebounds in only eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   White, particularly, gave CSUN a boost in the first half when
the Matadors built a significant lead. He had eight of the team's
10 points in a five-minute stretch in which a 28-18 CSUN lead
became 38-26.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches always pressure us in practice to play our
roles,'' White said. ``They call me the `Energizer Bunny,' so I
just try to come in the game with energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were sizzling from the floor in taking a 41-27
first-half lead, shooting 66 percent (18 of 27). They also held the
Golden Eagles to eight rebounds in the game's first 20 minutes;
Oral Roberts' tallest starter is 6-foot-6 forward Derrick Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Oral Roberts hung in during the first eight minutes despite not
having starting point guard Eric Perry, who sat out his third
consecutive game with back spasms. But CSUN began pulling away at
the 10-minute mark, and White's basket gave the Matadors their
first double-digit lead _ 28-18.
</P>
<P>
   White, a 6-5 junior from Chicago who only had two points in five
minutes Saturday at Cal Poly, had 10 in only six first-half minutes
Monday. He made 5 of 8 shots in the half and had three offensive
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the closest group of guys I've been around,'' White
said. ``We just stayed together (after losing to Cal Poly). That
was a letdown, but we did what we had to do tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The CSUN players did what starting forward Hewitt Rolle called
``the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing out, diving on the floor,'' said Rolle, who had 11
points and 11 rebounds. ``... We were upset by the loss the other
night. That was a team we shouldn't have lost to.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, which sat on a big lead through the first 14 minutes of
the second half, had its lead reduced to nine _ 58-49 _ when Oral
Roberts' Reggie Tate made a baseline 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Matadors responded with an 8-0 run, which was
highlighted by two three-point plays by Jeff Parris, who led CSUN
with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were consistent up and down the lineup; eight
players had at least six points and five had at least four
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are doing everything we've asked them to,''
Braswell said.

DEION MAY PLAY RECEIVER, BUT GAILEY WON'T REVEAL PLANS

   IRVING, Texas _ The ``possibility'' of Deion Sanders being
integrated into the Dallas Cowboys' offense, even as early as this
week against Philadelphia, had coach Chan Gailey:
</P>
<P>
   1) being evasive.
</P>
<P>
   2) being laconic.
</P>
<P>
   3) holding steadfast that even if his bare feet were held to an
open flame, he would not divulge the secret behind talks to give
Sanders some snaps at wide receiver now that the offense has scored
only four touchdowns in the past 18 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Deion? Offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not out of the realm of possibility,'' said Gailey,
backpeddling nicely.
</P>
<P>
   The mood around Valley Ranch on Monday ranged between vague and
cloaked in secrecy regarding whether Sanders can infuse a
much-needed spark to a sagging Cowboys passing game. The subject
was raised by owner Jerry Jones and Sanders himself Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Has Deion approached Gailey to ask to be put on offense for as
many as 10-12 plays per game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he dropped hints? Yes,'' said Gailey, rewording the
question and providing the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Are they subtle?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not real subtle,'' Gailey replied.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders had 36 receptions for 475 yards for the Cowboys in 1996.
Last season, he had seven receptions for 100 yards. His last catch
came 13 months ago this week in a game against the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking a lot about this now,'' Gailey said a bit
impatiently. ``We've said it's a possibility (that Sanders will
move to receiver).''
</P>
<P>
   Would Gailey prefer to drop him into the lineup against an
unsuspecting opponent rather than advertise the possibility of it
happening?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ``if'' we're going to use him on offense,'' he added.

RESEARCHERS CLAIM TO HAVE BROKEN PRIVACY CODE FOR WIRELESS PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two Israeli researchers say they have found an
efficient way to crack the code that protects the privacy of
conversations and data transmissions over a type of wireless
telephone used by more than 215 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The encryption method is part of the Groupe Speciale Mobile, or
GSM, wireless phone standard. Though not dominant in the United
States, it is the world's most widely used cellular technology.
More than 215 million digital phones use it worldwide, including
more than 100 million in Europe and five million in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Most cell phones in the United States are based on other
wireless technologies, but several American cellular phone
companies, including Pacific Bell, a unit of SBC Communications
Inc., and the Omnipoint Corp., use the GSM standard.
</P>
<P>
   The code the researchers say they cracked is known as the A5/1
algorithm, which is supposed to protect calls from being
intercepted by electronic eavesdroppers. It is not an
authentication code, which prevents detecting a phone's number and
``cloning'' it in another phone to bill calls fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   While cell phone encryption has been cracked before, the new
method is significant because it requires very little computer
power; an eavesdropper with just a PC could break into a
conversation in less than a second, its developers said. Several
methods of attacking the GSM algorithms have been announced before,
but most were impractical, requiring several hours and a network of
computers to intercept a single conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers who say they discovered the latest method are
Alex Biryukov and Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot,
Israel. The men said they were able to break the code using a
computer with 128 megabytes of RAM and two 73 gigabyte hard disks.
The computer is used to analyze the A5/1 algorithm in the first two
minutes of the conversation, which is intercepted using a digital
scanner. Once that data is gathered, the eavesdropper can listen to
the entire conversation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the new cracking method requires resources not
available to most individuals. Before intercepting phone
conversations, an eavesdropper must make one-time sophisticated
computations that demand significant computer power. Once that is
completed, though, all GSM-protected conversations are easily
accessible, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   An eavesdropper must also have access to a digital scanner,
which can intercept wireless calls within a radius of several
miles. Such devices cost thousands of dollars and are illegal in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though the finding was not formally announced, it was confirmed
on Monday by one of the researchers after word spread quickly among
encryption experts on Internet mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Omnipoint on Monday called the researchers'
claims ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're describing is an academic exercise that would
never work in the real world,'' said the spokesman, Terry Phillips.
``What's more, it doesn't take into account the fact that GSM calls
shift frequency continually, so even if they broke into a call, a
second later it would shift to another frequency, and they'd lose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Wagner, a computer security researcher at the
University of California at Berkeley, insisted the discovery was
significant. ``This is a big deal,'' he said. ``I don't think that
the frequency hopping will be a major barrier.'' He added that it
put the interception of GSM calls ``within the reach of corporate
espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer security researchers continually try to break codes
because the measure of an encryption scheme is how much time and
computing power are needed to crack it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Wagner and Ian Goldberg, also at Berkeley, and Marc
Briceno of the Smart Card Developers Association demonstrated that
they could crack an authentication method associated with GSM in a
matter of hours on a single PC.
</P>
<P>
   In their research, they found that the A5/1 algorithm used keys,
which are used to scramble and unscramble the data, that were much
shorter than advertised and thus much easier to break. That
prompted speculation that the algorithm had been deliberately
weakened to allow for government eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Wagner, Goldberg and Briceno developed a method for
breaking into calls protected by weak versions of the A5/1
algorithm used in parts of Asia and Australia. Their method could
break into a conversation in a fraction of a second with a single
PC.

LEGACE(Y) OF PERSEVERANCE   TRAILS EX-KINGS GOALIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Manny Legace, it could be home for the
holidays or Manitoba by morning. Either way, he is a great story of
perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   You might remember him as the goalie who stepped in for the Los
Angeles Kings last year when Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr went
down with injuries just seven minutes apart in the fourth game of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking advantage of a great opportunity, Legace
stepped into a hockey black hole, going 2-9-2 and 0-6 at home. He
quietly left town last summer and signed with Detroit with little
hope of ever playing regularly again.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, the Red Wings' top goalie Chris Osgood is out at
least two more weeks with a hairline fracture in his right forearm.
Veteran backup Ken Wregget is just 5-6 and not playing well for
perhaps the league's best team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head is still spinning,'' Legace said earlier this week
after his recall by Detroit. ``I haven't had time to settle down in
one spot yet. I've been on the road the whole year. The whole year
I've been in a hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Legace's legacy is not just his days in L.A. nor his new role
with Detroit, although it would be fitting to face his former team
Friday when the Kings play the Red Wings at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kings cut Legace, he signed with Red Wings. He had a
great training camp, but with Wregget around, Legace was going to
get sent down. To do so he had to clear waivers and was claimed by
Vancouver. The Canucks had him on their opening-night roster, but
two weeks later he was back walking the waiver wire.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings reclaimed him and sent him to Manitoba of the
International Hockey League. He was awful at first, then suffered a
badly bruised right knee. But with Osgood out and Wregget
struggling with his confidence, Legace might get a little playing
time.
</P>
<P>
   When he was with the Kings last year, Legace got more action
than he could handle. He was the starting goalie in Long Beach when
Storr and Fiset went down. Over the next 16 games, he made 14
starts. The Kings won just twice during that stretch and never were
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   Life is better now but still uncertain. Osgood could return
right before Christmas, meaning Legace could be back in the minors
for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wife's not happy,'' said Legace, who also has two small
children. ``I would like to get them (from Winnipeg) as soon as
possible. I haven't seen the kids in forever. If you only spend a
couple days, they've going to forget who their father was. They are
going to think the mailman was their father.''
</P>
<P>
   Fit to be tied: Friday night's 1-1 tie with the Mighty Ducks
wasn't the best way to spark a rivalry. And when the Kings blew a
3-1 lead in the final three minutes of regulation and had to settle
for a 3-3 tie with Tampa Bay, their magical season seemed to have
hit a snag.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion Atlanta should help on Wednesday. A bigger question is
whether the new four-on-four overtime period really has had any
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically yes. There have been 44 percent of ties broken in
OT this year, compared to 23 percent last season when both sides
play five-on-five.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game was the most-exciting overtime this season. The
Kings outshot the Lightning 5-0 and had several great scoring
chances with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Ducks, the Kings waddled. The action was so
slow, there never was a question the game would end in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was it bad for fans who sold out the Pond, it was awful
for conference play. The West is tighter than ever this season. But
teams, who know they will get a point regardless of the final
outcome, are not prepared to lose a point by playing recklessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy level in overtime is better than ever,'' King coach
Andy Murray said. ``It's unfortunate the conference games haven't
been more exciting, but you have to understand what is at stake. A
point here or there could decide this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Daigle no longer dangling: Alexandre Daigle was the first player
chosen in the 1993 draft by Ottawa and twice scored more than 20
goals in the NHL. He was considered one of the league's brightest
prospects except for one thing. Or two. Or three.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Daigle (pronounced Dayg) ever worked at was
honing his bad attitude. He never took the game seriously and
confounded his coaches, who called him lazy.
</P>
<P>
   After five years in Ottawa, the Senators had enough. Then it was
on to Philadelphia, where Flyers coach Roger Neilson said Daigle
``loves everything about hockey except playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Daigle couldn't even stick with lowly Tampa Bay, where he played
before the New York Rangers made him a reclamation project this
season
</P>
<P>
   Now 24, Daigle seems to have found his way on the league's most
underachieving team. He continued to play well Saturday, scoring
the tying goal in a 1-1 game against Buffalo. In six games since
Daigle was recalled from Hartford, he has three goals and three
assists.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been the only bright light on a dismal team that has
gotten only one goal in the past 17 games from high-priced free
agent Theo Fleury. The Rangers have the league's highest payroll
and worst power play.
</P>
<P>
   They also have been playing without Brian Leetch (fractured
forearm), Valeri Kamensky (bruised forearm) and Petr Nedved (groin
pull) because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But coach John Muckler isn't ready to call Daigle a savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased,'' Muckler said. ``But he has to understand
that he has to continue to do this every night. He has to be held
on a short leash and he has to know that. He has to know that this
is his last opportunity to play in the National Hockey League.
Nobody questions his talent. They've questioned other things, but
they don't question his talent.''

USC RECEIVERS COACH WILSON MIGHT LEAVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The next USC assistant to depart the staff could
be wide receivers coach Mike Wilson, who might join his brother in
private business. A decision could be made as soon as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The other coach who is most often the focus of speculation,
offensive coordinator Hue Jackson, is not believed to be in
jeopardy of losing his job, according to several sources.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said he would make final decisions
regarding his staff by mid-December, but all of USC's defensive
coaches have been assured they will return.
</P>
<P>
   As reported Monday, USC officially named tight ends coach Steve
Morton as the offensive line coach, replacing Steve Greatwood, who
was fired last week.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves a vacancy at tight ends. A longshot candidate might
be former USC assistant and Los Angeles Rams lineman Doug Smith,
who met briefly with Hackett last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Oregon?: Greatwood might be returning to his alma mater,
Oregon, although a defined role has not been established.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a possibility. The right circumstances have to happen
there,'' Greatwood said.
</P>
<P>
   The La Crescenta resident is in no hurry to find a job, because
he still has 20 months remaining on his USC contract.
</P>
<P>
   Turner out: Men's basketball forward Jarvis Turner will miss
four to six weeks while recovering from a stress fracture in his
left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing Jarvis Turner is a serious blow to the team,'' USC
coach Henry Bibby said. ``His loss limits our versatility on the
court and we will also miss his senior leadership.''

CLIPPERS FALL TO HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Serious Los Angeles Clippers scholars figured out
this team's patterns a long time ago. Pattern one: down and out.
Pattern two: fade.
</P>
<P>
   But through a bit more than the first month of this season,
another pattern emerged: the Clippers were 1-10 against teams from
the Western Conference, but had a relative feast against the East
(3-2).
</P>
<P>
   This incongruity was settled Monday by the Miami Heat, who
defeated the Clippers 99-91 in front of 10,194 at Staples Center,
even though the pattern seemed legit for most of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   However, the now-hackneyed, doomsday script was at full strength
in the second half, permitting the Clippers to end their homestand
at an imperfect 0-5. They will begin a three-game road swing
Wednesday at Atlanta with six consecutive defeats and an overall
mark of 4-13.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Riley's Heat (13-4) maintained the best record among
Eastern Conference heavies and ended a two-game road losing streak.
Miami has won five of six games without point guard Tim Hardaway
(jammed right knee).
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway's understudy, Anthony Carter, provided a career-high,
20-point bonanza for Miami, which also received a 25-point,
11-rebound, eight-block effort from All-Star center Alonzo Mourning
and 20 points from Jamal Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told our guys before the game, during the game and during
the timeouts, `Do not challenge Alonzo,' '' Clippers coach Chris
Ford said. ``You know he's going to come ... find the open man.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Clippers did just that, racking up 22 assists, their
most in one game this season.
</P>
<P>
   The lead pitch man was triple-double threat Derek Anderson, who
responded with his shift to point guard by posting 16 points, 10
rebounds and 12 assists for the Clippers. It was Los Angeles' first
triple-double since Mark Jackson did it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays hard, he plays well wherever I put him,'' Ford said
of Anderson, whose duties included the futile chasing of the
smaller Carter when the Miami guard spent a great deal of the
second half curling around screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little tired,'' Anderson admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom, who added 20 points and seven rebounds, still can't
find much joy in losing, but was encouraged by the improvement his
team made since last Saturday's disaster against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I can go home and sleep after this one,'' Odom said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers also received solid efforts from Maurice Taylor (17
points, 9 rebounds, 8 turnovers) and Brian Skinner (15 points, 6
rebounds), but it wasn't enough to offset Mourning inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the league's toughest players,'' Odom said. ``He's
a monster; he's relentless.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning's 13 points kept the Heat at room temperature through
the first quarter, which ended with the Clippers leading 31-25.
Clarence Weatherspoon (8 points) starred for Miami's bench, which
helped the Heat pull ahead 46-44 at intermission. Miami led 72-66
after three and by as many as 14 in the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of good things out there,'' said Ford, whose team
outrebounded the Heat 47-41, but was loose enough on defense for
Miami to shoot 51 percent for the game. ``We just have to get some
court awareness; some court savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, with three road games against Eastern Conference foes, they
need to resume that pattern.

SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF RESIGNS IN WAKE OF WTO PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Police Chief Norm Stamper says he is resigning and
that he takes full responsibility for the riots that disrupted the
World Trade Organization meeting and brought chaos to the city's
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper sent a letter Monday to Mayor Paul Schell announcing his
decision to step down as head of the city's 1,800-member force at
the end of March, ending his six-year tenure as chief. Schell
accepted the resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The move, Stamper said, is designed to ``depoliticize'' the
chief's job as the City Council, American Civil Liberties Union and
others prepare to investigate the department's actions during the
WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in making this announcement, I've taken my tenure off
the table. I will be leaving the Seattle Police Department,'' he
said in an interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will stay through March so that he can help
investigators sort out how and why police lost control of the
demonstrations and can speak freely in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's poor form to just walk away, especially at a time
when we're involved in some intensive review of last week's
experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper said he had made up his mind last month that he would
announce his retirement in January. But the events of last week
changed his timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that I'll be leaving (the chief's job) two months
later than I expected to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the chief's resignation, Schell called Stamper an
effective but unpopular leader who was misunderstood by
rank-and-file officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been a great chief and I tried to talk him out of
it. ... He's a man of absolute integrity,'' Schell said Monday
night. ``Anybody who is a change agent faces the challenge of being
effective but not necessarily popular. That comes at a price. But
history (will) judge him with a kind eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamper's decision caps a scandal-filled year that began with
allegations that a Seattle homicide detective stole $10,000 from a
crime scene and culminated last week as outnumbered police officers
fired tear gas, pepper spray and rubber pellets at WTO
demonstrators on downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police and law enforcement officials outside the
department _ including King County Sheriff Dave Reichert _
complained bitterly that Stamper and Schell were not prepared to
handle the thousands of protesters who descended on the city for
the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, WTO delegates were placed at risk, the meeting was
disrupted, violence spilled out of downtown into the nearby
residential Capitol Hill neighborhood, downtown businesses
sustained more than $2 million in damage and the city's retail core
lost millions more dollars from lost sales at the height of the
Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday night, police officers yanked Seattle City
Councilman Richard McIver from his car as he tried to drive into a
restricted area.
</P>
<P>
   McIver, who is black, said the officers ignored his business
card, and he said the incident highlights problems in how the
department deals with people of color.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, police officers complained loudly and publicly that
the failure to anticipate violence left their ranks so thin that
they could not do their jobs. Many said they were dangerously tired
while on the front lines for nearly 20 hours without food, backup
support or enough tear gas and pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly do accept full responsibility that our officers
did not get all the support they needed and deserve,'' Stamper
said. ``As the chief, it's fundamentally important for people to
understand that we knew this was going to be big. We knew that
there was a potential for violence and destructive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamper acknowledged for the first time Monday that the mayhem
on Seattle's streets last Tuesday nearly caused President Clinton
to cancel his trip to the city to speak to WTO delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had a very serious conversation about whether all the
venues the president would visit were secure,'' Stamper said.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper, visibly relaxed and confident during the interview,
denied that politics had played a role in tactical decisions for
handling the protests.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that the department _ and the city _ had
tried to negotiate with the protesters rather than confront them.
</P>
<P>
   He said Assistant Chief Ed Joiner directed the tactical response
to demonstrators practicing civil disobedience while negotiating
behind the scenes with protest group leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the leaders of the various demonstration factions were
not able to deliver,'' Stamper said. ``In other words, they were
dealing with the wild card of demonstrators who are not part of
their particular group, and who are not playing by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamper said police faced squirt guns filled with urine, chunks
of concrete and soda pop cans filled with gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anarchists used techniques downtown that they were trained
for,'' Stamper said. ``They integrated themselves into peaceful
demonstrators. They made it very clear to us that if we were going
to get to them, we were going to have to come through people who
were not destructive and violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``One protest leader reported to us that he saw anarchists
change clothes three times a day to avoid detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamper said the Seattle Police Department _ and police officers
called in from King County and elsewhere _ were trained and
prepared to handle unruly and even violent protests. But they just
did not have the numbers to cope with tens of thousands of
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Cities like New York, with nearly 40,000 officers, and Chicago,
with 15,000 officers, ``can pour two to three to four times the
number of officers that we can into those venues for dignitary
protection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle could not match those forces. ``Even with mutual aid,
looking at the entire state of Washington, we're asking other law
enforcement agencies to literally strip their streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard eventually sent in 300 unarmed troops and the
Washington State Patrol sent another 300 armed troopers after the
violence broke out Tuesday. But they did not arrive until Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Schell said he was disappointed that Stamper was leaving under a
cloud. The chief, he said, had hoped to walk away from the job
after guiding the city successfully through the WTO and the arrival
of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's his life,'' Schell said. ``And it's not going to be
fun for the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamper said he was under no pressure from the mayor to announce
his retirement earlier. He said he informed Deputy Mayor Maud
Daudon of his intentions Saturday. She arranged a meeting Sunday
with Schell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said this is categorical, it's unequivocal,'' Stamper said.
``Does this look like the face of somebody who's indecisive about
his decision?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a responsibility to stick around and answer
questions about WTO. It's no secret that there are officers who
believe that they didn't get as much support for this as they
needed and deserved, and I want to hear any and all concerns and
answer every question that I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also want to be a part of systematically critiquing and
debriefing the WTO experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vancouver, B.C., where police employed similar means to
curtail looting and violence during protests against the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum held there in 1997, public
hearings into whether the police responded appropriately are still
going on.
</P>
<P>
   Second-guessing takes time, said Vancouver Police Department
Inspector Ken Doern, a specialist in crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of WTO, Stamper said he hopes his legacy will be his
advocacy of community policing, a concept some officers resisted
and some community members have misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community policing is not a touchy-feely police strategy,''
the chief said yesterday with a tinge of frustration. ``That kind
of a term attached to policing or my leadership position is kind of
evidence of lazy journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community policing is very tough to pull off. ... And when it
works, it sets the stage for the next phase of community policing,
which is a deeper and deeper commitment'' to working closely with
the community.
</P>
<P>
   In Schell's three-paragraph letter accepting the chief's
resignation, the mayor credited Stamper's community policing
formula for plummeting crime rates. And he praised the chief's
unwavering focus on improving the department's record of civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under your leadership, our police department and its citizen
partners have accomplished a great deal,'' Schell said. ``Crime is
down. Ours is the best domestic violence response police force in
the country. Citizen complaints are down by two-thirds in your six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stood firm against racism, sexism, and homophobia. Human
rights are stronger in our department and across our community
because of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he arrived in Seattle in February 1994 after having been
executive assistant police chief for San Diego, Stamper has taken
an active and visible role in Seattle's diverse neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   He was a regular marcher in the annual Gay Pride Parade, which
alienated him from many of the rank-and-file officers. He also met
regularly with representatives of the city's minority communities
and invited controversy by speaking frankly about his own
experience as a rookie cop who witnessed and participated in police
abuse of civil rights.

<P>
   For two of the world's finest jockeys, Wednesday promises to be
a date with history.
</P>
<P>
   If Laffit Pincay, Jr., who turns 53 on Dec. 29, can steer home
three more victories at Hollywood Park Wednesday to add to the
8,831 he already has to his name, he will become, as the Americans
like to put it, the winning-most jockey in history.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie ``the Shoe'' Shoemaker retired in 1990 after 41
years in the saddle, he had ridden 8,833 winners, a mark which many
felt belonged in the same ``unbreakable'' category as Bob Beamon's
long-jump track-and-field record. Yet Beamon's mark was eventually
passed, and now the Shoe, too, is to be eclipsed.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 or more races on an average card, and a season which
never really ends, American jockeys have many more opportunities to
rack up a huge lifetime total than their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Kieren Fallon, for instance, has ridden 200 winners in each of
the last three seasons, but this is rightly seen as an immense
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The sums show, though, that he would need to reach a
double-century in each of the next 35-odd seasons to begin to
threaten Shoemaker's total.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even so, Pincay's imminent overhaul of the man who was a
fierce rival for many seasons is both a personal and professional
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   He rode his first winner in his native Panama in 1964, when he
was 17, Douglas-Home was the British prime minister, and Nelson
Mandela was just beginning his life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In the 36 years since, he has won the Kentucky Derby, the
Belmont Stakes three years in a row and seven Breeders' Cup races,
as well as winning the Eclipse Award for America's leading jockey
five times, more than any other rider.
</P>
<P>
   He also produced his own version of Dettori Day at Santa Anita
in 1987, when he won seven races in an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But Pincay's career has been a much harder struggle than the
bare numbers of winners and prize-money might imply.
</P>
<P>
   He stands just five feet and one inch tall, but his upper body
is built like a linebacker's, and his weight has been a lifelong
problem.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, America's most successful trainer, once told a
story of a plane trip from the West Coast to the East in the seat
next to Pincay. While Lukas tucked into the in-flight meal, Pincay
just watched, until eventually he asked the stewardess for a cup of
thin soup.
</P>
<P>
   The jockey drank a mouthful of soup, then reached for a packet
of peanuts. He removed a single peanut, split it in two, and spent
three minutes chewing one of the two halves. He then took another
swig of soup. That, apparently, was breakfast, lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   It was a regime which was always likely to catch up with him.
Two years ago, within sight of Shoemaker's record, Pincay found he
was growing too weak to ride morning work, and as a result, the
bookings for the afternoons started to dry up too.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he adopted a more generous, but still strictly
calorie-conscious, diet of fish, chicken and fruit did the strength
and opportunities return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have a lot of pressure when I was younger and I was
going for titles and fighting weight,'' Pincay said on Saturday,
shortly after winning the $400,000 Hollywood Turf Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were days when I felt really good and there were days
that I felt terrible. I have learned so much about myself and my
body. I'm very relaxed and enjoying myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Shoe retired, I thought no one would even come close to
that record, but I'm surprised how easy it has been for me.''
</P>
<P>
   At 52, Pincay has set no date for his retirement, saying only
that he will continue to ride for as long as he enjoys it.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he will have set a fresh target for his colleagues, one
which the likes of Pat Day (more than 7,600 wins) and Chris
McCarron (6,800) may one day overhaul in their turn.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years yet, though, Pincay will be able to call himself
the winning-most jockey, and even Shoemaker is pleased about that.
``If it's going to be broken, there's no one better,'' the Shoe
said recently. ``There has never been any rider more dedicated to
his profession.'' &QL;

ANALYSIS: TRUMP COUNTING ON HIS FAME, WEALTH IN POSSIBLE REFORM 
 PARTY RUN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS _ Three months before the March 7 primary, at a
time when most of the presidential field is trooping in and out of
California to scoop up campaign contributions, billionaire Donald
Trump may be the only candidate to actually earn money on a
campaign trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Donald is scheduled to speak Tuesday before a sold-out crowd
of 21,000 at Arrowhead Pond stadium in Anaheim, Calif., as part of
motivational guru Anthony Robbins' ``Results 2000'' seminar _ one
of 10 such speeches for which he'll rake in $100,000 per talk,
sources confirm.
</P>
<P>
   He's even collecting outside contributions _ about $10,000 so
far _ because ``being a smart entrepreneur, he'll never leave
honest money on the table,'' said Trump political consultant Roger
Stone.
</P>
<P>
   During a 20-minute press conference beside the pool on the roof
of the L'Ermitage Hotel, the developer, author and star of TV
commercials assailed the World Trade Organization, said he would
appoint himself U.S. trade representative, slammed Republican
front-runner George W. Bush's tax plan as ``timid'' and said his
gut tells him he could be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   With a ``Trump 2000'' poster beside him, he dismissed his chief
competition for the Reform Party nomination, Pat Buchanan, as a guy
without a chance and dismissed all the other rich guys _ Steve
Forbes, are you listening? _ who've unsuccessfully tried to run for
high office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not them,'' he said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's first trip as a possible presidential candidate to the
nation's most populous state underscored just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we can get the Reform Party nomination,'' he told
reporters. He said he'll decide by late February whether to run to
become the most powerful leader in the free world ``based on
whether or not the election can be won. ... In a three-person race,
we need 33 to 34 percent. So it's not a very large percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump's Reform Party explorations come in a year when such
celebrities as former wrestler Jesse Ventura and actor Warren
Beatty also have flirted with a top run.
</P>
<P>
   But at the exclusive L'Ermitage, where he held court, Trump's
appearance trumped the glitz of Beatty and the gutsiness of
Ventura, forging an almost surreal marriage between marketing
madness and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The developer's aides, razor sharp in black suits and
sunglasses, handed out samples of Trump 2000 hand sanitizer _ a
wink to the candidate's reluctance to shake hands _ and glossy
pamphlets to sell his new book, titled, ``Donald J. Trump for
President?''
</P>
<P>
   Melania Knauss, Trump's lady du jour, stood by demurely, the
very picture of first lady serenity _ with tanned, bare,
up-to-there miniskirted legs and 5-inch spike heels.
</P>
<P>
   Political and entertainment reporters stepped over each other to
catch the action as, across the pool from Trump, Jodie Foster was
doing her own sales job _ interviews for the premiere of the movie
``Anna and the King.'' As if that weren't enough, a bejeweled
elephant in brocade prowled the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Trump's potential appeal to the common voter in the
midst of all this uncommon political splendor, campaign adviser
Stone captured the context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is the central question when it comes to Trump's
candidacy: Is pop culture more influential in this country than the
old institutions? In the old days, a developer from Queens could
not get elected president, because the institutions in this country
would not allow it. We kind of think in the age of mass
communications, the institutions are losing their power and the
people are making their own decisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around at the group of political writers, Stone warned,
``You can laugh at the ... `Entertainment Tonights' and the `Hard
Copies' if you want ... but millions of people are watching those
things, and forming opinions based on what they see.''
</P>
<P>
   At a tony reception, Trump got high marks from 90 Reform Party
leaders from throughout the West who crammed in and grabbed ``Trump
2000'' buttons. But he took some aggressive questions on trade and
campaign finance reform, even as he made his sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the purpose in getting the nomination if you can't
win?'' he said. ``If I decide to run, I'd be willing to spend $100
million of my own money. Pat (Buchanan) is not going to do that. He
doesn't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump then took his case to ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   There, introduced as ``the next President of the United
States,'' the billionaire strode onstage to cheers and the sounds
of ``Hail to the Chief,'' his hands raised in victory signs.
</P>
<P>
   Leno, who regularly uses Trump as monologue material, let fly.
``How 'bout a first lady. Would you hold a massive search?'' Leno
asked. ``If you got married in the White House and got divorced,
would she get, like, west of the Mississippi?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to get a prenup, to save the country,'' Trump
deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Trump's dressing room, Leno said the billionaire has
been a good sport _ and makes better material than most
presidential candidates. (``The toughest is McCain,'' he lamented.
``You can't go there.'')
</P>
<P>
   And the current long presidential campaign _ one that has melded
show biz and politics in a singular way _ may help vet the
candidates better than anything else, Leno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand you have to have a thick skin to do this.
... That's why the American process takes 18 months _ it's a
setup,'' Leno said, slapping Trump on the back. ``After (he's) been
through all of the nonsense ... you won't catch him in a bra and
panties.''

It ain't over till it's over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nowhere has that butchered bit of wisdom ever been more true
than in Monday night's game between the Grizzlies and Rockets at
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Given the teams involved, this game was destined to come down to
the wire. Why? Because on one hand you had the Grizzlies, who had
seemingly forgotten how to win a game. And on the other you had the
Rockets, a team that seemed intent on inventing ways to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to give, and it turned out to be the Grizzlies,
who did everything but gift-wrap a 102-99 victory for the Rockets,
their third straight win and fourth in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, people might say, `Oh, the (Rockets) are going to
win that game,' or whatever,'' said Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
of playing a Vancouver team that is now 3-14. ``But if you lose
this game, it really sets you back.''
</P>
<P>
   And with a quick three-game East Coast trip coming up this week,
the Rockets desperately wanted the win Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But not as desperately as the Grizzlies, who entered the game
with 10 straight losses overall and 29 straight on the road over
the past couple of seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Given their chances, however, the Grizzlies couldn't capitalize
after a fourth-quarter comeback erased a nine-point deficit. They
missed three key free throws in the final 6.2 seconds, and since
these are the Grizzlies, the only one they made in that span was
the one Othella Harrington was trying to miss.
</P>
<P>
   With Vancouver down by two points, Harrington was fouled inside,
but he missed the first of his two free throws. With 6.2 seconds
left, he tried to miss the second, hoping the Grizzlies could get
the rebound and tip it in. But the ball smacked off the backboard
and plopped straight into the basket, leaving them down 100-99 and
out of timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to win the game, and I blew it,'' said
Harrington, who finished with 18 points and seven rebounds but made
just six of his 11 free-throw attempts. ``That was tough. I
couldn't believe it when it came out.''
</P>
<P>
   That, more than anything else, has typified Vancouver's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hung in there, and the objective is to win,'' said Charles
Barkley, who finished with game highs in scoring (25 points) and
rebounds (11). ``We've played well the last two weeks, and we lost
some games we should have won. We could have a six- or seven-game
win streak (now).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important road trip coming up, and we'll know
where we're at when we come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, because they appeared to be lost at times Monday
night. And lost could have described Shandon Anderson, who had
scored 53 points in his last two games. He scored just one point
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets found Carlos Rogers, who missed the previous
game against Phoenix with stomach flu. Rogers scored 18 points,
hitting eight of his 11 shots, and picked off seven rebounds in 24
minutes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed somebody else to step up, and today it was Carlos,''
Tomjanovich said. ``That was big, since he had been sick. That's 18
points where we don't have to call a play for him. He was just
using the system and hustling.''
</P>
<P>
   Also involved in the system was Walt Williams, who hit a huge
3-pointer to put the Rockets up 100-96 with 59.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But that lead wouldn't hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who led Vancouver with 24 points in 28
foul-plagued minutes, hit a short hook shot in the lane to pull the
Grizzlies within 100-98 with 41.4 seconds to play. Williams, who
finished with 14 points, rimmed out a 3-point attempt from the top
of the arc, but Barkley grabbed the rebound to maintain possession
for the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't keep the ball long.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Williams was unable to get the ball inbounds in
the allotted five seconds, giving the Grizzlies the ball and a
chance to tie the game in the final 17.6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good five-second call by the refs,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``You always think it's too fast when it (the call) is
against you. The guys just didn't get open. We had timeouts, but we
didn't call time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington then did his free-throw routine, leaving the
Grizzlies pretty much out of gas.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
TAMPA, Fla. _ No matter how long he plays in the NFL, Tampa Bay
rookie quarterback Shaun King will never forget the first start of
his career.
<TEXT>
<P>
   King, a native of St. Petersburg, made his starting debut
against the Minnesota Vikings in front of family, friends, a
Raymond James Stadium-record crowd of 65,741 and a Monday Night
Football audience.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intense pressure of a showdown for a share of first
place in the NFC Central, King played with the poise of a veteran,
throwing two touchdown passes in the Buccaneers' 24-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaun played a nice, smooth, efficient game,'' Bucs coach Tony
Dungy said. ``I think we'll keep him starting next week. The team
rallied around him, and he was more calm than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs didn't have the victory secured until their outstanding
defense stopped the Vikings' explosive offense on the last series
of the game. When Jeff George's fourth-and-19 pass with 23 seconds
left was incomplete, the Buccaneers were finally able to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay increased its winning streak to five games and
elevated its record to 8-4, remaining in a first-place tie with the
Detroit Lions, who visit the Buccaneers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every game in the NFC Central is just as tough
and hard-fought as this one,'' Dungy said. ``We knew we had
Minnesota and Detroit back-to-back. So far, we've done what we set
out to do when our streak started, and now we're playing the Lions
for first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's five-game winning streak ended, and the Vikings
dropped to 7-5, one game behind the division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   King, a second-round pick from Tulane, replaced Trent Dilfer,
who is out for the season with a broken collarbone. He completed 11
of 19 passes for 94 yards and was intercepted once. The Bucs
generated only 190 yards compared to Minnesota's 339.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a defense like ours, it wasn't necessary for
me to make a lot of great plays,'' King said. ``I didn't want to do
anything stupid. I wasn't nervous. I tried to stay calm. I really
enjoyed this one.''
</P>
<P>
   King outdueled George, who had been unbeatable since being
elevated to starting status six games ago. George's record fell to
5-1 as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota had a chance to tie the score and force overtime on
its last series, but Tampa Bay's defense won that battle.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:24 remaining, the Vikings got the ball at their 30, and
they were on the move. On a fourth-and-one, George threw an
incompletion from the Tampa Bay 44, but a false-start penalty gave
them a reprieve. On fourth-and-six, he completed a 15-yard pass to
Jake Reed.
</P>
<P>
   After two incompletions and another false-start penalty, George
threw to Leroy Hoard, who did a magnificent job of running for a
first down at the 25. After George spiked the ball, the Vikings had
another false-start penalty. Then, cornerback Ronde Barber blitzed
and had a clear path to George for a 10-yard sack.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-25 from the Bucs' 40, George threw a short pass to
running back Robert Smith, who couldn't get out of bounds after a
six-yard gain, forcing Minnesota to use its last timeout. On
fourth-and-19 from the 34 with 23 seconds left, George's pass
intended for Matthew Hatchette was off target and broken up by
cornerback Donnie Abraham, and the celebration began.
</P>
<P>
   In a sloppy first half, there were six turnovers, three by each
team. The first one came on Minnesota's first series, and it
resulted in Tampa Bay's first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the third play of the game, George threw to receiver Cris
Carter on the right side, but his pass was intercepted by Abraham,
who was blitzing off the slot receiver. Abraham caught the ball in
full stride and had an open field on his way to a 55-yard
touchdown. Rookie kicker Martin Gramatica kicked the extra point
for a fast 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay increased the lead on its next series. After Gary
Anderson missed a 46-yard field-goal attempt for Minnesota, the
Buccaneers drove to the Vikings' two-yard line and settled for
Gramatica's 20-yard field goal and a 10-0 lead early in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings had a chance to score on their next series, but
Abraham intercepted George again. The Bucs gave it right back,
however, when King was sacked by end Chris Doleman. King fumbled,
and tackle John Randle recovered at the Tampa Bay 22. The Vikings
used five plays to cover 22 yards. Hoard scored the touchdown on a
one-yard run, and Anderson made it 10-7 with the extra point.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs committed another turnover when King was intercepted by
safety Robert Griffith. The Vikings couldn't do anything with it,
but when Mitch Berger's punt was fumbled by Karl Williams at the
Tampa Bay 10 with 56 seconds left in the first half, Minnesota took
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-goal from the one, George threw a quick touchdown
pass to Carter, his 11th since George replaced Randall Cunningham
6{ games ago for a 14-10 Minnesota lead at halftime.

GOP HOPEFULS SPAR _ WITH VERY SOFT GLOVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Republican presidential contenders sparred gently
Monday night even as stragglers in the contest sought to draw
contrasts with front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Although the format offered candidates an opportunity to
question one another, it was a surprisingly bloodless affair. There
were as many moments of bonhomie as biting thrust and parry.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a competitive edge in the hourlong session
was the effort of Sen. John McCain of Arizona to appear more well
informed than Bush on the esoteric historical importance of Dean
Acheson, a Democratic secretary of state a half-century ago, and
the role of foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain also parted company on the future of the
economy, with the Texas governor defending the soundness of his
tax-cut proposal because, ``I refuse to accept that the surpluses
are going to decline.'' Later in the debate, McCain took pains to
assert: ``I do not envision surpluses forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the four of his challengers appeared on stage at the
Orpheum Theatre, a 70-year-old vaudeville and movie palace near
Phoenix's modern civic center. McCain participated by satellite
hook-up from Boston after a day of campaigning in the first-primary
state of New Hampshire, where some polls show the senator has
pulled even with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush retains a major polling lead nationally, but that position
could be eroded by a poor showing in the early contests. Other
candidates in the debate were magazine publisher Steve Forbes, Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah, conservative activist Gary Bauer and former
Reagan administration diplomat Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, lagging near the back of the pack in polling, took the
most direct shot of the night at Bush, repeating his doubts about
whether the Texan is experienced enough to take on the nation's
highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been a great governor,'' Hatch said, ``but you need
more experience before you become president.'' Hatch, drawing
laughter from the audience, said he was considering Bush as a
vice-presidential running mate, and predicting that after two terms
at the Utahan's side, Hatch said Bush would ``make a heck of a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   In questioning from CNN correspondents and other candidates,
Bush defended his education plan and his approach to China against
suggestions that they were similar to those of President Clinton _
and, by extension, of Vice President Al Gore, front-runner for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   When a CNN reporter questioned how Bush's proposed reliance on
federal mandates in schooling was different from Clinton's, the
governor shot back: ``It's not even close.'' He cited his advocacy
of school vouchers, to allow parents greater choice in schools for
their children, and said: ``My plan says less power in Washington,
not more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of candidate-to-candidate questions, Bauer
challenged Bush on the governor's support for China to become a
member of the World Trade Organization, which he said was an
embrace of the Clinton policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he rejected the Clinton approach to China as a
``strategic partner'' of the United States and would redefine it as
``one of competitors.'' But he strongly defended his call for more,
not less, commercial dealings with the Asian giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in our best interest to sell to China,'' Bush said,
saying even conservative critics such as Bauer might ``be amazed at
how soon democracy will come. ... But if we turn our back on China
things would get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In that answer and most others, Bush relied on long-tested
snippets from his stock campaign speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate last week, Bush pointed to a book about Acheson as
something he was currently reading, so a CNN reporter asked him
what lessons he had drawn from the volume.
</P>
<P>
   With only passing reference to the book, Bush launched into the
foreign policy segment of his stump speech, saying, ``The United
States must not retreat within our own borders'' and must promote
peace through strategic alliances, free trade and a strong
military.
</P>
<P>
   During his next response, McCain, unbidden, said: ``Let me talk
about Dean Acheson a second,'' pointing out that the diplomat and
President Truman decided to move U.S. forces to Korea ``without a
poll.'' McCain contrasted that with the ``feckless, photo-op
foreign policy'' of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Forbes tried to pin Bush down on how to lower crude oil
prices and asked him to name a favored selling price.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush stressed the need for increased domestic oil and
natural gas production, McCain, in a later, unrelated answer on
faith-based institutions, did a short riff on the importance of
energy supplies in Azerbaijan and the need to ensure that Russia
does not exert undue influence in the Caspian region.
</P>
<P>
   Although the format allowed candidates to question each other
directly, only one query in each of three rounds could be directed
to any one candidate, so any thought of directly ganging up on
front-runner Bush had to be laid aside. Bush drew the first
question in two of the three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   A new Newsweek poll among New Hampshire Republicans found Bush
and McCain in a statistical dead heat, with Bush favored by 38
percent and McCain by 33 percent. The margin of error was plus or
minus 7 percentage points. A Boston Herald poll, of New Hampshire
Republicans, published Sunday, found an even closer race, with Bush
leading McCain 34 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The session in the Arizona capital came four days after a New
Hampshire forum, the first debate that Bush agreed to join. Next
Monday, the candidates meet in Des Moines, Iowa, for their third
pre-Christmas debate. Iowa, with its Jan. 24 caucuses, is site of
the first major primary-season event. McCain is not an active
participant in the Iowa caucuses, but will appear in debates there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, during a town-hall meeting in Farmington, N.H.,
McCain said he would shut down the federal government if necessary
to restrain pork-barrel spending. Aware that shutting the
government in a fiscal fight with President Clinton cost
Republicans public support earlier in the decade, McCain aides
rushed to say that the senator was not looking for a disruptive
political fight with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was explicit on the point when asked by a voter if he
would veto all spending bills and allow the government to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I would,'' he replied. ``If we don't change business as
usual in Washington, people will be deprived of their
representation.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain does not mention a shutdown in anti-pork barrel
television ads scheduled to begin airing this week in New Hampshire
and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will refuse to sign any pork barrel bill that crosses my
desk,'' McCain says in the ad, the text of which was released by
his campaign. ``And if Congress overrides my veto and tries to
force me to waste your money, I'll make sure you know who they are,
every single one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Farmington, McCain said he would ``make them famous'' by
naming names.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate was a make-up session for Bush, who skipped the
Arizona Republican Party's candidate forum last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Arizona is McCain's home state _ and he was re-elected
last year with 70 percent of the vote _ Bush's popularity in the
state has made the local GOP presidential contest a competitive
one. Bush led in statewide polling earlier in the year, but a late
October sampling for KAET-TV by Arizona State University found
McCain leading Bush 39 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The polling raised questions about the pre-debate claim of Rep.
J.D. Hayworth, a local U.S. House member, that Arizona is ``McCain
country.'' The senator especially has been embarrassed by the
decision of Gov. Jane Hull to back Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republicans hold a primary Feb. 22, one of the earliest
state tests for the candidates.

AMERICA IS GOING TIME-CAPSULE CRAZY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a paradox for the ages: Time capsules, buried to help
future generations remember the past, are instead one of the most
forgotten items on earth.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, said Paul Hudson, co-founder of the International
Time Capsule Society at Atlanta's Oglethorpe University. Even
though about 10,000 time capsules have been buried worldwide this
century, we don't have a clue where most of them are. According to
Hudson's estimates, 9 out of every 10 time capsules buried are now
officially lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's human nature,'' said Hudson. ``We move on. There's a lot
of excitement when people bury (a capsule). But they tend to forget
them almost the day after they seal them up.''
</P>
<P>
   So are we just wasting our time with time capsules?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But it doesn't seem to be stopping us. As we roll toward
the start of a new millennium, time capsules _ containers filled
with items meant to give future generations a glimpse into life in
the past _ have never been hotter.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is going time-capsule crazy,'' said Hudson. ``With the
millennium coming, people sort of want to write themselves into
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Time capsules have never been easier to find. Scads of capsules
are offered on the Internet and in an increasing number of stores.
They can also be found on cereal boxes, in various museums and sold
through catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Jim Croce wished he could save time in a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he could. In a bottle, jug, vat, tube, safe, aluminum
cylinder or polymer storage pod. Manufacturers report surging sales
of containers, ranging from $9.99 to more than a thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Cities are making them. So are schools, scout troops, churches,
corporations, individuals and agencies of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Why the rush?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what they're all looking for is an independent voice
to the future,'' Hudson said. ``We all want to know we made a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of schools in the Kansas City area will either open or
bury a time capsule in 2000. On Jan. 1, 2001, Kansas City officials
will open one 100-year-old time capsule and leave behind another. A
committee is working on what to put in that capsule.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate its legacy of world-class science, the U.S.
Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton,
N.Y., will bury two time capsules on its site. The specially
designed, flame-sealed glass capsules will contain documents,
photographs, scientific objects and other memorabilia. A monument
will be placed at the burial site.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorcycle Hall of Fame in Pickerington, Ohio, is also
getting in on the fun. It's collecting messages at $50 to $100 a
pop to send to future bikers.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York, a group of would-be preservationists is raising
money to create a flying time capsule named KEO that will orbit the
Earth. Participants are being asked to write messages of up to
6,000 characters and submit them through a Web site (www.keo.org).
Messages will be stored on special, glass-tempered CD-ROMs and sent
into space in a satellite that is supposed to fall to Earth in
about 50,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson has been watching the increasing interest in time
capsules with delight. A historian, he became enamored of them
after discovering the Rolls-Royce of all capsules, the ``Crypt of
Civilization,'' buried at Oglethorpe in 1940. The crypt is not set
to be opened until _ hold on to your time machine _ 8113.
</P>
<P>
   The swimming-pool sized crypt holds thousands of items _ from
dental floss and newsreels of Adolf Hitler to the works of
Shakespeare and more than 640,000 book pages on microfilm.
</P>
<P>
   It even has a specially sealed ampule of Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``So whoever opens the crypt in 8113,'' Hudson said wryly,
``that Bud would be for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The crypt's creator, Thornwell Jacobs, chose that date based on
his calculations that in 1936, the year of his inspiration,
civilization was at a halfway point from the date when the Egyptian
calendar was established in 4241 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of preserving one's life and times for the future began
with the Egyptians. While the pyramids were designed as vessels to
the afterlife, they were also vessels to the future.
</P>
<P>
   The first modern time capsule was created in 1876 in
Philadelphia for the United States' centennial, said Will Jarvis, a
librarian at Washington State University who is working on a book
on time capsules.
</P>
<P>
   President Gerald Ford opened the so-called ``Century Safe'' in
1976 during the country's bicentennial. It contained a few
autographs and photos. Nothing particularly valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``time capsule'' was first coined by George Edward
Pendary, the publicity director for Westinghouse at the 1939 New
York World's Fair, Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``they're just all over the place,'' he said. ``This year's
new Cheerios are called Millennios. When you are done with the
cereal you're supposed to turn the box into a time capsule. Then
there's the Mars Candy Co. It has an M&AMP;M millennium time capsule
kit. Just about every museum catalog has a time capsule, and a lot
of kids' hobby catalogs have them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are even television specials about time capsules.
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel aired a special called the Times Capsule on
Monday night. Among other things, the special documented the
construction of a capsule made by the editors of The New York Times
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The paper invited 48 designers, architects and engineers to
suggest items to include in the capsule, which is to be installed
later this year at the American Museum of Natural History in New
York. Suggestions included the complete works of Dr. Seuss and the
diary of an American teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Rosenthal, the magazine's editor, said the capsule also
will contain many newspaper articles. Using a technology called
HD-Rosetta, the magazine plans to etch data onto a nickel disc
using a charged particle beam. The 2-inch disc can hold more than
90,000 pages of 8-by-11-inch text pages.

<P>
   What should you put in your time capsule?
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Korbel Champagne Cellars, which has no small
interest in New Year's Eve, asked consumers what single item should
be included in a capsule bound for the year 3000. Top vote-getters
included a laptop computer, audio and videotapes, CDs of popular
songs and CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies a problem. Such technologically dependent
products may not work in the future. The data will degrade _ some
of it surprisingly quickly. Even at room temperature, magnetic
videotapes have an expected shelf life of only 20 years. CDs are
expected to last only 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you put in?
</P>
<P>
   Photos are good. So are letters. Newsprint tends to break down.
So does rubber or thin plastic.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of container?
</P>
<P>
   Although you can buy specialty capsules on the Internet, people
often use whatever they can find around the house, Hudson said,
including Mason jars, Tupperware, pop bottles, plastic bags and
cookie tins. He's even heard of coffins being used for time
capsules.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would certainly preserve the artifacts,'' he said, ``But
it sort of takes the zest out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, you can use just about anything. As long as it's dry,
dark and durable.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson encourages everyone to make time capsules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think if somebody put their baseball cards in a time
capsule,'' he said. ``What a collection they could have! And just
think if your grandfather had done a time capsule for you, what a
gift that would be for future generations. It doesn't have to be
expensive. It's the thought that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't forget where you buried it.

IT'S ABOUT TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout the Kansas City area, people are looking for a way to
commemorate the coming of the new millennium. Like countless others
nationwide, many have chosen time capsules.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: It not only marks the occasion in the present but
also preserves it for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention it's just plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Ed Stewart of Paola, Kan., are planning to bury a time
capsule in their back yard on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They got the idea after finding all sorts of interesting things
squirreled away in the 95-year-old house they are restoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we took the trim off around the door, we found a 1903
datebook with carpenters measurements inside,'' Kelly Stewart said.
``We also found a small perfume bottle just inside the attic hatch
in my daughters room. It's neat. We just imagined that some girl
many years ago had a father who wouldn't allow her to have perfume.
And maybe she hid it there. We're just speculating, but it's fun.
And we found some old coins, and two 11/2-cent stamps and an old
medicine bottle. That sparked our interest in the objects that
people use in everyday life, and that there may be things that we
have today that some future generation might get a kick out of
seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   So they're putting together a small box of their own neat things
to leave behind for someone else to find.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to include pictures of their house, a list of owners
and pictures of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also thought about enclosing a Christmas card so they would
see the traditions of Christmas,'' Kelly said. ``I have a Paola
tourism brochure, a Miami County map. And we will put in some 1999
coins.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 they will seal their bounty in a Tupperware container
and place it in their back yard under a steppingstone. They haven't
determined how long to leave it there. But they don't intend to let
people forget about it, either. They plan to turn the steppingstone
into a dated plaque that indicates the time capsule buried beneath.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Yacht Club at Lake Lotawana also is planning to
make a time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are doing something that is rather poignant in a
way,'' member Sherry Cromwell-Lacy said.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule, to be buried for a quarter century, will contain a
professionally shot and produced documentary video called ``Hello
2025.'' The idea, Cromwell-Lacy said, is to ``send a message
through time'' to descendants of current members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular community is unique because it contains so
many second- and third-generation families,'' Cromwell-Lacy said.
``We have people here who brought the first water skis from Cypress
Gardens to the lake, and now they have grandchildren who are expert
skiers. And hopefully those grandchildren will have their own
children who can then hear their ancestors talk about lake living,
and those traditions can be passed on.''
</P>
<P>
   The capsule will be sealed in a moisture-proof container, buried
on clubhouse grounds and marked with a plaque.
</P>
<P>
   A time capsule is also the choice of Jerry Wolfskill, director
of the regional police academy at Johnson County Community College.
The capsule will serve double duty. In addition to marking the
millennium, it will aid in dedicating their new police academy
building on campus, set to open in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to put the capsule in the building's cornerstone and
have it opened in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep it on permanent record with the college,
in the archives,'' he said. ``Of course we are making an assumption
that the college will be here in 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Items being considered for the capsule include police training
films, photographs of people involved in the academy, a list of
current laws, predictions, letters to as-yet-unborn relatives, a
police baton, a share of Microsoft stock and a bank book containing
a small deposit. (Even a dollar with compound interest, Wolfskill
figures, would accrue to a significant amount over the next 100
years.)
</P>
<P>
   Future openers of the capsule would be instructed to give the
money to the college.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Martha Peterson. Unlike most time capsule
planters, the 69-year-old Peterson doesn't care if her capsule is
ever found.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she'd prefer it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Her family has owned the Osawatomie farm she lives on since
1914.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us kids were born and raised there,'' she said, with a
hint of nostalgia in her voice. ``Grandpa gave dad the farm in 1919
when he got married. I had a mother, father, two brothers and a
sister, and the only one left is me.''
</P>
<P>
   And now she'd like nothing more than to know that a little bit
of them will remain a part of the farm for all time.
</P>
<P>
   So she picked a container and began sifting through her life.
Then she wrote a story of everything that had happened on the farm
over the years. She included a picture album, chose articles about
ancestors and placed them in the capsule with stamps, coins, a
small porcelain Betty Boop figure and a Blue Jay Beanie Baby that
holds special significance for her. Then she added some glittery
confetti, complete with little hearts and angels, and planted it in
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want anybody to find it,'' she said. ``I just
wanted a little piece of all us there forever. Like my daughter
told me, `Mom, you just buried yourself a kind of eternal flame.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Making your own: Some ageless advice
</P>
<P>
   Making a time capsule? Here are some tips:
</P>
<P>
   - Choose a container that is tough, sealable and moisture-proof.
</P>
<P>
   - If you're serious about wanting items to last a long period of
time, invest in a capsule that lets you pump out the oxygen and
replace it with an inert (or non-reactive) gas, such as argon.
</P>
<P>
   - Include items that don't require any technology or equipment.
CDs and videotapes, for instance, may not be playable in the
future. How many of you have 8-track players or Beta VCRs, hmm?
</P>
<P>
   - Avoid plastics, especially when thin. They cannot be counted
on for long-term survival.
</P>
<P>
   - For long-term storage, choose black-and-white photos and
pencil over color pictures and ballpoint pen. Colors,
preservationists say, can fade or even disappear. Remember to write
a dated description on the back of each photo in pencil.
</P>
<P>
   - To keep the emulsion surfaces of your photos from sticking
together, sleeve the photos with archival-quality photo envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   - Newspapers are not only highly acidic and deteriorate quickly
over time but also can hasten the deterioration of other items. If
possible, photocopy any valuable articles you may want to keep onto
high-quality archival paper.
</P>
<P>
   - Remember to remove all staples and paper clips. They corrode
easily.
</P>
<P>
   - To help reduce moisture, include packs of moisture-absorbing
substances. These are often included in the packing materials for
various electronics equipment.
</P>
<P>
   - Document your time capsule on the outside with a permanent
marker. Tell the date it was made, who made it and give a ``do not
open until ... '' date.
</P>
<P>
   - Do not bury your capsule. Instead, keep it in a dark, dry
place, such as an attic, or in another place of honor that you will
remember. It has been estimated that for every 1,000 capsules
buried, only one is ever found. If you must bury your capsule, mark
it with a permanent plaque or sign that notes what it is, where it
is and when it was buried.
</P>

on assembling a time capsule. You can receive a packet of

HOWEVER YOU EXPLAIN IT, WE'RE SEEKING HONESTY IN OUR LEADERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'll never forget the 1996 presidential campaign, with poll
after poll declaring that voters didn't care about a candidate's
honesty or personal character _ what they wanted was a president
``who cares about people like you.''
</P>
<P>
   So the choice was a no-brainer. Here was Mr. Compassion, Bill
Clinton, a man who had the integrity of a rattlesnake but felt our
pain; and there was Bob Dole, a man whose word was his bond but
conjured up images of the crabby neighbor who was always screaming,
``Get off my lawn!''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cared about people like us. To prove it, he could cry on
cue. Dole wouldn't have cried if you'd poked him in the eye with a
stick.
</P>
<P>
   It was thoroughly baffling. Clinton had proved beyond a shadow
of doubt in the first four years of his presidency _ heck, the
first four days _ that he was pathologically dishonest. Not only
was he a compulsive liar, as anyone who was paying attention could
see, but he couldn't keep a promise for more than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon told one gigantic lie _ ``I am not a crook'' _ and
was driven from the presidency. Clinton seemed to lie every time he
opened his mouth for four years _ and won a second term without
breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? As the 2000 presidential campaign picks up
steam, the electorate has apparently changed its tune.
</P>
<P>
   According to a public-opinion poll commissioned by The
Associated Press and conducted by ICR of Media, Pa., the most
important characteristic that voters are looking for in a potential
president this time around is _ are you ready for this? _ honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honesty was mentioned ahead of compassion, leadership skills
and political philosophy,'' the AP reported. ``One-third of
Americans mentioned honesty as the `most important' quality they're
looking for in a presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP quoted a voter from Virginia: ``How can you tell your
children not to lie if the president is not telling the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   And about time. Remember all those polls that came out during
the sex-and-lies scandal that culminated with Clinton's impeachment
trial in the Senate? You know the polls I mean: the ones that said
hardly anyone cared if the president cheated on his wife, lied to
the country or robbed a Brink's truck _ as long as the economy was
strong and most Americans had jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, only the most avid Clinton-haters were grumbling
about how awful it was to have a notorious liar living in the White
House and commanding the world's greatest armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   What changed?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe all the years of presidential mendacity and all the
months of investigation and scandal just finally took their toll.
Maybe voters have decided that it's not such a good idea to entrust
the keys to the Oval Office to an individual who can't be trusted _
even if he does care about people like them.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe nothing has changed. Maybe the polls suggesting that
the American people didn't care about their president's character
and honesty were an anomaly _ a fleeting phenomenon fueled by
disgust with investigators, news organizations and politicians who
made a federal case out of Clinton's character flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that the ``we-don't-care'' attitude that seemed
so pervasive during the scandal wasn't all it was cracked up to be?
Could it be that what the American people really were saying was,
``We don't care this much''?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensible Americans were simply reacting to what they
viewed as overkill in the investigators' pursuit of the president _
and the media's coverage of the pursuit and related events.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the public didn't change its attitude virtually overnight
from not caring about honesty at all to caring about it more than
anything else. Surely the electorate can't be that confused and
indecisive.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. The AP poll is good news because it tells us that
voters have regained their senses _ if they ever lost them. And
because it sends a message to all the would-be presidents: Liars
need not apply.

WHERE'S HEAT? DEBATE NEVER IGNITES FIREWORKS  
 (THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE DEC. 7 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By XXXXXX  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If Monday evening's debate among all six Republican
presidential aspirants proved anything, it was this: Given a chance
to grill each other, none of these fellows ever met a softball
question served gently over the plate that he didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the season's first unscripted, unpredictable GOP
debate thanks to a format that allowed candidates to query each
other reporter-style, the event at the lovely Orpheum Theatre in
downtown Phoenix produced just occasional fireworks. And most of
that involved simply some low-caliber testiness between Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Note to Miss Manners: Is it OK for presidential candidates to
address each other by their first names?
</P>
<P>
   Blissfully genteel, each of the Republican Six seemed intent on
using the debate, televised nationally on CNN, to fine-tune his
image.
</P>
<P>
   George ``Dubya'' Bush, the acknowledged front-runner, wishes,
like the current, lip-biting officeholder, to be viewed as
``compassionate.'' But conservatively compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   While the Texas governor believes, like Clinton, in federal
support for education at home and the inclusion of China in the
World Trade Organization abroad, his notions on those subjects
``are not even close to Clinton's,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's edgiest moments came when Forbes _ who has devoted
almost his entire campaign focus to attacking Bush _ got to ask the
Texan a question. But a fairly interesting query about what Bush
might do to lower oil prices quickly devolved into snippiness over
whether to address each other by first names.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown candidate Sen. John McCain, who joined the event
electronically, adroitly worked the Forbes-Bush snit to his own
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a Bush question about faith-based ministries,
McCain said, ``I think you're on the right track, Governor . . . or
George . . . or Dubya . . . or whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   As is becoming tradition, McCain also managed a bit of
self-parody regarding his infamous temper, this time regarding the
mysterious Senate colleagues who reportedly have been accusing him
of tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his contention that a good teacher should never be
paid less than a bad senator, McCain said, ``I would never allege
that there are any bad senators. I win the Miss Congeniality Award
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also worked his image as a maverick-minded reformer. With
the generous aid of pro-life activist Gary Bauer, McCain repeatedly
identified his primary campaign weapon _ campaign finance reform _
as one of the most important issues of the entire campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And while still providing lustrous oratory, Alan Keyes seems to
be settling into a campaign of symbolism, marking his responses
repeatedly with references to slavery, serfdom and racism. Keyes,
the sole African-American among the six, has accused the press of
neglecting his campaign out of racism.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a debate that produced few surprises, and
left Bush and McCain untoppled as the front-runners. &QL;

SAINTS' BONES HOLY TO SOME, MACABRE TO OTHERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Therese of Liseux, known as the ``Little Flower,'' won over
many people deep in the heart of Texas last week.
</P>
<P>
   The bones of St. Therese, perhaps the most revered of modern-day
saints, reached Fort Worth-Dallas during a U.S. tour that began in
October in New York City. Thousands visited her relics in San
Antonio and Houston later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   I was among thousands who lined up to see the gold and wooden
box, called a reliquary, containing her bones. Some came in
wheelchairs. Many carried roses. A tradition holds that when St.
Therese heals or blesses someone, that person receives a rose, or
is aware of the scent of the flower.
</P>
<P>
   Why so much attention to this French Carmelite nun who died at
age 24 more than a century ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``She gives us hope,'' said Edith Raoult of Garland, a native of
France who was one of those braving a crowd of about 10,000 at the
Arlington Convention Center to view the relics and attend a Mass.
``She knew suffering. She understands us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Most Rev. Joseph P. Delaney, bishop of Fort Worth, was the
principal celebrant at the Mass. He was joined by other bishops.
Behind them was a larger-than-life picture of the gently smiling
blue-eyed saint.
</P>
<P>
   People do not regard St. Therese's remains as mere bones, said
the Most Rev. Patrick V. Ahern, associate bishop of New York, who
presented the homily. They feel they are drawing close to a real
saint and therefore are closer to God.
</P>
<P>
   Not a lot of precise Catholic teaching exists about a
Christian's obligation to honor relics, according to University of
Dallas faculty member Marcellino D'Abrosio.
</P>
<P>
   But honoring the bones of people of great faith has been a part
of the Christian practice since Roman times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition comes from the Old Testament idea that holy
people leave a certain spiritual power in the things they touch and
use, and also in their bones,'' D'Abrosio said.
</P>
<P>
   People gathered up the bones of Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna,
after he was burned at the stake by Romans in A.D. 155. The
86-year-old martyr's bones were put in a place of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``His bones were considered more precious than gold,'' D'Abrosio
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in the second century, the site of St. Peter's grave was
visited as a shrine. Later, Constantine built St. Peter's Basilica
over the apostle's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Not all see the importance of relics, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think that this is awfully medieval and
unsophisticated,'' he said. ``Some who feel that way are professors
and some are priests.''
</P>
<P>
   But D'Abrosio, a Catholic layman, contends it is foolish to look
askance at a practice that has blessed many people, including
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 20, I made a pilgrimage to Rome and had a very
profound experience that really changed my life when I visited the
tomb of Pope John XXIII,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, though, that many have misused relics,
regarding them in a superstitious way as good luck charms.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time St. Therese's bones have been in the
United States, and large crowds have assembled.
</P>
<P>
   People may be drawn to her because outwardly she seemed like one
of us. She could boast of no great deeds. She was relatively
unknown when she died of tuberculosis in 1897.
</P>
<P>
   But she left a spiritual legacy that has touched the world. She
was made patroness of France along with St. Joan of Arc.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern noted that when she died, she told those around her, ``I
am not dying. I am entering into life. My mission is about to
begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Her autobiography, ``Story of a Soul,'' first published in 1898,
still is inspiring many in their search for true spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   It contains teachings many of us can apply in this frenzied
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters in life,'' she wrote, ``is not great deeds, but
great love.''

MOONLIGHT AND LOVING HEARTS CONQUER FEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing as black as a Mississippi night, nothing as
lonesome or frightful.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this explains how so much evil has been played out there.
The nights always seem to match the terrifying deeds.
</P>
<P>
   But I am also reminded of sweeter moments, of dusty gravel
roads, a white wood-frame church with its squeaky piano always in
need of tuning, and riding with my sisters in the back seat of my
uncle's car, smelling of Listerine he kept handy for his chronic
bad breath.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't thought much about those nights of my childhood or the
wonderful splashes of moonlight giving life to the ghosts
inhabiting the big, towering oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, of course, I realized the ghosts were not real. But
I was just a little girl then, like Noni, frightened by my own
imaginings.
</P>
<P>
   I remember this as I read ``Tambourine Moon'' to my daughter
Asha. This is where we meet Noni and Grandaddy walking along dark
city streets.
</P>
<P>
   The shadows of parked cars are as huge as giants to her, and the
houses all have mean expressions on their faces, but they conjure
memories from another time for Grandaddy.
</P>
<P>
   Noni wants only to get home. He pauses instead and stares at the
moon, that thing, Grandaddy tells her, that ``works the night shift
so that the sun can get some rest.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Joy Jones' ``Tambourine Moon.'' The tale bounces back
and forth from Noni and Grandaddy in the city, to a time when
Grandaddy was just a boy. And scared of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Based loosely on her father's recollections of his roots in
Selma, Ala., and nearby King's Bend, Jones celebrates love, family
and storytelling in one fell swoop, saving us from the dark just
like the moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   But if her story is lost on you _ and I suspect this won't be
the case _ brilliant splashes of color by Texas illustrator Terry
Widener hold you spellbound till the very end.
</P>
<P>
   You will believe Grandaddy, believe how Grandma Ismay and her
tambourine calmed his fears one night and guided him home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of me shaking the tambourine, the tambourine was
shaking me,'' he says. ``Then all of a sudden, that tambourine
jumped right out of my hand! It shot itself up higher, higher,
higher till it settled in the sky. That big yellow tambourine, just
hung there, glowing and pouring light all over the night like
butter running down the sides of a hot biscuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, he and Noni have walked the distance home,
and Asha and I are left with the warm fuzzy feeling that you get
from knowing the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nice story, huh, Mommy?'' Asha asks.
</P>
<P>
   I tell her ``yes.'' She lingers, thumbing through the colorful
pages over and over again as if to soak up their words and their
images.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, she kisses me and leaves for her bed. I am left
with memories of Mississippi nights, dark gravel back roads and
trees with terrifying expressions.
</P>
<P>
   I was Noni, needing to get home, but finding comfort in
Grandaddy's memory of the Alabama moon. But I was Grandaddy, too,
discovering, in a nighttime moment of dread, Grandma Ismay and the
magic of her yellow tambourine.
</P>
<P>
   That's how my nights always turned out. One moment I was shaking
with fear and the next jumping for joy.
</P>
<P>
   And so it occurred to me while reading ``Tambourine Moon'' that
that's how it is in real life, too. In our darkest hour, God always
shines some light, even moonlight, that thing which ``works the
night shift so that the sun can get some rest.''

NEW MAZDA MPV COULD BE FAMILY'S MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mazda, the Japanese automaker mostly owned and solidly
controlled by Ford Motor Co., has a credible new entry in the
minivan market with the completely redesigned 2000 MPV.
</P>
<P>
   This company was one of the first Japanese automakers to roll
out a good minivan with the original MPV in 1989. It was among the
best-selling import vans for years. But because it had not has
significant changes in style or interior setup since introduction,
sales steadily declined the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, the MPV joins the rest of the pack with dual sliding
doors, and it has a feature not found on the competitors: real
windows that actually roll down into those sliding doors.
Unfortunately, Mazda is not offering automatic electric sliding
doors like some of the competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The new MPV is a bit larger than its predecessor, but smaller
than most of the competition. It's about on par with the short
version of the Plymouth Voyager/Dodge Caravan.
</P>
<P>
   It's narrower than the competition, too, a necessity for Mazda
in its home market. Japanese city streets are rather narrow, and
Japanese drivers prefer cars that are easy to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the smaller size _ Mazda calls it ``smart sized'' _
will appeal to many U.S. buyers, especially people who want a
vehicle that is easy to park and fits into the family garage.
</P>
<P>
   Interior space really doesn't suffer. The van is still roomy and
comfortable for seven people.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior styling and interior layout are similar to those of
the new Honda Odyssey. One big plus for the Mazda is the price: You
can buy a base DX model equipped with air-conditioning and other
popular amenities for $19,995 (plus $480 transportation). That
price allows the MPV to compete against the bargain-priced
entry-level minivans from DaimlerChrysler. No other imports have a
base price this low.
</P>
<P>
   A midlevel LX model, which adds power windows and door locks and
heated power mirrors, lists for $22,050 (plus transportation). This
is close to the entry-level price for most of the Japanese
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Load up the MPV with all the best amenities, including leather
seats and a premium audio system, and you get the ES model with a
reasonable list price of $25,550. A comparable competitor's model
would would run a few thousand dollars higher.
</P>
<P>
   Only one engine is offered in the MPV. It's an all-aluminum,
24-valve, 2.5-liter V-6 provided by Ford. It's rated at 170
horsepower (160 in California) and 165 foot-pounds of torque. This
is the smallest six-cylinder engine offered in a minivan, but don't
immediately dismiss it as too small. The MPV is several hunded
pounds lighter than competing vans, so the little V-6 provides more
than adequate power for most uses. The vehicle does strain a bit
climbing hills fully loaded, but that's true of some other popular
minivans and sport-utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is comfortable if not cushy. The suspension is a bit
stiffer than that of a luxury passenger car. The payback is that
the vehicle handles better. It's no sports car, but it handles much
better than the average van.
</P>
<P>
   The four-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly and
effortlessly, and the brakes are very efficient, thanks partly to
the relatively light weight. Front discs and rear drums are
standard. Antilock braking is optional on base models but was
included on our test vehicle, the top-of-the-line ES.
</P>
<P>
   There is seating for seven, with two buckets up front, Mazda's
patented ``side by slide'' dual middle-row captain's chairs, and a
tumble-under third-row bench seat that folds flat into the floor
when you need to get it out of the way. The middle seats can slide
together to make a two-person bench, or push to the two outboard
positions to make separate seats. Each can quickly be removed, and
at 37 pounds each, they're easy to carry.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample cargo space behind the third seat. A deep well
holds groceries in place, even when they are packed into plastic
bags. This is in marked contrast with some of the competition.
Total cargo space with all the seats in place is a highly
respectable 17.2 cubic feet. That expands to 54.6 cubic feet with
the third seat folded into the floor.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost too many cup holders to count, which is good
for a minivan loaded with the neighborhood soccer team. And
speaking of that, the third seat can be set up backward so you can
sit in it and look out the rear hatch to watch the team play; it
makes for a great tailgate party.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-volt power outlet is provided at the rear for camping
accessories and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Driver and passenger get front air bags; side air bags for the
front seats are optional.
</P>
<P>
   The base stereo includes AM/FM/compact disc, but an optional
in-dash six-disc CD changer ($600) is offered.
</P>
<P>
   Our test model's list price, with options, was $27,330 including
transportation. That price included the in-dash CD changer and a
power moon roof ($700). And it's well below some of the
best-equipped competitors.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 18 miles per gallon in the city and
23 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 18.5 gallons of gasoline, and
unleaded regular is recommended.

THE WONDERFUL WARTS OF DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's been a long time since we've read about
``anarchists'' in the streets of a U.S. city. And ``radicals.'' And
``anti-capitalists.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next? ``Subversives?'' ``Outside agitators?''
``Radic-libs?'' ``America - Love It or Leave It?''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, 1999. Tear gas. Night sticks. Broken plate glass.
Emergency curfews. Mass arrests. The National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   As the Buffalo Springfield sang 32 years ago: ``There's
something happening here; what it is ain't exactly clear.''
</P>
<P>
   But what it ain't is clear, even though the dramatic images you
saw on your television screen and newspaper front page _ and the
understandable kvetching from Seattle residents _ might indicate
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what happened in Seattle last week, as World Trade
Organization delegates met and tens of thousands of people
protested their meeting, was not about vandalism, looting or
calculated violence. It was not about anybody, including Seattle's
mayor or its police force, making the city look bad.
</P>
<P>
   In this increasingly polarized time of ours, it would be helpful
to keep those facts in mind.
</P>
<P>
   What really happened in Seattle was a testimony to this flawed
but magnificent democracy of ours.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50,000 people made their way by plane, boat, car and foot
to northwestern Washington to tell the representatives of 135
nations that they value some things more than the fat, juicy fruits
of a booming economy. And all but a tiny percentage of those people
did their telling in nondestructive ways, exercising the same
methods of civil disobedience that have been used by protesters
from Selma, Ala., to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that tiny percentage, a mayor and a police force who
had hoped their laid-back city could best handle protests by
remaining laid-back did what a lot of municipal officials do when
surprise violence erupts: They panicked and overreacted. Peaceful,
even retreating demonstrators were tear-gassed or shot in the back
with rubber bullets; all protesters lost their right to peacefully
assemble anywhere near the WTO meeting headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   That overreaction was ugly, but it doesn't make Seattle Mayor
Paul Schell, his police chief or the city's cops Nazis _ or as one
Seattlite put it, ``wimps'' _ anymore than the tiny percentage of
marauders makes the majority of protesters looters and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing you might want to keep in mind: With everything
that did occur in Seattle, not a protester or cop was killed or
seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some folks who didn't deserve it got hurt. Yes, some small
businesses that didn't deserve it lost money. Yes, some property
got damaged. Things like that can happen when 50,000 people are
allowed to descend upon a small area for a week of public protests.
</P>
<P>
   But the day we no longer risk such loss to allow such protest is
the day we kiss this flawed but magnificent democracy goodbye.

GAZING INTO SAN FRANCISCO'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The year is 2003, and there is an election
happening in San Francisco to determine who will be the second
mayor of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing is that we won't hear anything about anyone
leading San Francisco into the new millennium. We will already be
there, and we will still be complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Brown could be leaving office and returning to his law
practice, running for the Senate or being appointed as head of the
World Trade Organization - after all, like a Sta-Prest suit he
would sooner die than wear, he travels well.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ammiano could be at the end of his first term, challenged by
Clint Reilly and Frank Jordan on the right and a transgender
union-rep bicycle messenger with a grass-roots coalition of people
of piercing on the left.
</P>
<P>
   This is San Francisco. There's someone to the left of anyone.
</P>
<P>
   What will San Francisco look like after four years of Ammiano or
a full eight years of Brown?
</P>
<P>
   It's 2003, and the once and future King Willie has ruled for
eight years. Let's look into the court wizard's crystal ball.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's traffic and parking plan finally reached completion. As
he promised during the 1999 run-off race, he has turned the
Candlestick lots _ where the 49ers stadium and mall still isn't _
into commuter parking and mud baths.
</P>
<P>
   The financial and high-tech district now sprawls in a highrise
strip to Potrero Hill. Rush hour now starts at 4 a.m. and ends at 9
p.m. The Bay Bridge still hasn't been rebuilt across the conference
center, resort and shelters for homeless mayoral aides on Treasure
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Every neighborhood now has a convenient Home Depot, brought to
you by Jack Davis, lobbyist, political consultant and theme party
planner.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the affordable housing give-back demanded by Brown,
each of these chain stores includes a Homeless Depot, specializing
in cardboard of all types, ranging from underpass-home-construction
grade to will-write-on-for-food grade.
</P>
<P>
   Rents in San Francisco start at $800 per month for a good spot
in the privatized homeless camp next to the used car lots in the
Presidio. Young couples can still find the occasional
$5,000-a-month loftette in the upscale Mission District.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall looks better than ever with its new gilt. The Board of
Supervisors still follows orders with no guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The Municipal Railway still doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   It's 2003, and Ammiano has presided over his first four-year
plan. Let's check with his Ministry of Information to see if
production quotas were achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Ammiano tax plan has been worked out in compromise form.
Those making more than $100,000 a year can pay a 10 percent fee for
an exploiter's license or agree to house two homeless people per
thousand square feet of living space.
</P>
<P>
   The living wage has been adjusted for inflation up to $22 an
hour, still not quite enough to live on, even in an Ammianoville
workers commune.
</P>
<P>
   It took four years for young workers to learn how to Rollerblade
in the same lanes as bicyclists in the Old Folks on Spokes program,
but Ammiano's transportation plan finally went into operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Ammiano commuter surcharges on the bridges ($1 per occupant
or $3 if they're in German cars or sport utility vehicles) have
proven popular with San Franciscans. Delays caused by the
construction of border crossings into San Mateo County have not.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's neighborhood car-share program has had its problems
because of high demand for cars to get out of San Francisco, the
world's first meat-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has also been declared a Starbucks-free zone, a
developer-free zone, a smoke-free zone and a city of refuge for the
oppressed politically correct of America.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall's party facilities are now vegetarian soup kitchens
and homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Muni still doesn't work, but Ammiano still rides it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in 1999 that's the way the two candidates for mayor were
seen by their opponents, as well as by many undecided voters who
faced a tough decision in that run-off election of Dec. 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we know what really happened.
</P>
<P>
   In 2003, highrises and fancy restaurants ring the waterfront,
and the Bay Bridge is the closest parking lot - at rush hour or any
time. Rents finally stabilized at $2,500 for studios when the
Internet and the Siliconomy, as it is now known, went bust in the
Great Y2K Recession.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic tickets went up to $500 for triple parkers impeding the
flow of meter persons' scooters, the only traffic that's flowing.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers stadium-mall still doesn't exist, but then neither do
the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   In 2003, everyone hates the mayor. But City Hall still looks
good, whoever runs it until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Muni still doesn't work.
</P>

THE HOMESLESS DESERVE SHELTER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Homelessness is much with us this season every
year as the nights turn bitter cold, compelling society to sort out
the rights and wrongs of letting people sleep outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about the homeless this year is sharpened because of
its emergence as an issue in the pre-campaign stage of New York's
race for U.S. Senate. That's a guarantee that the problem will not
as quickly fade from the public stage as it would have if New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had
not chosen to argue about it.
</P>
<P>
   During the Great Depression, the homeless were mostly men unable
to find work at a time when unemployment affected probably a
quarter of the working population. Some of them hit the rails,
vagabonding from one place to another, seeking a job, sleeping in
shantytowns and Hoovervilles. It was a time when the president,
Franklin Roosevelt, saw ``one-third of a nation ill-housed,
ill-clad, ill-nourished.''
</P>
<P>
   Today we're not talking about a third of our people; it is a
tiny, but intractable, fraction. These people too often are shunted
aside for being different, a judgment impaired by ethical myopia.
</P>
<P>
   Surely today's homeless people are also jobless, but not because
there are not enough jobs to be had. It is our special blessing
that there are more jobs available today than there are people to
do them. Many today are both homeless and out of work because they
suffer from mental illness or are paralyzingly addicted to drugs or
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   This hard-core cadre of homelessness makes the problem so
injurious, elusive of both quick or even long-range fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Those homeless people not plagued mentally or by addiction can
be more easily assisted in a straightforward way. That requires a
commitment to spend the money to house them temporarily while they
are guided and trained to get work, helped by the governmental
support systems designed to see them through tough times. Too
often, those people who have had the good fortune never even to
have come close to the affliction of homelessness are quick to
grumble about taxes going to support what they consider
free-loaders feeding on the body politic.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these grumblers are so hard-hearted as not to recognize
society's moral responsibility, they ought to be shrewd enough to
recognize their own self-interest in providing such aid.
Homelessness undermines the stability of society, and, in time, the
comfortable existences of everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But that leaves unattended and unaided that major sector of
today's homeless who are mentally ill. Mental institutions, which
once upon a time housed these people, were shuttered for several
reasons. Many of them were bedlams, so atrocious in their treatment
of their patients that they could not be permitted to continue to
operate. They also were costly.
</P>
<P>
   So when science discovered drugs that stabilized the mentally
ill, permitting them to function more or less successfully in the
larger world, there was a belief that a magic bullet cure had been
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria was not long-lived. It became clear that
unsupervised the mentally ill often elected not to take the drugs
they needed. And the smaller community centers that were supposed
to replace the large institutions, in which mentally ill people
would receive some supervision, were not put in place. They were
both too costly and too inconvenient to be accepted in residential
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   For that callousness we have been paying a large and disturbing
price. Incidents of sudden, irrational violence unleashed against
innocent passersby occur year after year.
</P>
<P>
   We shove the homeless here and we shove them there, anywhere to
get them out of sight. But both the stringency of the law and the
stinginess of the public commitment have made dealing with the
hard-core ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   What clearly is required is the re-establishment of facilities
for the custodial care of the mentally ill as well as treatment
centers for drug and alcohol addicts, to which sufferers of these
maladies could be legally committed.
</P>
<P>
   Just because earlier institutions failed in their
responsibilities does not mean that better ones could not be set
up. Having the bad example of the past in mind, they should provide
the necessary medical care and personal supervision that was
lacking in the previous ones. The new hospitals would also require
hard-nosed outside oversight to make certain to avoid a repetition
of previous mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   This will take even greater resources, but it is the only
available solution. Society has the unavoidable obligation to take
care of those who are incapable of caring for themselves.
</P>
<P>

AUTHOR EXAMINES THE ROOTS OF HISPANIC HERBAL REMEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANIEL J. VARGAS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ When Joie Davidow moved from New Jersey to Los
Angeles, she knew very little about Mexican-American herbal
remedies. Once she settled in a mostly Hispanic neighborhood and
got to know her neighbors, they offered her soothing teas when she
wasn't feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drank them and they worked,'' said Davidow, 52, the author
of a new book on herbal treatments. ``I would see the herbs in
supermarkets. I wanted to learn more about this tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Her curiosity sent her on a two-year adventure of research and
interviews that resulted in her book, ``Infusions of Healing: A
Treasury of Mexican-American Herbal Remedies'' (Fireside Books, 340
pages, $14.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like unlocking a dark closet and seeing it was filled
with treasure,'' Davidow said of her research.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, she thought it was going to be a simple
project because she already knew a lot about herbs. It turned out
to be a gigantic undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Davidow traveled the Southwest and talked to curanderas
(healers) and yerberas (herbalists), abuelas (grandmothers) and
young women. She also scoured records on the Internet from Mexican
universities on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned what was being practiced in the Mexican-American
neighborhoods _ they were legacies from Aztec medicine,'' she said
of the indigenous Indian civilization of Mexico. ``It was an
integral part of their religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidow said the Aztecs had detailed botanical records and
cultivated botanical gardens. When the Spanish conquered the
Aztecs, the practice was outlawed because some of the herbal
concoctions had ties with their religious beliefs and practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice went underground and became a folk tradition
being passed from generation to generation,'' she said in a recent
interview. ``I wanted to make sure I talked about the Aztec's
contributions to medicine. If you don't, it's out of context and
missing the point.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Infusions of Healing,'' Davidow describes 250 herbs and
plants from A to Z to help ease everyday ailments such as
indigestion, congestion, diarrhea, migraines and arthritis. She
includes English, Spanish and botanical names with notes on their
origin and primary uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to choose the ones that are easy to find, commonly
used and ones that I could talk about their known medicinal
properties,'' Davidow said, adding that two of the more popular
herbs are spearmint (yerba buena) and chamomile.
</P>
<P>
   Next, readers are told how to prepare the herbs from warm teas
(infusions) and compresses to soothing liniments. Teas are the most
popular.
</P>
<P>
   The author does warn that people should be aware of possible
allergic reactions to herbs. And, she said, people should always
tell their doctor what herbs they are taking because of potential
interactions with prescription and/or over-the-counter medication.
</P>
<P>
   Davidow said there is a rebirth of herbal remedies in part
because of the burgeoning natural supplement industry, which has
sales of $12 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? An estimated 25 percent of all modern
pharmaceutical drugs are derived from herbs, including aspirin,
which comes from white willow bark.
</P>
<P>
   The author is such an herbal remedy fan that she has a '`great
big collection'' of herbs in her kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grow my own herbs in my garden, and I dry them out myself,''
Davidow said.

 WHAT'S A TREND? WHAT'S A FAD?
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE RINZLER BUCKINGHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I first start talking about a trend, people typically have
one of two responses. Either they tell me they've already seen it,
and therefore it can't be that ``trendy,'' or they say they've
never even heard of it, so they can't believe it could become
popular.
</P>
<P>
   But trends are more than just what colors the latest fashions
will come in or which video MTV can't play enough. Trends are about
changes in the way we think, act and live.
</P>
<P>
   Trends show us the subtle ways in which society is changing and
the direction in which it is heading. We did not wake up one day to
a nation that puts Jerry Springer on top of the TV ratings. Nor did
women earn the right to vote simply because men decided it seemed
fair. Trends, both large and small, helped achieve both of these
ends.
</P>
<P>
   So where do you find trends? They come from music, politics,
travel, the Internet. They are in every ad you see and every
magazine you pick up. They evolve everywhere. And they can come
from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can spot them, however, it's important to know the
difference between a fad and a trend.
</P>
<P>
   When companies go hunting for ``the next big thing,'' too often
they invest energy and resources in products or people who fade out
before they can deliver. Fads are like crushes. They burn fast and
hot but die quickly and often leave a bitter taste. They don't
survive because they are not grounded in anything real. Bell
bottoms, Green Day and Jennifer Aniston's haircut are all fads that
came and went quickly (albeit some not quickly enough). They were
not rooted in anything with foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Trends, on the other hand, are most important when they emerge
from a behavioral shift or psychological belief that gives them
reasons for existing. There are two types of trends: macro and
micro.
</P>
<P>
   Macro trends are about the ``big'' issues: our definitions of
happiness, success, fulfillment. These come from the way people
think, and they develop over a longer period of time. They emerge
when people feel a dissatisfaction with the status quo _ in their
own lives and in society.
</P>
<P>
   Micro trends emerge from macro trends. They are more tangible
offspring of what people are feeling. They manifest themselves
through fashion, music, sports, activities. Micro trends reveal to
us that a macro trend exists, showing us that people are ready for
something new.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a current macro trend is the general
dissatisfaction with the work world. As a general rule, young
people no longer believe that they will join a company and leave 30
year later with a gold watch and a cushy pension plan. Corporate
downsizing, mergers, takeovers and massive layoffs have all shown
that the career pact as previous generations knew it no longer
holds true. In addition, people are questioning whether they even
want their boss's boss's job or whether 14-hour workdays are worth
the supposed end benefits.
</P>
<P>
   People are questioning the work code, not the work ethic. This
general dissatisfaction is a macro trend.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that doesn't mean that corporate America will shut down as
people leave in droves to pursue more ``meaningful'' livelihoods.
But a micro trend that has emerged is the shift toward casual work
clothes. Workers no longer subscribe to the idea that wearing a
suit means you're doing a good job. In fact, many have begun to
believe that you can do a better job if you're more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has happened slowly, moving from avant-garde
companies in the fields of advertising and design to more
mainstream offices. Today, ``Casual Fridays'' are commonplace.
Don't confuse this with a fad. Khakis may be the ``hot'' pant this
year, and Cargos may replace them next year, but ``casual'' will
stay for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Other micro trends emerging from this ``dissatisfaction''
include the rise of entrepreneurism, an increase in flex time and
an acceptance of multiple midlife career changes.
</P>
<P>
   What's on the horizon? Expect to see more women giving up their
jobs to stay home and take care of children. Anticipate a more
flexible workday, with employees choosing their own hours. We may
even see a four-day office week with all employees working from
home on Fridays. (Now wouldn't that be nice!)
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen overnight. Trends don't. But if you watch
emerging trends, you'll have a better idea of where we may be going
and what may be changing in your life in the not-too-distant
future.

 &HT;    Seal up cracks and keep winter chill at bay

   ATLANTA _ It's never too late to insulate doors and windows to
prevent cold air from seeping through.
</P>
<P>
   Although older homes are more likely to need insulating, newer
ones aren't guaranteed to be properly sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Nichols, a store associate at Home Depot in Atlanta, says
one way to determine if your door needs weatherproofing is to look
for gaps of light around doors and windows.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols recommends using high-density weatherstripping for
doors, because it is more durable. He recommends low-density
weatherstripping for use around windows, because it is more
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: Measure the top of the door and the door jamb (where
hinges are located) to determine how much weatherstripping to
purchase. Remove worn weatherstripping. Fit insulation into door
jamb; work from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Cut insulation at bottom where door jamb ends. Make sure
weatherstripping is even with the bottom of the door.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Remove adhesive tape, starting from top. Repeat the
process on top of door.

 &HT;    Quick fixes for sprucing up your home for the holidays
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 9.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, you swore you would repaint that dining room. In
April, you promised that your tax refund would go for carpeting. In
September, you vowed to replace that drought-scorched landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? It's December, and dozens of guests are headed your
way for that office party you foolishly volunteered to host or that
family dinner you insisted it was your turn to prepare. Suddenly,
you recall all those projects you wanted to tackle before another
friend or relative set foot in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes! Too late.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have a lot of people coming in to do the quick
fixes before the holidays,'' said Cris Lasco, manager of the new
Expo Design Center in Alpharetta, a one-stop decorating outlet.
</P>
<P>
   But with a mere 16 days left until Christmas, what's doable _
short of Martha Stewart, B. Smith and Bob Vila riding in on white
horses to rescue your home from the decorating doldrums?
</P>
<P>
   Lots, if you ask the folks who perform such wonders for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, if your domestic prowess extends only to changing light
bulbs and fluffing pillows, you may find it tough to hire a
carpenter, decorator or electrician in time for the holidays. But
with two weekends to go, even the inexperienced can still repaint a
room, hang wallpaper or replace the kitchen cabinets' hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Often, buying a few accessories or simply updating what you have
_ a new shade for that lamp, finer frames for those pictures _ can
work wonders, said Tracy Hughes, who leads Expo's designer team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has family coming in, and they want to show off a
little,'' she said. ``The best thing they can do in the time they
have left is to think about focal points.''
</P>
<P>
   The front door is the first thing visitors see, so spruce up
your entrance. Give the door a fresh coat of paint, preferably in a
different color. Put down a new doormat and haul in a pair of
planters with boxwoods or other lush evergreens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Update your address numbers and dress up a wooden door with a
new kickplate,'' said Raphael Williams of Restoration Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, hang, or lean, an oversize mirror over the mantel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without going to the trouble of painting walls, you can add a
real splash of color with new pillows or window treatments,''
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry about finding a seamstress on such short notice.
Instead, take the no-sew route by hanging decorative brackets over
a window and draping a bold fabric over them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a fresh look doesn't have to cost a dime. Simply
rearrange what you have.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite trick of designers on a tight decorating budget is to
empty a room of all its accessories, place them on the kitchen
table and put them back in the room one by one, editing the duds
from the keepers. It's an enlightening exercise that can save you
trips to the store.
</P>
<P>
   But rest assured, their staffs will be armed with ideas just the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get into December,'' said Leslie McLenon, manager of
Pottery Barn, ``we call it fun desperation.''

BLACKLISTEE LOOKS BACK IN WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HOLLYWOOD EXILE 
Or How I Learned to Love the Blacklist 
By Bernard Gordon 
University of Texas Press, 303 pp., illustrated, $34.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernard Gordon hasn't really stopped worrying or started loving
the blacklist, any more than we've really stopped worrying and
learned to love the bomb. But the blacklisted screenwriter sets up
that very smart subtext with the Kubrickian subtitle to clue us in
that this memoir is a recollection leavened by age, history, and a
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood Exile, or How I Learned to Love the Blacklist''
isn't just about the blacklist, Hollywood's menu of alleged
Communists and communist sympathizers considered unemployable
because of their political affiliation. It's about the mad, mad,
mad, mad world of moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had joined the Communist Party at 22, when he was just
getting his start in Hollywood. Over the next 30 years, he would
write or produce more than 20 films. But not before learning to
live with the blacklist, a tale he tells here. While he loathed the
dark days of the anti-communist witch hunt _ and has a venomous
hatred for the poison spewed by the House Committee on Un-American
Activities and by Senator Joseph McCarthy's vilifying speeches _ he
also understands that there are plenty of documents and testimonies
to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who saw communism as a way to fight against big business
and the forces that led to the Great Depression, wasn't
anti-American. ``Joining the party was certainly not a path to
success, either financial or professional,'' writes Gordon. ``Right
or wrong, people were there because they were outraged about the
existing woes and evils of the world and wanted to do something to
correct them. The meetings were painfully boring, but this was the
price we had to pay for saving the world.''
</P>
<P>
   While never losing sight of the injustices of the era, Gordon's
story doesn't end with the blacklist. Thank goodness, because the
most entertaining and revealing portions of the book involve his
work with producers Philip Yordan and Samuel Bronston in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   As his fellow blacklistee, director Abraham Polonsky, points
out: ``Survivors took refuge in small islands of protests and work
at home and abroad. One was in Spain, and there Bernard Gordon
continued his screenwriting career while maintaining the integrity
of his morality and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Polonsky might have added, maintaining his sense of humor,
business savvy, and observational acuity.
</P>
<P>
   He tells some great stories about Kirk Douglas, whom Gordon
tried to interest in a role in a script called ``The Afrikan
General.'' Richard Harris was in line for one key role and Gordon
wanted Douglas for the other. Gordon was so excited about Douglas's
interest, he flew to Tel Aviv, where the star was finishing up his
portrayal of Israeli Colonel David Marcus in ``Cast a Giant
Shadow'' (1966). Douglas turned down the role with arrogant aplomb.
Gordon takes the opportunity to set the record straight on
Douglas's claim that he was the first one to give a blacklisted
screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo, full credit for his work on a film _
it was ``Spartacus'' (1960). According to Gordon, when Trumbo urged
Douglas to give him screen credit, the star-producer hemmed and
hawed, explaining that ``he would have to deal with Universal on
that question and could not promise anything. Only after Otto
Preminger, producer and director of `Exodus,' announced publicly
that Trumbo would receive credit for `Exodus' did Douglas come
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is also refreshingly frank when it comes to his own work.
Producer Yordan wanted a movie about the Boxer Rebellion, a movie
that eventually starred Charlton Heston and was released as ``55
Days at Peking'' (1963). ``We had no story, no plot ideas, no
characters, and only the sketchiest notion of what the Boxer
Rebellion had been about.'' And this coming from a communist?
</P>
<P>
   One of the great ironies of Gordon's work in Spain is that it
was made economically feasible by Generalissimo Francisco Franco,
Spain's fascist dictator. Franco was so enamored with the film
industry, and so eager to generate business, that he loaned his
soldiers and military equipment to dozens of productions, including
``The Battle of the Bulge,'' a Gordon film.
</P>
<P>
   The financial machinations, as producers offered things with one
hand while taking them away with the other, also make for
entertaining, revealing reading. The details of complicated
co-productions in different countries, with a variety of
currencies, sound as if they had all the makings of a Marx Brothers
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who now lives and writes in Los Angeles, hasn't lost the
social rage that brought him to the Communist Party in the first
place. Of America he concludes that ``you can't turn it into a
grand new mansion, but maybe you can make it habitable by fixing
the leaky roof and plumbing, and improving the heating, and making
it a place with living space for all, regardless of race, color,
creed. But keep hammering away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon hasn't really stopped worrying. And that's what makes his
memoir such a quietly remarkable addition to film literature.

SCANNO: DIZZYING DELIGHT AT 3,500 FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCANNO, Italy _ The village is a cliffhanger, all right, long in
the tooth and stuck against a molar in the snow belt of Abruzzo.
Scanno poses an adventure in walking tilting, cobbled streets,
wondering if you'll get out of town the fastest way _ falling head
over heels into the lovely Sagittario River valley 3,500 feet
below.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe that's a slight exaggeration. Gravity hasn't claimed
anybody lately, says Gabriela DiMasso, innkeeper at her modest yet
immaculate Albergo Centrale.
</P>
<P>
   But, like so many towns in these mountains, the central
Apennines, Scanno seems to be clinging dangerously by its
collective thumbs. However, the packed stacks of graying stone and
tile _ a huddle of homes, churches, small palaces, and shops _ have
hung and clung together like a crowd of fall-proof goats at least
since the Middle Ages. Signora DiMasso sees no reason why they
shouldn't stick it out together for another millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The women of the community also hang on _ onto a sartorial style
that goes back centuries with Asia Minor origins. Shod in black
slippers, garbed in long black dresses and aprons, topped by black
turbanesque head wrappings, they might be showing off a folk
costume for a local pageant. You feel as though you've stumbled
into such a performance, or possibly even tumbled back into another
age. However, it's not a costume worn as an amusement for tourists
in a village that time forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just part of our culture. Not changing much,'' says
Signora DiMasso, who doesn't favor the fashion herself, and isn't
dressed as somberly as the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she answers a question, ``it isn't limited to widows or
women in mourning. Just a custom. Tradition. We have television and
roads, modern ski lifts now, but maybe people who lived by
themselves in the mountains for so long are slower to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nazarreno Ricci, the ebullient proprietor of Serenissima, a
trattoria to salivate for in Rome (a couple of blocks from the
Cavalieri Hilton), frequently has urged us to look into Abruzzo,
his native turf. Of course, every Italian you meet boosts the
grounds where he stomps, or did stomp as a youth _ and is usually
justified.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Publius Ovidius Naso (the poet Ovid)
enthusiastically applauded his own birthplace a few years before
the birth of Christ: ``Sulmo mihi patria est!'' (``Sulmona is my
fatherland!'') Eventually the initials, SMPE, of the famous local
boy's tribute were incorporated in his hometown's emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast about 100 miles from Rome, and on the way to Scanno,
Sulmona is a pleasingly unhurried valley city of 25,000, embraced
by remaining sections of its medieval wall and some of the gates.
</P>
<P>
   It nurtured a couple of yet highly regarded romantic items.
First, arriving in 43 BC, was Ovid, whose ``Art of Love'' and other
amusing poetry devoted to commingling of the sexes, is still read.
Later came a product, the confection called ``confetti'':
sugar-covered almonds that are considered good luck and appear on
wedding tables as favors.
</P>
<P>
   Inspecting several confetterias and buying up a variety of them
in the shapes and colors of flowers, my friend Aurelio said,
``These local candy-makers are artists. They've gone well beyond
the originals, the sugar-coated almonds in pastels that we call
Jordan almonds in the US. Don't you remember seeing them as favors
at Italian weddings at home?''
</P>
<P>
   Very good weddings since I remember nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Ovid, who used to make fun of marriage. His wit got him
into big trouble. It is unknown whom he offended or why, but Ovid,
a star in Rome among the crowd of Emperor Augustus, was run out of
town by imperial decree. Augustus exiled him to the chilling,
barbaric wilds of what is now Romania where, despite pleas for
clemency, he spent the rest of his days, nine years, forlorn and
lonely _ but still writing.
</P>
<P>
   How did he live? David Maloof, the Australian writer, conjures
it up in a fine novel, ``An Imagined Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovid's stuff has lasted, and a few of his lines may have
influenced people such as Bill Clinton: ``You who seek an end of
love, love yields to business: be busy and be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``You will go most safely in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the one that applies to most of us: ``I see and
approve better things, but follow worse.''
</P>
<P>
   There are worse roads to follow than the gorge-flirting pavement
that creeps through a beautiful stretch of the Apennines, the spine
of Italy from top to bottom: Alps to Sicily. Diving through tunnels
and bridging gaps, to reach Scanno, it is a challenging route with
enough curls to make a snake nauseous. Or envious.
</P>
<P>
   Snow is coming, though some of it has never departed the creamy,
cloud-pinned crests that jut all about. Lake Scanno, an aqua-tinted
bowl, will stiffen with ice. The ski hotels on the outskirts are
getting ready for the season, but Scanno is still quiet. Beside the
tall bell tower of Santa Maria della Valle, a church with parts
belonging to the 12th century, old men sit on old benches and gaze
into the hazy valley, perhaps reminiscing about the good old days
of the wool-trade boom of the 16th century. Probably none of them
is enrolled in the computer course advertised in a shop window.
</P>
<P>
   Our landlady recommends Alle Fonte, the Tarullo brothers'
restaurant, for dinner. ``Massimo, Nuncio, and Orazio will take
good care of you.'' They do, in an attractive pine-paneled room
where the three of us are the only diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it gets busier,'' says Massimo, also a carpenter, ``when
the ski season begins, and later, summer.'' The homemade gnocchi
with a tomato sauce is especially good.
</P>
<P>
   As a finishing touch, Massimo brings Amaro with fresh-baked
cookies, saying, ``You should come back in January for the Festa of
St. Antonio Abate. We cook a giant lasagna outside, beside Santa
Maria della Valle, and everyone is free to eat all they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like dreaded lasagna overload to me, but interesting. I
mean, what journalist ever turned down a free meal?
</P>
<P>
   After dinner we walk the compressed, dark, empty streets of
``this lop-sided place, a pedestrian roller coaster,'' in the words
of compatriate Ron Sampson. ``I hope the politicians are on the
level because nothing else is in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   The moon dips and ascends as we also do on steep staircases that
pass for thoroughfares and passageways leading . . . where?
</P>
<P>
   TVs babble behind shuttered windows, a card game is glimpsed
through a cafe window. Two old women, only yards apart, converse in
raspy whispers from facing iron balconies. Laundry hangs hopeful of
sunshine and breeze tomorrow. Puncturing the stillness, cats warble
and dogs croon. Our footsteps on paving stones are percussion
completing the ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Sloping ramps, leaning alleys, rising and plunging arteries give
us passing grades as we wander, wondering what it's like when snow
and ice appear. ``A slalom on foot? Tricky,'' says Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people are roped together like mountain climbers,''
Aurelio speculates.
</P>
<P>
   I've fallen out of trees, love, sorts, favor, and beds _ but
never a town.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio takes my hand, reassuringly, ``I won't let it happen.
After all, you've got the credit cards and the room key.''

AEROSMITH'S ROCKIN RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can it be? Is that actually Aerosmith greeting you before the
start of a Walt Disney World ride called the Rock 'n' Roller
Coaster Starring Aerosmith?
</P>
<P>
   No. But you may be forgiven if you thought the Boston rockers
were actually present: What you're seeing is a holographic movie.
And that's just the first surprise at this Disney-MGM Studios
attraction. When you ride the coaster, here's what happens:
</P>
<P>
   --You travel on a track that is 3,043 feet long _ more than a
half-mile of twists, turns, loops, corkscrews, hills, and dips. The
ride is Disney's first coaster in the United States that features
inversions.
</P>
<P>
   --The high-speed launch catapults each 24-person car, or
Limotrain, to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds. That's similar to the
feeling you'd get in a supersonic jet as it blasts off from the
deck of an aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
   --You encounter a force of nearly 5 Gs in the transition from
launch to loop in the ride's first inversion. In contrast, space
shuttle astronauts encounter only 3 Gs at liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   --Each Limotrain has 120 speakers, and each plays a different,
specially recorded Aerosmith song (for instance, ``Love in an
Elevator'' has been transformed into ``Love in a Roller Coaster'').
In all, the attraction has 900 speakers and
</P>
<P>
   more than 32,000 watts of audio amplifier output power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --And, oh yes, this speedy, sonic ride all happens indoors . . .
and in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of Disney: ``Mousetales, the Unofficial Newsletter of
Walt Disney World'' is offering 10 tips for visiting the Year 2000
celebration at Epcot. The tips include the best time to visit
Millennium Village (11 a.m. to 1 p.m.), the best places to view the
Tapestry of Nations Parade (the Germany or Italy areas of World
Showcase) and Illuminations 2000 (the bridges between the United
Kingdom and France), and where to snag three free souvenirs (the
Innovations buildings). For a free copy, send a self-addressed,
stamped envelope to Mousetales, PO Box 383, Columbus, OH 43216.
(For a year's subscription to the quarterly newsletter, send
$12.95; for a single issue, send $4.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What is Mexico's largest lake? (Answer at end of
column.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a name: Many assume Angel Falls in Venezuela got its name
because of its heavenly height. (At 3,212 feet, it is the world's
highest waterfall.) But the real reason is because it was
discovered by Jimmy Angel, a pilot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Wonderful, wonderful, sublime, indescribable,
incomprehensible; I never saw anything so truly and appallingly
grand.'' _ P.T. Barnum, after his first visit to California. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bus drivers' joke (Santa Fe): A tour-bus driver calls over to
another tour-bus driver parked nearby: ``Hey, I see they finally
gave you your license back!'' The second driver replies, ``Right.
And how did your eye surgery go?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: Texas requires a permit for people to go
barefoot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Getting around: In San Juan, 40 policemen have donned in-line
roller skates to patrol tourist areas and shopping centers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mailbag: Jeff Coyne of Roslindale begs to differ with our statement
that Lhasa, Tibet, is the world's highest capital. Citing the
Encyclopedia of World Geography, he writes: ``LaPaz, the capital of
Bolivia, is 13,461 feet above sea level. This tops Lhasa by 1,374
feet.'' Merriam Webster's Geographical Dictionary agrees that LaPaz
is the highest capital, but puts its altitude at 12,001 feet,
topping Lhasa by just 171 feet. Other sources offer still different
figures but put LaPaz on top. So Jeff is right. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Lake Chapala in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. The
651-square-mile lake is 50 miles long. &QL;

SOME GOOD DEALS IN Y2K PACKAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Believe it or not, if you want to go where it's warm for the
millennium, you can, and without paying a premium. And, if you want
to go where it can be cold, very cold, few places say winter with a
warmer welcome than Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people have been turned off by the prices being quoted
for trips over the millennium. Too high a price to pay for the trip
of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, all that's changing,'' said Claire Gorayeb, vice
president of marketing at TNT Vacations. TNT is known for offering
value-packed charter vacations, and for the millennium they have
not only some great prices, but also space.
</P>
<P>
   Aruba has packages beginning at $999 leaving Dec. 25-26 (only
Dec. 26 departures are sold out); other destinations with space
available leaving on either Dec. 25 or 26 are Cozumel (was $1,199
now beginning at $899); Antigua (was $2,049, now from $1,049);
Cancun (was $1,799, now $999); St. Maarten, now from $1,399; Punta
Cana, now from $1,599, and Playa del Carmen, was $2,399 and now is
from $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are all-inclusive vacations (all meals, drinks,
and more) to Cancun from $1,449, St. Maarten at $2,349, and Playa
del Carmen at $1,499. Travel agents have details, or call
800-GO-TNT-GO.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you are looking for the hot spot of 2000, Gorayeb says,
it's Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. The beach is
unbelievable, and the prices are great, she says.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec even the snowmen have a jolly look and welcoming smile
_ especially that happy symbol of the Quebec Winter Carnvial,
Bonhomme Carnival. This annual winter festival, Jan. 28-Feb. 13, is
one of the biggest in the world and includes dog sledding, ice
climbing, a canoe race across the frozen St. Lawrence River,
glittering night parades, tobogganing, snow sculpture competition
(last year 19 countries participated), and a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec City, North America's only walled city, is particularly
beautiful in winter, with lots of wonderful places to stay and
dine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for some wonderful cultural experiences,
Montreal is the place to head. In winter, you can travel throughout
the city without ever stepping outdoors. Underground Montreal is a
place to discover.
</P>
<P>
   So think winter, think Quebec for some new experiences. Skiers,
too, will find new discoveries at Mont Tremblant, just outside
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years Tremblant has been transformed into
a world-class ski resort with a wonderful village almost slopeside,
grand new hotels, and new ski facilities. This season Tremblant has
even added 20 percent more skiing terrain.

<P>
   For information on the province of Quebec, Montreal or Quebec
City, call 800-363-7777.

   Many events are held on the Plains of Abraham where activities
are held for all ages.

 &QL; 
Fun in the sun

   Barbados offers its seventh annual Paint It Jazz festival Jan.
12-16. Featured will be Wynton Marsalis, Luther Vandross, and
Regina Belle. For information, call the Barbados Tourism Authority
in New York at 800-221-9831.
</P>
<P>
   Every Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday evening through April 15 Bay
Street in Nassau will be jumping to the sounds of music and
entertainers. More than 70 of the duty-free shops will be open. For
information, call 800-4-BAHAMAS.

   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BTV
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BTV stands for Before Television and it's the subject of a
fascinating exhibit at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge,
Mass. ``Prior to the early '50s, mass-circulation magazines like
the Saturday Evening Post built their audiences around the visual
appeal of illustrations, especially on magazine covers,'' said
Christopher Clarke-Hazlett, guest curator at the museum. ``The Post
circulated among more American households, generated more
advertising revenue, and exerted more influence over popular
opinion than any other American magazine for the better part of
four decades.'' Norman Rockwell was one of the Post's top
illustrators. ``Before TV: American Culture, Illustration and the
Saturday Evening Post'' continues through June 11.

Need a nanny?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Families visiting Aruba can now have the services of a nanny.
The Aruba Sonesta has begun an ``Island Nanny Program'' that
provides a nanny for the duration of the family's stay. The service
costs $120 a day from 8 a.m. to midnight for two children. For
information on the nanny program, call Coleta Zschuschen at
011-2978-36000. For reservations, call 800-SONESTA.

   Mention Australia and many think of koalas and kangaroos and
crocodiles and cassowaries. And well they should, because nature
puts on a splendid show. But amid all the natural wonders, some
visitors may be surprised to find resorts that offer fine food and
excellent accommodations while keeping in harmony with their
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the top resorts in Tropical North Queensland,
all of which I have at least visited. Costs vary but most places
have packages that lower the prices and add to the amenities. All
have pools and lush landscaping, offer nature excursions, and serve
good food, including Australia's excellent seafood and lamb, as
well as the nation's excellent wines.
</P>
<P>
   Kewara Beach Resort, 20 minutes north of Cairns in Northern
Queensland, is surrounded by forests and the Coral Sea. Its design,
including wooden carvings and Aboriginal artifacts, is intended to
reflect the lifestyle and traditions of the Torres Strait
Islanders. Listed prices begin at about $125 US per room. Phone
800-525-4800 or, on the Web, visit www.kewarrabeachresort.com.au.
</P>
<P>
   Thala Beach Lodge is some 12 miles south of the lively village
of Port Douglas. The 145-acre resort includes 1.2 miles of sandy
beach. Even a walk along that beach there has its rewards, such as
the sight of parrots in the nearby trees. Listed prices begin at
about $155 US. Call 07-4057-5300 or visit www.thalabeach.com.au.
</P>
<P>
   Silky Oaks Lodge, also near Port Douglas, is literally
surrounded by the Daintree rain forest _ a platypus is even said to
inhabit the resort's waters. There are 60 chalets near treetop
level and overlooking the Mossman River. On the lodge grounds is a
nursery where orphaned wallabies are taken care of until they are
mature enough to be returned to the forest. The two I met, Sandy
and Sheila, weren't at all shy. Listed prices begin at about $255
US. Phone 132-469 in Australia or e-mail
resorts-reservations(at)poaustralia.com.
</P>
<P>
   Reef House is a boutique hotel in the pleasant beach town of
Palm Cove, and is built so that it seems to be an extension of the
outdoors, with its ferns, bougainvillea, gardens, and three
swimming pools. The Corals Restaurant is a good place to try those
lobsterlike crustaceans, bay bugs, which taste a lot better than
their name sounds. Cocktails include a ``strawgasm,'' made with
chcolate and strawberry liqueurs and cream. Listed room prices
begin at about $148 US. Call 61-74055-3633.
</P>
<P>
   The Great South Pacific Express is a luxury hotel, a grand
restaurant, and a scenic ride all in one. The latest member of the
Venice-Simplon Orient Express family (in partnership with
Queensland Rail), the South Pacific Express has routes encompassing
the rain forest, the Great Barrier Reef, Brisbane, and Sydney. The
train features gleaming woods (Australian red cedar prime among
them), multicolored upholstery, elaborate marquetry, and
stained-glass clerestory roofs. With its doting stewards and
waiters, dining carriages, piano lounge, and observation deck, the
Express is designed to appeal to the high-end traveler. Breakfast
and afternoon tea are served in passengers' compartments while
gourmet dinner dishes can range from coral trout with roasted
aubergine to ash mountain rack of lamb on a tomato risotto.
Two-night Brisbane-Cairns trips begin at $1,430 US, with breakfast,
afternoon tea, dinner, and an excursion by air to the Great Barrier
Reef included. Call 800-524-2420 or, on the Web, visit
www.orient-expresstrains.com/.

   Hayman frequently pops up in lists of the world's five top
resorts. A favorite of celebrities, luxury lovers, and nature fans
alike, Hayman boasts scenery that rivals even that of my beloved
Hawaii. Tropical gardens and white-sand beaches help this 31-acre
resort blend in with the rest of 960-acre Hayman Island, the
northernmost of the Whitsunday Islands. There are 203 rooms
overlooking swimming pools, beaches, and the sea. There are also
six restaurants ranging from formal to casual, and a wine cellar
with more than 20,000 bottles. A wedding chapel sits on a hill. And
throughout the grounds there are statuary, paintings, gardens,
shops, a children's club, a library, and game rooms. Activities
include tennis, squash, table tennis, volleyball, a nine-hole
putting green, nature walking, a dive center, parasailing,
waterskiing, fishing, snorkeling, scuba diving, windsurfing, and
boating. Helicopters and seaplanes are also available for exploring
the islands, and excursions include a day at Whitehaven, one of the
world's best beaches. Hayman, not surprisingly, is a member of
Leading Hotels of the World. Listed prices range from about $350 to
about $2,000 US. Phone 800-223-6800.

TREASURES OF QUEENSLAND: REEF AND RAIN FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITSUNDAY, Australia _ Barry and I had becomes fast friends,
swimming alongside each other off Hayman Island, a paradise of a
place on the Great Barrier Reef. But now it was time for lunch, so
I clambered back aboard the boat . . . and threw Barry a hunk of
bread, which was quickly engulfed by his big blue lips.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, you see, is a fish _ a giant Maori wrasse, to be precise.
He's about 3 feet long and has a handsome hump that he didn't mind
letting me pat. Barry (as in Barrier) is a familiar figure off the
island as he greets snorkelers and swims around with hundreds of
his smaller friends _ just a sampling of the 1,500 species of fish
found in the 1,250-mile-long Great Barrier Reef, stretching along
the continent's northeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   The reef, with its fish and coral and islands and waters in
several shades of green, is a treasure. But then again so is the
Wet Tropics rain forest, which brings you the world as it was
millions of years ago. The rain forest area stretches from about
125 miles north of Cairns, the biggest city in the area, to some
185 miles south. Together, the reef and the rain forest make up
nature's dynamic duo in Tropical North Queensland. Both are World
Heritage Sites and neither should be missed. Fortunately both are
easy to visit without the need to rough it, because the area has no
shortage of stylish resorts and fine restaurants along with a
plethora of knowledgeable guides and transportation that can be a
treat in itself. The tropical north is home to 600 tours from
Cairns alone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Great Barrier Reef &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting Barry and other finny fellows, I was awed
just seeing the reef, with its 300 kinds of living, breathing,
sometimes waving coral, some hard, others soft and frondlike, and
still others looking a lot like big brains. (Despite their
appearance, they are animals, not plants. They have cells that
catch prey and openings for material to move in and out.) Add to
that 4,000 kinds of mollusk, 400 species of sponge, anemone,
crustaceans, and echinoderms, as well as 500 kinds of seaweed, six
species of turtles, thousands of birds, and the last great
population of those curious aquatic mammals called dugong.
</P>
<P>
   Whales come to the warm waters around the reef to give birth,
and are best viewed from July to October. What's more, there are
600 continental islands and 300 cays, or reef islands, many of them
emerald-colored and fringed with sandy beaches. You'll never see
all that the reef _ actually a complex of more than 2,900 reefs _
has to offer. But it's fun to view as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   You don't even have to get wet, thanks to helicopter flyovers
and rides in semisubmersible, glass-bottomed vessels. (One of those
boats is a yellow ``submarine'' near a tiny island named Bali Hai.)
My first view of the reef involved a copter flight from Hamilton
Island and a Fantasea cruise in a high-speed catamaran, complete
with a buffet lunch and lots of beverages.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing like getting in the water to view the
multicolored fish up close. Boat tours make snorkeling equipment
available (and if I can snorkel, getting just a wee bit of the
Pacific Ocean up my nose, it must be easy), and there are charters
for certified scuba divers. There is such peace in floating amid
the fish and the coral that I was eager to repeat the experience a
few days later on a day sail from magical Hayman Island. Good thing
I did or I never would have met my friend Barry. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The rain forest &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Australia's rain forests transports you back millions
of years to when Australia was part of a supercontinent called
Gondwana. Plant lovers will rejoice in the diverse kinds that grow
in this forest, where more than half of the annual 13 feet of
rainfall is caught by the plants before it reaches the ground. A
canopy of leaves filters the bright tropical sunlight, leaving the
forest floor dark and cool.
</P>
<P>
   And animal lovers, if they are fortunate, have a chance to see
58 frog species, 100 mammal, 327 bird, 162 reptile, 64 native fish,
and more than 40,000 insect species. (You wouldn't want to see all
of the insects at once, certainly.) The creatures, of course, don't
come out to greet you, so you may want to visit a place like the
Rainforest Habitat Wildlife Sanctuary in Port Douglas, where for a
few dollars admission you are assured of seeing bats, crocodiles,
marsupials, and cassowaries _ more than 150 species in all, most of
which roam freely and many of which can be viewed from walkways.
For an extra donation, you even get to pat or photograph a
eucalyptus-munching koala.
</P>
<P>
   In the Port Douglas area, a guide from Australian Wilderness
Safaris showed off a swatch of the Daintree rain forest area, with
its cool waters, prehistoric ferns, and sunlight softened by the
canopies of leaves. And in Cairns, a ride on the Skyrail, a
4.7-mile cableway, brought memorable views of forest and waterfall,
with exploratory stops along the way and a lively village called
Kuranda at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate travelers, though, take their Skyrail ride at the
beginning or end of a trip on the Great South Pacific Express,
Australia's glistening answer to the Venice-Simplon Orient Express
(they're part of the same company). The Great South Pacific Express
goes through the forest, right past the waterfalls, past great
farms and fields where kangaroos and cattle can be spotted, and
near small towns that look like stage sets of the 1800s' American
West. A day at the Great Barrier Reef is also part of this luxury
train trip.
</P>
<P>
   The twin treasures of reef and rain forest can fill many a day,
and yet that's hardly all the untamed nature that Queensland _ and
not only its tropical north _ offers. Queenland, the second-largest
Australian state (it's 2 1/2 times the size of Texas), has 400
natural and environmental parks, the world's tallest vegetated sand
hills, the nation's densest jungles, and its driest desserts. There
are many beautiful beaches, too, although from approximately
November through May, swimming is restricted to netted areas. The
reason is box jellyfish, which you don't want to mess with. (``How
do you know when the jellyfish are gone?'' I asked an Australian.
``Easy,'' he replied. ``I toss my friend in, and if he comes out
all right, then I go in.'') In the capital city of Brisbane,
meanwhile, are the famed Botanic Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Queensland, you're amazing . . . naturally.

IN LONDON, THE ART OF TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``You're not as brainy as you think you are,'' shouts
the man standing on the stepladder. ``There's a lot you don't
know.'' (Is he reading my wife's mind?) ``For example, how many
leaves are there on that tree?''
</P>
<P>
   With a brisk fall breeze altering the count by the second, this
is a question too tough for me, so I drag Marcia along to the next
soapbox orator holding forth at Speakers' Corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe your grandmommy was a big fish?'' he demands.
Now, this is a query I can answer. I saw self-same grandmommy just
a month or so ago, and though she grew up swimming in the St.
Lawrence River, she's most definitely a land-based biped.
</P>
<P>
   But Marcia is more interested in the youngish guy from the
Association of World Federalists who has drawn a crowd of several
dozen with his dire warning that the oceans are rising and tropical
diseases spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is responsible for dealing with this kind of stuff?'' he
demands. ``Nice Mr. Blair with his wavy hands?'' His own flutter
through the air in imitation. ``No, there is no authority in the
world to deal with global problems.''
</P>
<P>
   No, indeed. But as long as there's a Speakers' Corner, there
will be someone to talk about them. Since Parliament's 1872 law
making it legal to declaim on any topic, the northeast corner of
Hyde Park, just a few yards from the Marble Arch Underground stop,
has been the favored place for Sunday speechifying.
</P>
<P>
   Religion and politics are always on the agenda, but it's not
just the fire and brimstone crowd warning about eternal damnation
or moldy Marxists yammering about the proletariat. During England's
great beer debate of the mid-1980s, for example, you could
regularly hear purists pouring forth on the virtues of freehouses
and real ale. And it's not just oratory, but a give-and-take where
interaction with the audience is part of the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is legitimate objection, but most is just (usually)
good-natured heckling. One day a half decade ago I watched a
hirsute street preacher hold forth on the promise of heaven, only
to be interrupted by a cockney skeptic with a pressing question.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'yeh 'alf to 'ave a long beard to be a 'oly man?'' he
inquired. ``Eh've always wanted to be a 'oly man, but I just can't
grow a long beard.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day in early November, there's some of the
same spirit abroad at the corner. A few yards on, a 35-ish
professional type holds forth about _ I kid you not _ the need to
change the accounting system, particularly the depreciation of
assets, to give investors a more level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get to a real economic rate-of-return measure, we
can better understand prices,'' he promises. ``Then we can identify
promising firms and we can add real value, not only for ourselves
but for our investors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you against money?'' shouts a bystander, evidently reading
into the recondite call for more legible ledgers a more Marxist
condemnation of capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' replies the orator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then shut up and give me yours,'' returns his criticaster,
still missing the point, but delighted with his own wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, a man who disdains money is a pauper,'' answers the
speaker, casting a suggestive glance at his unkempt questioner.
</P>
<P>
   And without missing a beat, he's back on the subject of more
accurate accounting.
</P>

<P>
   London is a city of marvelous museums, but oddly, because the
National Gallery and the Tate are so dazzling, the city's smaller
jewels are often overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   One that definitely is, is Sir John Soane's Museum, in Lincoln's
Inn Field, just a few blocks from the Holborn Underground stop.
</P>
<P>
   Soane (1753-1837) was an architect by trade, a collector (and
something of a pack rat) by avocation. His home is a treat not
simply because of the opportunity it offers to tour a stately
English townhouse set in one of London's most interesting
residential squares. Or because it's free.
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is the work by William Hogarth, England's first
truly great painter. Hogarth was, among other things, a satirist,
and the two series of paintings on display here _ ``The Rake's
Progress'' and ``An Election'' _ hilariously trace corruption both
spiritual and electoral.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, the viewer sees Tom Rakewell, a young Oxford
student, inherit a fortune from his miserly father, forsake his
pregnant fiancee, and order a suit of clothes to inaugurate his
career as spendthrift and roue.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent canvases chronicle Tom through the accumulation of
parasitic hangers-on; an orgy at the infamous Rose Tavern, where a
harlot lifts his watch while otherwise distracting him; his arrest
for debt as he makes his way to royal court; his marriage to an
elderly one-eyed dowager to redeem his fortunes; a further descent
into gambling, debauchery, debt, and, ultimately, prison; and,
finally, his death in the Bedlam madhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings are rich with witty detail, and puzzling out the
pictorial story, with the help of a museum pamphlet, is a delight.
</P>
<P>
   Just as rewarding, if a bit more difficult to decipher, is ``An
Election,'' a four-painting series that chronicles the liquor,
bribes, and blandishments with which the Whigs and the Tories
pursued votes in the election in 1854, through to the corrupt and
riotous victory celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The two series alone make this museum worth a trip, but they are
far from its only attractions. And the opportunity, afterward, to
tour the nearby law courts adds to the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 10-minute walk toward the Thames brings you to the Courtauld
Gallery at Somerset House, Strand, which one critic has called the
best small museum in the world. And with good reason. This gallery
of 530 paintings contains an expansive collection of Peter Paul
Rubens and a broad range of Impressionism and post-Impressionism
works, including paintings by Cezanne, Degas, Gauguin, Modigliani,
Monet, Manet, Pissarro, Renoir, Seurat, Sisley, and van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you have an afternoon or an hour you can spend it
profitably here. Yet in the various times I've been, I've never
seen more than perhaps 20 people browsing through the several
floors of its collection. That's puzzling, since the Courtauld's is
hardly a collection of lesser-known works. Indeed, the museum
boasts several of the world's best-known paintings.
</P>
<P>
   One is Edouard Manet's masterpiece, ``A Bar at the
Folies-Bergere,'' in which a wistful barmaid stares diffidently
back at a customer whose own intent look, reflected back at us from
a mirror behind her, suggests it may be her rather than a drink
he's interested in buying _ even as the angle of reflection seems
to put the viewer in the position of the man who has elicited her
melancholic gaze.
</P>
<P>
   A second is a work most everyone knows, van Gogh's
``Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear,'' painted in Arles after his
quarrel with Gauguin about aesthetic inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   If Manet caught a certain melancholy plaintiveness in ``A Bar at
the Folies-Bergere,'' Renoir freezes romantic disillusionment in
``The Theatre Box,'' in which a beautiful woman in pearls and
decollete stares pensively out at us while her escort, behind her,
scans the other boxes with his opera glasses. The expression on her
face suggests she knows he's looking at other women _ and that long
years have resigned her to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Courtauld also has two famous nudes. One is Modigliani's
captivatingly erotic ``Nude,'' a work whose inclusion of pubic hair
so scandalized the Paris police when it was first shown in 1917
that they ordered the entire exhibit closed.
</P>
<P>
   A second is a smaller version of Manet's ``Le Dejeuner sur
l'herbe'' (``Luncheon on the Grass''), which hangs in Paris's Musee
d'Orsay. This painting shows two women, one naked, with two dressed
men. And no idealized nymph or Venus is she, cloaking her nudity in
the acceptable antiquity of classical illusion. With the painting
set in the everyday France of 1863, her nakedness, and the bold,
defiant way she returns the viewer's gaze _ suggesting prostitution
or at least libertinism _ set critics ahowl.
</P>
<P>
   And if you favor blues and greens over that blasted ochre that
dominates so much of Cezanne's palette, you just may declare his
rendering of the ``Lake at Annecy,'' in the French foothills of the
Alps, the most pleasing painting Cezanne ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallace Collection, in Hertford House in Manchester Square
(just a short walk from the Bond Street tube stop), is another
formerly private collection housed in the home of its onetime
owner, Sir Richard Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is both an art museum and a showcase for decorative arts,
including one of the world's finest collections of porcelain and
rooms of armor, which means the ornate mansion really does have
something for most everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But the cornerstone of its collection is the paintings, which
include works by Titian, Poussin, Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens,
Velazquez, and Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallace Collection is free, so it's worth a trip even if the
17th and 18th centuries aren't necessarily your first love in art.
In a 15-minute tour of the main gallery you can see the
collection's masterpieces, including Titian's ``Perseus and
Andromeda,'' Nicolas Poussin's ``A Dance to the Music of Time,''
Rembrandt's ``Titus,'' a portrait of his son at 16, and the work
the museum is best-known for, Frans Hals's ``The Laughing
Cavalier.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Victoria and Albert Museum, with its huge collection of
decorative, fine and applied art, hardly ranks as either a small
museum or one that's often overlooked. Just yards from the South
Kensington Underground stop, it's a massive museum that boasts more
than seven miles of rooms, and any normal visitor will find himself
suffering from museum overload, that mysterious malady that can
only be treated by repairing to the nearest pub to dose oneself
with a pint of lager, before he's seen a fraction of the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is one little-known aspect of the V &AMP; A: the Print
Room in the Henry Cole Wing. This is where the museum keeps its
off-display collection of more than half a million watercolors,
engravings, etchings, and the like. It's really a research room for
art scholars, yet if you wash your hands and put away your pens,
sit up straight, and speak quietly, the curators will bring you
portfolios of work from any of scores of artists.
</P>
<P>
   On our visit, we requested Joseph Mallord William Turner's
watercolors. Ten minutes later, a curator had delivered to us a box
of 18 paintings, and we sat there reverential as Ruskin admiring
Turner's genius. No, we didn't know how many leaves were left upon
the tree in Speakers' Corner, but we felt brainy indeed for making
our latest London discovery.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As science over the years has vanquished some of the world's
most dreaded diseases, from diptheria to malaria and polio, the
credit has gone to scientists who wear white jackets and work in
laboratories filled with test-tubes and bubbling flasks.
</P>
<P>
   But as pharmaceutical researchers probe the genetic building
blocks of life to attack more complex illnesses, this expensive
``wet science,'' as it is known, is no longer where drug
discoveries initially are made.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of working at laboratory benches, many of today's
leading-edge researchers can be found hunched in front of computer
screens, manipulating multiple databases to analyze and visualize
biological and chemical and molecular information that could lead
to the the next generation of wonder drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of going out to a garage and setting up beakers and
petri dishes and looking at an experiment are long gone,'' said Dr.
Stephen Friend, president and chief scientist of Rosetta
Inpharmatics Inc. and a former associate professor of pediatric
medicine at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now teams of scientists work together using many different
databases to find key pieces of information with the `wet' science
becoming a member of the research team and together they solve
problems that can lead to new drug discoveries _ that's something
we did not see five to seven years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a shift from traditional patterns of pharmaceutical
research, much of this work, known as bioinformatics, is being doat
dozens of young companies like Rosetta, in such high-tech centers
as Cambridge, Mass., California's Silicon Valley and the Seattle
area. They see researchers treading water in ever-increasing oceans
of data looking for better and faster ways to dive down and find
the critical knowledge and easily display it without drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a problem that scientists had in visually representing
hundreds of compounds, each with a host of different data elements
but without having to turn to heavy-duty statisticians,'' said
Christopher Ahlberg, founder and chief executive of Spotfire Inc.
The company, nearly three years old, has 40 employees in Cambridge
and 30 more researchers in Goteburg, Sweden, where it got its
start. ``Text-oriented computers cannot handle it, so you have to
develop a way of seeing all this information,'' Ahlberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlberg developed the idea for Spotfire while a doctoral student
at the University of Maryland's Human Computer Interaction
Laboratory. He targeted the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries as his customers, with solid results: 24 of the top 25
pharmaceutical companies, along with 50 biotech firms, use
Spotfire's Web-based software programs, paying between $100,000 and
$1 million for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   At Merck &AMP; Co., researchers use Spotfire software to access and
analyze information about relationships between chemical structures
and biological activity. The programs ``will help our project teams
make decisions faster to shorten the drug development cycle,'' said
Seth Pinsky, senior director of research information systems at
Merck.
</P>
<P>
   To help scientists ``see,'' or visualize, the compounds they e
working with, Spotfire software employs conceptual graphics.
</P>
<P>
   One application, for example, helps to sort out complexities of
molecular chemistry by placing different colored boxes on computer
monitor screens to represent 400 chemical compounds or proteins,
clustered based on their molecular weight. But when different
structural criteria are put into the program, as many as 350 of
these may disappear from the screen. Diagrams and graphs can be
called up to help uncover trends and anomalies within the data from
a multitude of different databases.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to identify early what experiments are likely to hit
a dead end. In ``wet'' laboratory science, much of this is achieved
by trial and error, with an enormous failure rate. Only one in 300
drugs that advance to clinical trials on humans ever win final
government approval. Hundreds more never even get to the trial
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Researchers working in teams need to understand and act on
more and more data types and see the failures early, because then
they can work with ones that work,'' Ahlberg said.
</P>
<P>
   His young company also mirrors the field of other bioinformatics
companies that are focused on related issues.
</P>
<P>
   With names like Molecular Applications Group, Pangea Systems,
Netgenics Inc., Informax Inc., Genomica Corp. and Rosetta, they
provide a range of search and retrieval software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that what once took us four years to carry out
from concept to the start of clinical trials is now done in two
years,'' said Victoria Sato, senior vice president of research at
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Cambridge, a major user of multiple
databases forrug design. ``For us, working with biolog, chemistry
and genomic databases is one thing; extracting the information you
need is another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bioinformatics increasingly is viewed as the glue that will hold
the discovery of new drugs together, with its capabilities linked
closely to two other cutting-edge research techniques _
high-throughput screening, where 100,000 compounds can be tested
per day in the hopes of finding those that make effective drugs;
and combinatorial chemistry, where substances are collected and
analyzed for potential drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ast year Frost &AMP; Sullivan, a New York market research company,
estimated US pharmaceutical ompanies spent $1.2 billion on
bioinformatics products _ and predicted that amount would double in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this growth is the development of programs that
enable researchers to ask many, sometimes open-ended questions
across multiple databases, said Friend, who is president of
Rosetta, based in Kirkland, Wash. This, he said, ``compares to just
five years ago when people created databases as a tool to ask just
one particular question.''
</P>
<P>
   Friend's five-year-old company, like Spotfire, is typical of
many bioinformatics companies, fomed in the past three to seven
years with venture capital financing. Some have revenues of $5
million to $10 million, but few are profitable.
</P>

PATRIOTS HAVE TO BEAT COLTS TO STAY ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Super Bowl comes early this year for the
Patriots. fact,t comes in five days.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots don't return from Indianapolis Sunday with a
victory, they will not be traveling to Atlanta the week of Jan. 30
for Super Bowl XXXIV. Frankly, it's not likely they'll be going
there whether they beat the Colts or not, but if they don't win
this Sunday, they know they won't be going anywhere but home after
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   No playoffs. No Super Bowl. No nothing.
</P>
<P>
   They are not in a must-win situation, they are in a MUST-WIN
SITUATION. Their backs are not against the wall, they're through
the wall. The fat is not the only thing in the fire. So is the
muscle if they lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already in playoff mode,'' said safety Lawyer Milloy
Monday. ``We're in playoff mode pretty early but that's nobody's
fault but our own. The fortunate thing is we're used to this
situation. We've been in it for three years, so we're used to
fighting through this.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be used to it, but they aren't happy about it. Nobody
wants to go to the RCA Dome and face the 10-2 Colts in a game you
cannot afford to lose. That's because the Colts haven't lost in two
months, have the highest-scoring offense in the AFC, and possess a
quarterback, a running back, and a wide receiver who can beat you
on their own if given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky we got them early the first time,'' Milloy said.
``They got that big lead (28-7 at the half) but we were able to
catch them because they didn't know how good they could be yet. We
can't let that happen again. Now they play with great confidence.
Now they play like a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they play like the Patriots always think they're going to
play each September but never quite seem to. Because of that, each
December has been a survival test for Pete's Patriots, and the fact
is you don't always survive such tests.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Pete Carroll might tell you these experiences have
helped build character ihis team, and he might be right about that,
but nobody needs or wants as many character-building opportunities
as there have been in New England the last three Decembers.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse this time is that there is more of a trick to the
situation. First, the Colts are no longer the AFC East doormat. Now
they are the attic. They are the best team in the division and
maybe the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more important even than the presence of the Colts is the
absence of the slightest bit of room for error for the Patriots.
Desperate as their straits have been in the past, the Patriots
always had room for a small faux paus in December. One tiny slip-up
would not undo them completely.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that could save New England after a loss to the
Colts would be a total collapse of the Miami Dolphins or Buffalo
Bills (which is unlikely), and even if that happened, the Patriots
still would have to win their last three games just to be 10-6 and
grasping at straws.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this are clear, but let us reiterate them. The
Dolphins, who are 8-4, already have swept New England, so they are
really two games ahead of the 7-5 Patris because a tie with the
Dolphins at the end of the year is a loss for New England. No
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo already has a win over the Patriots as well and has a
two-game lead in division losses, so even if New England wins the
rematch for a 1-1 split, the Bills would end up a game ahead in
division losses unless someone else helps out the Patriot cause.
Failing that, it means one thing. No playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts are the only division team contending for the playoffs
that New England could sweep, but even so, the Patriots still would
trail Indianapolis by two games with three to play and would be one
game down in division record and two down in conference play. So a
tie with the Colts would lead to _ you guessed it _ no playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, New England must win in Indianapolis or accept
that in three years it has gone from AFC champion to AFC also-ran.
This is not how the no-longer-quite-so-young Patriots see
themselves, but it is how many of the pundits saw them before the
season.
</P>
<P>
   There was much scoffing in New England when many observers of
the NFL scene picked the Patriots to finish fourth (or in some
cases last) and miss the playoffs for the first time in four years.
Yet here it is December, and if the season ended today, they would
be exactly where those experts said they'd end up.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place and out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to believe what you guys write in August,'' wise old
Bruce Armstrong said recently, ``but here we are in fourth place
ith a month to go, so you do have to wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes you do, which is at least what will make the Patriots what
fns always hope they will be. It will make them interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they lose in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Then they won't be interesting anymore. They'll be DOA.
</P>
<P>
   As we said, the Super Bowl is coming early in New England. It's
coming in five days.

 TITLE: ``Dr. Seuss Goes to War: 
 The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel''  
 Text by Richard H. Minear  (The New Press, $25)
 &HT;     By DAVE WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cat in the Hat's red-and-white-striped leaning tower of a
stove-pipe has become an American icon only slightly less
recognizable than the Disney mouse ears,'' contemporary cartoonist
Art Spiegelman (author of ``Maus'') writes in the introduction to
this eye-opening picture book for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the slightly battered lid on the Seuss bird that
represents the United States,'' Spiegelman writes, ``is
disorienting enough to bring on an epiphany: the prototype for the
cat's famous headgear is actually an emblem deployed in countless
political cartoons: Uncle Sam's red-and-white top hat! The Cat in
the Hat is America!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-necked ``Seuss bird'' is everywhere in this collection
of political cartoons, and so are prototypes of nearly all of the
other familiar Dr. Seuss characters, including Lorax and Yertl the
Turtle, the circus fish and the ubiquitous whale, but here they are
pressed into service as characters in single-panel political
satires.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss, it turns out, began his career as a cartoonist for
the famous experimental daily newspaper of New York in the 1940s,
``PM,''perhaps the last left-wing paper in the country of any
circulation before it turned toes-up in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known, as we read these books to our kids and
grandkids through the decades of the Cold War, that the long-necked
Seuss bird probably made his first appearance on Sept. 22, 1941,
with a sign, ``I am part Jewish'' hanging from his beak! For it
turns out that Theodor Seuss Geisel, son of German immigrant
Republicans, was an ardent anti-fascist and critic of
America-Firsters, anti-Semites and non-interventionists of every
stripe.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't remember America First, it was a group of
both conservatives and liberals who opposed getting into the war in
Europe, and among its leading members was Charles Lindbergh,
against whom Seuss directed volley after withering volley, as in
the cartoon of July 16, 1941, that featured the familiar whale with
the big eyes. Here the whale is presented as a fish out of water,
an ``isolationist'' whale who lives way up on top of a mountain:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(EDITOR: QUOTED LINES:) Said a whale, ``There is so much commotion,
</P>
<P>
   Such fights among fish in the ocean,
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving my scalp
</P>
<P>
   Living high on an Alp . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Dear Lindy! He gave me a notion!)''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eight years after his death, Dr. Seuss still has more than 50-plus
titles still in print, and, in fact, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' is said
to be the third-largest selling book in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   This collection, with commentary by Richard H. Minear, is an
illuminating look at the politics of the early 1940s from an oddly
familiar voice, and it may even provide some clues to the deeper
meanings of the good doctor's less obviously political children's
tales. &QL;

ACHES AND GAINS FOR TED JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There were no quick movements as Ted Johnson
methodically got out of his car, put one foot on the ground, then
dragged the other one down to the pavement and slid his hurting
body out of the seat, starting the long walk to the front door
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has moved faster than this before. Most likely he will
again. But this was the morning after his first football game in a
year. It hurt to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sore,'' said the Patriots linebacker, whose team
kept alive its playoff hopes with a 13-6 victory over the Dallas
Cowboys Sunday. ``It's been a while since I've felt these aches.
It's a shock to the body to have that kind of contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some respects, I could have played better, but my body
responded well. It didn't shut down on me like I thought I would.
That was good. The offense kept the ball f ite a while. I only had
35 plays, which is very average.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is precisely the number of plays the Patriots had in mind
when they cleared Johnson, who had torn a biceps tendon in training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic night. The Patriots chose to introduce the
dfense to the Foxboro Stadium crowd before the game, and Johnson
was announced last. It was a gesture of respect for him and an
attempt to inspire the crowd and the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was electric out there when Ted was introduced,'' said
defensive lineman Chad Eaton. ``It was like I almost had tears in
my eyes because he's gone through so much and tried so hard to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rams linebacker Todd Collins, Johnson's former teammate and a
friend to whom he speaks on a regular basis, had told him not to
come back so quickly. Collins told the Globe a few weeks ago,
``This is his career. He needs to take care of himself and not let
anyone pressure him to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody _ at least a lot of the players _ just said
to me, `Dn't rush it,' '' said Johnson. `` `Don't do anything
stupid.' Family and friends pretty much across the board said the
same thing. I took that into consideration. I know when I'm ready.
I talked to Todd; he said don't rush it. I need to call him today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun being out there,'' said Johnson, who made six
tackles. ``It felt like it always felt. There were things that I
wished I had done better.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was encumbered by a huge arm brace, but he said, ``There
wasn't anything I didn't feel I could d. I was so eager to get in
the flow. I thought they'd run the ball more than they did. I was a
little rusty on my play-action. My reads weren't as clean as they
should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing he looked for was a little contact, and it came
very early, on the Cowboys' first series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I feel I'm in the flow of the game,'' said Johnson.
``I was looking for a good collision. I got one. They ran a little
trap on me and I got a solid hit on the guard and I felt I was
back, right then and there.''
</P>
<P>
   The brace, which he'll wear for the rest of the season, is very
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nuisance,'' said Johnson. ``Running isn't easy. Other
than that, I've been working with it for a month now. It's not a
big deal.''

   Johnson was foremost in the coaching staff's thoughts after the
game. In the postgame press conference, coach Pete Carroll
mentioned his ``presence,'' though defensive coordinator Steve
Sidwell took a more cautious outlook and tried to downplay
Johnson's contribution on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he'd take a two-week approach to evaluate ohnson.
The coach wants to see how Johnson reacts to getting back on the
field for practice Wednesday, after ``looking like he'd been hit by
a truck.''

WITH RAMOS, REVOLUTON HAVE A MIDFIELD LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; soccer team's foundation is established through the middle of
the field. And that is what the Revolution are emphasizing as they
announced the acquisition Monday of Bolivian midfielder Mauricio
Ramos from the Tampa Bay Mutiny in a trade for an allocated player
to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, 30, is expected to be the Revolution's midfield
choreographer. He will play in front of defensive midfielder Leonel
Alvarez, with newly-acquired Eduardo Hurtado and Giovanni Savarese
at forwards. The Revolution must yt reinforce their central
defense, butt ganization is clearly changing the direction of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone we are bringing in is a good player and has the right
attitude to make the team go the way I want it to go,'' coach
Fernando Clavijo said. ``Mauricio is one of the best playmakers in
the league but he hasn't been able to prove it because of the
difficult situation he was in.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations will be high for Ramos, who played for Bolivia in
the 1994 World Cup finals, but performed in a secondary role to
Carlos Valderrama in Tampa. Ramos is a dynamic playmaker with a
dangerous leftfooted shot from long range. He scored 12 goals in 52
games for the Mutiny after playing for Destroyers, Guabira,
Bolivar, and The Strongest in Bolivia and Cruzeiro in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, like D.C. United's Marco Etcheverry, is from Santa Cruz
and was developed by the Tahuichi Academy. He was in the starting
lineup in Bolivia's 3-1 loss to Spain in the 1994 World Cup in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a copy of Marco Etcheverry,'' Clavijo said. ``He plays
the same position, he is from the same country, and now he will be
playing for a team which specifically needs a No. 10. He is very
quick, he has great vision, and he makes what seem to be very easy
passes out of nowhere. He is the type of player who can make the
players around him better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos will have an advantage over past Revolution midfield
leaders. Not only does he have the coach's seal of approval, he is
being installed as the team leader long before the start of
training camp, which begins next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to bring in players from abroad,'' said Clajo,
who will be scouting in Portugal this week. ``It is difficult to
adapt to the US. I am filling my needs with people who have been in
the country, who know it is very disciplined here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we need to bring in a defender. If we can find a sweeper,
we can play three in the back, but we need someone with the speed
to cover people and the experience to read the game and ability to
give instruction and direction.''
</P>
<P>
   With prominent roles being filled by foreign players, questions
are raised about the status of John Harkes, who is among the team's
highest-paid performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harkes is still a focal point of the team,'' Clavijo said.
``Everyone will have a role to make the team successful. He is
definitely a key player and he still has many years more to play.
My job as coach is toimprove the team, and there are many other
roles John can play and be helpful to the team. I need to talk to
him about it but I am sure he would be more than happy to play for
a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clavijo will have to decide if it is sensible for Harkes to
be in a complementary role while being paid the salary of a marquee
player. The Revolution have room for one more foreign player on
their roster.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore finds work
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore, the Revolution's all-time leading scorer,
received his work permit and could play for Everton at Exeter City
in an FA Cup match Saturday . . . Clavijo was impressed with
20-year-olds Ebbie Kodiat of Boston United and 6-foot-6-inch
Sullivan Phillips of Bermuda during a tryout camp Saturday at
Foxborough. They will likely be among 25 players who will be
invited to return for a combine next month. The Revolution will
probably not consider older players such as Jesus Rolando
Justiniano Rojas, formerly of Oriente Petrolero in Bolivia, and
Liberian national team member Jonathan Sogbie of the Connecticut
Wolves . . . The Boston Bulldogs will continue to tap talent from
El Salvador. Midfielder William Renderos Iraheta, formerly of FAS
and Luis Angel Firpo, will join Elias Montes with the Bulldogs this
season . . . The US will probably meet the Republic of Ireland at
Foxboro Stadium in the US Cup, scheduled June 3-11. Mexico and
South Africa are also in the tournament, which will also be played
in Chicago, New York, and Washington. Ireland has a 1-2-1 record at
Foxboro Stadium, with a victory over Portugal (2-0) June 7, 1992, a
tie with the US (1-1) June 1, 1991, and losses to Italy (2-0) June
4, 1992 and the US (2-1) June 9, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No respect for Italy
</P>
<P>
   Italy could be facing a World Cup 2002 qualifying group of
Germany, Croatia, Slovenia, Georgia, and Belarus. The Italians were
surprisingly not placed at the head of a group for Tuesday's
qualifying draw in Tokyo. In fact, Italy was ranked 12th in Europe
by the bizarre criteria of a nation's performance in qualifying
matches for France '98 and Euro 2000. Previously, seedings had been
determined by how a nation finished in the three previous World Cup
finals. The top European teams are Spain, Romania, Norway, Sweden,
Holland, Czech Republic, Germany, Belgium, and Yugoslavia. A record
197 nations have entered the competition for the finals, scheduled
June 1-30, 2002 in Japan and South Korea. The North Koreans, who
had been invited to participate as a host nation, failed to enter.
Meanwhi, the US will not start qualifying until next October. There
will be three CONCACAF groups, headed by the US, Jamaica, and
Mexico. The top two teams from each group will advance to a final
round-robin, home-and-away playoff for three places in the Cup
finals.

IOC SET TO VOTE ON REFORM PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year after the Salt Lake City payoff scandal that turned the
International Olympic Committee inside out, the Lords of the Rings
will be voting on a massive reform package in Lausanne,
Switzerland, next weekend dealing with everything from membership
to bid-city visits. Among the 50 recomenatns urged by the special
IOC 2000 commission are a cap of 115 members, an age limit of 70,
eight-year terms, a screening committee for new members, detailed
(and public) financial reports, and stricter control over would-be
Games hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Though nearly everything is expected to be rubber-stamped, two
proposals will be sticky _ a ban on individual visits to bid cities
and a renewable term for the IOC president. What may happen is that
members will have to ask permission to visit a city, with the IOC
footing expenses, and the president will be allowed one additional
term of four or eight years. While the reformwon't satisfy the
harshest critics, who want more outsiders involved, the changes are
still historic by the IOC's insular (and conservative) standards.

   Blunder down under
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers are trying to recover from a public relations
nightmare after secretly holding back hundreds of thousands of
premium seats from the Australian public. Already criticized by the
IOC for high prices, SOCOG had to admit that domestic buyers had
almost no chance to get tickets to the hot events like opening
ceremonies, swimming, and the women's 400 in track, where native
Cathy Freeman is favored. Amid the furor, the organizers have
dumped their ticket manager and released more than a half-million
tickets to the public. As expected, anything the Aussies are good
at _ track and field, swimming, basketball, rowing, cycling, field
hockey _ has been oversubscribed for months. The Australian public
has been guaraeed half of the 10 million tickets . . . More than
100,000 of the 250,000 tickets allocated for Americans are still
available in tour packages from Cartan Tours of Manhattan Beach,
Calif. Figure on paying $5,000 per person at the low end . . .
Though tickets to the premier events in Salt Lake City will be at
Super Bowl levels ($425 the top for hockey and $400 for figure
skating) the average price will be $82, with 78 percent of the 1.6
million tickets less than $100 and 50 percent less than $60. The
organizers are planning to set aside 20 percent for Utah residents
and auction off another 10 percent on the Internet. They aren't
saying what opening ceremonies tickets will go for, but they
promise it'll be less than what Sydney is charging. Sales will
begin next fall . . . Powder (the hare), Copper (the coyote), and
Coal (the bear) are the names of the mascots for the 2002 Winter
Games, chosen from a bunch suggested by Utah schoolchildren . . .
Primo Nebiolo, who died last month at 76 after ruling world track
and field as a dictator for 18 years, went out in Caesarean style.
His coffin was put on a pedestal at Italy's national Olympic
headquarters in a room with murals portraying Roman emperors and
Benito Mussolini, while six athletes stood guard. Though Nebiolo
was widely criticized as Machiavellian and tyrannical (he held up
the master scheduling for both the 1996 and 2000 Olympics to
demonstrate track's primacy), he transformed the sport, for better
and worse, from amateur to professional witworld championships,
prize money, a TV exposure. Lamine Diack, a Senegalese lawyer, is
serving as interim successor.

   Bela Karolyi, newly named coordinator (but not coach) of the
United States women's gymnastics team, isn't wasting any time
whipping his charges into shape. He will hold an orientation
meeting in Tulsa, Okla., this weekend and a training camp next
month at his woodsy ranch near Houston. And the Olympic hopefuls
can forget about holiday vacations, Karolyi says. Except for
Christmas Eve, Christmas, and New Year's Day, he wants them in the
gym. After placing only sixth at this year's world meet in China,
they're in no position to argue . . . Though she's a full-time
freshman at UCLA, Michelle Kwan found time to qualify for next
month's Grand Prix figure skating finals in France. Kwan, who
didn't compete in the event last year, will be the favorite in a
field that includes four Russians. Tim Goebel will be the only US
male in the field since national champ Michael Weiss, nursing a
stress fracture in an ankle, didn't make the cut. The Americans
didn't qualify in either pairs or dance . . . Season over (and
future uncertain) for US pairs skater Paul Binnebose, who fractured
his skull after falling during a star lift in practice at the end
of September. Binnebose, just released from the hospital, still has
some paralysis and will be rehabbing at home. He and partner Laura
Handy were world team members and likely Olympians . . .
Encouraging showing by the US lugers on the World Cup circuit so
far.Mrk Grimmette and Brian Martin are second in the doubles
standings, Becky Wilczak is eighth on the women's list, where
Westborough's Ashley Hayden ranks 17th, and Adam Heidt is 10th on
the men's. Italy's Armin Zoegeller is tearing up the overall men's
standings with four victories in four races and the German women,
as usual, are dominating behind Sylke Otto. Meanwhile, Duncan
Kennedy, the best luger in US history, appears to be finished. He's
abandoned his comeback after dizziness and nausea from brain-stem
bleeding recurred during training. The 31-year-old Kennedy won 21
World Cup medals during his two-decade career, but none at Olympus
. . . Why did Winchester bobsleder Jim Herberich call it a career
last month? After 14 years and three Olympics, ``it was an
appropriate time to retire,'' said Herberich, who was the top US
finisher (seventh in the two-man) at the Nagano Olympics and
already had made the World Cup team for this season. His former
teammates have yet to make the medal stand in two races. The US
women, meanwhile, ruled their Cup opener in Calgary with drivers
Jean Racine and Jill Bakken swapping off 1-2 on the two-day event.
They don't have another Cup race until the end of January . . .
Next up for the US women's hockey team are games at Princeton,
Harvard (Dec. 17), and Dartmouth (Dec. 18) before a post-Christmas
tournament against the Russians and Swedes in Lake Placid, N.Y.
They'll spend January and February training in Walpole and playing
exhibitions before the world championships in Toronto in April . .
. The US men's volleyball tam just missed qualifying for the
lympics last week despite beating world champion Italy at the World
Cup in Japan. A stunning loss to the South Koreans and Cuba's upset
of the Italians did in the Yanks, who can still get a ticket to
Sydney by winning the regional qualifier next month in Winnipeg,
Manitoba. The US women, who ended up ninth, get another shot, too.
Russia, Cuba, and Italy earned the automatic men's berths; Russia,
Cuba, and Brazil earned the women's . . . Only one medal for the US
_ a bronze from 16-year-old Cheryl Haworth _ at the recent world
weightlifting championships in Athens. The Americans earned the
full four Olympic slots for women but only two for men.

DEPLORING THE `MAGIC NEGRO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood dearly loves its cliches.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how shopworn they may be, there are certain tried,
tested and tired devices writers and directors just can't seem to
resist. Hence, just because we've seen a zillion mismatched buddies
in action comedies _ such as the Mel Gibson-Danny Glover ``Lethal
Weapon'' films _ it doesn't mean Hollywood isn't going to keep
cranking them out _ like the more recent ``Rush Hour,'' which
starred Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same old thing with some characters. There's the dumpy
wisecracking gay best friend (see Nathan Lane); the debonair
wisecracking gay best friend (see Rupert Everett); and, of course,
the wisecracking not-as-attractive best friend, usually a woman,
who makes the lead actress look that much better (see Rosie
O'Donnell).
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the ``Magic Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   I first heard a variation of this term after seeing the film
``Clara's Heart'' with a friend about a decade ago. In this 1988
drama, Whoopi Goldberg played a Jamaican maid who transforms the
lives of a well-to-do white Maryland family. The family is
completely falling apart until Clara, with her honeyed patois and
no-nonsense emotions, comes on the scene to set everything right.
It's a backbreakingly earnest, and irritating film, which led my
friend to utter a phrase I never forgot:
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn, I can't stand them `magic (Negro)' movies,'' she hissed,
although in the heat of the moment, she didn't use the word
``Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Washington Post film critic, Stephen Hunter, used
the term to lambaste ``American History X.'' In that film, Edward
Norton starred as Derek Vinyard, a virulent neo-Nazi skinhead who,
after being imprisoned for murdering two young black men, is
converted to goodness and light by a fellow inmate, a black man.
While complimenting Guy Torry's role as Derek's savior, he skewered
the part as ``a lie from start to finish; it reflects a secret
bigotry that sees black people only in terms of what they can do
for white people, but has no other interest in them.''
</P>
<P>
   I found myself thinking about this at a recent screening of
``The Green Mile,'' which opens Friday. The film, based on a
best-selling six-part Stephen King novel, stars Tom Hanks as a
death-row guard in a 1930s Louisiana penitentiary, and Michael
Clarke Duncan as a hulking black man who is possessed of
extraordinary healing powers, but is condemned to death for the
murders of two little white girls. He can barely spell his name,
but he spends much of his time healing white people, at the drop of
a hat.
</P>
<P>
   (A celluloid flip side of the Magic Negro is the White Savior,
wherein a white crusader manages to save all the cowering black
folks from really, really bad white people, as seen in such films
as ``Mississippi Burning'' or ``Ghosts of Mississippi.'')
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been such characterizations at least since
the 1950s, when Hollywood put its hand over its liberal heart and
pledged to create films designed to teach white moviegoers all
sorts of nice things about black folks in general, and race
relations in particular. So we got films like ``The Defiant Ones,''
with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis as escaped convicts shackled
together, and Ethel Waters dispensing advice to Julie Harris in
``Member of the Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, and these ``Touched by a Negro'' films are
still with us. There was last year's ``Shadrach,'' with John
Franklin Sawyer as the title character, a 99-year-old former slave
who returns to 1930s Virginia to be buried on the plantation where
he was born. Of course before he dies, he teaches a young white boy
about about life, death and the resilience of the human spirit. And
it's much of the same in Whoopi Goldberg's maid trilogy _ ``Clara's
Heart,'' ``The Long Walk Home'' (1990), and ``Corrina, Corrina
(1994). All of these films reduced its black characters to
walking-and-talking totems of kindness, understanding, and means to
heal the white soul of whatever ails it.
</P>
<P>
   And lest anyone forget, in such films the black character, for
all his or her saintliness, is often in a subservient position _ as
maid, as ex-slave or, in the case of ``The Green Mile,'' a man
awaiting a date with Old Sparky.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in its haste to counter negative stereotypes, Hollywood
overcorrects, and creates simple _ and simple-minded _ characters _
who are just as offensive. Despite their unfailing goodness, they
lack complexity, nuance, and the two things they seem so eager to
share _ heart and soul. While the idea may be well-intentioned,
black characters who exist solely for the betterment of their white
counterparts, are at best laughable, and at worse cloyingly
conscending.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in Hollywood, even when its heart is in the right
place, its mind is out to lunch.

AIMEE MANN'S VOICE CARRIES `MAGNOLIA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ``artist-driven soundtrack project'': That's what it's being
called in Hollywood, where musicians are usually just hired guns
and have little say in how their songs appear in a film. While
soundtrack albums may sell in the millions, the actual songs may
not even get into the film, instead being relegated to the
cutting-room floor or used for 10 to 20 seconds as filler.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's rare to see an artist like Aimee Mann _ a former
Bostonian who fronted the hit group 'Til Tuesday _ have three of
her songs used in their entirety (and six others partially) in the
upcoming ``Magnolia,'' an urban drama directed by Paul Thomas
Anderson and starring Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who directed ``Boogie Nights'' and lives with singer
Fiona Apple, is a music lover who took a shine to Mann's work and
even fashioned his ideas and dialogue around her poetically etched,
adult-pop songs. The soundtrack comes out this week, though the
movie won't screen locally until next month.
</P>
<P>
   In Anderson's liner notes, he confesses that he ripped off a
verse from Mann's ``Deathly'' (``Now that I've met you, would you
object to never seeing me again?'') for the character Claudia,
played by Laura Wilson. He writes: ``All stories for the movie were
written branching off of Claudia, so one could do the math and
realize that all stories come from Aimee's brain, not mine. . . .
You can look at the movie as the perfect memento to remember the
songs that Aimee has made.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. That's high praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean the liner notes where he worships at the hem of
my garment?'' Mann says with a laugh from her home in Los Angeles,
where she settled after leaving Boston six years ago. ``I don't
even know how to react to them. They're hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's spotlight music in ``Magnolia'' (one song, ``Wise Up,''
is sung by the entire cast, voicing different lyrics in a montage)
is expected to jump-start her career, which has been in limbo for
most of the '90s. Mann endured record-label hassles that meant
distribution woes for her solo discs, ``Whatever'' (1993) and ``I'm
With Stupid'' (1996), but she's found a patron in Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   She first met the director three years ago when he asked her
husband, Michael Penn, to write songs for Anderson's first film,
``Hard Eight.'' That inspired a friendship that's now a mutual
admiration society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is very enthusiastic. When he likes something, he really,
really likes it,'' says Mann, who has another solo album,
``Bachelor Number 2,'' due out in February. (Three songs from
``Magnolia'' will be carried over to that disc.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had songs here and there on soundtracks, but I've never
had my songs utilized in such an integral way,'' Mann says of her
``Magnolia'' experience. ``I don't think a lot of directors do that
anyway. Mostly, there's pressure on directors to make a deal with
the record company and use whatever acts the record company is
trying to push in the movie and on the soundtrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Anderson was quite different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give Paul rough mixes of songs,'' says Mann. ``And I'd
write songs without thinking they'd be in a movie. But we were kind
of talking about the same kinds of things. The same kind of
characters he writes about are the same sort of characters I write
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann can relate to Anderson's characters, including Claudia, a
cocaine addict and a pivotal figure in ``Magnolia.'' ``I've been
that character, minus the cocaine. She's someone who is very
defended against other people. And I've gone out with that kind of
character too.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the soundtrack really plays like a Mann solo album, rich
in vocal and lyrical nuances that probe aspects of the psyche that
aren't normally probed in a pop record.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, there are people who think my music is not
real radio-ready,'' says Mann. ``But I don't think movies have
those same restrictions. They generally have a wider emotional
range and can take music that's a little more complex or more
emotionally intricate.'' Mann, who will tour on a double bill with
Penn early next year, hopes to do more soundtrack work. ``But as I
said before, I don't think a lot of directors are interested in
having music be that interwoven with their movies. Music is usually
just tossed on top.''

<P>
   As consumers find themselves getting buried under an avalanche
of holiday credit-card debt, Andrew F. Capoccia sounds almost too
good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   A smooth-talking lawyer who rails with religious fervor about
the predatory practices of the nation's giant credit-card
companies, Capoccia promises to slash the debt of each client by 50
percent to 70 percent or more and help them steer clear of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy for his clients is as blunt as a bare knuckle: Stop
making even minimum payments to the credit-card giants, sue the
companies if they violate the law, and starve them into submission.
For his services, Capoccia takes a fee of 28 percent of whatever he
saves the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card companies are not known for rolling over, but many
have decided that it's smarter to settle for 30 cents to 50 cents
on the dollar rather than tangle endlessly with Capoccia or see the
debtor end up in bankruptcy with the entire debt wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, we're a consumer-protection firm that says
negotiate first and, if that doesn't work, file bankruptcy,'' said
the 57-year-old Capoccia. ``Before we came along, it was a
slam-dunk for the creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia's tactics are hardly novel, but he has taken them to
new heights. He estimates that he has saved his clients $21 million
so far this year, a figure that would net him nearly $5.9 million
in fees.
</P>
<P>
   In less than three years his business has grown from three
employees to 150, and now he is starting to expand outside his
Albany, N.Y., base. He opened a clinic last month in Cambridge,
Mass. and soon hopes to go national. If Congress approves a pending
bill that would make it more difficult to file for bankruptcy, his
business could explode. Capoccia is helped by the industry's
practice of sending out increasing numbers of card applications
each year _ a total of 3.5 billion in 1998, according to the
Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   But his success also has drawn controversy. Some debt
specialists question whether Capoccia's debt-reduction program is
in every client's best interest. Richard Hackel, a consumer
bankruptcy attorney from Boston, said the impact of Capoccia's
program on a customer's credit would not be that much different
from a bankruptcy, yet with a bankruptcy the consumer's entire
unsecured debt could be wiped out at less cost and under court
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement and judicial officials also are attacking his
tactics. New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued Capoccia last
month, charging him with deceptive advertising and making false
claims. Several New York judges have imposed sanctions on him
exceeding $1 million for filing what they consider frivolous
lawsuits. And the sanctions have spurred the Committee on
Professional Standards, New York's lawyer-disciplinary body, to
charge him with misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia is no stranger to the Committee on Professional
Standards. Twice before, while a divorce attorney and a personal
injury lawyer, he was suspended briefly from the practice of law.
The last time, in 1988, it was for depositing checks owed to a
client into his own escrow account. In 1989, Capoccia also was
warned to tone down his ads, which characterized him as a ``smart
tough lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia said there is no pattern of wrongdoing here. He said he
is at war now with the New York legal establishment because of his
crusade against credit-card companies. He has countersued Spitzer,
appealed the sanctions (pointing out that the judge who imposed the
heftiest fines formerly worked for a law firm specializing in debt
collection) and forced the disciplinary body to open its
proceedings to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that Capoccia is seen as a tremendous threat to
the way business has been conducted in New York,'' said his Boston
attorney, Harvey Silverglate.
</P>
<P>
   When a client signs on with Capoccia, the firm's first action is
to notify every creditor that the client is now represented by
counsel and that direct contact with the client is no longer
permitted. Capoccia urges clients to document any creditor contact
and sues the creditors if they violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia also demands a mountain of information from every
creditor and then combs through the documents looking for errors
that would invalidate some or all of the debt. Capoccia said he is
not trying to get his clients off on technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't write these laws,'' he said. ``We just use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical customer is someone with a job who is struggling to
make the minimum payments on anywhere from four to a dozen credit
cards. Capoccia's staff estimates how much the debt can be reduced
and the firm's fee, and then starts drawing from the client's bank
account on a monthly basis to raise the necessary funds. Then the
waiting game begins.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Scott of Buffalo, who works in the cardiac-care department
at a local hospital, said she was paying somewhere between $300 and
$400 a month and wasn't making a dent in her $7,000 debt. After
signing on with Capoccia in July 1998, she started to pay $209 a
month into an escrow fund.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen months later she settled with her creditors, paying
them a total of $2,279. She also paid Capoccia's firm a fee of
$1,192.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they said came true,'' she said. ``Now I feel free
in my own home. Before, I was a prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   David Smith of Delmar, N.Y., who got into financial trouble when
his wife quit her job as their son began kidney dialysis, said it
took him just over two years to complete the Capoccia program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think their debts will magically disappear, but
that's not reality,'' said Smith. ``It took years to create the
debt, and it's going to take some time to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Capoccia, creditors settle with him 90 percent of
the time. He even has lucrative standing settlement agreements with
some creditors. Collect America, a company that buys uncollected
debt from credit-card companies, has agreed to settle with Capoccia
for 50 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   On an annual basis, Collect America is handling about $2 million
in debt with Capoccia. That means Collect America takes in $1
million, Capoccia's customers save $1 million, and Capoccia gets
$280,000, or 28 percent of the savings, mostly for processing
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Klein, a consumer credit specialist with the National
Consumer Law Center in Boston, said Capoccia is filling a need.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of families out there who are
looking for help with their debts,'' he said. ``If he's able to get
good agreements, more power to him.''
</P>
<P>
   David Herwitz, a law professor at Harvard University who has
signed on as an ombudsman for Capoccia's firm, said he has had few
complaints to deal with so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have formed a favorable impression of him,'' said Herwitz.
``I think the courts in New York have gone mad with the sanctions
and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The drawback to Capaccio's approach is that, as consumers wait
for settlement agreements with their creditors, their credit
reports take a beating. They get hit with late fees, higher
interest rates, delinquencies, and court judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult way to go about it,'' said Debbie Eaton,
senior vice president at the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of
Southern New England, a program set up by credit-card companies to
help consumers shed their debt.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Fisher, of Solomon &AMP; Solomon in Albany, who represents
Citibank and other major credit-card companies, said Capoccia may
not fully inform clients that many companies won't settle on the
cheap and will pursue court judgments that can garnish wages and
place liens on homes.
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia, who noted that all of the risks are spelled out in the
legal representation agreements clients are required to sign, said
he is helping clients who want to avoid bankruptcy and attack their
debt head-on. He said credit-counseling services, such as Eaton's,
fail because they never attack the principal of a client's debt,
only the interest costs going forward.
</P>
<P>
   While Capoccia's clients may take a beating on their credit
report, there often is no permanent damage. Six Capoccia clients
interviewed by the Globe said their credit rating suffered in the
debt-reduction program, but that did not stop credit-card companies
from continuing to mail them preapproved credit-card applications,
convenience checks, or home-equity-loan applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sick part about all this,'' said Edward Ruede of
Albany. ``I've learned to live without credit cards. It's like
going cold turkey on heroin. But the companies keep pushing credit
at you.''

GORE'S PRIMARY WEAPON IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: SHAHEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ROCHESTER, N.H. &UR;  &LR; _ So I asked the reigning champ the obvious
question, what the secret is. And she smiled and made the obvious
seem revelatory: ``The secret is that there is no secret. My
conventional wisdom is that there is no conventional wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, the secret is that hard, grunt work in the precincts can
still matter in politics.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire primaries, Jeanne Shaheen has caused more
earthquakes than Mother Nature: Jimmy Carter, when he was a
no-count former governor of Georgia 23 years ago; Carter, when he
was a decided underdog to Edward Kennedy in 1980; and then, the
legendary one _ Gary Hart from out of the blue in 1984 over former
Vice President Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   To that you should add her own improbable elevation from state
senator to governor in 1996, followed by a landslide in '98 that
brought in the first Democratic state Senate in 86 years on her
coattails.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that she is now officially with Al Gore for the primary
less than two months away is anything but news. Her husband Billy
has been chairing the Gore operation for months. The governor, in
fact, would have been on board two months ago, had not a
long-running school-funding crisis flared anew.
</P>
<P>
   When she made it official over the weekend in this important
population center of eastern New Hampshire, it was no accident that
the first thing she and Gore did before another public meeting in
Portsmouth near her old Senate district was to go canvassing door
to door for a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen is an unabashed fan of the revamped Gore campaign. She
loves the long town meetings where Gore stays until the last voter
with a question has had the chance to ask it. And she believes that
regular canvassing by the candidate himself is time productively
spent.
</P>
<P>
   It was ironic that while the Gore-Shaheen alliance was being
formally unveiled inside the Chamberlain Street School here, a
small knot of Bill Bradley supporters outside was passing out a
statement by the state director, Mark Longabaugh, vowing to press
on and defeat ``the political establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Going down the stretch here, with the primary up for grabs,
being called the establishment is certainly a twist and a first.
Shaheen has never done politics from that position, and certainly
doesn't govern that way. It was ironic also that to slightly
counter the governor's announcement, Longabaugh released some more
converts to Bradley's ``steering committee,'' a list of supporters
that now includes 2,500-plus people.
</P>
<P>
   Every campaign uses this organizing tool now. In New Hampshire,
the patent for it should belong to Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite was 20 years ago, getting ready for the second
Carter campaign when he was a big underdog to Senator Kennedy,''
she told me. ``We had the idea of having a large committee of
supporters to show we were very much alive.'' Back then, the last
Democratic governor, the late Hugh Gallen, was still in office and
the notion was to send a personal letter from him to 5,000
Democratic officials and activists,asking for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1979, remember, there were no signature machines,'' she
went on. ``Each letter was done individually, with some kind of
personal message, and then signed by Gallen. We ended up with more
than 700 people on our committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there are other hallmarks to a Shaheen operation
in New Hampshire and they, too, have become part of the landscape.
Wise Democrats pay special attention, for example, to the parts of
the state that tend to get ignored in general elections because
they are mostly Republican, such as Carroll County in the Northeast
and all along the western part of the state. In her own case,
Shaheen has also been strong among politically independent and
moderate voters who are usually the margin of victory. What is less
well known is that her political success comes attached to a deeply
held philosophy that mirrors Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen came out of the Ozarks on the Missouri side, the
daughter of Republican parents, and got her master's degree from
the University of Mississippi. Since arriving here, her activism on
behalf of presidential candidates has been consistent, as she
summarized it: ``They have tended to be the moderate Democrats, the
New Democrats, they haven't been the more traditional liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for her governance. She is a well-known education
reformer, an earlier leader in the electric utility deregulation
movement to slash rates, a managed-care reformer before the
patients' rights movement was nationally prominent, and a civil
rights and women's rights tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Her alliance with Gore has personal as well as policy roots, not
the least being that the Shaheens and Gores became grandparents
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Anything can happen and no doubt will, but if Gore makes it,
Jeanne Shaheen would be no token short-list name on his vice
presidential list. With her, gender would be the gravy, not the pot
roast.

PERFECT PRESENTS FOR WORDY FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do clone, smog, and solar heating have in common? All three
words were first recorded in _ can you guess? _ the year 1903,
according to John Ayto's ``Twentieth Century Words,'' a timely
compendium of the century's lexical innovations from Oxford
University Press ($25).
</P>
<P>
   (Sure, the Greenwich Observatory says the century rolls on for
one more year, but publishers know better than to let scientists
dictate their schedules. Any potential turn-of-the-whatever gift
book has to be out there competing in the '99 holiday marketplace _
and if we celebrate again next year, so much the better.)
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly indexed, as a good reference book should be,
``Twentieth Century Words'' is also eminently browsable. With
chapters arranged by decades, it's a review of history through the
lens of English: Word by word, new terms spring up to meet the
needs of the times. A page from the '40s gives us telethon,
terrorist, and thought police; the '80s bring policy wonks,
post-feminists, and Prozac. Often there are surprises: People were
still dancing the hully gully (1964) when someone coined hypertext,
now familiar from the Web's HTML, or ``hypertext markup language.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything worthy, of course, can fit into a 600-page
volume. Science fiction furnishes William Gibson's cyberspace and
John Wyndham's triffids, but Robert Heinlein's grok doesn't make
the cut. Sociologist Robert K. Merton's ingenious self-fulfilling
prophecy is missing, but Richard Rosen's psychobabble is here.
Nobody will feel shortchanged, though, not even millennial
hard-liners: Since the book starts with the year 1900, it supplies
100 years' worth of words, even without the novelties 2000 is sure
to bring.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a splashier gift, the ultimate word book,
of course, is the Oxford English Dictionary. But even deep-pocketed
gift givers have some tough decisions to make about format. For
someone with plenty of shelf space and no computer, the 20-volume
dead-tree edition is a real deal this year at $995 list, down from
the regular $3,000. Plus shipping charges, of course, and the visit
to the chiropractor after you've lugged the packages into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Or there's the CD-ROM version, only $395 and (for some of us,
anyway) more gratifying than any Tiffany trinket or Rolex
``timepiece'' could be. Even partisans of the printed word are
suckers for this disk, which offers instant access to definitions
and quotations in big, readable type _ and weighs less than your
cell phone, too. ``Word heaven,'' one blissed-out user called it,
though heaven must wait till spring if you're a Mac user; for now,
it runs on Windows only.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the OED is planning a great leap Netward in March _
will the on-line version be even more wonderful? Yes, in that it
will be updated regularly; no, perhaps, for someone whose Internet
service is spotty or slow. And promise a subscription only if you
can write a blank check; rates have not yet been set, according to
the publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Another gift you can promise, but not yet deliver, is Barbara
Wallraff's ``Word Court,'' due next month from Harcourt Brace
($25). Inspired by Wallraff's Atlantic Monthly column of the same
name, ``Word Court'' builds on the magazine's advice-column format
but makes room for more leisurely excursions into jargon,
diagramming, and a host of other word byways. I've already
photocopied her lucid discussion of why English allows us to say
``When baby boomers' joints start to go, so does their identity''
without sweating number agreement; Wallraff picks her way through
such language thickets with a sure step and a generous attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Until ``Court'' is in session, you can while away the hours with
William Safire's 11th collection of columns, ``Spread the Word''
(love that title!), $26 from Times Books. Even regular Safire
readers have reason to check out the books, which allow space for
letters from readers _ including such worthies as Alistair Cooke
and Jacques Barzun. ``Spread the Word,'' incidentally, marks
Safire's 20th year in what he calls the language dodge.
</P>
<P>
   For the ambitious readers who make up Steven Pinker's following,
this year's treat is ``Words and Rules'' (Basic Books, $26), a
return to the territory of his 1994 bestseller, ``The Language
Instinct.'' In ``Words and Rules,'' Pinker homes in on irregular
verbs to illuminate the way language works. Our treatment of
irregulars, he says, shows how we combine a store of memorized
words, using the rules of ``mental grammar,'' to create an infinite
variety of linguistic expression. Not everyone agrees with Pinker's
model, but you don't have to take sides to enjoy his elegant, funny
prose. You do have to pay attention: This is a tightly argued book,
with less room for pure entertainment than ``The Language
Instinct.'' If you liked that book, this is next year's course, as
it were. But give it to someone who dreams of going back to school,
not the callow graduate who has just fled academia without a
backward look.
</P>
<P>
   If the callow youth is off to a job, say ``Yes, Virginia'' (or
Victor), ``there still are rules about writing clearly'' _ and wrap
up a copy of Becky Burckmyer's ``Why Does My Boss Hate My
Writing?'' (Adams, $9). Despite the unfortunate title, Burckmyer's
book is what the revised ``Elements of Style'' should have been _ a
readable, practical guide that doesn't waste your time with
gimmicks, vampires, or excessive puns. Burckmyer's simple strategy
for checking parallel structure, for instance, is a trick many
journalists could profit by. And the book goes beyond grammar to
help novices compose smart memos and business letters. I've got
several giftees in mind _ but I'm keeping a copy for myself.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for some wordplay, after all that work? Several of the
year's books lend themselves to entertainment, even to parlor
games. We took Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions ($15), by
Elizabeth Webber and Mike Feinsilber, on a vacation with friends
this fall, and we had a fine time quizzing one another on the
Battle of Hastings, the Heisenberg principle, and Heloise
(Abelard's girlfriend, not the mistress of household hints).
</P>
<P>
   You can do the same thing with ``The Big Book of Beastly
Mispronunciations'' (Houghton Mifflin, $15), a combined and
expanded version of Charles Harrington Elster's earlier ``There Is
No Zoo in Zoology'' and ``Is there a Cow in Moscow?'' (there is).
Nobody reads Elster without an occasional howl of disbelief: Do I
really have to put two syllables in mirror, abandoning my
Midwestern dialect? At least Elster allows that route is right
either way _ ROOT or ROWT _ and I've noticed with satisfaction that
techies talk Midwestern when they say mail router, pronouncing it
ROWTER, like the woodworking tool.
</P>
<P>
   Elster likes to argue, so it's satisfying to be able to argue
back: He wants the last syllable of bouillabaisse pronounced BASE,
but my dictionary and I like the Frenchier BESS (we agree it's
never BAZE). While he's threading his way through the pronunciation
maze, though, he loses sight of spelling, so the entry reads, big
and bold, bouillabase. Paging Houghton Mifflin: Is there a
proofreader in the house?
</P>
<P>
   Prefer baseball to bouillabaisse? The year also brought The New
Dickson Baseball Dictionary ($35 hardcover, $20 paper), a
substantial revision of Paul Dickson's guide to the game's language
and lore. I wish this book had been around last year, when we were
wondering why Robin Williams had fondly referred to South Boston as
``a can of corn.'' Even Dickson can't explain what Williams meant,
but he knows everything else about the possible origins of can of
corn (a high fly ball that's easy to catch) and many another
baseball term.
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of wordplay are mourning the master of the game, Willard
R. Espy, who died in February, but his work lives on: ``The Best of
An Almanac of Words at Play'' (Merriam-Webster, $20), a new
compilation from his classic ``Words at Play'' volumes. This
collection of puzzles, palindromes, and other linguistic diversions
makes a fine introduction for an Espy novice, and it's supposed to
last all year. But don't be surprised if the recipient skips and
browses; Espy gratification can be hard to delay.

 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The image of a federal judge sitting in Boston is
beamed into a courtroom 3,000 miles away in Phoenix, where lawyers
appearing in front of a television screen argue over the copyright
to a horror movie and whether tons of pet food were contaminated by
tainted wheat.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exercise that tests the limits of technology and
long-distance justice, while helping some of the nation's busiest
courts clear their crowded dockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to go to virtual courtrooms,'' said Chief US
District Judge William G. Young, who is presiding over the Arizona
cases from a Boston courtroom. ``I much prefer that trials take
place with judges in a courtroom. But these people in Arizona are
waiting to get justice in their cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Video conferencing, which so far has been restricted mainly to
bankruptcy proceedings and civil pretrial hearings involving
prisoners, may soon result in the first complete video trial in
federal court in Boston, as some of the 20 civil cases transferred
from Arizona edge toward trial. It would make Boston one of a small
number of federal courts around the country to hold video trials.
</P>
<P>
   While Young said he wouldn't try a jury trial via video because
he strongly believes that juries and judges must interact directly,
he said many jury-waived cases built mainly on documents could
easily be tried in a remote courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of what might be called paper cases,'' said
Young, noting that one Arizona case he is handling involves a
dispute over how much it cost to repair the roof of a commercial
building.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen McNamee, chief judge of the US District Court in
Arizona, said judges in the Phoenix division carry an average
caseload of 500 civil cases and 100 criminal cases, while those in
the Tucson division shoulder about 250 criminal cases and 100 civil
cases.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, federal judges in Massachusetts have an average
caseload of about 250 civil and 28 criminal cases, according to
statistics compiled by the administrative office for the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Young credits the low caseload in Massachusetts _ the 13th
lowest in the country last year _ to the fact that there are 14
sitting judges in the district and no vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal courts along the southern border of the
United States are clogged with criminal drug and immigration cases,
causing many civil cases to languish on dockets for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge problem with our border courts. They are
overwhelmed,'' said Karen Redmond, a spokeswoman for the
Administrative Office of the US Courts in Washington. ``We have
fewer resources. Congress is definitely encouraging us to do more
video conferencing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven federal courts have video conferencing capability,
according to Redmond, and officials are considering revising
regulations on the use of video in criminal proceedings. While
video trials are prohibited in criminal cases under federal
regulations, there is a move to use video in some criminal pretrial
hearings. Still, the biggest push for video conferencing is in
civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have litigation that spans the globe, this type of
technology will have to come to the forefront because of the cost
factor,'' McNamee said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed a bill last week that allows for the
appointment of four more federal judges in Florida, three in
Arizona, and two in Nevada, but it will take time for nominations
and confirmations.
</P>
<P>
   For the past eight years, McNamee said, the federal court in
Arizona has been transferring blocks of 20 cases to other judges in
the Ninth Circuit, which includes Alaska, Arizona, California,
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, as well as
Guam and the Northern Mariana islands.
</P>
<P>
   Most civil cases settle before trial, but in cases that do not,
the out-of-state judges have traditionally traveled to Phoenix or
Tucson to conduct trials.
</P>
<P>
   When Young volunteered to help, McNamee said, it was agreed to
try to save money by using video conferencing as much as possible,
rather than have Young travel to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were curious to see how it was going to
work,'' said attorney Randy Wahl of Scottsdale, Ariz., who
represents two screenplay writers who filed suit in June 1998
against a production company for copyright infringement of a horror
movie.
</P>
<P>
   During a video conference in Phoenix, Wahl said Young's face
appeared on a small television screen in the courtroom, creating,
``a virtual-type judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it seemed a bit strange at first, Wahl said his clients
are happy because the case is moving swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas G. Ryan, a Phoenix attorney who represents a wheat
supplier being sued by a pet food company, said his 1995 case
languished before being assigned to Young this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a virtual guy, but I think it's a good idea,
especially for the pretrial aspects of the case,'' said Ryan, who
has practiced law for 24 years. ``What you sacrifice in spontaneity
has more than been made up for in efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Young listens to lawyers in Phoenix in Judge Nancy
Gertner's high-tech courtroom, which is equipped with several large
television monitors and computer screens that broadcast the
lawyers' arguments to monitors on the judge's bench, the clerk's
desk, the court reporter's desk, and the jury box.
</P>
<P>
   Other federal judges in Massachusetts, including Gertner and US
District Judge George O'Toole, have offered to take cases from
overwhelmed districts. Florida is awaiting final approval to send
federal cases to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously everyone's first preference is to be in the
courtroom with everyone present,'' said McNamee. ``But given the
cost and the crowded court dockets, that's just not always
possible.''

WITH CHANGING TIMES, A LOST HERITAGE

<P>
   HE YUAN, China _ Stepping onto the flagstone path that winds
between the ancient houses nestled cheek-by-jowl in He Yuan village
is like a journey back in time.
</P>
<P>
   The pathway is plied not by cars but by puppies, chickens, and
children. Elderly people whose mouths have never met a toothbrush
gather in dim courtyards to gamble with handmade cards, using
sunflower seeds as chips. At first glance, He Yuan seems unchanged
since medieval times.
</P>
<P>
   But something is different. Here in one of two villages where
the women's-only Nushu script was ``discovered'' in the 1950s,
there are no young women left. Relatives explain that nearly every
female between the ages of 15 and 30 has gone to a town or city for
schooling or for lucrative jobs in offices or bars. They send money
home, but have no intention of moving back.
</P>
<P>
   In a bare stone house at the end of the path lives He Yanxin,
60, one of three women alive known to read and write Nushu. Her
daughters were not interested in learning, because Nushu songs
``sounded like crying. `It's terrible, so sad,' they said. `Why do
you sing like that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He, who still comforts herself by singing Nushu songs, tried to
tell them that the script was a way of venting boredom or
loneliness that women could not otherwise express. But her
daughters could not relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls now go to school, they work. It's meaningless for
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like He's daughters, other young women from the Nushu villages
see no need for the script. Chen Meijun, 22, who came to Jiangyong
city to work as an accountant, laments that a valuable piece of her
heritage is dying. But she admits she never thought of asking her
grandmother to teach her.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Yau, 21, a karaoke bar owner, was one of the girls chosen
to learn Nushu songs for a video made by Chinese Television for a
1995 women's conference in Beijing. She has since forgotten the
songs, and says that with no practical use for Nushu, girls today
will not study it.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the language was on the verge of extinction, the
government tried to start a Nushu class a few years ago and printed
some textbooks. But there were not enough resources or takers.
</P>
<P>
   A researcher, Zhou Shuoyi, said Nushu must be preserved because
it is ``the written history of our women's fight for equality.'' He
suggests drumming up interest among tourists and locals by selling
Nushu crafts and scrolls. But others, like Yang Huangyi, the oldest
surviving woman who knows Nushu, said Nushu's death may be a good
thing; it proves how far women have come.
</P>
<P>
   ``If girls don't want to use it now,'' she said with a shrug,
``let them be.''

 &HT;    GORE, FIRST LADY FREQUENT FLYER MILES BILLED TO TAXPAYERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton breakfasted with black
clergy in New York City, then jetted over to Buffalo for lunch and
back to Great Neck for dinner, as she toured the state she wants to
represent in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On that same day, Nov. 30, Vice President Al Gore was pumping
hands and giving speeches in three New Hampshire cities on his 20th
visit this year to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary
state.
</P>
<P>
   As both pursued their political ambitions, taxpayers were
footing most of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Because the first lady and vice president travel aboard military
aircraft, accompanied by official staff and guarded by Secret
Service agents, their dozens of campaign trips this year cost tens
of thousands of dollars apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Although their campaigns reimburse the U.S. Treasury for some of
the expenses, the repayments don't come close to the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mrs. Clinton generally flies aboard a version of
the C-20, similar to a Gulfstream corporate jet. The cost to
operate it is $4,059 an hour, said Sgt. Dan Neely, spokesman for
Andrews Air Force Base, Md., which oversees the presidential fleet.
Expense for the crew is extra, but the Air Force does not calculate
the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Gore usually takes the larger C-32A, similar to a Boeing 757,
which costs $10,000 an hour to fly, according to the Air Force
estimates, again not including the expense of the crew. At that
rate, just one of Gore's 10 trips to vote-rich California this year
costs a minimum $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet following rules set down in 1982 by the Reagan
administration, officials are required to pay only the equivalent
of a first-class ticket for themselves and their campaign aides for
political trips. If a trip includes official events such as
announcing federal grants, the government can be charged for all or
nearly all the travel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reimbursement by politicians for their travel has always been
frankly ridiculous, and a little bit of a wink and a nod routine by
all these folks,'' says Charles Lewis, who heads the non-partisan
Center for Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the party out of the White House has usually
withheld criticism of the practice of traveling on the public dime,
since both parties have long taken advantage of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans are now trying to make the frequent flying
by Gore and Mrs. Clinton an issue. They lampooned the first lady's
11 visits to New York in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Republicans criticized Gore when his aides
acknowledged that they were seeking out official events and
announcements around the country so that he could conserve his
campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides insist they are going by the book when it
comes to travel.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore travels with a government-paid entourage
including a personal aide, secretary, doctor, photographer,
military aide and Secret Service detail. All have been cleared by
the legal counsel as essential, said Gore spokeswoman Melissa
Radcliff.
</P>
<P>
   In the first lady's case, no clear precedent exists, since no
presidential wife has ever before run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   She travels aboard military aircraft because the Secret Service
prefers that method for security, said press secretary Marsha
Berry. Mrs. Clinton takes an official photographer and a trip
director as well as her security detail on trips, all paid for by
public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She follows the rules that the (Federal Election Commission)
has in place for anyone in the situation she's in,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the first lady had no plans to change her travel
practices now that she has removed the name ``exploratory'' from
her Senate campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republican rivals, although cautious in their direct attacks,
have positioned themselves on the high ground when it comes to
travel.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, when Mrs. Clinton was flying around New York, her
apparent rival for the Senate, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
was visiting Texas, raising money and conferring with Republican
front-runner Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the expenses being incurred on this trip are being paid
for by the campaign committee,'' said his press secretary Bruce
Deidelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to say how Giuliani was traveling on his Texas trip.
The mayor has in the past used corporate jets, which companies make
available to politicians, who are required to pay only the
equivalent of first-class fare.
</P>
<P>
   Several presidential candidates, including Republican Sens. John
McCain of Arizona and Orrin Hatch of Utah and Democrat Bill
Bradley, have also availed themselves of corporate aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has brought charges of conflicts of interest and
influence peddling.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has avoided that controversy. The governor flies by
Gulfstream jets chartered by his campaign, which is flush with
cash. Bush has not flown on a Texas-owned aircraft since last
spring, when he addressed a college commencement in the state,
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush has forgone his governor's salary on days when he
campaigns for president. As of the end of November, he had given up
pay for 49 days for a total of $15,489, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has not been cost-free for Texas taxpayers.
The bill for ``executive security'' has gone up to $1.8 million
this year, a ninefold increase over the average annual cost before
Bush began his presidential quest.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were released by the Texas Department of Public
Safety after a freedom-of-information request by the
Austin-American Statesman and other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Security costs for the vice president and first lady are
classified secrets that have never been made public. Nor are the
total travel costs for to officials ever fully disclosed, to the
frustration of groups such as Lewis's Center for Public Integrity,
which conducted an investigation of the costs for President
Clinton's 1996 campaign travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got a good, straight answer out of anybody,'' Lewis
said. ``Every day we should know what they are spending, if it's
taxpayer money.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lewis: ``They get away with it because other politicians,
including Clinton, have.''

ROCKETTES KICK OFF CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The holiday season is a time for nostalgia, and anyone whoever
bundled up against the Eastern cold and headed into New York City
for seasonal entertainment can summon those warm fuzzy feelings
with the latest edition of the ``Radio City Christmas
Spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few new elements to the program, but the fixtures
that have been there for decades, ``The Parade of the Wooden
Soldiers'' and ``The Living Nativity,'' among others, are as
impressive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   This company of 18 Rockettes is as sharp as the New York City
crew has always been, from the first kickline in the opening number
to the ragdoll dance in the ``Santa's Workshop'' scene. Its
precision in the wooden-soldiers routine is remarkable,
particularly in its ending.
</P>
<P>
   Radio City makes a tame concession to current pop culture with
``Santa's Gonna Rock,'' which includes a rapping elf.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the show is a throwback to the June Taylor and
Ernest Flatt dance troupes that charmed TV audiences in the '60s
and '70s, especially in its ``We Need a Little Christmas'' and
``Christmas in New York'' numbers. It's probably Radio City's
strong sense of tradition that keeps the show a few decades behind
the rest of live entertainment. After all, who'd pay to see Santa
Claus surfing a mosh pit of tattooed and pierced Rockettes?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Santa, the big guy really anchors this production,
bridging the numbers and appearing in nearly every scene but the
Living Nativity. Brad Oscar has donned the red suit and lends his
pleasant baritone to several songs.
</P>
<P>
   In a production made up of show-stoppers, ``Santa's Workshop''
stands out, particularly the r&AMP;b-flavored singing-and-dancing
poinsettias and Christmas trees. It also features the raggedy
Rockettes who, at one point, apply their precise timing to tapping
out ``Jingle Bells'' on the xylophone strapped to the back of their
nearest dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the musicians' union, and no doubt some
ticketholder complaints, Radio City has brought in a live orchestra
for this year's show. The live sound is definitely better than
canned music, but the band unfortunately has been tucked into a
curtained alcove on the left side ofthe auditorium so the
traditional ``pit'' position can be used for VIP seating. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The show: ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular.'' &QL; 
Where: Universal Amphitheatre, Universal City. &QL; 
When: Through Dec. 28. &QL; 
Tickets: Tickets range from $22.50 to $63.50 and are available at
the Universal Amphitheatre box offices and Ticketmaster locations,
or by calling Ticketmaster at (213) 252-7497. &QL;

IN CHINA, AN OLD WRITTEN WORD IS DYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With sidebar, China-Village)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JIANGYONG, China _ For hundreds or perhaps thousands of years,
women in this remote pocket of southern China have shared a
remarkable secret.
</P>
<P>
   Legend holds that it began with a concubine of a Song Dynasty
emperor who was so lonely in the palace that she devised a way to
write letters about sorrows that only friends and family could
read.
</P>
<P>
   Men may joke that women share a language that men cannot
understand, but in Jiangyong County, a rural community of 230,000
people, that was literally the case.
</P>
<P>
   But now, it is on the verge of disappearing. As Chinese women
got schooling and freedom, women here have seen little need to
maintain Nushu, or ``women's script.'' Only three women still are
known to read and write Nushu, and what may be the world's only
women's written language will probably die with them. Even if
scholars preserve the texts, the language will become a fossil.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that, after centuries when authorities might have
wanted to stamp out the language, the cash-strapped local
government now wants to preserve Nushu as cultural heritage and a
tourist draw. But with no money to teach it _ and no interest in
learning it _ an extraordinary legacy that survived for perhaps two
millennia may last only a few years into the next one.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the oldest remaining woman who knows Nushu lives
quietly in a brick, stable-like dormitory of a grapefruit orchard.
She farms as she always has, writes Nushu poems, and sings them for
the occasional visitor who makes the five-hour drive by a sometimes
bumpy dirt road from the nearest airport.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Huangyi is 92, and her tiny, deformed feet _ bound when she
was a child in the fetish tradition of imperial times _ are a
testament to past inequities between men and women. Yang's
sun-bronzed face is still astonishingly beautiful and seems
permanently creased in a broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   She digs into a plastic bucket where she stores her notebooks
and crinkles her nose as she begins to sing, her voice vibrating in
a plaintive, longing lament not unlike some American Indian chants.
The lyrics are about a husband who goes to town for a job, leaving
his new wife alone and miserable.
</P>
<P>
   The script is simple and abstract compared to Chinese;
characters resemble fishbones, arrowheads, stick figures, or the
stylized outline of a fish. The characters are curved or linear,
compared with the square shapes of Chinese, which one researcher
says may have made it easier to weave the words into cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Yang learned Nushu when she was about 15 from friends and
relatives in her village, and she used it while doing ``women's
work'' _ making shoes, knitting, embroidering, and singing. But it
was most important for wedding ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition in this county held that female friends moved in with
the bride-to-be for the month before her marriage to keep her
company, and during this time they pledged their ``sworn
sisterhood'' and wrote poems about friendship. For three days
before marriage, the bride was expected to cry to show how sad she
was to leave home. Then, three days after the wedding, the bride
returned to live at home for her first three years of marriage, and
again exchanged Nushu embroidery, handmade books, and songs with
her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would write to our `sworn sisters' on paper fans and
handkerchiefs,'' Yang said. ``In the old days, boys and girls were
separated . . . so the boys didn't know what we girls were doing.
My husband never saw me studying it. He maybe knew it existed, but
didn't really know what it was and didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   There are happy Nushu songs, but many speak of the drudgery of
marriage, and of the importance of ``sworn sisters'' as allies. One
proverb recounts that ``beside a well, one does not thirst; beside
sisters, one does not despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang's daughter-in-law, Yi Ruiyi, regrets she never learned
Nushu. She came from a village where it did not exist and married
Yang's son after the 1949 Communist Revolution, when Nushu was cast
aside as irrelevant and later banned. Communist propaganda ballads
replaced Nushu as songs of camaraderie, and women did not have the
need for Nushu that their mothers did.
</P>
<P>
   ``In old China, newly married girls' position was very low.
Daughters-in-law were oppressed. But they could not express it
because it was the custom to obey,'' said Yi, 63. ``They were
isolated in their husband's family and depressed. So when they went
home to visit, they gossiped about their mother-in-law and husband.
Nushu was like a secret code between friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The origin of Nushu is debatable. One theory is that women
adapted the script from embroidery patterns or tried to imitate
written Chinese, simplifying it along the way. But perhaps the most
plausible explanation comes from Zhou Shuoyi, the largely
self-taught local researcher who ``discovered'' the script in 1954.
Zhou, now 74, had first seen Nushu years earlier as a boy, when his
grandmother visited a village and brought home a poem in Nushu.
Zhou's father was puzzled by the writing and said it looked like
ancient Chinese. The mystery haunted Zhou until he encountered it
again while collecting folk poems.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou has traced Nushu characters to ancient Chinese script, and
he believes it dates back more than 2,000 years, to the time of Qin
Shihuang, the man who unified China and became its first emperor.
Qin eliminated all local written languages, currencies, weights and
measures, and decreed one standardized script. The penalty for
creating new languages was death _ for oneself, one's family, and
nine related families.
</P>
<P>
   Facing such a penalty, men abandoned local written dialects and
learned to write Mandarin Chinese. Most women, however, were denied
education and kept at home, where their activities were not
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient marriage traditions of Jiangyong predated Qin and
were not targeted for elimination. Zhou's theory is that women _
barred from learning Chinese _ quietly kept using the local script,
and since women's activities had no official use, men paid no
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken Nushu is the local dialect, and can be understood by both
men and women. When written, only women could decode it.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Revolution, women in the two villages where Nushu was
found kept the ``Third Day Book'' ceremony alive and continued
their evenings of ``women's work.'' But after 1949, Communist
China's founder, Mao Zedong, declared gender equality, assigning
women the same jobs as men. Old culture and customs were
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   During a purge in 1958, Zhou was accused of propagating old
ideas and was sent to a labor camp for 21 years. His Nushu writings
were burned. Local lore holds that in the 1960s, paranoid
authorities suspected it was code for espionage. When the
government relaxed and Zhou was released in 1979, he went back to
studying Nushu, but found few women who still knew it.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, a Chinese academic learned about the script
from a report Zhou submitted to the government. The man reviewed
Zhou's work, conducted research, and published a book heralding the
discovery as his own. Since then, numerous people from China and
abroad _ lecturers, doctoral students, a filmmaker _ have made
careers on the back of Nushu.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the women . . . didn't realize it was anything special,''
said Wan Jufeng, a Jiangyong official.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, modern life has succeeded where Emperor Qin could not;
it has stamped out the language by making it irrelevant. Girls are
schooled in Mandarin and have much the same freedom as men to work
and travel, making Nushu an anachronism. The women who still know
Nushu have not taught it to anyone; no one wants to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Yang, the 92-year-old, mused that with greater freedom to leave
home, ``girls aren't as close to each other as they used to be.''
But now, she added with satisfaction: ``They can have a better
life, better clothes, work for themselves. I hear that some girls
now make hundreds and send it home to their villages. That's great.
We couldn't do that.''

BATTLE IN SEATTLE SENT A MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seattle may be remembered less by many people for being the host
of the recent World Trade Organization meeting than for the violent
protests over the trade gathering and the crackdown by police and
the National Guard against the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   But to many others, including some of the protestors, Seattle
will be remembered as the city where the massive protests sent a
strong message to the world.
</P>
<P>
   That message is that the WTO, viewed by the protestors as
representing corporate global interests, can no longer make
decisions on free trade without hearing from the groups that would
be most affected, including labor groups, environmentalists,
farmers and other workers from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for the first time, these groups combined to develop a
strong voice that the representatives of the 135-nation WTO clearly
heard during its gathering.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been many media and other public comparisons
between the 1999 battle in Seattle and the movement of the 1960s,
including the Chicago street protests of 1968, there were notable
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Although young people were at the vanguard of demonstrations
both in the 1968 and 1999 protests, there appeared to be a much
larger number of older protestors -- many in their 40s and 50s --in
Seattle than their were in Chicago, according to some observers of
both demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference appeared to be in purpose. In Chicago, the
largely young protestors wanted not only an end to the Vietnam War,
but the beginning of a new world. In Seattle, the young protestors,
many of them environmentalists, seized the streets. The older
protestors from the United States and other countries ( including
China, Japan, and European nations) were there to force the WTO to
focus on child labor problems, health problems, and the lack of
environmental protections around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO gathering also brought together two groups - organized
labor and the environmentalists- which had different purposes. But
in Seattle they agreed on one purpose: change the way the WTO
operates, and force the WTO to put their issues on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor movement and the environmentalists forced the WTO
delegates to focus on human rights, labor rights, and environmental
rights,'' said Jeff Crosby, president of the North Shore Labor
Council in Lynn, who was among a group of Massachusetts union
leaders, environmentalists and others who joined the protest in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the protesters included not only trade unionists and
environmentalists but also also workers from the Caribbean, South
Africa, China, and farmers from Japan and France, Crosby said the
protest in Seattle ``was truly an international response.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton ``was bringing up the rear and started
talking about labor standards and possible sanctions against
companies who violated these standards, it appears that the labor
movement and the environmentalists were driving the agenda,''
Crosby added.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby was referring to Clinton's suggestion to the WTO trade
ministers that trade sanctions be used against countries in
violation of basic labor standards, including exploitation of
workers and suppressing workers rights.
</P>
<P>
   Among the protesters' concerns: whether a new WTO trade policy
would have some of the negative impacts it has had on some workers
in the United States and in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby and others in Seattle recall one worker at an
American-based automobile plant in Mexico who said at a labor rally
that she was earning more money before NAFTA (North American Free
Trade Agreement) went into effect and less money after NAFTA was
enacted..
</P>
<P>
   A single mother of two, she also found herself working many more
hours a week -- around 74 -- simply to make barely enough money to
support her family, she said. Asked what she wanted, the woman
answered: ``I just want to see my children.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, billions of people from around the world,
including in the United States, will see that the battle in Seattle
made a difference. They now know what the WTO does, and why it must
change to make the world truly better - for everyone.

ESPN, MLB SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN and Major League Baseball settled their little spat Monday,
and the result was no surprise: ESPN forked over a bunch of money
to keep baseball on its air for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a sports rights package defied logic. Once again,
substandard television ratings didn't preclude a huge rate hike
(233 percent). Not even bad feelings could stop the relentless
chase for exposure and advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   It will never stop.
</P>
<P>
   With a federal court case looming, ESPN agreed to pay MLB $800
million for six years, about $133 million per year. The last
contract was worth about $40 million a year. In exchange, ESPN and
ESPN2 will receive about 290 hours of programming, including a
minimum of 44 night games (on Wednesdays, select Sundays, and
holidays) and a new baseball show, ``Baseball2Day,'' on ESPN2
Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Things change when money is on the table. Not too long ago,
Major League Baseball, mf that ESPN bounced three of its Sunday
night games to ESPN2 when there was a conflict with football,
terminated its contract with the Disney-owned network. ESPN quickly
filed suit, and a hearing in federal court was scheduled for
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In settling, ESPN and MLB agreed to air no Sunday night baseball
games during football season for the first two years of the new
cntract. For each game preempted, ESPN will air two games _ one on
a Friday in September on ESPN, and one on a Sunday night on ESPN2
earlier in the baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   The beat goes on. With legal matters resolved, MLB is now poised
to strike up a new deal for its over-the-air rights. Fox and NBC
currently split those rights, but ABC and CBS are eager to bid on
postseason games. The current deals expire at the end of next
season, but negotiations start in January.
</P>
<P>
   The market is extremely hot, and baseball is guaranteed to at
least double its revenue from television networks. Fox now pays
$575 million, while NBC pays about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder MLB and ESPN officials were at peace Monday.
ESPN, which recently lot a bid to acquire the NCAA basketball
tournament, has a new deal that includes Internet and radio rights,
while MLB has a good partner willing to give its game prime-time
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``MLB is pleased that the arrangement with ESPN will continue,''
said baseball commissioner Bud Selig. ``ESPN has been a valued
partner for the last decade. We appreciate the network's
professionalism and dedication to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN was equally mushy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We greaty value our relationship with MLB,'' said ESPN
president George Bodenheimer said. ``Our passion for the sport has
been evident each day since our first agreement a decade ago, and
we will continue to dedicate ourselves to serving baseball and its
fans better than anyone.''

BURNS PUSHES BRUINS AT PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They took to the FleetCenter ice about 11 a.m. Monday
with little or no dialogue among them, the atmosphere businesslike
and more than a tad subdued. They had their sticks in hand but
there wasn't a puck in sight.
</P>
<P>
   For the first hour of practice, the Bruins looked like a group
of players in the beginning of training camp, participating in
conditioning drills and going one-on-one in exercises designed to
get the competitive juices flowing.
</P>
<P>
   At exactly noon, the Bruins retired to the dressing room before
returning at 12:14 for another 45 minutes on ice, this time with
pucks. The reason? Certainly, Boston's hideous 9-3 loss to the
Chicago Blackhawks Saturday night was the rock-bottom explanation
for Monday's punishment duty. However, this attett attitude
adjustment has been coming for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday may have been the worst game the Bruins have played in
a very long time, but the fact is, since a 5-3 victory over the
Rangers Nov. 18, the Bruins have not been performing well. In the
last seven games, the Bruins are 2-3-2 and have come out of the
gate poorly in each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it isn't acceptable, no matter how you look at it,''
said coach Pat Burns, who was as testy as he's been since arriving
in Boston 2 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to ridicule anybody. I'm not here to put on a
show for anybody. I'm here to make sure everybody gets hard work
and an effort in. We didn't have one in the game Saturday night,
therefore we'll have one today. You look at the tape again and you
realize that for some reason or other _ I don't know what it was _
it was an embarrassing performance by everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The club didn't have ice time Sunday, but if they had, it's
likely Burns would've used it to deliver his message. Instead, he
spent Sunday stewing about the situation, particularly Saturday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the worst weekend because I felt embarrassed all day,''
he said. ``I certainly hope they felt embarrassed because I did.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other contributing factors in Saturday's outcome
besides the horrible performance by the Bruins. The Blackhawks had
had a front office shakeup, with president Bob Pulford taking over
a general manager and head coach. Such a move usually lights a fire
under a team. It certainly did in this instance. The last time
Boston was in such a position was Nov. 26, 1997, in a 10-5 losin
Florida after Doug MacLean was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the fact that when a team changes coaches
or replaces a coach, that usually happens,'' said Burns. ``It
happened against us against the Florida Panthers but did it
continue after that? No. Will the Hawks be able to do that every
night?I doubt it. But there's a natural reaction of a pickup for
maybe one, two, or three games. We were on the receiving end of it
and we've been on the receiving end of it twice for teams that have
let coaches go but there's no excuse for it. There's no excuse in
your own building for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also miss the grit of defenseman Kyle McLaren and
right wing Rob DiMaio, both of whom could be available for
Thursday's game against Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had absolutely no character whatsoever,'' said Burns. ``We
had guys who couldn't possibly be hurt after the game because there
were no body checks whatsoever. There was no passion. It's
embarrassing in your own building when you get run over and you
don't respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe with the addition of a Kyle McLaren or a Rob DiMaio or
even a Joe Murphy, all of a sudden the club becomes a little bit
taller, a little bit stronger, one guy throws a hit and then
everybody follows from then on. I think it's just a question of
lack of passion, lack of aggressiveness, and lack of wanting to be
aggressive and lack of wanting to be passionate about the game.
Maybe these guys coming back will help that, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Jason Allison is just hoping that this won't come back to
haunt Boston down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the ones you look at at the end of the yearnd say,
`Would've, could've, should've,' '' sai Allison. ``We can't make
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison recognized the warning signs all along as the Bruins
have dug holes for themselves in games. In some, they dug
themselves out, but it was bound to come back to bite them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've played well the last seven games, even the
ones we were winning,'' he said. ``We're not playing together as
well. We're not jelling on the ice. I don't think it's that we're
not working hard or shooting enough. We're missing coverage maybe,
but that's part of jelling, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were playing well after the first few games at
the start of the season even though we weren't winning. It was not
great but we had guys missing camp or who were hurt or unsigned. We
weren't as good a team as we are now. I thought we were playing
better but we were finding ways to lose games.''
</P>
<P>
   Nw, they're just playing poorly with no plausible explanation.
</P>
<P>
   If Burns has anything to say about it, that will change.

RUIZ CAN'T PIN DOWN GRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This weekend, Chelsea's John Ruiz will put his World Boxing
Council No. 1 ranking on the line in a place called Tunica, Miss.
It is no place to take a chance, even if the fight will be held at
a casino, but Ruiz always has been willing to gamble on himself. He
just wishes he could make a bigger bet.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Ruiz offered to fiht hot prospect Michael Grant
even before Grant got knocked on his nose by Andrew ``No Mas'
Golota two weeks ago. The offer remained in effect even after Grant
righted himself and convinced Golota to quit on his feet despite
holding an insurmountable points lead in the 10th round of a fight
that proved two things: Golota can't fight and Grant doesn't know
how to fight. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the claims of Grant's management that he is the best
young heavyweight in the world, no deal between Ruiz and Grant, who
is right behind Ruiz in the WBC's ratings, has yet been made. Both
sides continue to s thy want it and talks are ongoing, but money
and the wishes of HBO appear to be standing in the way even though
all Ruiz has asked for is the same money HBO was willing to pay
David Tua, the International Boxing Federation's No. 1 contender,
to fight Grant.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is $1.5 million, and Tua rejected it while Ruiz is
saying he'll accept it even knowing a third of it would end up in
the hands of his promoter, Don King. To further those efforts,
Ruiz's manager, Norman Stone, and attorney, Tony Cardinale,
recently sent a letter to WBC president Jose Sulaiman urging him to
order a boxoff between the two top contenders to establish not only
the undisputed No. 1 contender but also to provide the most
attractive opponent for undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The WBC responded with a letter saying it would ``absolutely
approve any elimination bout'' but went on to point out that Lewis
did not have a mandatory title defense due for another year.
Regardless of the wait, Ruiz and Stone are ready to put their
rating on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would clear everything up with the WBC and with the WBA
by us fighting,'' Stone said. ``If they're so sure _ which
everybody in the world seems to be _ that Grant can handle Johnny,
then just do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they win, they got Grant in the mandatory position and they
got King out of the heavyweight picture. HBO would have the
champion, Tua, and Grant. So if they're all so sure Johnny can't
fight and Grant can, why not make the fight? Maybe they ain't so
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant is a tough kid but he don't know how to fight,'' Stone
said. ``They've already made millions with Grant. They have nothing
to lose. onny has everything to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   hat will be true Saturday night as well when Ruiz faces Jade
Scott, who once was a contender but always seemed to be one built
on air rather than on fights. Although Scott is 25-3, Ruiz's people
took the fight because their fighter needed a payday and the WBC
was pushing King to put Ruiz in with a top 15 contender, which
somehow Scott is.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, King tried to push Larry Donald as an opponent for
Ruiz but Stone and Cardinale smelled a rat and refused. Donald is a
cute boxer who runs for a living. He is difficult to hit, elusive,
rfuses to fight if he can avoid it, and is just the type to steal a
decision from a more ponderous mover like Ruiz. That is especially
true because his manager is named Carl King.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to guess who Carl's father is, do you?
</P>
<P>
   ``We told King there's no sense fighting a top 10 opponent for
less than a million,'' Cardinale said. ``So Johnny ended up with
Scott knowing there's no such thing as a tuneup fight for a kid in
his position. The way we see it, it's a fight that gets us closer
to Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   And, they hope, closer to that million-dollar payday.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Looks like after all the talk of a Felix Trinidad-Oscar De La
Hoya rematch and then a Trinidad-David Reid showdown for the super
welterweight title, what we're going to end up with is Trinidad
defending the WBC welterweight title against Derrell Coley, which
should last about two rounds, in mid-March and De La Hoya fighting
World Boxing Organization welterweight champion Ahmed Kotiev Feb.
26 at Mason Square Garden. If the latter fight comes off, unbeaten
welterweight prospect Vernon Forrest likely will fight former
junior welterweight champion Vince Phillips on the undercard . . .
Kotiev successfully defended his title and kept his unbeaten streak
intact (25-0) with a win over Daniel Santos and it may land him
that Feb. 26 shot at De La Hoya. Why's that? Because more fights
fall out than happen. . . . The International Boxing Federation got
more bad news this week when a US District Court judge found
prosecutors would be likely to prove racketeering charges against
IBF president Bob Lee. Because of that, judge John W. Bissell
ordered that the IBF cannot pay more than $5,000 to any entity in a
single week without court permission and barred Lee and the IBF's
other officials from destroying documents or concealing funds . . .
Muhammad Ali may be done fighting but he still needs a manager. And
he got a new one last week when Bernie Yuman, who manages the Vegas
illusionists Siegfried and Roy, announced he was now Ali's
exclusive manager. He has managed Siegfried and Roy for 24 years,
the last nine during their stay at the Mirage in Las Vegas . . . In
Toronto, a bearded Sikh boxer won a court order allowing him to
fight with whiskers. But rather than let him fight for a Canadian
amateur title, the Canadian Amateur Boxing Association canceled the
light flyweight bouts he was scheduled to compete in because
bearded fighters are banned in international competition. The
associaion said it feared international sanctions on the eve of the
2000 Olympics. Pardeep Nagra said he would wear a net on his face
if necessary. That's what he did when he won the Ontario flyweight
title earlier this year. Said Anne Lowthian, executive director of
the World Sikh Organization of Canada, ``There is no justification.
Not legally. Not morally.'' I cannot make this stuff up . . . No
one will see the fight, but ex-world champion Gerry Penalosa, who
once looked like a potential great, takes on unbeaten WBC super
flyweight champion Injoo Cho Jan. 2 at the Sheraton Hotel in Seoul.
Cho upset Penalosa to win the title in August 1998 and this is a
classic rematch of a stylish boxer (Cho) vs. a power puncher
(Penalosa, who is 40-2-2, 24 KOs). Unlike what we've seen too much
of with bigger names, the fighters and managers did all they could
to finalize this fight when Penalosa waived a $25,000 penalty he
was supposed to receive if the bout was postponed from its original
Dec. 26 date . . . Word out of Europe is that longtime promoter
Mogens Palle is retiring at 65 and turning his boxing enterprise
over to his daughter, Bettina . . . Here's Tony Ayala Jr.'s take on
the troubles of Mike Tyson. ``Mike Tyson is a jerk,'' Ayala said
recently in Los Angeles. ``Four years in jail, $100 million in
purses, and he cries to the world that he's misunderstood.'' Ayala,
who served 16 years in a New Jersey prison himself, faces the
biggest fight of his life Saturday in San Antonio against Tony
Menefee. It's Ayala's biggest fight not because Menefee is the
toughest opponent the 36-year-old former contendr has faced but
because he knows at his age he cannot afford a defeat if he's ever
going to get the title shot that eluded him when he was
incarcerate. ``At this stage of my life, people aren't really going
to tolerate many losses,'' said Ayala (24-0, 22 KOs, two wins since
his comeback began) . . . In case you missed it, WBC lightweight
champion Stevie Johnston easily defended his title two weekends ago
in England over Billy Schwer at Wembley Arena. He won 10 of 12
rounds on all judges' cards . . . Six boxers who appeared at the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta now have won world titles. The latest was
German Markus Beyer, who won the WBC super middleweight title
recently with a decision over champion Richie Woodhall. Both Beyer
and former German teammate Sven Ottke hold world titles. This is
believed to be the first time two members of a non-American Olympic
team have held world titles at the same time since 1984.

   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   Here's the latest ratings miracle: Mikael Rask has had just 13
professional fights but he's slated to step in with WBC junior
middleweight champion Javier Castillejo Dec. 17 in Madrid.
Castillejo was briefly considered as a possible opponent for De La
Hoya until the former welterweight champion decided to forego a
quick move up to 154 and remain in the welterweight division. As
for young Rask, he miraculously shot up 11 spots in the WBC
rankings into the top 15 to qualify for a world title fight.
According to the WBC rule book, a minimum of 15 professional fights
is required of all title contenders. But this being the holiday
season, WBC president Sulaiman apparently decided to give out a
gift. To Castillo . . . Castillejo is 46-4 and has defended his
title (if you want to call it that) three times since he won it
from Keith Mullings. One of these days, Castillejo actually will
have to fight someone in danger of fighting back, but not this time
. . . Don't ask me what he's done to justify it, but Hector Camacho
Jr. (26-0) was named the WBA's No. 1 rated super lightweight last
week. He has fought seven times this year and plans to fight again
next month . . . Looks like an Erik Morales-Marco Antonio Barrera
showdown is headed for Mandalay Bay on Feb. 19, with HBO televising
. . . After three years of battling, Arizona senator John McCain
lost his fight to see the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act passed
when the full Senate was blocked from voting on it because of
procedural moves by two Democratic senators. The bill previously
had been passed twice by the Senate and once by the House but
because of changes made in the House version it had to be revoted
in the Senate but was blocked from consideration. McCain promised
he would attempt to bring the bill back next year because, ``The
boxing industry is in crisis and the Ali Act would have provided
urgently needed reforms such as limiting coercive option contracts,
establishing fair business practice guidelines for rating
organizations, and requiring key financial disclosures on promoters
and organizations of major boxing events.'' . . The date for
Tyson's next fight has been moved to Jan. 29 and probably won't be
in Wales. It's now more likely to be at the new MEN Stadium in
Manchester, England. Same opponent, light-hitting and glass-jawed
British heavyweight uius Francis. Generally, a British heavyweight
is a lightweight, which is why Tyson's people want to make the mat.
If Tyson puts on a strong performance, don't be surprised to see
him bac in Europe, possibly against WBO champn itali Klitschko.
Klitscko's manager, Klaus-Peter Kohl, said from Berli last week
that his man will fight in gust in Hamburg but ources close to
Tyson said, ``That's just a guy trying to get publicity for his
fighter. Mike's not fighting anybody in Germany. We don't even know
for sure if and when he's fighting in England.'' . . . Tyson's
schedule change means Roy Jones headlines the first card ever at
Radio City Music Hall in New York Jan. 15 without television
competition. Originally, Jones was scheduled to fight Graciano
Rocchigiani but when HBO executives asked to see a signed contract
from Rocchigiani no one could produce one so hard-hitting David
Telesco was substituted. Telesco has pursued Jones at many a
postfight press conference, demanding a title shot. Now he's got it
. . . After all the hue and cry over the Evander Holyfield-Lewis
draw in their first fight, New York Gov. George Pataki quietly
vetoed legislation recently that would have required judges'
scorecards to be publicly posted after each round. Politicians,
like fight promoters, never will change . . . December's best fight
could be 34-year-old middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins's title
defense against hard-hitting Antwun Echols Sunday on Fox Sports
Net. HBO tried to sign Hopkins for more money and a side deal to go
down to 154 pounds and challenge Fernando Vargas and Reid, but
thatell through because of promotional ontract problems with
America Presents. Instead an angry Hopkins gets only $100,000 for
the Echols fight. Hopkins hasn't lost since he was outpointed by
Jones six years ago and even though Echols (22-2-1, 22 KOs) hasn't
lost in three years he'll be in with the division's heavy iron in
Hopkins.

   CAMPAIGN-COST _ WASHINGTON _ As Al Gore and Hillary Rodham
Clinton pursue their political travels, taxpayers are footing most
of the bill. Just paying for their military airplanes costs more
than $4,000 an hour for her and $10,000 an hour for him. Campaign
reimbursements don't come close to the real cost and have ``always
been frankly ridiculous,'' said the head of one private watchdog
group. One escape: candidates using corporate jets, which also
brings controversy. And in the case of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, it's the increased cost of security that's raising
questions. (Malone, Cox News Service). 22.

   FLORIDA LOTTERY PART ONE
</P>
<P>
   FLALOTTERY-MAIN1 _ TALLAHASSEE _ TALLAHASSEE _ If your
first-grader gets to attend brand-new Binks Forest Elementary
School in Wellington next monthcq JAN., thank Delray Beach
appliance installer Howard Anthony James. If your daughter goes to
Florida State on a Bright Futures Scholarship, thank West Palm
Beach shipyard retiree Eddie ``Cowboy'' Brown. (Date, Palm Beach

</P>
<P>
   FLALOTTERY-HOWMANY _ TALLAHASSEE _ Though three out of four
Floridians play the Florida Lottery, how much they gamble and what
games they play vary widely. For most middle-class and well-to-do
Floridians, lottery means Lotto, the agency's flagship game that
dangles millions, even tens of millions, as a possible reward for a
$1 bet. (Date, Palm Beach Post). 12. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA LOTTERY PART TWO
</P>
<P>
   FLALOTTERY-MAIN2 _ TALLAHASSEE _ A $2 billion-a-year industry
doesn't survive on luck alone. Sophisticated marketing make up the
backbone of the Florida Lottery's efforts that each day, seven days
a week, 365 days a year, spends an average $99,000 encouraging
Floridians to gamble. (Date, Palm Beach Post). 49. WITH GRAPHIC.

</P>
<P>
   FLALOTTERY-PUBLIX _ TALLAHASSEE _ Pop quiz: Of the following,
the number one purveyor of gambling last year was: A) Gulfstream
Park; B) Palm Beach Kennel Club; C) Dania Jai-Alai; D) Publix
supermarkets. If you guessed Publix _ the same company that
resisted opening its stores on Sundays until 1983 and to this day
avoids the word ``Halloween'' in its ads for much of Florida _ you
guessed right, according to statistics provided by the Florida
Lottery and the state Department of Business and Professional
Regulation. (Date, Palm Beach Post). 20. WITH GRAPHIC.

   FLALOTTERY-HISPANICS _ TALLAHASSEE _ They know where you live.
They know how much Spanish language television you watch. They know
how much you spend on Lotto each week, and they think they have a
way to make you spend more. They are the Florida Lottery's Hispanic
marketing experts, and they've got your number. (Date, Palm Beach

   VECSEY-COLUMN (New York) _ Something has gone wrong. When we
used to talk about the National Basketball Association, we
discussed moves _ the agile, brazen creations of the giants who
roamed the earth. Now it is no longer about the game. Now it is
about the subtext, the potential gestures and snubs, who is dissing
whom. Now it is not about gymnastics and accuracy but rather about
personalities, a soap opera instead of the ballet. By George

<TEXT>
<P>
   As science over the years has vanquished some of the world's
most dreaded diseases, from diptheria to malaria and polio, the
credit has gone to scientists who wear white jackets and work in
laboratories filled with test-tubes and bubbling flasks.
</P>
<P>
   But as pharmaceutical researchers probe the genetic building
blocks of life to attack more complex illnesses, this expensive
``wet science,'' as it is known, is no longer where drug
discoveries initially are made.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of working at laboratory benches, many of today's
leading-edge researchers can be found hunched in front of computer
screens, manipulating multiple databases to analyze and visualize
biological and chemical and molecular information that could lead
to the the next generation of wonder drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of going out to a garage and setting up beakers and
petri dishes and looking at an experiment are long gone,'' said Dr.
Stephen Friend, president and chief scientist of Rosetta
Inpharmatics Inc. and a former associate professor of pediatric
medicine at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now teams of scientists work together using many different
databases to find key pieces of information with the `wet' science
becoming a member of the research team and together they solve
problems that can lead to new drug discoveries _ that's something
we did not see five to seven years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a shift from traditional patterns of pharmaceutical
research, much of this work, known as bioinformatics, is being done
at dozens of young companies like Rosetta, in such high-tech
centers as Cambridge, Mass., California's Silicon Valley and the
Seattle area. They see researchers treading water in
ever-increasing oceans of data looking for better and faster ways
to dive down and find the critical knowledge and easily display it
without drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a problem that scientists had in visually representing
hundreds of compounds, each with a host of different data elements
but without having to turn to heavy-duty statisticians,'' said
Christopher Ahlberg, founder and chief executive of Spotfire Inc.
The company, nearly three years old, has 40 employees in Cambridge
and 30 more researchers in Goteburg, Sweden, where it got its
start. ``Text-oriented computers cannot handle it, so you have to
develop a way of seeing all this information,'' Ahlberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlberg developed the idea for Spotfire while a doctoral student
at the University of Maryland's Human Computer Interaction
Laboratory. He targeted the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries as his customers, with solid results: 24 of the top 25
pharmaceutical companies, along with 50 biotech firms, use
Spotfire's Web-based software programs, paying between $100,000 and
$1 million for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   At Merck &AMP; Co., researchers use Spotfire software to access and
analyze information about relationships between chemical structures
and biological activity. The programs ``will help our project teams
make decisions faster to shorten the drug development cycle,'' said
Seth Pinsky, senior director of research information systems at
Merck.
</P>
<P>
   To help scientists ``see,'' or visualize, the compounds they are
working with, Spotfire software employs conceptual graphics.
</P>
<P>
   One application, for example, helps to sort out complexities of
molecular chemistry by placing different colored boxes on computer
monitor screens to represent 400 chemical compounds or proteins,
clustered based on their molecular weight. But when different
structural criteria are put into the program, as many as 350 of
these may disappear from the screen. Diagrams and graphs can be
called up to help uncover trends and anomalies within the data from
a multitude of different databases.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to identify early what experiments are likely to hit
a dead end. In ``wet'' laboratory science, much of this is achieved
by trial and error, with an enormous failure rate. Only one in 300
drugs that advance to clinical trials on humans ever win final
government approval. Hundreds more never even get to the trial
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Researchers working in teams need to understand and act on
more and more data types and see the failures early, because then
they can work with ones that work,'' Ahlberg said.
</P>
<P>
   His young company also mirrors the field of other bioinformatics
companies that are focused on related issues.
</P>
<P>
   With names like Molecular Applications Group, Pangea Systems,
Netgenics Inc., Informax Inc., Genomica Corp. and Rosetta, they
provide a range of search and retrieval software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that what once took us four years to carry out
from concept to the start of clinical trials is now done in two
years,'' said Victoria Sato, senior vice president of research at
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Cambridge, a major user of multiple
databases for drug design. ``For us, working with biology,
chemistry and genomic databases is one thing; extracting the
information you need is another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bioinformatics increasingly is viewed as the glue that will hold
the discovery of new drugs together, with its capabilities linked
closely to two other cutting-edge research techniques _
high-throughput screening, where 100,000 compounds can be tested
per day in the hopes of finding those that make effective drugs;
and combinatorial chemistry, where substances are collected and
analyzed for potential drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Frost &AMP; Sullivan, a New York market research company,
estimated US pharmaceutical companies spent $1.2 billion on
bioinformatics products _ and predicted that amount would double in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this growth is the development of programs that
enable researchers to ask many, sometimes open-ended questions
across multiple databases, said Friend, who is president of
Rosetta, based in Kirkland, Wash. This, he said, ``compares to just
five years ago when people created databases as a tool to ask just
one particular question.''
</P>
<P>
   Friend's five-year-old company, like Spotfire, is typical of
many bioinformatics companies, formed in the past three to seven
years with venture capital financing. Some have revenues of $5
million to $10 million, but few are profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Spotfire expects to have sales of $7 million this year, up from

   ``We are starting to look beyond medicine to other fields in
chemistry and material science, where there is a massive amount of
data and few ways of getting access to it to make critical
decisions, Ahlberg said. ``We've just begun.''

LAWYER RESCUES DEBTORS IN DISTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As consumers find themselves getting buried under an avalanche
of holiday credit-card debt, Andrew F. Capoccia sounds almost too
good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   A smooth-talking lawyer who rails with religious fervor about
the predatory practices of the nation's giant credit-card
companies, Capoccia promises to slash the debt of each client by 50
percent to 70 percent or more and help them steer clear of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy for his clients is as blunt as a bare knuckle: Stop
making even minimum payments to the credit-card giants, sue the
companies if they violate the law, and starve them into submission.
For his services, Capoccia takes a fee of 28 percent of whatever he
saves the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card companies are not known for rolling over, but many
have decided that it's smarter to settle for 30 cents to 50 cents
on the dollar rather than tangle endlessly with Capoccia or see the
debtor end up in bankruptcy with the entire debt wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, we're a consumer-protection firm that says
negotiate first and, if that doesn't work, file bankruptcy,'' said
the 57-year-old Capoccia. ``Before we came along, it was a
slam-dunk for the creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia's tactics are hardly novel, but he has taken them to
new heights. He estimates that he has saved his clients $21 million
so far this year, a figure that would net him nearly $5.9 million
in fees.
</P>
<P>
   In less than three years his business has grown from three
employees to 150, and now he is starting to expand outside his
Albany, N.Y., base. He opened a clinic last month in Cambridge,
Mass. and soon hopes to go national. If Congress approves a pending
bill that would make it more difficult to file for bankruptcy, his
business could explode. Capoccia is helped by the industry's
practice of sending out increasing numbers of card applications
each year _ a total of 3.5 billion in 1998, according to the
Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   But his success also has drawn controversy. Some debt
specialists question whether Capoccia's debt-reduction program is
in every client's best interest. Richard Hackel, a consumer
bankruptcy attorney from Boston, said the impact of Capoccia's
program on a customer's credit would not be that much different
from a bankruptcy, yet with a bankruptcy the consumer's entire
unsecured debt could be wiped out at less cost and under court
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement and judicial officials also are attacking his
tactics. New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued Capoccia last
month, charging him with deceptive advertising and making false
claims. Several New York judges have imposed sanctions on him
exceeding $1 million for filing what they consider frivolous
lawsuits. And the sanctions have spurred the Committee on
Professional Standards, New York's lawyer-disciplinary body, to
charge him with misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia is no stranger to the Committee on Professional
Standards. Twice before, while a divorce attorney and a personal
injury lawyer, he was suspended briefly from the practice of law.
The last time, in 1988, it was for depositing checks owed to a
client into his own escrow account. In 1989, Capoccia also was
warned to tone down his ads, which characterized him as a ``smart
tough lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia said there is no pattern of wrongdoing here. He said he
is at war now with the New York legal establishment because of his
crusade against credit-card companies. He has countersued Spitzer,
appealed the sanctions (pointing out that the judge who imposed the
heftiest fines formerly worked for a law firm specializing in debt
collection) and forced the disciplinary body to open its
proceedings to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that Capoccia is seen as a tremendous threat to
the way business has been conducted in New York,'' said his Boston
attorney, Harvey Silverglate.
</P>
<P>
   When a client signs on with Capoccia, the firm's first action is
to notify every creditor that the client is now represented by
counsel and that direct contact with the client is no longer
permitted. Capoccia urges clients to document any creditor contact
and sues the creditors if they violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia also demands a mountain of information from every
creditor and then combs through the documents looking for errors
that would invalidate some or all of the debt. Capoccia said he is
not trying to get his clients off on technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't write these laws,'' he said. ``We just use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical customer is someone with a job who is struggling to
make the minimum payments on anywhere from four to a dozen credit
cards. Capoccia's staff estimates how much the debt can be reduced
and the firm's fee, and then starts drawing from the client's bank
account on a monthly basis to raise the necessary funds. Then the
waiting game begins.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Scott of Buffalo, who works in the cardiac-care department
at a local hospital, said she was paying somewhere between $300 and
$400 a month and wasn't making a dent in her $7,000 debt. After
signing on with Capoccia in July 1998, she started to pay $209 a
month into an escrow fund.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen months later she settled with her creditors, paying
them a total of $2,279. She also paid Capoccia's firm a fee of
$1,192.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they said came true,'' she said. ``Now I feel free
in my own home. Before, I was a prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   David Smith of Delmar, N.Y., who got into financial trouble when
his wife quit her job as their son began kidney dialysis, said it
took him just over two years to complete the Capoccia program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think their debts will magically disappear, but
that's not reality,'' said Smith. ``It took years to create the
debt, and it's going to take some time to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Capoccia, creditors settle with him 90 percent of
the time. He even has lucrative standing settlement agreements with
some creditors. Collect America, a company that buys uncollected
debt from credit-card companies, has agreed to settle with Capoccia
for 50 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   On an annual basis, Collect America is handling about $2 million
in debt with Capoccia. That means Collect America takes in $1
million, Capoccia's customers save $1 million, and Capoccia gets
$280,000, or 28 percent of the savings, mostly for processing
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Klein, a consumer credit specialist with the National
Consumer Law Center in Boston, said Capoccia is filling a need.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of families out there who are
looking for help with their debts,'' he said. ``If he's able to get
good agreements, more power to him.''
</P>
<P>
   David Herwitz, a law professor at Harvard University who has
signed on as an ombudsman for Capoccia's firm, said he has had few
complaints to deal with so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have formed a favorable impression of him,'' said Herwitz.
``I think the courts in New York have gone mad with the sanctions
and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The drawback to Capaccio's approach is that, as consumers wait
for settlement agreements with their creditors, their credit
reports take a beating. They get hit with late fees, higher
interest rates, delinquencies, and court judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult way to go about it,'' said Debbie Eaton,
senior vice president at the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of
Southern New England, a program set up by credit-card companies to
help consumers shed their debt.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Fisher, of Solomon &AMP; Solomon in Albany, who represents
Citibank and other major credit-card companies, said Capoccia may
not fully inform clients that many companies won't settle on the
cheap and will pursue court judgments that can garnish wages and
place liens on homes.
</P>
<P>
   Capoccia, who noted that all of the risks are spelled out in the
legal representation agreements clients are required to sign, said
he is helping clients who want to avoid bankruptcy and attack their
debt head-on. He said credit-counseling services, such as Eaton's,
fail because they never attack the principal of a client's debt,
only the interest costs going forward.
</P>
<P>
   While Capoccia's clients may take a beating on their credit
report, there often is no permanent damage. Six Capoccia clients
interviewed by the Globe said their credit rating suffered in the
debt-reduction program, but that did not stop credit-card companies
from continuing to mail them preapproved credit-card applications,
convenience checks, or home-equity-loan applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sick part about all this,'' said Edward Ruede of
Albany. ``I've learned to live without credit cards. It's like
going cold turkey on heroin. But the companies keep pushing credit
at you.''

<P>
   If the world was going to end, thought Max, the best place to be
was in a traffic jam on U.S. 19, one of America's ugliest roads and
biggest parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more tourists and ``snowbirds'' flocked to West
Florida, the development and traffic clotted Route 19 to the point
of arteriosclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a good day to die,'' said Max to his Mustang,
quoting an old Native-American saying, and looking north toward
Clearwater and an endless line of traffic. Apocalypse today might
be considered a form of euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   For the next half hour he inched by one strip shopping mall
after another, their stores offering everything from lawn furniture
to used cars to fast foods to lingerie modeling. Finally, he came
upon the landmark he was looking for, a large billboard inviting
one to stop in for a ``Quick Lube.''
</P>
<P>
   Max pulled the Mustang, its temperature gauge pointing toward
hot, into a big lot and parked it under a shady tree and pulled up
the top to avoid bird bombing runs. He had come here to meet Father
Ralph Rizzo and to sort out the things he had seen and heard at The
Watchers' initiation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   He could not erase from his mind the image of Angela Powers,
naked as a newborn, shimmering wet in the moonlight. He told
himself that his thoughts about her were not lustful, that they
aroused in him a different kind of yearning, a fatherly desire to
save a lost daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph stood in the parking lot wearing sandals, khaki
shorts, a Hawaiian shirt, and a Yankees cap. As Max approached him,
Ralph swept his hand and pointed dramatically: ``Behold. There she
is. Our Lady of Clearwater. The Rainbow Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   It clicked now in Max's mind. He looked up to see on the glass
panels of a bank building the most remarkable image _ a
multicolored pattern of wavy bands that formed the familiar cloaked
outline of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Max remembered reading about
it. How a palm tree had been removed. How water from the sprinkler
system had washed upon the glass. How chemicals had bonded to form
this startling icon of red, blue, gold and violet. How this was now
a destination for pilgrims and preachers and miracle seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Max noticed about 100 votive candles before the image, along
with dozens of handwritten messages tacked to the fence. ``Dear
Mother of God. I am only 10 years old. My dad is sick and doesn't
have any money. Please help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph told Max that he came here once in a while to collect
messages, to greet pilgrims, and to minister to those seeking help.
He often directed them to food banks, or hospices, or AIDS clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two stories from the Gospel that always impressed
me,'' said Ralph, leading Max to a white plastic bench under a
tree. ``The first one is about this sick lady who figures that if
she can just touch the hem of His garment, she would be healed. It
says that Jesus felt the power going out of Him. In another town,
Jesus can't perform any miracles because the people there had no
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get it,'' said Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think God reached down from the sky and with some big
magic marker drew a picture of Mary on that glass? No. I think the
sprinkler system did that. The power is not in that image, but in
the faith of that 10-year-old boy who wants to help his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But people can believe in the wrong thing. The Nazis had faith
in Hitler. The Watchers have faith in Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does that name sound familiar to me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking about him for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the first time I've focused on his name. Is this
the guy you saw on the boat _ with that beautiful girl?'' Max
nodded. ``Do you think Glaber has the hots for her?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a funny expression for a priest to use, and it evoked
from Max a muffled laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph turned professorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing in The Watchers turns out to be a very old
story, Max. Social movements inspired by the millennium take many
shapes, but they always have two distinct features _ it's been that
way since the Middle Ages. I taught this stuff for years. First,
you need an alienated, disenfranchised, impoverished group _ in the
Dark Ages it was the peasants. And then you need a charismatic
leader who is self-important and usually a little loony. This Raoul
Glaber has obviously targeted the dispossessed young for
indoctrination. And he holds himself up as a kind of savior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazed me, Ralph, is that I know this guy's a jerk, but
he makes a kind of perverse sense. It's hard to deny that we've
sort of screwed over a generation of young people. And we've
committed such atrocities over this century, some in the name of
religion. Maybe we've lost the chance to be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull----,'' said Ralph. ``There are only three kinds of people
in the world. The ones like Glaber who look at things and see the
end. The ones, like that 10-year-old boy, who have hope even in the
dark days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the third kind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like you, Max, who can't make up your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How could a just and merciful God allow something like the
Holocaust to happen? I'm not trying to be disrespectful, Ralph. I'm
just trying to get inside Glaber's head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the oldest trap in the world, Max. It's shows that, deep
down, you're a believer. If you believe only in chaos or accident
or biology, then you can account for someone like Hitler _ a crazy
person in a crazy world. If you believe in God, you've got some
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you're not supposed to understand. Maybe you're just
supposed to act. To investigate this Glaber guy. And write a great
story. And save the life of that beautiful young woman. Maybe
that's the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here for a counseling session, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you come here for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to learn more about this millennium stuff. We may be
entering a new era, but I think I'm beyond the kind of rejuvenation
you're preaching, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You once had so much energy and passion. I admired that in
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've collected too many barnacles, Ralph, even for a good hull
scraper like you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't you ever seen a piece of driftwood polished into
something glorious? Maybe God ain't done with you yet, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph got up from his seat to greet a tall, thin man with long,
unkempt hair, and a scraggly beard that flowed to his breastbone.
His face was gaunt, and Max could see that his belongings were
piled nearby in a grocery cart.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph, a foot shorter than this man, locked him in a bear hug
and dragged the man by the arm into the shade of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max,'' he said, ``I want you to meet Louis. He's a friend of
mine.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max meets up with Father Ralph and questions
the priest about the millennium, but Ralph dispels a doomsday
attitude with acts of kindness.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   As Max cruised down Gulf Boulevard through Madeira Beach and
toward Treasure Island, he glanced down and noticed the odometer
had, some miles ago, crossed the 99,000-mile barrier. He reached
out and patted the dashboard of the old Mustang as if he were
stroking a pony's mane.
</P>
<P>
   Although exhausted from his encounter with Father Ralph, Max
decided to keep another appointment he had made for that afternoon.
He turned toward the beach and stopped at a lovely house with
weathered shingles and a xeriscaped yard. Dr. Evelyn Hamilton lived
here, a retired veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Max had read in the Florida Sun that this kind woman had adopted
Daisy, the Rottweiler who survived a fall from the Skyway Bridge.
Daisy's former owner, quite deranged, had tossed her over on his
own journey toward the big deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me Evie,'' she insisted and extended her hand. She was a
lovely woman with dark eyes and silver hair who had been chosen
from among more than 100 suitors to take care of Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always tell how a person will treat people by how they
treat animals,'' she said. Daisy was doing fine, except for the
slightest limp, the effects of neurological damage to one of her
paws.
</P>
<P>
   Max lowered himself to one knee, reached into a bag and took out
a handful of gourmet doggie yummies. Daisy devoured these and
nuzzled Max's hand for more. The next half hour was spent on the
rug with generous amounts of ear rubbing, back scratching and
slobbery kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Evie told Max he could visit any time. He congratulated her on
her fine work and said he'd like to write Daisy's story some day.
He waved from his Mustang _ the top was down _ and drove happily
down the beach until his thoughts turned to the young man who had
ended his own life and wanted to take his dog with him.
</P>
<P>
   What had she done for him but be a faithful companion even into
the abyss? Did he think he needed her in the afterlife like some
Egyptian pharaoh? Could he not stand the thought of someone else
taking care of her? Maybe God watched over the sparrows and the
Rottweilers, the lilies of the field and the Daisies. Maybe that
cagey Father Ralph was getting to him.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the road, Max heard an amusing story on National Public
Radio. A man entered a betting emporium in London, where they'll
lay odds on almost anything: ``What are the chances my 5-year-old
son will grow up to play for England in the World Cup?'' A 100,000
to 1, minimum bet 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But one man wanted to bet 1,000 pounds that the world would end
on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' explained the manager, ``we can't take a bet where we
couldn't pay the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The bettor looked puzzled. ``If the world did end, how would we
pay you?''
</P>
<P>
   That bit of British honesty _ along with his visit to Daisy _
lifted Max's spirits, a feeling that intensified when he thought
again of Angela Powers, a young girl so beautiful and strong, whose
physical presence projected a sense of purity and purpose
inconsistent with her attachment to Raoul Glaber and The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   As he made his final turn toward Land's End, his thoughts moved
to Kate Banks. He needed to see her again to report on all he had
learned about the Watchers and _ more urgently _ to test whether
there was anything between them.
</P>
<P>
   Max clicked the radio to a music station, only to hear Michael
Bolton's overwrought version of ``When a Man Loves a Woman.'' He
took it as a bad sign. He changed stations and a true miracle
occurred: It was Percy Sledge's original version of the same song.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, he pressed his foot on the accelerator and, in the
three minutes it took to finish the song, he looked in his rearview
mirror to see the lights of a police car. He pulled over and a
tall, imposing officer with ebony skin approached the Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry if I was speeding, officer, I ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to worry about that, Mr. Timlin. You are Max Timlin. Or
have you just stolen his car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm him. I mean he.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, sir, could you follow me?''
</P>
<P>
   More curious than fearful, Max followed the police car for about
a mile, then turned down a side street in front of a tiny
restaurant called Red Beans. The officer held the front door open
without a smile and Max walked in, his eyes adjusting to the
darkness. Finally, at an isolated corner table he saw a familiar
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, my man, what the hell are you doin' muckin' around with
The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   The question was so direct and had such conviction behind it, it
caught Max off guard. He decided on a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the hell do you know that, Sam? You been followin' me?''
</P>
<P>
   Sam was Samson Lockhart, one of the top cops in the state of
Florida. Max had written a long profile of Lockhart, who had
arrived in St. Pete from New Orleans, La., to become its first
African-American chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was the son and grandson of police officers, and had
been credited with easing tensions between the police and the black
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to follow you, little brother. We been watchin'
the Watchers. Special investigative unit. We've got you on tape in
Ybor City when those kids knocked over the Jesus guy, and we got
you during the latest initiation ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart let out a big laugh. He was almost 6-foot-5, and the
laugh echoed through the empty restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funniest thing I ever seen. You looked like a candy-ass
dressed in that biker stuff. But the lady you were with looked
mighty fine. Who was that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman named Sherry ... '' Max regretted it as soon as the
name left his lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherry Darling? So you workin' for the Florida Sun now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly, I ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you not exactly work for a newspaper? Do you hear
that?'' he turned to the other officer, ``He doesn't exactly work
for the Sun. Well, who the hell are you workin' with, then? I know
you ain't datin' Sherry Darling because she's a bright and talented
woman who wouldn't be seen dead with a burnt out old dog like
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Max couldn't bring himself to laugh under this harangue though
he wanted to. ``Sam, I can't tell you any ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, why don't you call me Chief Lockhart, just for today,
just so I know you're payin' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir, Chief Lockhart, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You still drivin' that old piece of junk? When you gonna get
yourself a proper car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What does this have to do with The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well if you're gonna catch Raoul Glaber and those pretty blond
boys he hangs with, you're gonna need a car that goes more than 45
miles per hour and gets better than eight miles to the gallon.''
</P>
<P>
   `You know the kind of car Glaber drives?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what kind of toothpaste he uses, but we ain't gonna
tell you unless you start tellin' us some things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, Sam, I mean Chief Lockhart, that I'm working
as a journalist. It's not some personal thing. But I can't tell you
who hired me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to tell me. It's Miss Kate Banks, another fine
woman who should know better than to have anything to do with the
likes of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want from me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothin' much. I just want you to go to the Conquistador Hotel,
go into that lion's den, and interview Raoul Glaber, the Number 1
Big Daddy Watcher himself.''

<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max meets up with Daisy, the dog that survived
a fall from the Skyway Bridge, and then is summoned to a meeting
with Sam Lockhart, chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to do what?'' Max Timlin squinted his eyes and
scratched what was left of his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to screw your courage to the sticking post,'' Sam
Lockhart, police chief, reciting this line in a mock Shakespearean
accent as if rehearsing for a Mel Brooks production of Othello,
``and I want you to go in amongst the Watchers and interview Raoul
Glaber, their king.'' He bowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you just send your best detectives in there? Or why
not just bring him in?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's much too dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Max looked at him, his eyes now wide in disbelief. ``He's too
dangerous for the cops, so you want me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam relaxed his demeanor and pointed to the chair across from
him. He called to someone in the kitchen and began ordering Cajun
food, large steaming bowls of it: red beans and rice, andouille
sausage, shrimp jambalaya, crawfish etouffe, blackened grouper, all
washed down with sweet iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   The talking and the eating took almost two hours. Some of Max's
favorite music played in the background: Fats Domino, Professor
Longhair, Dr. John, the Neville Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to the sweet voice of Aaron Neville, Max, you've just
got to `Tell it like it is....' You're a macho newspaper man,''
said Sam, pushing back from the table. ``You'll get a big story out
of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't cut deals with cops,'' said Max, eating a bite of
bread pudding soaked in rum. ``And I don't do their work for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't like reporters,'' said Sam, ``but we've got
something important here, and I'm willing to dispense with some of
the old rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a huge file on our ongoing investigation of The
Watchers. It goes back more than a year. And I'll open it just for
you. It's got loads of stuff in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what do I have to do in return?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just be yourself. Go in and ask for an interview. Get as close
as you can, which will not be easy. Light a little fire under him
and see if he jumps. Just be your old, stank reporter self. And
then just answer a few of our questions about what you saw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get no access to my notes. I tell you whatever I want to
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I get to see the file anytime I want to from now until the
Second Coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a good man, Max Timlin, and deserve a fine cup of
chicory coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Max debated the big cop's proposal with himself for two days
before meeting up with his editor.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks showed up at the condo on Saturday evening, just in
time to enjoy a bright-orange sunset, which she and Max watched
from the balcony while sipping Heineken from bottles and nibbling
on slices of Sicilian pizza. They fought over the crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought you a present,'' said Kate, reaching into her purse.
``Call it a bonus for your good work so far.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a video copy of ``Goldfinger,'' which Max had told her
was one of his favorite movies. He peeled off the plastic wrapper,
popped it into the VCR, and curled up on the couch to watch it.
About 90 minutes and two beers later, by the time James Bond is
rolling in the hay with Pussy Galore, Kate had kicked off her
sandals, pulled up her knees, and rested her head against Max's
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the coolest thing,'' Max clapped his hands in delight
as Bond defeated Odd Job, and the counter on the nuclear device
stopped at exactly 007. ``Fort Knox and the economies of the Free
World _ saved!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldfinger was not your average terrorist,'' said Kate. ``I
wonder what Bond would do if he encountered Raoul Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably go right into the lion's den.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same phrase that Sam Lockhart had used, and it gave
Max a moment's pause. He had told her over the phone the details of
the plan, and she now approved, ``As long as you report to me first
_ before you talk with the cops.''
</P>
<P>
   She opened a folder filled with photos, the ones Sherry Darling
had shot at the initiation ceremony. They were splendid. The
cigarette boat in the moonlight, with the Skyway Bridge as a frame.
The initiates lined up on the beach. Raoul Glaber waving from the
boat. And Angela Powers, like a postmodern Venus, rising from the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume you'll want to keep this one for your private
collection,'' said Kate.
</P>
<P>
   Max raised his hand in honest protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but she's
young enough to be my daughter. Father Ralph thinks I've been put
on this earth to save her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' said Kate, and looked into his eyes earnestly.
``Thank you, Max. You're one of the good guys.'' And with that she
kissed him, first lightly on the cheek, and then lightly on the
lips. And again. He kissed her back, very softly, like a beginner,
then more firmly, and then, as if a door had finally opened, with
passion.
</P>
<P>
   He took in the warmth of her breath, the smell of her hair, and
the wonderful feel of a strong woman's body pressed against his.
They kissed nonstop for what might have been 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang. It was on the near table, and it startled them
both, so that they separated, looked at each other and laughed.
Kate picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, hello, Father Ralph. Yes, this is Kate Banks. Yes, Max is
here. We were just watching a movie.'' Kate winked at Max, who took
the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, tell me again, the name of this Watcher guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest's voice was loud and excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raoul. Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spell it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``R-a-o-u-l G-l-a-b-e-r.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've got two pieces of news for you, buddy boy. First,
that's not his real name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the second piece?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in more trouble than we thought.''

<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Police Chief Sam Lockhart persuades Max Timlin
to infiltrate The Watcher headquarters and obtain an interview with
the secretive Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   It took Max Timlin three full days in the musty old library of
St. Pius College, north of Tampa, to make sense of Father Ralph's
revelations: Raoul Glaber was not the real name of the leader of
The Watchers. Max wasn't as convinced as Ralph that this was true,
but he devoured the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He began by reading the Book of Revelation, sometimes known as
the Book of the Apocalypse. He always thought the word
``apocalypse'' meant some great final cataclysm, as in the movie
``Apocalypse Now.'' But it was actually the Greek word for
``revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Father Ralph's tutelage, Max came to realize that the
revelations of the last book of the Christian scriptures are
shrouded in mysterious and symbolic language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if the Apostle John was dropping acid with Picasso,''
said Max, irreverently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dreamlike visions of this book have left so much open to
interpretation that any tinhorn prophet can use it to predict just
about anything,'' explained Ralph. ``One thing we know for sure,
that for at least a thousand years, people who look at their own
times, and see dark things, return to this book as a kind of
mystical map.''
</P>
<P>
   Max pored over the text and some commentaries on it. In one
tradition, he learned, Christ would return to rule over the Earth
for 1,000 years. The Latin word for this was ``millennium.'' The
story of this return contains several subplots, including the
appearance of false prophets and antichrists, a time when Satan
would rule, a great battle between God and his enemies, and the
Last Judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great problem,'' explained Ralph, looking at Max over his
reading glasses, ``was how to calculate the time when Jesus would
return. There's evidence in the Gospels that the disciples thought
it would happen right away _ perhaps in their lifetime. But when it
didn't happen, it opened the door for people to reinterpret the
Scriptures for their own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Max learned that the historical Jesus was actually born between
6 and 4 B.C. _ the first calendar makers goofed _ which means that
even if you were thinking about an era of 1,000 years, what would
be the starting point? The moment Christ was conceived? His birth?
His death and resurrection?
</P>
<P>
   Max read a gospel passage in which Jesus describes a time of
judgment when ``the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not
give her light, and the stars will fall from heavens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' said Max to Ralph, ``Jesus said that `this generation
will not pass away till all these things have been accomplished.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But listen to this next part,'' said Ralph pointing down the
page and reading aloud: ```But of that day and hour no one knows,
not even the angels of heaven.' Jesus is urging his followers not
to calculate the precise time, but to do good all the time, to be
prepared for their own deaths and the end of the world, which would
sneak up on them, `like a thief in the night.'''
</P>
<P>
   That led Max and Ralph to a discussion of the year 1000, the
only historical precedent for what the world was about to
experience. Ralph stood on tiptoes and pulled a thin volume off a
high shelf. ``This is the smoking gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The innocent book was called ``The Year 1000,'' written by a
French art historian named Henri Focillon. The text tried to settle
an ancient intellectual argument: Was there any hard evidence that
people living in 10th century Europe were obsessed by the terrors
of the last days? Did they think they were living in a time when
the end of the world was at hand?
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer was no. The historical records and artifacts
do not reveal a population in panic. Early in the next century,
after the millennium had passed, there was an intense period of
church building.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might suggest,'' said Ralph, ``that some people were
holding their breath, waiting a bit before undertaking any big
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were some notable exceptions, some 10th century
``lunatics,'' as Ralph called them, who were prophets of doom, who
saw signs of the last days everywhere. The most notable of these
was a radical French monk. ``His name was Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber wrote of a great meteor or comet he saw in the night sky
in the year 1000: ``It appeared in the month of September, not long
after nightfall, and remained visible for nearly three months. It
shone so brightly that its light seemed to fill the greater part of
the sky, then it vanished at cock's crow. What appears established
is that this phenomenon in the sky never appears to men without
being the sure sign of some mysterious and terrible event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Glaber saw Halley's comet?'' asked Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Focus on the more important point, Max. We're not talking
ancient superstitions here. Remember what the Heaven's Gate cult
did upon the appearance of the Hale-Bopp comet. They followed to
the death a wacky old guy, who apparently had himself castrated,
who told these bright young people _ they were computer experts,
for God sakes, they had their own Web site! _ that there was a
spaceship waiting for them behind the comet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All they had to do to get there was to put plastic bags over
their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Read this,'' said Ralph and pointed to a passage in the text.
It said that the old French monk saw Satan everywhere, including
right beside his pillow, and that Satan was a ``small black monster
of human shape,'' and that ``Satan will soon be unleashed because
the thousand years have been completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Max leaned toward Ralph and whispered: ``Isn't it possible that
Glaber's daddy just named him Raoul?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what? That just by coincidence he turned into Doomsday
Dick? Have you been able to track back on this guy? Do you know his
family's history?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a researcher at the Sun working full blast on it. So
far there's just a black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tell you, Max, this guy, whoever he is, adopted the name
of a man who, 1,000 years ago, was trying to scare people to death.
And I predict that this guy will do the same. Unless we stop him.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: What Father Ralph teaches Max about the Year
1000 leads Max to a startling conclusion: that Raoul Glaber is not
the real name of The Watcher leader.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   From a distance the Conquistador Hotel looked like a friendly
old soul, a small but elegant pink lady, born in the roaring 20s,
and preserved with several discreet face lifts. For 150 bucks,
tourists could buy the right to lay themselves out in the sun and
burn to a crisp _ ensuring, if they lived long enough, skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of Max's Mustang, driving through
Gulfport toward the beach, it was hard to imagine anything more
malevolent happening here than, say, a post-prom booze party or
your standard adulterous affair. Even the president of the United
States once spent the night here. ``It sure is pink,'' he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But as Max drove closer and closer, the look of the place got
weirder and weirder. An attendant dressed in white stopped him at
the front gate and with friendly insistence pressed Max to learn
the nature of his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a guest at the hotel, Mr. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Timlin. No, but I've heard this was a special place, so I
thought I'd take a look for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man, he looked bleached blond, took Max's license and
recorded his tag number, slid a pass onto his dashboard, and
pointed to a place in the shade where he could park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy the day, sir, and don't forget to stop into the Globe
Room. You'll enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Max saw lots of tourists, and a few Watcher acolytes dressed in
black, and many more initiates in blazing white regalia.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was warm, Max dressed in black for dramatic effect. As
he walked around he got the impression of a gilded cage, a
too-perfect community in which everything was Watched. It reminded
him of the resort in Wales that became the set of the 1960s British
TV series ``The Prisoner.'' He started whistling the theme song,
``All You Need Is Love.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent about two hours scouting the place, its little
restaurants, shops, tennis courts, boardwalk, cabanas, and down one
end a dock for boats. He could see Glaber's cigarette boat in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, behind the dunes, he could see a large round white mark
along the beach with concentric circles _ like a target _ or
perhaps a landing pad for hang gliders or even a small helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   What interested Max most was the absence of Watcher insignias or
other public displays that might indicate who owned the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He took an elevator to the fifth floor, which opened to a
mahogany reception desk behind which sat an attractive young woman
dressed in a handsome white suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in white and I'm in black,'' said Max, still wearing
his sunglasses. She smiled at him blankly. ``The prince of parking
told me I should check out the Globe Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please sign in here, sir, and then take those steps to the
right.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed her directions and stepped into a remarkable
setting. The room was the world, or to be more precise, a globe.
Inside, Max could see a map of the world rendered in magnificent
stained glass, lit from behind. You could only move across the room
on a thin walkway which served as the sphere's diameter.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to a spot that marked the center of the Earth. A
recorded voice came on. It was Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand beside you, watching our magnificent world. But what
shall become of it?'' What followed was five minutes of standard
Watcher fare _ apocalyptic doom softened by New Age mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up and noticed a security video camera. He smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can turn back and walk out the way you came in,'' said
Glaber's soothing voice, ``or you can move forward beyond this
great world to something ever more glorious.''
</P>
<P>
   Max shrugged and walked 10 steps toward the door beyond him. It
opened automatically. The hall beyond had a great W on the wall.
This was The Watcher sanctum, busy with Watcher workers in white,
moving in and out of offices, or stretched out before banks of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Max was approached by a handsome black woman with her short hair
dyed blond. ``Dennis Rodman's sister,'' he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to The Watchers, sir. I'm Denise and you're ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Timlin. Max Timlin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, Max. I'm here to watch over you so you can learn more
about The Watchers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'd like that. I'm a reporter and would like to interview
Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   Her expression darkened. ``Wait right here, sir. Don't move.''
She ran off.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 seconds, Max was surround by burly blond attendants;
they resembled personal trainers in dress and physique, but Max
guessed they constituted the palace guard.
</P>
<P>
   An older man, his head shaved bald, approached him. ``I
understand you are a reporter, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct. I'm a free-lance writer and I'd like to
interview Mr. Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves to be a very open organization. We
conduct much of our business in public.'' Max pulled out his
notebook and began scribbling. ``I'm afraid I'm going to have to
ask you to put that away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure. I'm not here to make a scene. I'm Max Timlin. And
your name sir is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not required to give you my name, sir, but it's Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``May I write that down?''
</P>
<P>
   Monty shook his head sternly. ``Mr. Timlin, have you read
stories in the press about The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, of course, I've been doing research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen a story about us that didn't portray us as some
kind of kooky cult? We've been so badly used, we've had to ban
reporters from our premises. I'll give you all the literature
you'll need to understand who we are and what we stand ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, Mr. Full Monty, I don't take handouts from flacks, and
I'm not intimidated by blond Nazi boys dressed like ice-cream
vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to flex as one, but Monty held up a hand to restrain
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't I have you escorted from the premises _ and
roughly?''
</P>
<P>
   Max reached in his pocket and pulled out an index card and
clicked his pen and scribbled two quick sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's why. Be so kind as to show this to Mr. Glaber. I'll
wait here with your goons.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty took the card, read it, his face flushing with anger.
``Watch him,'' he said, and spun away. Max put his shades back on,
crossed his arms, and smiled.

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin is hired by editor Kate
Banks to investigate a doomsday cult called The Watchers and their
leader, Raoul Glaber. Max witnesses a Watcher initiation rite and
hears Glaber's dark view of the world and its future. Max seeks the
counsel of Father Ralph who becomes suspicious that Glaber is not
who he says he is. Police Chief Sam Lockhart persuades Max to enter
The Watcher's inner sanctum.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max's adrenaline had kicked in now, and his heart raced as he
was escorted through a glass automatic door, down a narrow hallway
and through two heavy wooden doors. A burly, grimacing attendant
pointed him through.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up to see Raoul Glaber wearing a red University of
Alabama T-shirt, sitting at the far side of a round table and
holding Max's index card in one hand and flipping it with the
middle finger of his other.
</P>
<P>
   I KNOW YOUR NAME IS NOT RAOUL GLABER!
</P>
<P>
   SURRENDER DOROTHY.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very amusing, Mr. Timlin. That's an interesting name, Max
Timlin. Just add a few letters and you could become Maximum
Timeline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You seem fascinated with names, Mr. Glaber, and with time. Or
shall I call you by your real name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know my real name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, no. But I do know that Raoul Glaber was a
10th-century French monk who saw Satan standing by his pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be so harsh on visionaries, sir. I believe in Satan _
how can you look at the world and not _ but I don't see him as an
ugly little gremlin. I think that he takes a much more reassuring
human form, like yours, for instance, ... or mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your real name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please call me William, if you like, William Miller. How's
that for a classic American name. Don't you love those double l's
in the middle? Almost like the Latin word for one thousand: mille.
I love beautiful and interesting names. But I've told you that.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached for a button near his chair. Max flinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, not to worry, sir, there is no shark pool under your
feet.'' A side door opened. Max was not prepared for the sight of
Angela Powers (though he had her in mind when he wrote ```Surrender
Dorothy'').
</P>
<P>
   She, too, was dressed in red: tank top, soccer shorts, and
thongs. She padded gracefully into the room, holding a tray with
glasses of cold iced tea and some ginger snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Timlin. This is Angela Powers, but I assume you already
know that. Isn't that a wondrous name _ the power of angels _ she
is my helper and my archangel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure to meet you _ please, help yourself,'' said
Angela to Max. ``Aren't you broiling in that black suit? You look
like one of the Blues Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber or Miller or Whoever came around the big table and took a
seat with Max and Angela near a window overlooking the water.
</P>
<P>
   Glaber took some hard swallows of tea. ``I like it Southern
style,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you not from the South?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' some impatience passed through the charm. ``I'm from the
West. And I don't talk to the press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And why not? Some publicity might gain you more followers.
Isn't it natural that, given your message, people would turn their
interest toward you as we approach the millennium?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, come now, Mr. Timlin,'' the voice came from Angela Powers.
It was deep for a young woman, and filled with character and
intelligence. ``The interest of the press is not in informing or
enlightening, no matter what you say. It is to appeal to the
largest and the lowest audience. Is any other institution more
responsible for the decline in standards, for cynicism about the
country, for spreading hopelessness, for fear of crime, for a
picture of the world that debases anything noble?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, Ms. Powers, don't The Watchers espouse a philosophy that
is the ultimate pessimism, that the world as we know it will
disappear?''
</P>
<P>
   ``God is no magician, Mr. Timlin. He's not into vanishing acts.
We see the world as it is. You see it as better than it is _ and
then portray it as worse than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You fascinate me, Ms. Powers.'' Max was sweating profusely.
Why had he worn this darn black suit? And why did he choose a chair
in the direct sunlight? He finished his tea, and held the frosty
glass to his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a good writer, Mr. Timlin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if you listen to my old editors. But I am fast. I think
for reporters fast is better than good. Are you a writer, Ms.
Powers? You are very well spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber smiled at the compliment to Angela like a proud parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about becoming a writer, but I saw what it did to my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mother's a writer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was. But she's an editor now. Mr. Timlin, are you all
right? You look a little pale. Can I get you some more tea?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ... mother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, perhaps you know her. Her name is Kate Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have been this revelation that unsettled him because the
image of her, the beautiful image, suddenly went out of focus.
There were two magnificent angels in red _ no there were three, and
then someone must have turned the lights out, or closed the blinds,
because wasn't it just daylight _ a moment ago _ or maybe an
eclipse of the sun _ or maybe this room was a revolving bar at
night _ spinning, darker and ... darker.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max meets Raoul Glaber and the beautiful
Angela Powers, but a sweet glass of ice tea and a startling
revelation render him unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there had been an eclipse, or maybe Max had fallen asleep,
because when he awoke the sky was still dark, but now a light rain
splattered across his face. He wiped it with his hand and clumsily
sat up.
</P>
<P>
   He looked around to get his bearings and found himself in the
back seat of his Mustang with the top down, and yes it was raining
and his head hurt and his leg hurt, too.
</P>
<P>
   This must be what a migraine felt like: a pain both dull and
sharp, pressing a thousand pounds against the side of his skull.
But he had never had a migraine before.
</P>
<P>
   His memory came back slowly now and then snapped into focus: the
visit to the pink hotel, the incursion into enemy territory, a cool
drink with Raoul Glaber and Angela Powers. The drink.
</P>
<P>
   He had been drugged, carted to his car, driven to an empty spot
on Cosmos Key, and left there for how long? Hours? His face felt
sunburned. This was the punishment for his arrogance. But at least
he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at the dashboard. ``They left the keys,'' he said
aloud to no one. ``My head hurts! And my leg!''
</P>
<P>
   Max drove slowly back to the condo, gripping the wheel and
blinking his eyes. He let himself in, clicked on the lights, and
looked around suspiciously. He blamed himself for letting down his
guard against Glaber _ not Glaber, but William Miller _ and what
had Angela Powers said to him, just before the eclipse? Now he
remembered. He picked up the phone and dialed the home number of
his researcher, Violet Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet, this is Max.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What time Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, Violet, it's 1 a.m. I've had a bad day. Violet, I
talked to Glaber today. Got him to admit his real name was William
Miller. But I don't believe it. Look up that name. Check not only
personal and legal stuff _ it's a common name _ but look at
historical references _ check the damn World Book Encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, you woke me up to tell me to look something up in the
encyclopedia?'' She was groggy, but laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick with me, Violet. He named himself after one doomsday
guy. Let's see if he picked another. One more thing. Do you know
much about Kate Banks? I mean her personal life?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this about, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick with me, Violet. Does she have a daughter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, one daughter. Cassandra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is her middle name Angela?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate Banks was married, right. Her husband died. What was his
name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, I think, Michael Powers. Max, are you all right?
Please. Do you want me to come over?''
</P>
<P>
   Her concern made Max feel guilty that he had awakened her. There
was something special about her, he had discovered. He had met
highly intelligent people before. And compassionate ones. But never
in quite the combination that Violet offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A megabyte mind,'' Kate had said of her, ``and a heart of
gold.'' Sherry offered her own appreciation of Violet's character:
``She's got the hardware and the software.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, are you hurt? I'll come over if you need me to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Violet. You are a kind person. I'm sorry I woke you
up. It could have waited until tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me what happened, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. Detail by detail in chronological order. It helped
him clear his memory, make sense of the day, and rehearse the long
memo he would write to himself tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, and one more thing, Violet. He says he's from the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``William Miller. From the West. Well that narrows it down.''
Max found Violet's laugh comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Max hung up. He stripped quickly, leaving his clothes in a pile
on the tile floor. He turned on the water in the shower until it
steamed up the room. The water hit his face _ he was sunburned _
just what a guy with skin cancer needed. But in a minute it felt
great, down into his muscles to the bone, steaming the pain and
poison from his body.
</P>
<P>
   Max turned to let the water hit his back. He let out a howl. As
the water sprayed the top of his leg, it stung like a horde of red
ants. ``What the ...?''
</P>
<P>
   He turned off the shower and stepped out onto the floor. A
full-length mirror on the back of the door was steamed up. He wiped
his hand across it and turned his body. And there it was. On his
right hip. A tattoo. The letter ``W.'' Sign of The Watchers.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max regains consciousness and makes his way
home, struggling with the idea that Angela Powers is really the
daughter of Kate Banks.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Sam Lockhart, police chief, had seen a lot in his day, but
nothing quite like this. A man stood in front of his desk, his
pants around his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my reward for doing your dirty work,'' said Max
Timlin. ``The letter `W' tattooed on my rear end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be laughing if it weren't for this.'' Sam slid an
investigative file across his desk. It contained autopsy photos,
and they were gruesome _ a young man and woman so broken apart they
look like they had imploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens after you've jumped off the Skyway
Bridge, and flown like a birdie 200 feet or so, and hit the water,
which is like concrete from that height. They were probably in the
water for a couple of days before they washed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you know about them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``White male and female. Probably a suicide pact. Drugs in the
system. Speed _ the kind of stuff that makes you aggressive and
paranoid. And check out this little detail.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief slid another photo across the desk. A close up showed
that each victim had the letter ``W'' tattooed above an ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to hate the look of that tattoo, so what say,
when this is over, the department springs to laser your sorry ass
and remove that nasty thing and all that it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think it stands for, Sam?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe nothin' but a bunch of folks who like to dress up in
white for a New Year's Eve party. But my responsibility is to be
suspicious and stay that way. I don't know what Glaber is watchin'
for _ but I'm watchin' him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is he capable of? That's what I can't figure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just assume he could blow up a federal building, or burn
down his hotel with everyone in it, or hold a big party at the Dome
and make everyone drink poisoned lemonade, or that he might blow up
a 747, or car-bomb an embassy in Africa. Now that the Commies are
all gone, these nuts are turning their anger against their own
countries _ even their own people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember how I thought the Oklahoma City bombing was caused
by terrorists from the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And, surprise, it turned to be some pasty lookin' white boy
with a grudge against his own country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But how vulnerable are we here? We're just a quiet little city
in West Florida. The land of snowbirds and retirees and tourists.
The city of the newly wed and nearly dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got no imagination, Max. You want doomsday scenarios.
They could poison the water supply. Or hijack nerve gas or
biological weapons. They could sabotage our Air Force base _ which
would appeal to fellow terrorists around the globe since we have a
special strike force stationed in Tampa. On any given day, how many
people are in one of our amusement parks? What's the Big Mouse
gonna do, let Goofy carry an Uzi?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I write this story _ if I write it _ I'm gonna put all
that stuff in it _ make you sound a lot smarter than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean if you write it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I may not have a job after I tell my boss what I think of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Max drove now as fast as the Mustang would carry him across town
to the offices of the Florida Sun, a 10-story marble tower
overlooking Tampa Bay, housing Florida's best and biggest
newspaper. Max had always wanted to work there. And now he did _
sort of.
</P>
<P>
   He strode briskly through the lobby and right past the security
guard, who was looking down reading the paper, and into the
elevator. A large woman eating a doughnut told him Kate Banks'
office was on the ninth floor. He walked in through a cluster of
secretaries, ignored their questions, and strode into Kate's
office. She looked up from her desk and sensed right away that Max
had learned the truth. In fact, she had hoped he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela Powers is not her real name,'' said Kate. ``It's
Cassandra Powers. Cassie. Powers was my husband's last name, but
this Glaber guy got off on the idea of `angelic powers,' and she
must have gone along for the ride. I've been desperate about her,
Max. This girl has been messed up since her father's death. Please.
Don't walk out on this. I couldn't bring myself to tell you about
her and make you think I was hiring you as some kind of private
eye. I'm up to my ears with conflicts. How could my own paper cover
this when my daughter's so involved?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about full disclosure _ and then trusting your people to
do the right thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never been a parent, Max. You saw my daughter, didn't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she spiked my ice tea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean in the water, without her clothes, with Glaber and the
others looking on.'' Max nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sherry showed me those photos, I turned to ice. I've lost
my husband. I'm afraid of losing my daughter. And now I don't want
to lose you, at least as a dance partner. At least as a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Kate. I could use a pal. But one who, from now on, tells
me the whole truth. I know you've been hurting for your daughter,
so let's just say that I'll stay on the story ...,'' he dropped his
pants to show her the tattoo, `` ... to the bitter end.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell, this is Kate. Please assemble the staff for a
meeting. I'll be down in an hour. There's something I want to tell
them, and someone I want them to meet.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max shows Sam Lockhart his Watcher tattoo and
gets a lecture on the potential dangers of a doomsday cult. Max
then confronts Kate about her daughter, but promises to stay on the
story.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A great thing happened to Max. His new friend Evie Hamilton
called him. She was going to visit her daughter in Santa Barbara,
Calif. Would Max like to take care of Daisy the dog for a week or
so? ``Of all her visitors, she liked you the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Daisy loved the beach, but shied away from the water. She walked
along the sand beside Max with a slight limp, which disappeared
when she broke into a jog. She was so attentive and so pleased to
be out, sniffing dead fish and clumps of seaweed, that Max didn't
bother with a leash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, there are no dogs allowed on the beach. We can't make the
sign any bigger. Are you a German tourist who can't read English?''
The harsh words came from a tall beach cop with a mean sneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I read the sign. And I ignored it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't any ordinary dog, copper.'' Max did a bad imitation
of Edward G. Robinson. The cop looked at him in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Max said in his own voice, ``This is Daisy _ the dog that
survived the fall from the Skyway Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The cop's features changed instantly. In a second he squatted to
pat Daisy's head, and apologized to Max, and walked with them down
the beach, explaining to sunbathers that they were in the presence
of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they returned to the condo, Daisy collapsed on the
cool tile, sated with exercise, attention and affection.
</P>
<P>
   A knock at the door announced the arrival of Violet Rose,
looking smashing in a purple sun dress and strappy sandals. Her
long black hair was pulled into a ponytail, drawn neatly through
the back of a St. Pete Rays baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   She flashed him a bright smile, her face glowed, which could
mean two things at the same time: She was glad to see Max, and her
research had discovered something important. She arrived with a
chew toy for Daisy, some Chinese takeout for her and Max, and a
file under her arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right, Max, about the name William Miller _ if that
is Glaber's real name, it's another weird coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The photocopies in Violet's file revealed that William Miller
was the most famous American doomsday prophet of the 19th century.
He claimed 100,000 followers. From his reading of the Bible, Miller
predicted that the Second Coming would occur on Oct. 22, 1844.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they waited and waited and the day came, and it
went, and the Millerites, what was left of them, referred to that
time as `The Great Disappointment.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a few of those in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So have I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to try out the hot tub? Kate's got some stuff out
there you can wear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can Daisy join us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She seems a little shy of water right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daisy surprised them, hopping right in and splashing around
a minute and hopping out and shaking hard, sending a healthy spray
over Max and Violet.
</P>
<P>
   Max told her now about the Watcher tattoo, but did not show it
to her, and she did not ask to see it. He told her that Sam
Lockhart, feeling a little guilty about what had happened to Max,
had the entire police investigative file on The Watchers
photocopied for Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you take it, Violet, and have another copy made for
yourself? Pay special attention to Glaber. I have a hunch that if
we can find out who he is, even a little something about his
background, some big mystery will be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, there are lots of ways to track someone's background
online. You know that. It helps, of course, to have a real name or
date of birth or Social Security number. But I'll start with a
cross check of the names Glaber and Miller and see what turns up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get this guy's real name, I'll buy you a dozen roses _
violet roses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll settle for a foot massage. Right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Max granted her wish, a job that took a surprising length of
time. Each foot demanded careful attention. This was no hard labor,
he decided early on, but work that still commanded his best effort,
which meant not ignoring the Achilles tendon stretching up to a
firm but slender calf, and pressing his thumb hard up into the
arch, so that Violet closed her eyes and tilted back her head and
moaned and told him that it hurt but not to stop, and then pulling
on the dainty toes until they popped and making sure not to forget
to slide his fingers through the slips of skin between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a kiss?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we get Daisy to join us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not this time.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max takes care of Daisy the dog, then receives
a visit from Violet Rose, who is tracking down the real identity of
Raoul Glaber. A foot rub leads to something more.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max Timlin woke up with a warm breath on his neck and rolled
over to see Daisy the dog on the next pillow. He let out a laugh
that startled Daisy from her sweet doggie dreams. Max offered her a
good morning ear rub and took a licking in return.
</P>
<P>
   This display of affection caused him to reflect on his
surprising good fortune with women, not a condition, after two
divorces, that he was used to.
</P>
<P>
   He got up and looked into the mirror and could not imagine what
anyone might see in him. A once athletic body had gone to seed.
Thinning blondish hair was down to a cluster of unruly stalks. He
had random scars from skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's invisible, he mused, or my after-shave. Kate Banks
was more attentive and earnest than ever before, but Max could look
into her dark brown eyes and see, clearly circumscribed, the
difference between friendship and love. That was fine with him. He
needed her passion and intelligence in mounting the investigation
against The Watchers. And she clearly needed him, at least for her
daughter's sake.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed his meetings with Sherry Darling, who continued
surreptitious photographing of The Watchers, not only around the
Conquistador Hotel, but also around the Star Dome, where
preparations were under way for an international gathering of
Watchers, now just a fortnight away. Sherry had become a great
buddy, a kindred spirit, a true partner to Max.
</P>
<P>
   And now came the delicious surprise of one Miss Violet Rose, who
had visited him for evening walks on the beach, each night for the
last five nights. Her purported mission was to fill him in on the
day's search. Along with gathering string on Glaber's background,
Violet was vacuuming the Internet landscape on news of the upcoming
Watchers event, billed as ``The New Awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, Violet taught Max some yoga stretching
exercises, which he found relaxing, cooked a meal for him, and
grabbed his hand during their sunset strolls.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, came the news from Evie Hamilton in California
that she would extend her visit to her daughter for a while. Max
assured her that Daisy would be in good hands until her return.
</P>
<P>
   The week had brought one disturbing development. Two more
Watchers were found floating face down in Tampa Bay. The couple _
another man and woman _ lacked the identifying tattoos, but they
were clean cut and dressed in white.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Sam Lockhart had sent his investigative unit into the
Conquistador Hotel, but the detective turned up little to indicate
why two healthy young people _ just before the New Awakening _
would choose to sleep with the fishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We presume they jumped,'' Sam told Max, ``except for one
little detail. There was no abandoned vehicle near the top of the
Skyway. How the hell did they get up there? Take a little stroll?
Or did someone give them a lift? And maybe a little push?''
</P>
<P>
   Max was writing furiously now every day, sometimes as much as
5,000 words or more. Kate had arranged a small team to cover the
daily activities of The Watchers. It was agreed that Max would
write the blockbuster, which would appear after the first of the
year, or the first of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The world was a month away from the biggest New Year's Eve party
of all time, and you could not turn on TV without seeing Dick Clark
hyping the annual Times Square event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join us for The Biggest Ball of All,'' he said, still looking
like the world's oldest teen-ager. And you couldn't turn on the
radio without hearing Prince or the Artist Formerly Known As _
heck, he had more names than Glaber _ singing ``1999'': ``Two
thousand zero zero, party over, oops, out of time ... We're gonna
party like it's 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Max sang along to the radio as he drove the Mustang toward the
St. Pete Municipal Airport, a flying club for rich people, really,
but convenient for journalists.
</P>
<P>
   There he met Sherry and a pilot. They boarded a helicopter _ Max
hated helicopters and high places _ but in he went after a
reassuring hug from Sherry. They circled the beautiful waterfront
district, and shot across the city, hovering over the roof of the
amazing Star Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where The Watchers will be gathering,'' said Sherry.
``This is the site for the New Awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   The great white roof was a structural marvel: six acres of
strong but flexible fiberglass coated with Teflon, translucent to
affect the light in the stadium, supported by 180 miles of cables
connected by struts, yet puffy, like the world's largest throw
pillow.
</P>
<P>
   The chopper banked and cut south. Max's heart raced and his
mouth went dry and he gripped his seat and closed his eyes.
Meanwhile, Sherry was gabbing and pointing and leaning out to shoot
images of the Skyway.
</P>
<P>
   Max found the courage to look down at another engineering marvel
_ a gorgeous bridge, its golden cables rising to the heavens in two
steeples, as if to sanctify the blue-green marriage of sky above
and water below.
</P>
<P>
   But he could never view this without thinking of the destruction
of the old bridge, and the 35 people in cars and a bus who had gone
off the end to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about bridges?'' he wondered aloud. He knew many
people had nightmares about bridges. He had interviewed people who
could not drive across the Skyway themselves. They needed friends,
or chauffeurs, or Valium to get them across.
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought of those who had made their way to the top, who
had looked down at this beauty, only to feel betrayed by it and the
world. Then it came to him in a flash of images. Maybe the drowned
Watchers hadn't jumped. Maybe they hadn't been driven to the top
and pushed over. Maybe they had been flown over and dropped from
the sky.

October, the holiday shopping season is now officially upon us.
</P>

your mailbox are letters from credit card companies eager to give

purchase using a brand-new department store charge card. And then
there is the kindest offer of all: skipping December's payment with
your creditor's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   As tempting as these gifts are _ not to mention the tennis

<P>
   Skipping a payment, even at a credit card company's behest,
doesn't stop the clock on finance charges.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a credit balance of $2,000 with an average interest
rate of 18 percent and you skip a minimum payment of $20, your
effective interest rate jumps to 25.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you were trying to erase that debt in a year by paying
$180.65 each month and you didn't send in December's check, then
you just tacked on two or three more months of payments, says Steve
Rhode, president and co-founder of Debt Counselors of America in
Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid adding to your debt, even if it means passing up a
discount on the perfect outfit for dancing away the century this
New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing store chains and department stores usually charge 18 to
22 percent to use their cards. Unless you pay the balance
immediately, you will wind up giving back the discount in interest
payments.
</P>
<P>
   And those of you thinking you can get a china cabinet or a
sleeper sofa using one of those ``buy now, pay later'' credit plans
that department and furniture stores offer this time of year had
better be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   The ``free'' period isn't free.
</P>
<P>
   Interest accrues on your purchase from the day you sign the
credit card receipt. By the end of the 90 days or six months, the
debt needs to be paid in full to avoid a balance ballooned by
finance charges.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if your credit card company raises your spending limit,
don't take that as a sign from Santa Claus to overspend. Some banks
charge a fee for extending you more credit, even if you didn't ask
for it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STICK WITH JUST TWO CARDS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can avoid all of this by paying cash for everything.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're like me and haven't been saving spare change and
bagging your lunch to build up a holiday shopping fund, then you
need to use your credit cards strategically. No one wants to spend
the summer paying off last year's spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to avoid the urge to splurge is to make a budget
that includes all of your expenses, from gifts and wrapping paper
to travel and eating out.
</P>
<P>
   If you can locate your receipts and bills for last year's
Hanukkah, Christmas or Kwanzaa purchases, use them to figure out
how much money you'll need this year. If that's impossible, use
your checkbook register and credit card statements to piece
together how much damage you did.
</P>
<P>
   Build into your budget a cushion of up to $100 for unplanned
expenses. Make sure you keep a running tally of how much you spend,
so that you are constantly aware of how much you have left.
</P>
<P>
   Add your credit card purchases to your checkbook register. As
you subtract credit debt from the available balance in your
checking account, you get a reality check on whether or not you can
afford to give that gift.
</P>
<P>
   Take only two credit cards to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a card with a zero balance, use it for purchases
that will be paid in full when the bill comes. If not, try to find
the cash to pay for the gifts rather than add to your revolving
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Use the other card _ the one in your wallet with the lowest
interest rate _ for purchases that will be paid over time.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bankers Association surveyed 1,000 consumers last
month and found that only 28 percent had a spending plan for the
holidays. What's worse is that 61 percent underestimated the time
it takes to pay off holiday debt.
</P>
<P>
   The association says it takes at least four months to get rid of
your holiday charges. Just in time for you to muster up enough cash
to pay your tax bill.

INDIAN CHIEF RETAINS POWER AS GOVERNORS COME, GO

<P>
   ONEIDA INDIAN NATION TERRITORY _ At day's end Sunday, pale pink
sunlight glowed luminously through December clouds huddled over the
western horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The light washed eerily over signs that a half-dozen
demonstrators were waving outside the Oneida Indian Nation's
fabulously successful gambling casino-resort complex here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indians get the gold mine and white people get the shaft,''
read one sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart Indian, dumb white man,'' read another.
</P>
<P>
   Still another sign reminded gamblers cruising through the gate
for a fun-filled evening of losing money that the casino has been
the target of bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
   The point was clear: Gamble here, and you could end up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Racism and fear-mongering.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly stuff _ especially when you consider that the Oneidas'
entrepreneurial efforts have brought unexpected prosperity to a
previously depressed region of central New York state.
</P>
<P>
   From a bingo hall that local authorities fought to close decades
ago, the Oneidas have created a collection of thriving,
gambling-related businesses on their ancestral land that have
generated nearly 6,000 jobs in the greater Utica area.
</P>
<P>
   Those businesses also pump nearly $160 million annually into
state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Now state government is locked in a legal battle with these
stubborn, enterprising people that could result in a second Oneida
casino closer to New York City, which currently supplies fewer than
10 percent of the customers to this one.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike gubernatorial administrations, problems seldom have
terminal dates.
</P>
<P>
   This problem the State of New York has with the Oneida Indian
Nation has dragged on for a quarter century, with no end in sight,
unless Gov. George Pataki's administration decides finally to come
to grips with it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, essentially, is this: The Oneidas have sued,
claiming that the state long ago wrongly grabbed 250,000 acres of
their land.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the vast majority of that land is in the hands of
20,000 private citizens, many of whom are furious over the Oneida
lawsuit despite the dollars the tribe has showered on this region.
</P>
<P>
   The state is negotiating to settle the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Halbritter, the Harvard-educated lawyer who is the chief of
the Oneidas, has made clear that he would like this settled
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas don't want title to anybody's house.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they would prefer state permission to install slot
machines at their Turning Stone Casino.
</P>
<P>
   They would like state approval to serve liquor at the Oneidas'
hotel and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, though, any settlement probably would include
the transfer of state-controlled land to the Oneida Nation,
probably in the economically depressed Catskills, which could
benefit greatly from the jobs the Oneidas would provide there.
</P>
<P>
   The very prospect of a casino in the Catskills terrifies big
money interests with heavy investments in Atlantic City casinos _
people like Donald Trump, for instance, who make political
contributions _ so negotiations are slow. Perhaps so slow, in fact,
that the matter won't be resolved during Pataki's second term.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1,100 People of the Standing Stone, as the Oneidas call
themselves, are going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, apparently, is the soft-spoken Halbritter, who has been
the chief for 25 years and has demonstrated an enviable deftness in
tweaking the nose of the State of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Before Harvard, when he was an ironworker, Halbritter returned
to the reservation to bury an aunt and uncle killed in a house
trailer fire. How did this happen, he asked? The local fire company
wouldn't come on the reservation, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe had to come up with the cash to buy a fire truck,
Halbritter decided.
</P>
<P>
   His plan: bingo.
</P>
<P>
   A court battle with local law enforcement authorities ensued,
and when the dust had settled, Halbritter was the Oneida nation's
first bingo caller.
</P>
<P>
   After that came involvement in the arcane world of Oneida
politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's a world in which the eldest women in each of the three
tribal clans _ turtle, bear and wolf _ jointly select the 27
members of the men's council, which then selects the nation
representative, or chief.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Halbritter long to figure out that, if he wanted
to be chief, he had only to convince two elderly women that he was
the best person for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Having won election, he then decided that if he was going to
battle the white man's establishment, he would need training and
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   First came a political science degree from Syracuse University.
Then came the Harvard law degree.
</P>
<P>
   And, all the time, the Oneidas were building, building,
building, under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The creation and growth of this huge enterprise has been largely
Halbritter's work, and he's not finished.
</P>
<P>
   As this has dragged on, New York governors have come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   But Halbritter seems firmly established as the man any governor
will have to deal with for as long as cars pour by bitter
protesters outside the glittering casino.
</P>
<P>
   The casino that has made a penniless people prosperous, proud
and nobody to be ignored any more.

BAN SOUGHT ON ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLES IN NATIONAL PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A coalition of environmental organizations urged
the National Park Service on Tuesday to prohibit dune buggies and
other all-terrain vehicles on parkland.
</P>
<P>
   The 68 organizations petitioned Park Service Director Robert G.
Stanton to extend existing restrictions on vehicle use to all
beaches, trails and primitive roads.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey, the Bluewater Network, a San Francisco group that
also has led a fight against noisy jet boats in California
waterways, said it found Jeeps, sand buggies and other off-road
vehicles tearing around 56 of 108 of the nation's largest parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general public is unaware that off-road vehicles are even
allowed in our national parks units,'' said Russell Long, executive
director of Bluewater Network. ``Clearly, this use violates the
charter for our park systems, which is to keep resources unimpaired
for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Cox, editor of Dirt Wheel Magazine in Valencia,
Calif., cited the rapid growth of all-terrain vehicles, reaching
480,000 drivers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental petition would keep much of the public from
enjoying the remote spots, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that the outdoors shouldn't be used at all, or it's
for an elite few to look at in coffee-table books and not to
experience,'' Cox said of the environmental coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in favor of responsible use and not abuse,'' he said.
``We want to preserve the environment for our children as well. We
don't want to go out and brutalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on questionnaires and interviews with park rangers, the
Bluewater Network found that 23 parks allowed off-road vehicles on
beaches as well as on back-country and four-wheel-drive roads.
</P>
<P>
   Another 33 followed a general Park Service policy of prohibiting
off-road vehicles. Yet rangers reported significant illegal use,
according to the San Francisco organization. In many cases, they
saw injury to animals and loss of habitat in deserts, forested
mountains, streams, mud flats and dunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems include endangering and harming wildlife such as
the desert tortoise, Florida panther, piping plovers and bald
eagles,'' Long said. ``The noise angers many other park users who
visit for peace and solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   A 50-page study that accompanied the petition said, ``The use of
the thrillcraft appears to serve as high entertainment for a
privileged minority of motorized `cowboys' who behave as though
national parks are their personal tramping grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The off-road all-terrain vehicles produce 118 times as many
smog-forming pollutants as are produced by modern cars on a
per-mile basis, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, any vehicle that isn't licensed for streets is
prohibited in national parks. In addition, all vehicles must stay
in parking areas, specially designated routes and roads.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the agency doesn't go far enough
because it permits vehicles on back-country and unmaintained roads.
In some cases, the national parks may adopt regulations that allow
off-road vehicles in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluewater Network already has filed a petition with the Park
Service asking for a ban on Jet Skis, which it has promised to do
in about two dozen parks by January. The group also asked for a ban
on snowmobiles, which the Park Service has said it will propose
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of organizations behind Tuesday's petition
includes the Golden Gate Chapter of the Audubon Society, the
American Lands Alliance, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the
International Rivers Network, the Sea Turtle Restoration Network
and the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity.

MAYOR SEEKS MORE HEALTH CLINICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advancing his pledge to provide health care to
people without insurance, Mayor Willie Brown said he would put
health clinics in some public high schools next year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has been heavily lobbied by student groups asking for
the clinics, is not sure yet how much his plan will cost, where the
money will come from or how many schools might benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's challenger in the Dec. 14 run-off election, Board of
Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, also pledged support for the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is sure that at least a pilot program in several high
schools will be possible next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my next term I'm going to form a partnership with the
school district and we are going to do health clinics in the public
schools. That is how I begin to cover 140,000 people that the
voters said we should cover,'' Brown said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, a former schoolteacher and school board president, also
said he supports putting clinics in high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically just takes political will,'' Ammiano said.
</P>
<P>
   Election-year promises by Ammiano and Brown are a hit with Youth
Vote, a student civic group that is calling for health centers in
the city's seven comprehensive high schools at an estimated cost of
$1.4 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Of San Francisco's 22 high schools, only one has a health
clinic. Three schools have nurses who visit one or two days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The student lobbying already has persuaded Brown and the
governing Board of Supervisors to create a $550,000 budget for
clinics in two high schools for the next school year.
</P>
<P>
   The original budget that Brown drafted this summer included less
than half that amount. The students helped to persuade the board to
raise the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The new clinics will not provide full medical services like the
school-based health center at Balboa High School, which costs about
$600,000 per year to run. Instead, the new centers will combine
some treatment with referrals to Department of Health specialists
as well as to private physicians and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping for something bigger _ more schools _ but I'm
just glad we got two schools,'' said Downtown High School student
Shirley Escobar, 17, who participated in the lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's pledge follows his 1998 unveiling of a plan for a
universal health care system, which, if achieved, would be a first
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for insuring those without health insurance by
pooling money for city, school district and community college
district employees and retiree medical coverage with federal and
state health care funds, then teaming with small businesses to buy
insurance at cheaper rates.
</P>
<P>
   But that program, under scrutiny by public employee unions and
retired employees, remains just a concept.

EXPERTS SAY COMPUTERS VULNERABLE TO ACTS OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Computer security experts warn that the
United States remains dangerously vulnerable to hacker attacks on
computer and communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Computer crime costs companies more than $100 million per year,
but a far worse loss _ perhaps in an international catastrophe
triggered by a lone hacker _ is possible, the experts said at a
conference held Monday at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our national security and economy is extremely dependent on
automation,'' said Alan B. Carroll, an FBI agent who works at the
recently formed National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) in
Washington, D.C. ``In fact, it's probably too dependent. We are an
extremely target-rich environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll urged those at the conference to imagine a computer or
communications version of the World Trade Center bombing, a
disaster that brings down, say, computer or telephone networks on
which society depends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we haven't seen a major disaster and, therefore,
there's no problem is a very slippery slope on which to base your
assumptions,'' computer security specialist Peter G. Neumann told
the conferees. The conference, titled ``International Cooperation
to Combat Cyber Crime and Terrorism,'' was held at Stanford's
Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium computer glitch, or Y2K problem, has received the
lion's share of attention in recent months, yet it is only the tip
of the iceberg, said Neumann, principal scientist at the Computer
Science Laboratory at SRI International in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that on Jan. 1, a Trojan horse virus disguised as
a Y2K virus could proliferate through world computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   A crash, he said, might prove difficult to resolve, because
investigators might mistakenly blame it on the Y2K bug.
Investigators might take months to spot the virus' true identity,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts fear that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Leading companies claimed $124 million in losses in 1999 because
of computer crimes and security breaches, said Richard Power of the
Computer Security Institute in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The losses for 1997 and 1998 were, respectively, $100 million
and $137 million. Power's figures appear in the latest issue of
Computer Security Issues &AMP; Trends, the institute's newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Just one hacker _ the notorious Kevin Mitnick _ accounted for
about $300 million in losses claimed by companies that he
penetrated in the early 1990s, Power said. Mitnick was eventually
arrested and sentenced to 46 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The losses could be higher, but the survey covered only several
hundred of the largest companies. One problem is that many
companies fail to estimate their losses to computer crime and
breaches, Power said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually international terrorists might try to bring down U.S.
computer networks, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the NIPC, which opened in 1998, is to protect U.S.
society against major threats, including terrorist attacks on
computer and communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists are not the only threat, Carroll said. He cited a
case last year in which hackers, including two 16-year-olds in
Cloverdale, Calif., broke into military computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not Middle Eastern terrorists, and it showed us how
vulnerable we are,'' Carroll said.

MAKE-AHEAD RISOTTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is the fifth of eight columns by Patrick O'Connell, the
chef and an owner of the Inn at Little Washington in Washington,
Va. They are written with Marian Burros.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Simpler is usually better when it comes to risotto. All too
often, American versions are cluttered with so many fancy
ingredients that the purity of the dish is lost. A good risotto is
meant to be as comforting and nourishing as a bowl of porridge.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think they don't have time to make a dish that
requires standing over the stove and stirring constantly for 20
minutes while gradually adding stock. But here is a simple
restaurant trick that allows you to partly cook the rice in advance
and chill it to prevent overcooking _ a sort of instant risotto
base. It can then be quickly reheated and finished by adding hot
liquid and any additional ingredients just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   This delicious base can be kept in your refrigerator for those
times when you don't feel like cooking but crave a comforting meal.
I encourage home cooks to set aside one day a week _ perhaps Sunday
afternoon _ for cooking large batches of food that can be enjoyed
throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   The risotto base can be flavored a number of ways at the last
minute to make a first course or main dish, or for a dinner party.
Shredded collard greens, fresh sage leaves or strips of thinly
sliced prosciutto can be tossed in to make this dish more
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of liquid for a risotto varies, so don't depend on an
exact measure. When finished, the center of the rice should be al
dente, the mixture loose enough to slide on a tilted plate. The
dish will continue to thicken as it rests, so serve it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   This shortcut should encourage you to serve risotto more often.
Not even an Italian grandmother will be able to tell that you
performed all the time- consuming procedures in advance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAKE-AHEAD RISOTTO WITH SAGE AND PROSCIUTTO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes (25 minutes for the make-ahead risotto; 20
minutes to finish as sage and prosciutto risotto)
</P>
<P>
   For the make-ahead risotto:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   { large onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup arborio rice
</P>
<P>
   To finish as sage and prosciutto risotto:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 1{ cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   7 leaves fresh sage
</P>
<P>
   1 collard green leaf, trimmed and rib removed, torn into pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 thin slice prosciutto, cut into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare make-ahead risotto: In a small saucepan, bring 2
cups of chicken stock to a boil. Reduce heat, and keep stock at a
simmer.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium saucepan, combine 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
and olive oil. Place over medium heat until butter has melted. Add
onion, and saute until onion is translucent. Add rice, and stir
until it is evenly coated with butter.
</P>
<P>
   3. Reduce heat to low. Slowly add simmered stock, two-thirds cup
at a time, stirring constantly until rice absorbs liquid, 4 to 5
minutes with each addition. When all stock has been absorbed,
remove risotto from heat. Immediately pour onto a baking sheet to
stop the cooking, and cool as quickly as possible; rice grains will
still be a bit raw at center. Refrigerate uncovered until chilled,
then transfer to a covered container. Partly cooked risotto may be
refrigerated for up to 2 days.
</P>
<P>
   4. To finish as sage and prosciutto risotto: In a small
saucepan, combine about 1{ cups chicken broth with sage and collard
greens. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and keep stock at a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   5. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt butter and
stir in the make-ahead rice until it is warm. Pour in { cup stock
(but not the sage or collard greens, holding them to the side with
a spoon). Stir until stock is absorbed, 4 to 5 minutes with each
addition. Repeat until all stock has been absorbed, adding
prosciutto with final addition of stock. Adjust amount of stock as
needed; risotto should be very creamy, and the rice grains tender
but firm. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings.  &QL;

TIGHT LID, TASTY FISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The classic technique of cooking en papillote is the essence of
minimalism, but this dish streamlines it even further. Rather than
sealing fish and aromatic vegetables in individual packets of
parchment or foil to bake, you just lay the fillets over leeks in a
casserole with a snug lid. The resulting dish combines wonderful
textures and flavors with a minimum of ingredients, no added fat
and almost no preparation or cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   As with the best minimalist dishes, everything counts here: the
flavorful fish; the leeks that stay crisp and assertive, thanks to
the quick cooking time; and a little wine or stock for juice and
flavor. For a little more potent flavor, Dijon mustard provides a
bit of a kick.
</P>
<P>
   As with cooking en papillote, the ingredients, all quick
cooking, essentially steam in their own juices in the tightly
covered container. I use a Corning Ware-type casserole, but any
covered dish that lets a minimum of moisture escape will do the job
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Doing this in a casserole instead of in individual packages is
not just much easier. It also lets you check on how far the cooking
has proceeded without tearing open the packages.
</P>
<P>
   In this dish I like a thick fish like cod, salmon or halibut.
Leeks are the best member of the onion family here, both because
they do not go limp and because their flavor is strong but not
overwhelming. Thinly sliced onions will do the job nearly as well.
In place of the mustard, you might consider soy sauce; chopped
fresh herbs, like a couple of teaspoons of thyme; or a teaspoon of
curry powder or another spice mix.
</P>
<P>
   This technique is almost infinitely variable but is especially
useful for all types of fish and boneless chicken breasts, which
cook just as quickly and remain fairly moist. If you use a
vegetable that will create some of its own juice, like a thick
slice of tomato, you can reduce or nearly eliminate the added stock
or wine. Or you can just use a sprinkling of olive oil or lemon
juice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FISH BAKED WITH LEEKS  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds leeks, trimmed, washed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   { cup dry white wine, or chicken or fish stock
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard (optional)
</P>
<P>
   About 1{ pounds cod, salmon or other fish fillet, about 1 inch
thick.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Scatter leeks over the bottom of
an ovenproof casserole. Mix with wine or stock, salt, pepper and
mustard. Top with fish, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover
casserole.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, or until a thin-bladed knife meets
little or no resistance when inserted into thickest part of fish.
Uncover, and serve the fish with leeks and pan juices spooned over.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.  &QL;

WINE OF THE WEEK: ZINFANDELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ERIC ASIMOV    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zinfandel is America's own wine, which is remarkably liberating
for American winemakers. For once, they don't have to respond to
critics who might otherwise compare their pinot noirs and cabernet
sauvignons with Burgundies and Bordeaux. The grape is turned into
wine only in the United States, hence the attitude, ``We can do
anything we want with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, zinfandel does have family in the Old World. Genetic
testing has linked it definitively to the robust primitivo grape of
southern Italy, which itself is beginning to gain a certain amount
of popularity in the United States. Chances are, though, you will
not see someone sniff a glass of zinfandel and declare it, ``Good
enough, but certainly no primitivo.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinfandel can be rich, luscious and heavy, or it can be light
and breezy. It can be brawny or elegant. And yes, it can be pink
and fizzy. White zinfandel had its heyday in the 1980s, but with
the return to red-wine drinking in the 1990s, original zin is back.
</P>
<P>
   These days, most zinfandels are high-alcohol monsters, often
more than 14 percent and sometimes topping 15 percent, but it
wasn't always that way. Recently, I tasted a mellow Ridge zinfandel
from the late '70s that was not only light-bodied but also only 11
percent alcohol, less than you'd find in almost any wine except
some German rieslings.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, like most good wines, zinfandels cost much more
than they used to. Ten years ago, even the best zins were generally
no more than $15; now they hover around $25. But you can still find
good wines for less. The lower-priced, simpler wines of zinfandel
specialists like Rosenblum Cellars, Ridge and Ravenswood don't have
the structure, power or elegance of the more expensive versions,
but they are reliably enjoyable, as are these six.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The urge to bake great quantities of cookies in as short a time
as possible feels like a thoroughly modern phenomenon at the
holidays. But the tradition dates from way before the home stove,
let alone the microwave, to a time when stress had another meaning
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   A new book by Albert Sonnenfeld tells of how journeymen bakers
in the Middle Ages were required to bake at least 1,000 orange- and
lemon-flavor wafers a day. They probably risked toppling into the
fire in exhaustion. In ``Food, a Culinary History From Antiquity to
the Present'' (Columbia University Press), Sonnenfeld writes that
in 1397 and 1406, King Charles VI of France issued guild rules to
protect bakers. The trade, the king noted, was ``very dangerous and
difficult to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, cookies are perceived as the easiest things to bake, but
there is still the seasonal time crunch. It's hard to find hours to
invest in making, chilling and rolling out sugar cookies and
gingerbread men, which must then be lavishly decorated. But there
is still something satisfying about setting out a tray of homemade
cookies in a variety of shapes and flavors with the eggnog, or in a
tin as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   One way to have your cookies and time for shopping, too, is to
rethink the Christmas cookie. Forget pinwheels and delicate tuilles
and even hand-formed Mexican wedding cakes and bourbon balls,
anything that requires cookie-by-cookie attention. The alternative
is cookies baked in a sheet pan or jellyroll pan.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is finding cookies that have the festive sophisticated
look and flavor that say holidays. As for the beauty of the
individually shaped and decorated cookie, it can be faked: cut the
dough into any shape, even with cookie cutters (you can eat the
trimmings). The four streamlined recipes presented here produce
cookies that meet the holiday test. Their range of flavors and
textures would make a fine cookie tray or gift box.
</P>
<P>
   You can turn out at least 17 dozen cookies in a morning or
afternoon of concentrated baking. Or you can spread the baking out
over the weeks before Christmas: all the cookies hold up well in
airtight containers.
</P>
<P>
   What these cookies have in common are easy preparation and
relatively few ingredients, though all the ingredients are of high
quality. The meringues, essentially enlightened drop cookies with a
festive look, take only sugar, egg whites and peanuts. Super-rich
brownies to compete with Valrhona chocolates are flavored with
orange liqueur and coffee. Apricot bars, a cakelike crust simply
spread with top-grade apricot jam and sprinkled with pistachios,
are glistening and festive and can be cut into squares, rectangles
or diamonds. And nut diamonds start with a fail-proof dough and end
up as brittle and sweet as toffee.
</P>
<P>
   These four cookies are all different in texture and taste. All
can be made in advance. The peanut meringues can be stored for a
week in an airtight tin at room temperature. The nut diamonds will
last even longer in a tin. The brownies and apricot dreams can be
refrigerated for a day or two or frozen for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   I made all of these in one whirlwind of baking. Not one batch
took me more than 20 minutes to put together, and as one set of
cookies was in the oven, I was already working on the next recipe.
</P>
<P>
   As simple as cookies are, there are a few tricks to getting them
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Check each batch two minutes before the minimum baking time
suggested. If some cookies are done before others, remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Remove all cookies as soon as they are firm enough to handle, or
they will continue to bake on the pan. Don't stack them; lay them
out on racks or plates so that they don't touch one another.
</P>
<P>
   Cake squares should cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes before
cutting and removing.
</P>
<P>
   Very delicate cookies should be stored with sheets of wax paper
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies to be frozen should be wrapped twice, first in aluminum
foil and then in heavy plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overbake brownies.
</P>
<P>
   And bake nothing that will result in falling over the oven in
exhaustion.

GO AHEAD AND COMPLAIN, BUT DO IT NICELY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everyone has a story, or more to the point, a
complaint, about dining out in New York. But Jeffrey Steingarten's
is by far my favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the old Bouley in that postage stamp-size lounge,''
Steingarten, the food writer for Vogue and author of ``The Man Who
Ate Everything'' (Alfred A. Knopf), recalled last week. ``As we
waited, new people arrived, and we stood together like in the
subway. Finally, after 40 minutes, my wife, Caron, pulled out her
cell phone, called a pizzeria and ordered. In a very loud voice,
she gave the address and said, `We're starving here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``No more than two minutes later, the maitre d' whisked us to
our table. He begged for the name of the pizzeria so he could call
and cancel.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, why didn't I think of that? Why didn't you?
</P>
<P>
   As anyone knows, who's pressed the redial button 50 times to
make a reservation, the restaurant boom has made the complaining
issue more timely than ever. Compounding the problem is the
accompanying shortage of experienced staff, which means the person
to whom you complain, may not know what to do, or may simply be
stretched too thin to be immediately effective.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Zagat, publisher of the Zagat Surveys, says most New York
complaints are about service, noise and crowding. What his survey
doesn't quantify, though, is how some diners manage to get what
they want, while others are left seething.
</P>
<P>
   What is the best way of getting results when you're not happy in
a restaurant _ short of phoning in a pepperoni pie? What can you do
to be seated faster or better, get bad wine replaced or food redone
to your liking?
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to remember, in all cases, is to speak up. But
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any complaint is legitimate,'' says Danny Meyer, an owner of
Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Tabla and Eleven Madison Park.
``What's difficult about so many of them is that instead of being
phrased as a simple request, they are covered with layers of
assumed personal rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing personal about bacteria in a cork that was
picked in Portugal and put into a bottle in Bordeaux. But with all
complaints, I'd much rather know right when it happens than hear
someone say on the way out, `We always get the worst table.' The
customers have spent two hours seething and feeling personally
rejected. That's not what most restaurants are trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Being Seated
</P>
<P>
   This very big sore point encompasses being seated on time and
being seated at a table that is agreeable to you.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Friedland, an executive editor at HarperCollins who is
also the director of cookbook publishing, recalls a business lunch
a few years ago at Sushisay in Midtown. Crammed into a table for
two, cheek-by-jowl with others, she requested a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officious maitre d' told me that the only thing available
was the smoking section,'' she recalled. ``Then two men seated on
my right made the same request and were taken to the table I had my
eye on. I sent a letter to the restaurant and got the most lovely
letter back from the owner, who was a woman. She said, `We try so
hard to avoid this kind of treatment, please come back.' I did, and
she made the maitre d' come over and apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is willing to speak up, however. Suzanne Goodson, a
lawyer, says she never complains about the service or the seating,
no matter how bad she thinks it is. ``It makes me nervous,'' she
admits. ``I hate to be with people who make scenes. I was with
someone once who actually sent the water back. I just hate
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Marie Brenner, writer at large for Vanity Fair. ``When a
restaurant does not honor reservations on time, I storm out and
almost never go back,'' she says. ``It happened to me recently at
Tabla. I was so angry, but I couldn't leave because I was in a
group. I feel that restaurants purposefully overbook just to get
people to go to the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Three approaches, same result: none got the table she wanted
when she wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs are aware of the problem and say there are some
preventative steps diners can take. ``Reservation times are what we
get the most complaints about,'' Meyer says. ``In the restaurant
business, as opposed to the theater, center orchestra is an 8 p.m.
reservation. Orchestra on the side is 7 or 8:30. Mezzanine is 6 and
9. But people don't take it personally when they call the theater
and can't get what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly do in restaurants. Jerry Della Femina, who opened
a branch of his busy Hamptons restaurant Della Femina in Midtown,
says: ``Everyone wants to book at the same time. When people get
stacked up, we give a complimentary drink to anyone waiting more
than 10 minutes. That goes a long way. People just want you to
acknowledge that you see them standing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Recently, my husband and I went to Beacon with another
couple who had made the 8:30 reservation. By 8:50, we were still
waiting. When questioned, the maitre d' led us to a table upstairs.
Our hostess balked. She had requested a table downstairs, closer to
the open-fire cooking the restaurant is known for.
</P>
<P>
   She told the maitre d' how much she had liked her meal the last
time, how eager she had been to return. He smiled and nodded and 15
more minutes passed, while we resumed our position near the door.
Finally, my husband walked through the downstairs and counted six
empty tables for four. Anticipating the traditional restaurant line
about no-shows, he confronted the maitre d'. ``Who are you holding
these for, the Aly Khan?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The maitre d' said: ``Don't worry. I'll give you a bottle of
Champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   I lost it. ``I don't like Champagne,'' I yelled. ``I want to eat
the dinner I was supposed to start 40 minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   After some whispered consultations, we were finally seated.
Downstairs. A complimentary bottle of wine appeared, and dinner
proceeded. The food was fine, but I would never go back. Who needs
it?
</P>
<P>
   The flip side to the reservation problem is diners who don't
call to confirm, yet show up expecting to be seated. One of the
Zagat Survey dining tips calls this ``doing your part.'' If you do,
the restaurant will generally hold your table 15 minutes, sometimes
more, though if you are running late, you should call. This is an
area where customers need to take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Nieporent, an owner of Myriad Restaurant Group, which
includes Nobu and Montrachet, says: ``My motto has always been
`nice gets nice.' But if people walk into a busy restaurant and
have no reservation and lie or they never called to confirm, I'll
say, `We'll try to work with you.' If they're nice, I'll jump
through hoops of fire to help them. But if someone does what I call
a verbal mugging, dropping a million names and trying to bully his
way in, I say, `There's nothing I can do.'''
</P>
<P>
   To review: If you have confirmed the reservation, arrived on
time and have been kept waiting more than 10 or 15 minutes (and
didn't yell), you may reasonably expect a free drink and an
apology.
</P>
<P>
   Corked Wine
</P>
<P>
   Is it or isn't it? This is a sensitive subject, especially with
expensive bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine is not like a pair of shoes that you can sell to another
person,'' Nieporent says. ``At the moment the wine is tasted, the
risk is taken. You don't change your mind five minutes later after
the other people at the table decide they don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cannon, an owner of Judson Grill, says: ``Corked wine
happens all the time. The wine industry has expanded, and there's
not a supply of corks sufficient to meet the demand. We'll always
take it back. If it's bad, we'll throw it out, but if it's not,
I'll give it to the bartender to sell by the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   To review: If you know what you're doing, you won't have a
problem. If you don't, consider beer.
</P>
<P>
   Solo Dining
</P>
<P>
   This can be a sore spot, especially with women. One woman I know
recently went alone to the newly opened Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe,
and the maitre d', faced with a sea of empty tables, led her to the
back corner, behind the swinging kitchen door. She refused. After
insisting that all seats were reserved, he finally moved her up
front. When another single women came in, she was led to the
original spot, where she sat uncomplaining.
</P>
<P>
   All the owners I spoke to applauded the woman who spoke up for
herself. ``Be direct and ask,'' Meyer says. ``Don't take anything
personally. Our goal is the same as the diner, for you to leave the
restaurant happy. Do us a favor and give us clues.''
</P>
<P>
   Della Femina agrees. ``The real terror is the customer who won't
tell you what's wrong, but leaves the restaurant and tells the next
500 people they see.''
</P>
<P>
   To review: Sit where you're comfortable, but don't be
unreasonable. No one will give you the table for four, so forget
it.
</P>
<P>
   Food
</P>
<P>
   Here's the good news. When the meal finally shows up, people are
happy to eat it. Though Cannon says, ``They'll ask for a duck
breast well done and then complain that it's tough.'' But not only
will he take it back, he'll send dessert.
</P>
<P>
   So the moral of the story is this: If you want to be treated
well by a restaurant, treat the restaurant well. Confirm your
reservation. Be on time. And don't act out. You have not become
Louis XIV simply because American Express issued you a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a complaint, identify it and deal with it when you
have it. If the restaurant behaves badly, don't go back. And if
that's not enough, buy a voodoo doll, take out an ad or open a
place of your own.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe most important, remember Ms. Friedland's advice in the
face of all restaurant adversity: ``It's just a meal.''

IN A $500 CELLAR, PRESENT COMES BEFORE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, it would have been relatively simple to conjure up
a modest little wine collection costing about $500. A case of this,
a case of that, a few bottles of something else and you had an
authentic ``cellar.''
</P>
<P>
   I recalled those days recently while leafing through a catalog
from a New York wine shop. It listed the 1996 Romanee-Conti,
admittedly a good Burgundy, at $2,500. Not for a barrel, not for a
case, but for a single bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Romanee-Conti is for collecting. Even in these flush
times, not many of us are going to open a bottle like that with the
lamb chops. But does it mean that amassing a decent wine cellar is
no longer possible for people of modest means? Not at all. You can
still begin with $500, or even less.
</P>
<P>
   If the longest journey starts with a single step, there is no
reason why a good wine cellar can't start with two or three
bottles. Every wine cellar begins with the decision to buy a few
extra bottles for future use _ even if the future is next month.
</P>
<P>
   There are no rules. Well, maybe one: buy only what you like.
Last week, writing about the physical aspects of a wine cellar, I
mentioned a fellow who, suddenly enamored of classical music,
bought an instant collection of musical masterpieces, most of which
he never played. Had he bought slowly and judiciously, he might
have created a record library to enjoy for years.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with wine. Too many people buy wines they think they
should have, rather than wines they enjoy. A Beaujolais fan should
try half a dozen different Beaujolais, then buy a case of the one
he likes best.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't the purpose of a wine cellar to store valuable wines
that need aging? Not necessarily. It's a place to store the wines
you like to drink right now. After you have accumulated a stock,
then you might choose to invest in good Bordeaux or California
cabernets that will benefit from aging.
</P>
<P>
   Building up a cellar of reasonably priced wines will force you
to become eclectic. For variety's sake, you will want to try
Italian wines, Spanish wines, Chilean wines, other varieties of
French wines. If you like Champagne, buy half a dozen brands. If
you like sherry or port, add a few. None of this need be done
overnight, but you'll be surprised how fast your cellar grows.
</P>
<P>
   If you are relatively new to wine, buy bottles or mixed cases at
the outset. Not sure what white wine you prefer with fish? Make up
a case: from France, a couple of Sancerres, a Quincy, a Macon
blanc, a St.-Veran and a petit Chablis; from California, two
chardonnays, a sauvignon blanc and a dry chenin blanc; a pinot
blanc from Oregon; and a pinot grigio from Italy. Decide which you
prefer and buy a case of each. Remember, there is almost always a
10 percent discount on a case.
</P>
<P>
   Do the same with reds: from France, go for the cru Beaujolais,
like Fleurie and Morgon; try some lesser-known Bordeaux chateaux,
and some reasonably priced wines from the Rhone like Gigondas and
Cotes du Rhone. For my money, Italy has left every other wine
country far behind when it comes to moderately priced reds. There
are literally dozens of great wines from every part of the country,
from the Alps to Sicily, from Venice to Sardinia.
</P>
<P>
   From California, there are cabernet sauvignons and merlots and
zinfandels. Oregon offers good pinot noirs, and Washington State
has its own style of cabernets and merlots. Determining which ones
you like enough to add to your cellar can be a long and delightful
task.
</P>
<P>
   Being cautious will mean that you will know all your wines and
can deploy them intelligently. All these everyday wines can be
found at $20 a bottle or less, which means a good working cellar
can be pulled together relatively quickly.
</P>
<P>
   At that point you might begin to think of laying down some
better wines, like barolos and barberas from Italy, good Bordeaux
and Burgundies, the more expensive California cabernets and pinot
noirs. You can buy them early and, with luck, watch them increase
in value.
</P>
<P>
   For those who feel ready to cellar better wines that should
improve with age, the 1998 Bordeaux vintage provides some good
opportunities. These are wines bought as ``futures,'' that is,
purchased now for delivery in 2001 after bottling and aging.
Bordeaux prices are at all-time highs, but there are still some
values for people eager to play in this market, and the wines are
expected to increase in value.
</P>
<P>
   As for that $2,500 Romanee-Conti, at least one critic,
Pierre-Antoine Rovani, recommends holding it for a few years and
drinking the 1997 first. This is a break, if you are into
high-priced Burgundies, because the price of the 1997, which is not
yet released, is expected to be only around $1,400. Put that in
your new wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Nice wines for an everyday cellar might include these whites:
</P>
<P>
   Sancerre Chateau de Sancerre, 1997; Lapostolle; $15
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Les Glaneuses, 1998 Jean Sauvion; $10
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma Cask Chardonnay, 1997 Sebastiani; $11
</P>
<P>
   Dry Creek Vineyards Chenin Blanc, 1998; $9
</P>
<P>
   Pinot Grigio, 1998 Alois Lageder; $11
</P>
<P>
   Pouilly-Fuisse, 1997 Georges Duboeuf; $15
</P>
<P>
   And the following reds: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gallo Stefani Vineyard Cabernet Sauignon, 1994; $20 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Strong Pinot Noir Russian River, 1997; $15 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Bernadotte, 1996 Haut-Medoc (Bordeaux); $19 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fleurie, Chateau des Deduits, 1997; Georges Duboeuf; $12 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notarpanaro 1994, Rosso del Saento Taurino; $10 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chianti Classico Riserva Ducale, 1995; Ruffino; $18 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These Bordeaux are good choices to buy as futures: Chateau La
Grave a Pomerol, $325; Chateau Lafon-Rochet (St.-Estephe), $285;
Chateau de Sales (Pomerol), $290; Chateau La Pointe (Pomerol),
$325; Chateau Canon-Moueix (Fronsac), $185; and Chateau d'Armailhac
(Pauillac), $265. &QL;

 &HT;    `Leading Ladies' strut their Broadway stuff
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any ``Great Performances'' event about musical theater is reason
to salivate, uh, celebrate for Broadway fans outside New York. For
better or worse, it keeps us in touch with the art form we love
most. There's plenty of better here, and a tad too much worse. No,
we're never satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly ``My Favorite Broadway: The Leading Ladies'' is very
good. What takes it down a peg is what _ or who _ isn't here.
Broadway's leading ladies, hmm? Where are Patti LuPone and
Bernadette Peters? Donna Murphy and Betty Buckley? Angela Lansbury
and Donna McKechnie? Liz Callaway and Carolee Carmello?
</P>
<P>
   Still, this special, edited into 90 tantalizing minutes from a
September 1998 Carnegie Hall spectacular, is worth your time, if
just to see Audra McDonald, who, in her 20s, is a three-time Tony
Award winner _ not to mention enjoying still more success in the
Broadway production of ``Kiss Me, Kate.'' She doesn't disappoint,
showcasing her Juilliard-trained soprano on the anthemic ``Love
Changes Everything'' (from Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Aspects of
Love'') and striking a jazzy, bluesy mood on ``Down With Love''
from the little-known 1937 musical ``Hooray for What!''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Love Changes Everything,'' McDonald _ who sings with the
Atlanta Symphony in April _ is one-third of a showstopper. With her
on this Lloyd Webber tour de force are Marin Mazzie (``Ragtime,''
``Kiss Me, Kate'') doing ``Unexpected Song'' from ``Song and
Dance'' and Judy Kuhn (``Les Miz,'' ``She Loves Me'') doing ``I
Don't Know How to Love Him'' from ``Jesus Christ Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mazzie's bewitching ``Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered''
from ``Pal Joey.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Karen Ziemba and Bebe Neuwirth singing and slinking like peas
in a pod to ``Chicago's'' ``Nowadays'' and ``Hot Honey Rag.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Priscilla Lopez still feeling ``Nothing,'' as she re-enacts
her Tony-winning turn in ``A Chorus Line.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Faith Prince sneezing through ``Adelaide's Lament,'' as she
re-enacts her own Tony-winning performance in ``Guys and Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lea DeLaria scatting through ``I Can Cook Too'' from ``On the
Town.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cabaret's'' Kit Kat Girls sharing the spotlight and a few
props for ``Life Upon the Wicked Stage'' from ``Showboat.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And the legendary Elaine Stritch doing ``Company's'' ``Here's
to the Ladies Who Lunch'' as if it were her first time, not her
thousandth.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's most embarrassing moment? A beefy Liza Minnelli
sloshing through ``Some People,'' that glorious battle hymn from
``Gypsy.'' Liza makes up her own lyrics, her own melody, even her
own rhythms, giving a great impersonation of fingernails on a
blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   And just once could a TV show about musical theater give us a
decent curtain call instead of pulling the camera back to the
balcony so we see teeny-tiny faces as the credits roll. No, we're
never satisified. As Liza would say in her own sloppy,
spit-propelled way, ``Sheesh!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   We have regional marketing managers and they travel to Detroit
to discuss future marketing plans. Then everyone goes out to
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it was just one more night away from home. So I said,
``Tell you what. Why don't we have dinner at my house, and when I
say dinner, I mean pizza and beer. I've got a pool table, I've got
a football table.''
</P>
<P>
   They said great.
</P>
<P>
   What I forgot to do was mention it to my wife, Nancy. My
secretary called to make arrangements, and then she caught up with
me on a business trip to tell me I'd better call my wife.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy was a little excited. But I told her, ``We'll order the
pizza, and I've already got the beer.''
</P>
<P>
   We had a great time. We probably had 20 or 22 people at the
house. The kids had a hoot. People were playing with their game
tables. Nancy was down there shooting pool with them, too.
</P>
<P>
   You have to plan way ahead to make sure you can play equally
well to your personal and professional life. I'm going to be
missing meetings occasionally because of my kids' audition or
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But when they're looking for you and they see you, and you see
the smile that breaks on their face, you know it really means
something to them. That's worth missing a business dinner. It is
worth cutting a meeting short.
</P>
<P>
   I don't see the kids in the morning. I leave at 6:30, and I'm
usually at work by 7. If people ask me to dinner, I'll say I can do
breakfast or I can do lunch.
</P>
<P>
   When my kids' school calendars come out, I lay their events in
my calendar and, to the extent that I'm able, work around them.
Sometimes things are scheduled on top of those days that are
precious to me, and as many days as not, I may be late to those
meetings or not going to dinners that conflict with their
performances. I try like crazy to be home as many times for dinner
with the kids as possible. When 6 o'clock rolls around, I try to be
in the car so I can get home and ask them the 20 questions that
drive them crazy about what they did at school today.
</P>
<P>
   I have not made every teacher conference. I haven't made every
performance. I remember one occasion when we had
take-your-daughter-to-work day, and Lindsey was interested in
coming. I was out of the country. There was not much I could do.
</P>
<P>
   I probably do better than most in terms of making some conscious
choices. I only have a few years to be part of their lives and to
instill in them a notion of family. I just choose as often as I can
in their favor.

   CHECHNYA-WARNING (Washington) _ George Roberston, NATO's

   BUSH-2000 (Undated) _ George W. Bush, in the wake of his second
debate, may be finding his winning smile may be his worst enemy
when it turns into a smirk. Political experts say it can work
against him if it becomes part of the larger picture of the ``empty
suit.'' Bush defended himself against the smirk in a news

   MIDEAST-ALBRIGHT (Jerusalem) _ As Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was about to land here Tuesday night, Ehud Barak, the
prime minister of Israel, sought to defuse growing tensions with
the Palestinians by pledging to halt the expansion of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank. Barak stopped short of baldly
declaring a freeze on construction, partly _ and unsuccessfully _
to avoid provoking the right-wing members of his coalition. But, in
an unexpected change of approach, he called a moratorium of several
months on new settler neighborhoods to avert confrontation during a
delicate period, as the parties seek to reach a framework final
peace agreement by February. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST-DAWN (Gisborne, New Zealand) _ The first sunrise of the
new millennium will be a cold and lonely moment as the midnight sun
dips below the horizon near Dibble Glacier in Antarctica, then, a
few minutes later, creeps up again. At the western edge of the
international dateline, the silent Antarctic dawn will take place
14 hours before the big ball descends to mark the new year in Times
Square _ and more than 21 hours before the sun rises in New York at
7:20 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2000. But no one is likely to be there on the
distant glacier to see the century's first dawn. This has touched
off a rough and tumble competition among the islands of the South
Pacific for the claim of being the first inhabited place to witness
the first fresh sunbeams of the future. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CHECHNYA-RUSSIA (Primykaniye, Russia) _ Just last week, it was
the Islamic rebels who held this bucolic settlement, a mere two and
half miles from the outskirts of Grozny. But as Russian troops
rushed to encircle the Chechen capital, the outnumbered rebels were
routed in a furious 10-hour firefight against Russian helicopters,
artillery, and tanks. Russian commanders boast about their use of
maneuver and deception. But the most enduring impression from a
three-day visit to Chechnya is of massive firepower. By Michael R.

rogue states, terrorists and ethnic conflicts. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   NY-HOMELESS-POLITICS (New York) _ As protests over the arrests
of homeless people mount on the eve of Mayor Rudolf Giuliani's all
but certain U.S. Senate campaign, a mayor who likes to talk tough
is attempting to extract himself from a political crisis by saying
he is misunderstood, and that it is more ``loving'' to get the

   UTAH-CAMP-ATTACK (Cedar City, Utah) _ The survival camp for

has doubled as parents search for different ways to deal with
difficult teens. Meanwhile, the authorities continue to search for

   SEATTLE-POLICE CHIEF (Seattle) _ Amid a continuing swirl of
criticism over the police department's handling of the protests
last week that engulfed Seattle's streets and eclipsed the WTO
meeting here, the city's police chief, Norm Stamper, announced on
Tuesday that he would resign. Stamper said that he wished to
``de-politicize'' the investigations that are underway into police
preparations for the trade talks. The demonstrations turned
violent; while police sprayed tear gas at peaceful protesters near
the meeting, they failed to stop the looting done by a small group
of vandals nearby. By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>

   NY-TEACHERS-CHEATING (New York) _ Exposing what they called one
of the largest cheating scandals in the recent history of American
public schools, investigators charged on Tuesday that 52 teachers
and principals in 32 of New York City's public schools had helped
students cheat on the standardized tests that help determine how
their school is ranked and whether the students move on to the next

<P>
   MARS-LANDER (Pasadena, Calif.) _ In the aftermath of the failed
$165-million Mars Polar Lander mission, NASA on Tuesday promised a
thorough investigation of its causes and implications and a ``major
rethinking'' of the strategy for the entire Mars exploration
program. The next landing mission, planned for launching in 2001,
may well be postponed for more than two years. That spacecraft is
almost identical to the polar lander and so may have to be modified
to correct any shortcomings revealed in the investigation. By John
Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   MARS-MISTAKES (Undated) _ A string of embarrassing mistakes that
doomed the $125-million Mars Climate Orbiter in September may have
contributed to the apparent loss of the $165 million Mars Polar
Lander, NASA officials and private experts said on Tuesday. Last
month, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration issued a
blistering 45-page report on the loss of the Climate Orbiter, the
first of two spacecraft meant to renew NASA's exploratory push this
year to the red planet. Those findings and recommendations also
suggested ways to avert disaster with the sister craft, which has
now fallen silent since Friday's scheduled landing. By William J.
Broad.

KOSHER EGG ROLL SKINS  
 STORING TOMATOES  
 FRESH SEAWEED  
 USING SIFTING FLOUR  
 REMOVING EGGSHELL 
</HEADLINE>

 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Where can I buy kosher egg roll skins for a Chinese dinner I
am making at home? And how do you get the small pieces of egg into
fried rice? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Kosher egg roll wrappers, made by Nasoya, are sold in
packages of about six dozen for under $3, and can be found in the
produce section of many supermarkets. If you don't use all at once,
freeze the leftovers for up to 3 months, tightly wrapped in
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fried rice, the easiest way to create those little
morsels of scrambled egg is to pour beaten eggs into the fried rice
mixture while it's still in the pan. Then stir the rice over high
heat until the egg pieces are cooked through, 1 or 2 minutes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you recommend storing fresh tomatoes? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. While most vegetables keep fresh longer in the refrigerator,
tomatoes are definitely an exception. In her book Cookwise (William
Morrow, 1997), the food scientist Shirley Corriher writes that
semitropical fruits and vegetables like bananas, pineapples and
tomatoes are at their best stored at around 50 degrees. If they are
refrigerated, these fragile fruits will stop ripening and lose
flavor. Tomatoes are especially delicate, and refrigerating them
will not only dull their bright flavor, but give them a mushy
texture as well. But storing these fruits at room temperature, out
of the line of direct sunlight, is perfectly fine. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where does one buy fresh seaweed? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In Hawaii, China and Japan, many varieties of fresh seaweed
are commonly sold in markets. But in New York, seaweed is a rarity
because it is quite perishable and demand is low. High-end Japanese
and other Asian restaurants generally import it themselves, but
most Japanese restaurants use either reconstituted dried seaweed,
or frozen seaweed from Chile, Japan or Canada, which I haven't been
able to find in stores.
</P>
<P>
   This said, there are two fresh seaweeds available on a limited
basis. One is fresh wakame. This popular seaweed, often added to
miso soup, has a deep greenish brown color and ruffled edges.
Katagiri a Japanese specialty store in Manhattan (212-755-3566),
sells fresh salted wakame, $2.99 for 500 grams. The other type,
Salicornia, also known as sea beans, is not a true seaweed, but a
spiny plant that grows near estuaries, many in Europe, and is often
used as seaweed or a `sea vegetable.' It has a briny, fresh flavor
and can be eaten raw in salads, or lightly steamed as a vegetable.
Salicornia is available in specialty shops in season, from summer
to early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Since seaweed dries extremely well and will then last for years,
reconstituted dried seaweed (found in packages at most Asian
specialty stores) is probably the best bet for the home cook. If
you are looking for fresh seaweed simply to use as a garnish or as
a bed for shellfish (not to eat), friendly fishmongers and
specialty stores will sometimes let you have some free. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I do a lot of baking and have noticed that some recipes call
for sifted flour and some do not. What are the guidelines for
sifting flour? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Flour is sold presifted these days, which is why most recipes
do not instruct you to sift (to rid the flour of any impurities or
bits of bran). But sifting is called for when the flour needs to be
lightened and aerated, which makes it easier to fold into delicate
preparations like souffles and sponge cake batters.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to note whether the recipe calls for a measure of
sifted flour (1 cup sifted flour) or for flour that is to be sifted
after measuring (1 cup of flour, sifted). The actual amount of
flour is different in each instance. One cup of all-purpose flour,
measured using the dip-and-sweep method, weighs 5 ounces, whereas
one cup of sifted flour (that is, sifted, then gently spooned into
the measuring cup) weighs only 4 ounces. So make sure to follow the
directions of the recipe you are using.
</P>
<P>
   Since flour settles and compacts, some cooking authorities
advise fluffing it with a spoon or wire whisk before measuring. In
general, the most accurate way to measure flour is to weigh it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that if you drop a shard of eggshell into a
mixture you should use a larger piece of eggshell to scoop it up? I
have heard that the shard will gravitate to the larger piece like a
flea to a dog? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is just a culinary old-wives tale. In fact, Linda Braun,
the Consumer Service Director of the American Egg Board, warns
against this practice, since there is a minute chance that the egg
shell might contain traces of salmonella. The best solution is to
fish the piece out with a clean utensil.

   Online tea fanatics will ignore www.bengalbay.com at their
peril, but watch out for the terrible puns. The home page has
departments to click on like ``Communitea,'' where tea drinkers
share recipes and discuss topics like the strongest brews they
know. There is also a searchable guide to tea shops, tea bars and
tearooms in the United States, with some in Canada and Britain,
called ``Localiteas.''
</P>
<P>
   Click on that, and a map comes up. Click on the shape of New
York, and up comes a list of tea spots in the Northeast, ranging,
north to south, from the House of Flower Wind in Boston to the
Victorian Rose Tea Co. in Occoquan, Va. The information includes
street addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, hours,
handicapped access and public transportation (where available), but
nothing about the menus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the site is a marketplace, providing 17 brands of
tea, including Stash, Eastern Shore Tea Co. and Harney &AMP; Sons,
along with more widely distributed names. Tea drinkers can browse
among black, green, herbal and organic teas. The roster of 80 black
teas, priced from $2.29 (for a box of 20 Foojoy China Oolong bags)
to $7.89 (for a six-ounce tin of Harney's loose lapsang souchong),
includes 11 varieties of Earl Grey, four of them decaffeinated.
</P>
<P>
   There are also tools like tea balls, strainers and infusers. A
gold-plated English tea strainer, for instance, sells for $3.49.
Click for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Bengalbay.com donates 1 percent of revenue from its sales to the
nonprofit Women in Livestock Development program of Heifer Project
International, helping women to provide for themselves and their
families. Donations from this site go to tea-growing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Tea enthusiasts will also want to know about
www.republicoftea.com, which sells only high quality Republic of
Tea products, including organic, herbal, black and green teas,
prized for flavors like mango, ginger peach and cinnamon plum. An
Earl Greyer (cq) tea is described as ``more of a good thing tea''
(3.5-ounce tin or 50 bags, $8). Teapots and cups are also
available. A tip: the online catalog is called ``Your World
Embassy,'' reached by clicking on ``Journey of Discovery'' and then
the elephant. The site still has rough edges.

Dr. Ruth Westheimer's sexual-health site is also a click away from
the others.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waters believes that cooking and sharing food connects
people to the earth and to one another. The site offers recipes
from her Chez Panisse cookbooks. You can search by ingredients like
eggplant and garlic, which figure prominently in her cooking. She
also answers questions, for example, on how to give variety to a
vegetarian diet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waters is on the board of the Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market in
San Francisco, and there are plans to put a national directory of

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The salad, a mix of baby lettuces like red oak,
frisee and lolla rossa, arrives at the table, looking stark naked.
Appetizing, yes. Dressed, no. Hold a candle under the greens, and
there isn't a glint of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the stealth salad dressing, invisible to the eye but
evident to the tongue. It is the reason that many salads in
restaurants these days have a delicious yet elusive quality that
may puzzle diners trying to replicate them at home.
</P>
<P>
   Five to 10 ingredients, few of them predictable, go into the
subtle, light and tasty dressings that are blended by the chefs at
restaurants like Nobu, Palladin and Local.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for these new dressings are the baby lettuces
and fragile microgreens, like sunflower and buckwheat sprouts, that
have come onto the market.
</P>
<P>
   When Jean-Louis Palladin made salads years ago at his restaurant
in Washington, his dressing was simply balsamic vinegar and olive
oil. But when he served the same dressing with microgreens at his
restaurant in midtown Manhattan, the greens wilted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked like they were wetted down with water, because the
balsamic was too heavy,'' said Timothy Dean, the executive chef at
Palladin. ``The vinegar just killed the microgreens.''
</P>
<P>
   So Palladin and Dean replaced the fruity, weighty, often green
olive oil with lighter, blander and transparent grape-seed oil. For
flavor, they added a touch of extra virgin olive oil and a
lemon-infused olive oil, made from the oil of the lemon peel
pressed into the olive oil before bottling. A bit of red wine
vinegar adds tartness.
</P>
<P>
   This dressing is starring in one of the airiest salads in the
city, a tangle of greens so light a strong breeze could scatter
them into the air. Tiny sprouts, edible chrysanthemums, curly cress
and kale are arrayed on a pinwheel of asparagus. The greens curl
and flutter, unfettered by their dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Equally light and mysterious is Matsuhisa Nobu's dressing for a
mesclun salad ringed by grilled shiitakes, served at both Nobu and
Next Door Nobu in Tribeca. There is a hint of citrus, a bite of
garlic and an invisible oil that lets the salad cling, oh so
lightly, to the greens. The secret ingredient is, again, the
unobtrusive grape-seed oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grape-seed oil has hardly any flavor,'' said Ricky
Estrellada, the head chef at Nobu. It works as a medium, through
which lemon juice, soy sauce, garlic puree, cayenne, salt and
pepper can blend. ``It is a neutral, so the flavor of the lemon
will come out, and it is just to emulsify the dressing,''
Estrellada added. Grape-seed oil is also low in saturated fat and
high in vitamin E.
</P>
<P>
   Nobu's salad dressings have always been light, Estrellada said,
``to let the flavors of the greens come through, and because it's
the beginning of the meal.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained, ``The lightness is for customers, so they do not
get full right away.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tabla, the house salad is presented as a jewel, not as a mere
appetizer. A translucent, paper-thin ring of cucumber surrounds
mesclun, topped by golden crisps of flaked rice or by glistening
ruby pomegranate seeds. The dressing, however, is always unseen,
slightly hot and tangy. The pivotal ingredients are lighter
versions of two thick and weighty Indian condiments: Patak's Mild
Lime Relish, intense and bitter, and mango chutney, sweet and
soothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to take strong flavors, and my food to have layers of
flavor,'' said Tabla executive chef Floyd Cardoz, who was born in
Goa, India. ``The reason I use lime pickle is because I love it,
although in India, this is one of the least popular flavors because
of the bitterness. But if you balance it out and cut it with sherry
and the mango chutney, you get a little sweetness, a little
acidity.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes the chutney and lime pickle lighter by blending them
with canola oil, red wine vinegar and a sherry cooked down to
concentrate the flavor. The dressing itself is matte orange, but on
the greens it is transparent. The flavor is piquant.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry and canola oil are the elusive elements in a fresh,
herbal vinaigrette at Local in Times Square. Executive chef
Franklin Becker cooks shallots in sherry and adds mustard, honey
and sherry vinegar. He drizzles two oils into the mixture, canola
for lightness and olive oil for fruitiness. At the very end, he
tosses in chopped fresh chervil, parsley, tarragon and optional
minced Nicoise olives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the sweetness of the sherry and the honey to bounce
off the spiciness of some of the greens,'' Becker said. The herbs
make the dressing sprightly. ``I chose the black olives to add a
briny note, to bring a nutty element into the salad,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that the salad is dressed, but not too much, how do
the chefs toss their salads? With their very clean hands.

RECIPES THAT DON'T COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chinese cookbooks often make too many concessions to what can
easily be found in the average supermarket. Others are
interpretive, presenting the author's personal take on the cuisine.
Too few offer uncompromising recipes for classic regional dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese Kitchen'' by Eileen Yin-Fei Lo (William Morrow,
$35) is one of the exceptions. Ms. Lo grew up in Sun Tak, in
Canton, before moving to the United States in 1959. She has taught
Chinese cooking for 20 years and has written six cookbooks. But
this one is her most ambitious, with 250 recipes plus chapters on
Chinese wines, teas, ingredients and culinary history.
</P>
<P>
   It includes definitive, well-tested recipes for familiar dishes
as well as for dishes not often translated onto English menus in
Chinatown. A banquet dish called Buddha Jumps Over the Wall takes
two full days to make and uses more than 27 ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of surprises. Smithfield ham, steamed with
brown sugar, makes a stand-in for unobtainable Yunnan ham, Ms. Lo
writes. And green tea leaves are used in a version of a classic
shrimp dish from the imperial court of Beijing. If you've ever been
curious about how to prepare jellyfish, Ms. Lo details it for you.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a book for the easily intimidated. Ms. Lo is
bent on preaching the purity of China's food ways. She offers no
shortcuts; the recipe procedures are exacting and can require many
steps and several sub recipes.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the steps are difficult, and many of the more
confusing ones are carefully _ and beautifully _ photographed in
color. If you were unsure exactly how to insert an air pump into a
neck for Peking duck, turn to the photos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lo lists few Western substitutions for hard-to-find
ingredients. I'm the type of cook who enjoys perusing the aisles of
bustling Chinatown markets to unearth boxthorn seeds or red dates.
But others with less patience might find it maddening. It took me
more than two hours of shelf searching to put together the
ingredients for the six recipes I wanted to test.
</P>
<P>
   I should have taken Ms. Lo's suggestion and brought along the
book or a photocopy. Then I would have been able to show the
shopkeeper the Chinese characters for the ingredients, which are
included in the informative pantry section of the book.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, I could not find the Tianjin preserved vegetable
(salted bok choi) for the Superior Soy Noodles in any of the
supermarkets I canvassed, so I had to return with the book the next
day. I was finally handed an earthenware crock with an untranslated
label as my prize. But the noodles were worth the trip.
</P>
<P>
   If you are willing to follow Ms. Lo in her mission, you will be
rewarded with often revelatory meals. Each dish I concocted tasted
as if it could have come from my favorite restaurant in Chinatown.
Chives stir-fried with shrimp were complex yet elegant; snow pea
shoots with crab meat were simple to make and delightful to eat.
</P>
<P>
   General Tso's chicken, which Ms. Lo explains goes by a different
name in China, was outstanding: pungent, spicy-sweet and perfectly
balanced. I even made soup dumplings, which burst with hot broth
when bitten into and barbecued pork, things I did not think could
be done at home. Ms. Lo's experienced, straightforward prose urged
me on.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few frustrating inconsistencies in the text. In a
recipe for shark's fin soup, for example, the ingredient list calls
for Chinese red vinegar. On the opposite page, another recipe
specifies Chinese red wine vinegar, while the recipe for the
dipping sauce for soup dumplings calls for Chinese red rice
distilled vinegar. The cook has no way of knowing if these all are
the same or three different vinegars. (They are not all the same.)
</P>
<P>
   A list of mail-order sources would be helpful, too, so you could
track down obscure ingredients _ without having to lug a heavy book
around Chinatown.

<P>
   1{ teaspoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   } teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger

</P>
<P>
   3. Heat a wok over high heat for 30 seconds. Add peanut oil, and
use a spatula to coat wok with oil. Add sugar and salt, and stir
briefly. As soon as you see white smoke, add ginger and hard stems
of garlic chives. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds, until fragrant.
Add shrimp, and stir well. Add wine and green parts of chives, and
lower heat to medium. Cook, stirring, for 1{ to 2 minutes, until
chives are bright green and shrimp turn pink. Add stock and
cornstarch mixture, and stir until it thickens, about 1 minute.
Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You may substitute regular chives. If you do so, cut them
into {-inch pieces and add with wine.

<P>
   WESTFIELD, N.J. _ Since it opened last year, the Williams-Sonoma
store here has recruited some pretty high-caliber part-time help.
Among its hires have been a Wall Street analyst, an auditor and a
human resources administrator.
</P>
<P>
   They are not between jobs, and they do not need the money ($6.50
an hour) or the employee discount. What they and others like them
are after is fun and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Fun and relaxation? On retail's frontlines? Oddly, yes. For
professionals tethered to tedious or stressful desk jobs, and for
women who delay their careers to care for children, working a cash
register, stocking shelves, even being at the beck and call of
customers can be downright therapeutic.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Glacken, 25, of Edison, N.J., works more than full time
as an analyst for a Wall Street investment bank. To wind down a
bit, he spends one day a weekend as a sales associate at the
Williams-Sonoma in Westfield. ``The pace I go at all day at work is
one of absolutely never-ending phone calls,'' he says. ``At the
store, I get a chance to take it all in: the kids running around,
the people talking about their families, about cooking. I love the
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Glacken's colleague, Patty Scanlon, 32, a quality-control
auditor for an industrial gas company who is now on leave to care
for her newborn son, working part time at Williams-Sonoma was a way
to rev up, not decompress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My full-time job wasn't particularly stressful, but all day
long it was business, business, business,'' Ms. Scanlon says. ``My
husband worked at the company, too, and sometimes, that's all we
talked about. I was fairly new to the area, and I wanted to get out
and meet people. At Williams-Sonoma I got to work with people my
own age. We talked about things like cooking. It was just so
different from my full-time job.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every upwardly mobile professional feels the need to be a
sales clerk in his or her spare time, of course. But such a choice
is not all that surprising, according to Barbara Reinhold, a
psychologist and the author of ``Toxic Work: How to Overcome
Stress, Overload and Burnout and Revitalize Your Career'' (Plume,
1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sound career-management and life-management tool,''
says Reinhold, the director of the career-development office at
Smith College in Northampton, Mass. ``For somebody who needs to
move around, to spend 40 hours a week in front of a computer, with
no other outlets, is an invitation to depression, anxiety, lower
back pain or abandonment by their immune system.'' Several of her
clients have taken retail jobs for fun, she says, and most are
``either stir-crazy moms of toddlers yearning to hear a complex
sentence again or extroverts who have ended up doing solitary work
such as writing, research or Web design and just need a periodic
hit of people chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Interaction with people is a big attraction for the
moonlighters, but for varying reasons. Perry Dixon, 36, an
industrial designer for ProD, a product-design company, says
working evenings and weekends at Restoration Hardware in Manhattan
helps him do his real job better. ``I'm fascinated by what people
buy and why,'' Dixon says. ``As a professional designer, I rarely
get to see a customer's reaction to what I've designed. Working
retail gives me a sense of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynette Duncan, 29, a human-resources administrator for Qumas, a
software company in Summit, N.J., began working part time at
Williams-Sonoma last year because her husband traveled a lot for
his job. ``I thought rather than sit home alone I'd get a second
job, be productive and meet people,'' says Ms. Duncan, who now
works at the store in Bridgewater, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Fuchs, 51, of Roselle Park, N.J., a full-time receptionist
at a pediatric practice, has returned for a second holiday season
at the Westfield Williams-Sonoma. She says the store and the
customers put her in the holiday spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their motives, the store's manager, Amy Better, 28, is
glad to have the part-timers' help. Because they are having fun,
there is a levity that makes the customers ``less cranky and more
apt to be patient,'' she says. Since the part-timers want to work
during the holidays, they make the season less stressful for the
full-timers who  &UR; have  &LR; to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could quit tomorrow if I wanted to,'' says Jennifer Davis,
35, a materials engineer for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Ms.
Davis works up to 20 hours a week at the Restoration Hardware in
Tysons Corner, Va., to keep busy and have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Her day job is in an office and involves a lot of paperwork and
technical writing, she says, so even when she is tired, ``I get a
second wind at the store.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with corporate careers _ or memories of them _ a big
attraction of working part time in a store is a lack of stress.
Jennifer Better, Amy's 35-year-old sister, used to be a brand
manager for companies like Reebok and Tumi but quit after starting
a family.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Better just began her second holiday season at
Williams-Sonoma, and, she said, ``When you walk out the door at the
end of your shift, you really are walking away.'' Her temporary job
has another benefit, she says: It teaches her daughters, age 4 and
2, `that mommies go to work, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the professionals who take part-time retail jobs
embarrassed when people they know spot them at the cash register?
Not at all, they say. Working at an upscale store like
Williams-Sonoma or Restoration Hardware is not like working in a
fast-food restaurant, which might give the impression that they are
in financial straits.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the pay is negligible for most of them. Even though
Glacken, the Wall Street analyst, has worked at Williams-Sonoma for
a year, he has to check his pay stub to be reminded he earns $6.50
an hour, the same as the temporary holiday hires. ``Well,'' he says
with a laugh, ``I should ask for a raise.''

EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE IN THE WALTZ OF THE CALENDARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA BELKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a changing rhythm in the workplace, a new dance between
employer and employee. Workers are proclaiming that their lives
count, and managers are responding with everything from job sharing
to on-site lactation rooms. I am a beneficiary of this evolution,
and a champion of it. But I never stopped to focus on how it looks
like from the other side _ the boss' side _ until my baby sitter
had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   That little girl was two months old when her mother broke the
news that she had decided to shorten her workweek to four days,
from five. I was racing to finish a book at the time, and I needed
her eight days a week, not four. I adored this woman. More
important, my sons adored her. She had been picking them up at
school since before they could remember, and they so loved their
afternoons at her house that they periodically asked to move in.
</P>
<P>
   How could I, who had left a structured job in the newsroom for a
more flexible life writing books, dismiss another mother for also
wanting to have more time for her children? On the other hand: What
about my work? I knew I couldn't do it in four days.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the decision grid of the turn-of-the-millennium
workplace, says Michael Losey, president and chief executive of the
Society for Human Resource Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Net additions to the work force are the lowest they have been
in half a century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Translated, that means there are 1 million to 2 million fewer
workers than there are jobs. This is why we are all working longer
and harder. It is also why companies that want to attract and
retain the shrinking pool of good workers (in my case, a great baby
sitter) have to be in the business of helping those workers manage
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, `We start at 8:30 and end at 5, and this is the
color shirt you wear,''' Losey says. ``Now it's, `What about flex
time? What about alternative work schedules?' It used to be, ``Your
child's sick, that's your problem.' Now it's, `We will pay you to
stay home with your sick child.'''
</P>
<P>
   Employers _ and here's the rub _ expect something in exchange
for all this caring. ``There's a point where the job has to get
done,'' says David Buda, executive vice president of Tzell Travel
in Manhattan which has a staff of 250 people on three floors, most
of them free agents whose success profits the company. To keep them
happy, the company built them a new $20,000 gym and a $70,000
outdoor deck. Exotic trips are awarded regularly and workers are
paid while they are off in Paris or Rio. This year's Halloween
celebration lasted the whole week.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting amid the carefully constructed happiness is the
receptionist, who dreams of being a rock star, and who started
taking off chunks of time earlier this year to promote her CD. ``We
were pulling for her to succeed,'' Buda says, but there was the
pesky problem of all those calls which weren't being answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally told her, `As much as we love you and want to
support you, we also need you here,''' he says. She was offered
three extra unpaid weeks off each year, in addition to her two
weeks of paid vacation, if she agreed to come in the rest of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   I worked out a similar arrangement with my baby sitter. Whenever
possible I cobbled alternate arrangements for Friday afternoons,
relying on friends, grandparents and high school students, who all
had complicated schedules of their own. But on weeks when all else
failed, and particularly on those Fridays when I was out of town,
she took the boys for an extra afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   We made this work for several months until her husband changed
jobs and she and her family moved away. Now my children come home
to an au pair, who doesn't want to even think about having babies
of her own until she finishes school and opens her own child care
center. What she does want, however, is to fly home to Halifax for
Christmas and stay there through New Year's _ if that's OK with me.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I have a deadline smack in the middle of those 10 days,
and my husband is on call. But she's wonderful with the boys, we're
lucky to have her, and I can write early in the morning if I really
have to. So she's booked her nonrefundable ticket, and I've blocked
out an unscheduled vacation. If my first column of the new year is
a little late, I'm sure my editor will understand.

`REFLECTIONS ON A RAVAGED CENTURY': `ISMS' IN PRISMS OF HISTORICAL
HINDSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Conquest calls Part I of his new book ``Mindslaughter,''
which is a suggestive and potent neologism if ever there was one.
Part II is ``Facing the Consequences,'' and anyone familiar with
this distinguished British historian's work will be able to guess
what consequences Conquest has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has chronicled the ravages of the 20th century more than
Conquest has, especially those caused by humankind's fatal and
fateful 20th-century belief that the world can be remade according
to a utopian design. His essential point in his new book,
``Reflections on a Ravaged Century,'' is that ideas were at the
root of 10 of millions of unnecessary deaths. They were, Conquest
writes, `` &UR; ideas &LR;  that claimed to transcend all problems, but were
defective or delusive, devastated minds and movements and whole
countries, and looked like plausible contenders for world
supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, Conquest is eminently worth reading, even if many of
the arguments one encounters in this new book have a familiar ring
and the book as a whole has a fragmentary quality. Here and there,
especially in Part II, he doesn't so much make arguments as express
irritation, for example, at what he sees as the ideological
excesses of environmentalism and feminism, and the way
``mindslaughter'' has affected liberal education, and the way the
pictorial arts have descended into ridiculousness.
</P>
<P>
   Readers who disagree with Conquest _ and there have always been
many _ will not be persuaded by these somewhat scattershot and
epigrammatic contentions, and those who agree will find little that
hasn't been said before on these topics.
</P>
<P>
   But Conquest is an eloquent and incisive man, and on his main
subjects _ the tenacity of malign ideas and humankind's seemingly
limitless capacity for deceit and self-deception _ he provides many
glowing embers of reasoned and wise argument. There is no crowing
in this book, no triumphalism over how its author, treated in many
circles as a Cold War ideologue, has been demonstrated by the
passage of time and the release of new documents to have been
correct in his most important descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Conquest's new book is an extended, discursive stock-taking,
like an urbane and erudite after-dinner speech delivered to an
ideologically friendly audience. He muses in melancholy judgment
over the century's great ``isms,'' Nazism and communism. He
searches for the underlying historical reasons that some societies
are closed while others are open. He asks in what ways
``mindslaughter'' remains an affliction.
</P>
<P>
   In one chapter, ``The Marxist Irruption: How and Why,'' Conquest
surveys the characteristics that gave Marx's 19th-century dogma
such appeal. Among them is the interesting idea that Marxism ``had
the advantages of both simplicity and complexity.'' It put forward
a powerful concept: that one class in society would inherit the
earth and in doing so usher in a utopia in which the state would,
as Marx wrote, ``wither away.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Marxism's complexities required that it be
interpreted by an intellectual vanguard. This vanguard thus had a
pretext for occupying positions of extreme power even while
supposedly melding with that working class whose hardships and
calluses it didn't have to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Conquest cites British parliamentarian Hugh Gaitskill in this
regard: ``Vagueness and complexity are not really limitations, but,
on the contrary, advantages. For they make the task of criticism
tedious and difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The author then turns to what he calls ``a sort of secondary
infection of the mental atmosphere of the West which still to some
degree persists.'' He means the odd and perplexing attraction that
Leninism and Stalinism had for many people in democratic countries,
especially the United States and Britain. Conquest reminds us of
some of the most familiar misjudgments of the Soviet Union, from
George Bernard Shaw's impression that no one was afraid of Stalin
and that ``everyone trusts him,'' to New York Times correspondent
Walter Duranty's failure to report on the devastating man-made
famine in the Ukraine in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were minds like jelly, ready for the master's imprint,''
Conquest remarks of the many travelers who went to Stalin's Russia
and returned favorably impressed. He accounts for the lapse in
critical judgment in several ways: the good reputation gained by
the Soviet Union for its support of the republicans in the Spanish
Civil War, the shock in the West over the ravages of capitalism,
and the use of the nice-sounding word socialism, which Conquest
calls ``a major mind-trap.''
</P>
<P>
   More sinister, in Conquest's view, was what he calls
``mirror-image McCarthyism,'' by which those who accused others of
being Soviet agents or spies in the West were in turn accused of
``smearing'' people or of being informers. ``If you do not like
communism, you are a red-baiter,'' George Orwell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, as Conquest covers this ground _ or rambles
over it _ that he quite accounts for the mystery that he evokes. He
cites W.B. Yeats' famous lines about the best lacking all
conviction while ``the worst'' are ``full of passionate
intensity.'' The reader, especially perhaps the sympathetic reader,
wishes that Conquest had more deeply explored the phenomenon of
passionate intensity, the power of uncomprehending
self-righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   But these ``reflections on a ravaged century'' are just that,
reflections rather than full-fledged examinations. In this sense
they are illustrations of Conquest's own temperament, his effort
over many years to hammer out a humanistic understanding, so that
``mindslaughter'' won't happen again.

SENEGAL TAKES SALSA, ADDS MBALAX AND MAKES MAGIC  
(DW)

<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal _ There's hardly a sound at three in the morning
in front of Chez Anthiou, a house much like any other on a sandy
middle-class street in this sub-Saharan city. But walk through a
leafy courtyard where couples embrace in the dark and open the
front door to this clandestine club.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, illuminated by just one pink neon light, a self-styled
Latin band, Super Cayor, is performing for a hot and sweaty crowd.
Friday, after the main Islamic prayer of the week, is salsa night.
But if it's an authentic salsa you're after, this is the wrong
place.
</P>
<P>
   On the dance floor the men are mostly still dressed in the long
flowing robes they wore to the mosque. Though many by now are
inebriated, they're mostly still deft at easily fitting the tricky
three-part salsa step into the four-four rhythm without stepping on
their partner's toes. But then, in the middle of a song, Super
Cayor speeds up the salsa beat and mutates it into Senegal's
polyrhythmic brand of Afro-pop known as mbalax. So salsa becomes
something else. The couples let go of each other and dance together
in groups, men lifting their knees into the air, women making
exaggeratedly sexual hip movements and teasing little skips and
jumps that bear little resemblance to anything Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Super Cayor's instrumentation is closer. The percussion section
does not have the essentials for the original salsa sound, like
congo drums, timbales or tumbas. The group has no trumpeter,
trombonist or any brass section at all, but Mbaul Birane Cisse, the
rhythm guitarist, said, ``We do have a toukhoro,'' a traditional
Senegalese wooden flute, ``and we imitate brass instruments on the
synthesizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Super Cayor does have its comparative advantages: a devastating
Senegalese percussion section, consisting of three types of local
sabar drums and the tama, or talking drum. It also has three strong
singers, though only one, Pascal, whose real name is Abdou Fata
Dieng, sings in a vaguely Latin style. The voices of the two
others, Mame Pathe Gadiaga, alias James, and Iba Ndiaye, alias
Mosquito, are distinctively Senegalese, a mix of Islamic and
pre-Islamic West African vocal traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their tunes _ which can be heard on ``African Salsa,'' a
CD compilation issued this year by the British label
Earthworks/Sterns _ are based on Cuban classics. But the lyrics are
in Senegalese languages, either the rhythmic Wolof or the poetic
Serer.
</P>
<P>
   Super Cayor toured Europe over the summer, performing at 14
festivals and seamlessly slipping between salsa and the very
different mbalax, which the singer Youssou Ndour made popular in
the 1980s by fusing traditional Senegalese songs with rock and
jazz. When mbalax and salsa are heard separately, it's hard to
imagine how they could ever work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the ones that figured out the logic shared by both
kinds of music,'' said Cisse, who is also the band's manager. ``We
are the inventors of salsa-mbalax.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Senegal has had many salsa musicians over
the years, many of whom incorporate local mbalax-type rhythms and
musical tunes. Various Latin styles that now fall under the
category of salsa have been popular here since at least the 1940s,
when Senegalese soldiers fighting World War II for France brought
back recordings of Latin bands popular then in Paris. Salsa was the
main pop music throughout much of Africa until the '60s, when
Africans began creating the various forms of Afro-pop, although
salsa never disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Since the earlier 1990s a rotating ensemble of well-known
African and Hispanic musicians have recorded together under the
name Africando. Though their hit song ``Yaye Boy'' is in Wolof, a
dozen or so singers from Cuba to New York have made their own
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Though Super Cayor may sound Latin, it remains close to its
Senegalese roots, taking its name from the ancient kingdom of
Cayor, which fought French colonial domination. The band members
mostly come from Thies, a crossroads town for many of Senegal's
ethnic groups and musical cultures. Two of the group's singers are
from griot families, the musician caste in many West African
societies, who traditionally go from town to village, a little like
troubadours in medieval Europe, singing and reciting local
histories.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the members also all grew up listening to salsa. ``Back
then people thought of salsa as a higher, more civilized form of
music than our own,'' Cisse says. ``We weren't even aware that it
was rooted in the music slaves brought from here to the New
World.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisse remembers the moment he became aware. He was listening to
a 1960's recording, ``Bembeya Jazz,'' from neighboring Guinea.
``Suddenly I realized there was something very familiar about the
rhythm,'' he said. ``It's no coincidence salsa and mbalax can be
interchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the musicians liked the idea of salsa-mbalax, Cisse
said. ``Some thought of it as old-fashioned.'' One even quit the
band, he said without specifying which one. ``But after a few
months he saw we were pulling in big crowds and he begged me to let
him back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Cuban salsa is almost forgotten in Senegal. ``Salsa-mbalax
is more alive,'' said Pierrot Ndour, an accountant who is often at
Chez Anthiou, ``because of course it doesn't have to follow the
rules.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A potent area of low pressure will move out of the southern
Rockies and into eastern Texas on Wednesday, bringing a swath of
snow with it. Snow will be heaviest in the front range of the
Colorado Rockies and will extend out into the Plains of eastern
Colorado and western Kansas. On the eastern edge of the
precipitation, there will be some rain mixing with the snow. Snow
will also fall in the mountains of New Mexico and eastern Utah.
Ahead of the low pressure system, moist flow from the south out of
the Gulf of Mexico will lead to showers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, high pressure will dominate the weather across the
Middle Atlantic states and into the Northeast. Very warm air over
this region will lead to afternoon readings being as much as 15 to
20 degrees above seasonal levels in spots. Most of the Southeast
will also be sunny and mild, although a few clouds and showers are
possible across the southern portion of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will be found across the northern Plains ahead of an area
of low pressure crossing the Canadian Prairie. Behind this front,
winds will descend the northern Rockies, drying the air and
bringing periods of sunshine to the far western Plains of Montana
and extreme northern Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Pacific storm will approach the Northwest Coast on
Wednesday, triggering some showers in coastal Washington. Most of
the rain associated with the system will remain offshore, however.
Farther south, abundant amounts of sunshine will stretch from
southern California into the deserts of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Jet Stream &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jet stream winds over 180 mph were clocked at 30,000 feet above
the western Pacific on Tuesday. Coming on the anniversary of the
bombing of Pearl Harbor, the observation was a reminder that the
sub-tropical jet stream was discovered during World War II. Before
then, high cirrus clouds streaking across the tropical sky had
hinted at fast westerly winds aloft. Proof of the jet stream's
existence waited until head winds forced U.S. bombers enroute to
Japan to turn back. Once, a bomber with an air speed of 200 mph
encountered mighty head winds that reduced the plane's ground speed
to zero. &QL;

THREE LIBERAL HOUSE MEMBERS ENDORSE BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley's long-shot presidential
bid received the backing of three House Democratic members from
western states Tuesday, raising his Capitol Hill endorsement total
to six House members and three senators.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's latest backers _ Reps. George Miller and Pete Stark of
California and Jim McDermott of Washington _ cited his universal
health care plan and pro-environment record as the main reasons for
their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley has put forward a big solution to one of the
biggest problems facing Americans today,'' Stark said, referring to
the 44 million who have no health insurance, 14 million of them
children. ``Mr. Bradley is the only candidate who's been willing to
say this is a problem we must address ... realizing there's a cost
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's congressional endorsements have been dwarfed by the
more than 130 that his competitor for the Democratic nomination,
Vice President Al Gore, has collected.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has consistently led Bradley in the polls, sometimes by as
many as 30 percentage points. Bradley, however, has gained on Gore
in New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary on Feb. 1.
A recent poll in the Concord (N.H.) Monitor put the two in a dead
heat with Gore at 45 percent and Bradley at 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, a psychiatrist who represents Seattle, said at a news
conference that both Gore and Bradley ``are good candidates and
would make good presidents. It isn't that we have anything bad to
say about Al Gore. We really feel Bill is the best one to do the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said: ``It really is about understanding what needs to be
done so we can stop the number of children who are losing health
care, stop the number of children not getting an adequate
education, and start closing the gap between minority and majority
children in our educational system.''
</P>
<P>
   The three especially praised Bradley's health plan, which he has
said would cost $55 billion to $65 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has criticized the plan as too costly and potentially
damaging to those with some insurance coverage. Bradley seemed to
play into Gore's hands last week when he said he would, if
necessary, consider raising taxes to pay for his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Stark said voters don't care much about the tax-hike issue
although, he added, ``maybe they will when all they get to see is
15-second sound bites. For now, we have the luxury of talking about
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller praised Bradley's environmental record, saying he was a
leader in a 1992 congressional battle over legislation to allocate
scarce water in California's agricultural Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Bradley was willing to take this fight on ... in the face
of a very well-organized constituency of large corporate farmers''
who threatened to withdraw financial support from lawmakers and
work against them unless they supported these farmers' water needs,
Miller said. ``He showed a great deal of integrity, courage and a
lot of skill in negotiating this through the Senate.''

NAPLES STANDS IN THE SUN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Italy _ For decades on end, Naples was the city that
Italy forgot and everyone else avoided. Poor. Dirty. Hopelessly
corrupt. A suburb of the Third World, where a foreigner could have
a purse or a wallet stolen in broadest daylight. It happened to me,
right on the main drag.
</P>
<P>
   But all that started to change in 1994, when the G-7 meeting of
world leaders inspired a cleanup effort here. Like every mayor of
every city that has played host to a summit conference in recent
years, Mayor Antonio Bassolino promised that the self-improvement
campaign would continue after the big shots had left town. Unlike
most of them, he kept his word.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I wrote that Naples looked ``like Eliza Doolittle
scrubbed and dressed in silks.'' It still does. Crime lingers on in
all its forms, but it is down sharply, and prudent visitors need
not worry. Neapolitans are as extravagantly, unreservedly
theatrical as ever, hugging and kissing in the narrow streets,
dodging mopeds, gabbing on cell phones, laughing, crying,
gesticulating molto con brio. This remains a city of Pagliaccis.
</P>
<P>
   And a city of eaters. With the lightest touch imaginable, good
Neapolitan cooks transform the bounty of the achingly beautiful Bay
of Naples, the vegetables grown in the rich, fertile soil of
Vesuvius and the fruits of the sun-blessed Sorrento peninsula into
simple but splendid meals.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most knowledgeable local trenchermen make a point of
eating often at Masaniello, a low-key, brick-walled restaurant
built beneath the vaults of a 500-year-old stable. Any sensible
person would go back again and again just for one of the simplest
dishes: cherry tomatoes picked at the moment of ultimate ripeness
and concentrated flavor from the slopes of the volcano, cut in
half, sauteed for a minute or two until they begin to break down,
then tossed quickly with pasta and Tuscan olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Food fit for the gods, but no better than two Neapolitan
classics that may well follow, an exquisite mixed fry of fish and a
boozy baba.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the word is seeping out. New Neapolitan restaurants have
opened in Rome and London. In the United States, where ``red
sauce'' has long been a term of derision among foodies, there is
fresh interest in the food of southern Italy, the Mezzogiorno.
Arthur Schwartz's treatise, ``Naples at Table'' (HarperCollins,
$27.50), was published in 1998; Rao's, a venerable Neapolitan-style
spot in New York's East Harlem, has become so chic that it's
opening a midtown branch; and Tony May, Naples-born but hitherto a
champion of northern Italian food at San Domenico, has put the kind
of dishes he ate in his childhood on the menu at Gemelli, his World
Trade Center outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively few Americans who come here (not counting the
military types based in Naples and the tourists who use it as a
jumping-off place for Pompeii, Capri and the Amalfi Coast) are
discovering the joys of the Neapolitan table. They quickly learn a
few hard lessons about the city's restaurants: the guidebooks are
mostly wrong, plainer is better and you can't eat panoramas. They
also learn about the demonic taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solo un consigilio,'' mine said with a dismissive shrug when I
lodged a protest as he sped through a red light. The light is only
a suggestion. Naples is not Milan; getting around town is always an
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake. Along with the sight of Vesuvius
silhouetted by the full moon and the inexhaustible exuberance of
the Neapolitans themselves, along with the Farnese bull in the
archaeological museum and the Titians and Bruegels in the
Capodimonte Museum, which has been rebuilt with the guidance of
German experts, eating can be one of the great joys of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   Duck into the hole in the wall called the Osteria della
Mattonella, on a back street in the Spanish Quarter, and you will
see how much Neapolitans can do with humble ingredients. It's a
tiny room, with space for 22 (small) people, tiled walls, oilcloth
on the tables, pictures of the great comedian Toto on the wall. The
sharp-featured host introduces himself as Peppino, brings wine in a
colorful Vietri pitcher and feeds you.
</P>
<P>
   To start, a strip of eggplant wrapped around mozzarella cheese
(made form a mixture of cow's and buffalo milk, Peppino said,
because all-buffalo cheese gets too gummy) and then deep-fried.
Then rigatoni with what the locals call ``genovese'' _ essentially
onion soup cooked down to a slightly syrupy consistency. And
finally _ as a separate course, mind you, not with the pasta _
polpette, or meatballs, in a light tomato sauce that cooks for 12
hours. This is common folks' food, the beef for the meatballs
having been ``stretched'' with a lot of bread soaked in cold water,
then squeezed dry. The result is light, juicy and throughly elegant
in its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   The night I was there, salt cod, plumped and rid of the
slightest salty taste by a bath of running water, was offered as a
fishy alternative, served in the same sauce. Again, poor people's
fare; salt cod is far less expensive than the seductive fresh fish
and shellfish on which you feast at Da Dora, a family trattoria on
a dark alley off the Riviera di Chiaia.
</P>
<P>
   Dora's spaghetti con vongole sets the standard for the whole
town. It is made with dime-sized clams, called ``vongole verace,''
colored a beautiful brown with cream stripes, plus olive oil,
garlic and gobs of parsley. The pasta is dressed when it is
blazingly hot, which helps it to drink in all the fruitiness of the
oil, the brininess of the clams and the herby freshness of the
parsley. Ecco! A cliche becomes a classic.
</P>
<P>
   I kept ordering things, because I was alone and the plates
headed elsewhere looked so good. Each dish was a study in glorious
simplicity: a little heap of deep-fried calamari, flavored with a
few drops of juice from a sweet-tart Sorrento lemon; four grilled
scampi, their long, charred shells lending them an evocative
seaside taste and aroma; a delicate little fish from Capri called,
I think, a pezzogna, cooked in a spicy bouillon called acqua pazza
(``crazy water''); and a plate of wild strawberries with perfect
lemon sorbet. The waiter wrote out the name of the fish for me; it
tasted like orata or another of the breams, but I can find no
reference to it anywhere, not even in Alan Davidson's encyclopedic
``Mediterranean Seafood.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But then Neapolitan cooking is full of unfamiliar ingredients.
At the nearby Cantina di Triunfo, in a rustic setting that lurks
behind a crumbling facade, I made the acquaintance of friarelli, a
variety of broccoli rape, spiced with red pepper, served at room
temperature. The Cantina's food is cooked to old recipes, mostly
regional. There is no menu; the half-dozen items on offer are
described with both passion and precision by Tina Concetta, one of
the owners, as she makes the rounds of the eight tables.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the short ribs of veal, a weakness of mine, but I loved
a dish of bucatini pasta, dressed with a sauce of cherry tomatoes,
eggplant, bell peppers and basil, whose ripe flavors blended into
something rich, ``meaty'' and altogether new. And I was blown away
by a little pastry barquette filled with superb whipped cream and
unbelievable lemon marmalade _ those Sorrento lemons again. The
recipe, Ms. Concetta said, came from Procida, a tiny island not far
from Ischia.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, I reflected, that the French consul brought Francois
Mitterrand to this little place during the summit. For all I ate,
plus more red wine than I could drink and a first-rate grappa, I
paid $35.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Faith Willinger, the Florence-based American food
writer, took me to meet her friends Eugenio and Alfonso Mattozzi,
father and son, at their restaurant, Europeo, a more bourgeois
place near the university. There the ingredients were a little more
expensive, but it was still the ingredients and not the legerdemain
of the chef that jumped off the plate at you. (Although they shared
a little trade secret with me: in winter, when the body needs more
calories, they add some pork to the tomato sauce and cook it
longer.)
</P>
<P>
   We met an old ingredient in a new form: grilled red mullet the
size of anchovies, crisp and eloquently gamy. New ingredients, too:
a soup of mussels and zucchini flower buds, unopened and unstuffed,
and a white (tomatoless) pizza with ventresca, a sort of belly fat
smoked over pine boughs.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, pizza. Invented by Neapolitans, they claim; certainly
perfected by them. Forget the anchovies and pepperoni. The thing to
order is a margherita, a small individual pie named after a
19th-century Italian queen; it is made with basil, tomatoes and
cow's milk mozzarella _ green, red and white, the colors of the
Italian flag.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to look like a native, fold the pizza in two or four
_ ``a libretto,'' like a book _ and eat it out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   You can try one at Brandi, where it was invented; at Di Matteo,
in the heart of Spaccanapoli, the old city, where President
Clinton, no pizza neophyte, hung out during the summit; or at my
favorite, Trianon, where the pies emerge from the cherrywood-fired
oven with blistered brown bits around the edges. Trianon is just
across the street from Da Michelle, which many locals consider the
best in town. As a result, Da Michelle is usually impossible to get
into.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza dough is put to countless uses in Naples. At Don
Salvatore, a handsome ocher-and-white restaurant with vaulted
ceilings, it comes as wedges of bread, topped with coarse salt and
herbs, to eat with the house's flawless rendition of insalata
caprese: tomatoes with the perfect Neapolitan balance between acid
and sweetness, sliced mozzarella, basil, black pepper, a little
dried wild oregano and extra virgin olive oil. It's a kind of
deconstructed pizza margherita. On the hills above the city, at the
Friggitoria Vomero, they make succulent fritters by deep-frying
little wads of dough.
</P>
<P>
   At Mimi alla Ferrovia, a jolly place near the train station,
where the waiters love to banter, laugh and swap jokes with their
customers, they turn pizza dough into a savory escarole pie. They
also wrap it around an orata, carving mock scales on the sides. The
fish is steamed inside the crust, locking the juices and vapors in
until it can be boned and served.
</P>
<P>
   The escarole pie is part of Mimi's ample antipasto. An even
larger one, plenty for a meal, is served at Al 53, a brasserielike
establishment that I visited one Sunday noon, when most restaurants
are closed. The waiter set a dozen little plates on the table _
three vegetables in oil, three grilled or deep-fried (including
oyster mushrooms), pieces of octopus with lemon juice, slices of
two kinds of frittatas, two kinds of fritters (vegetable and
cheese) and a baseball-size, slightly flattened, chewy, sour and
slightly salty mozzarella, by all accounts the best in town.
</P>
<P>
   That and a dense, aromatic coffee, served in an overgrown shot
glass, more than satisfied me.
</P>
<P>
   But miniature cannoli _ crisp, about two inches long, and filled
with light, fresh pastry cream, in sharp contrast to the gross,
soggy things you usually see in the United States _ came with the
coffee. Naples is like that; little extras all the time. Since
meals are so light, usually cream-free and often meat-free, people
here always have room for snacks.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned the fritters up in middle-class Vomero; it also has
the city's best ice cream shop, Otranto, where yes, again, the
flavor to order is lemon _ ice cream, not sorbet. For fancy
pastries, Moccia is the place. For gossip and espresso, it's
Gambrinus, on the piazza del Plebiscito, a onetime parking lot that
has been swept clear of cars by the mayor. So now you can study the
Royal Palace as you sip, or watch the pretty girls and the handsome
boys watching each other from their Vespas as they zip by.

 &HT;    What's your game? A lot depends on your economic status
 &HT;    (EDS: Part One/Sidebar _ runs with FLALOTTERY-MAIN1.)

<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Though three out of four Floridians play the
Florida Lottery, how much they gamble and what games they play vary
widely.
</P>
<P>
   For most middle-class and well-to-do Floridians, lottery means
Lotto, the agency's flagship game that dangles millions, even tens
of millions, as a possible reward for a $1 bet.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Palm Beach Post newspaper computer analysis, the
best-educated Floridians spend an average $102 a year per person on
lottery tickets _ 51 percent of it on Lotto. A mere 16 percent goes
toward Cash 3 and Play 4 _ the daily games modeled after the
illegal numbers rackets that predate the advent of modern state
lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   In the poorest, least-educated neighborhoods, those percentages
are almost completely reversed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 neighborhoods with the lowest education levels, the
average lottery spending was $221 per person _ only 21 percent of
it on Lotto and 36 percent on the daily games.
</P>
<P>
   The considerably higher per-person spending meant residents of
poorly educated neighborhoods still spent nearly as much as their
well-educated counterparts on Lotto; it's just that they spent four
times as much on Cash 3 and Play 4.
</P>
<P>
   Why the great interest in games whose top prizes are $500 and
$5,000?
</P>
<P>
   Because, said Duke University lotteries expert Philip Cook,
those smaller jackpots aren't so small to those who don't make much
money to start with.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who are just getting by, those numbers are very
good,'' Cook said. ``For more comfortable people, those three-digit
winnings are not the stuff fantasies are made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, whether Cash 3 or Lotto, the long-term payoff is
statistically the same: For every $1 you win, you will have paid $2
for the pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the daily games and Lotto is the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Betting $10 a night on Cash 3, and its 1,000-to-1 odds, you will
likely have won the $500 top prize once after just 3 1/2 months,
but will have spent $1,000 doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Betting $10 two nights a week on Lotto and its nearly
23,000,000-to-1 odds, you will _ if you could somehow live so long
_ likely have won an $11.5 million jackpot after 22,000 years. You
would have gambled $23 million winning it.

 &HT;    Lottery draws least-educated, poor
 &HT;    (EDS: Package one/Part one; runs with FLALOTTERY-HOWMANY.)
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ If your first-grader gets to attend
brand-new Binks Forest Elementary in Wellington next month, thank
Delray Beach appliance installer Howard Anthony James.
</P>
<P>
   If your daughter goes to Florida State on a Bright Futures
Scholarship, thank West Palm Beach shipyard retiree Eddie
``Cowboy'' Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's James _ $10 in lottery tickets a day _ and Brown _
$20 to $30 a day _ and hundreds of thousands like them in Florida's
least-educated, poorest communities who disproportionately buy
Florida Lottery tickets _ and thus lighten the education tax load
on everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   How disproportionately?
</P>
<P>
   People in Florida's least-educated neighborhoods spend an
average of $221 a year on lottery tickets, twice what those in the
best-educated areas spend, according to a Palm Beach Post newspaper
computer analysis.
</P>
<P>
   If income is factored in, the contrast becomes yet more stark:
Florida's least-educated spend nearly seven times as much of their
income on lottery tickets as Florida's best-educated, 2.35 percent
compared to 0.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These spending patterns have not gone unnoticed by the lottery:
In Florida's least-educated neighborhoods, there are three times as
many lottery outlets _ convenience stores, liquor stores, even pawn
shops and payday loan stores _ as there are in the better-educated
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   And now, lottery marketing experts want to promote the low-prize
games favored by players like Brown and James to increase sales
even more next year, according to documents obtained by The Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Post's findings match patterns nationally. What sets Florida
apart are the games' proceeds, much of which now flow to
public-school construction and state university scholarships. The
overwhelming majority of the new schools built with lottery money
are in middle- and upper-middle-class suburbs _ the fastest-growing
neighborhoods in Florida. Almost 90 percent of the university
scholarships generated by the lottery go to middle-class and
affluent children.
</P>
<P>
   Which means this: The poorest, least-educated Floridians bear
the greatest burden paying for new schools their children don't
attend and scholarships their kids rarely win.
</P>
<P>
   Players are not equal
</P>
<P>
   Approved by voters in 1986, the Florida Lottery has been running
instant, daily and weekly games since 1988. It, like other
lotteries in other states, is the single largest gambling
enterprise in Florida, selling about $2 billion in tickets each
year.
</P>
<P>
   But while the lottery depicts a Florida where nearly all its
residents participate in a harmless, entertaining fashion and
roughly equally across ethnic and socio-economic boundaries, The
Post's analysis rebuts that contention.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery play is closely tied to educational attainment. In the
100 neighborhoods with the most poorly educated adults, per-capita
lottery spending was $177 in budget year 1998-99. In the 25
least-educated neighborhoods _ where an average 58 percent of the
adults did not graduate high school _ the per-person spending is
$221.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, spending in the 25 most highly educated
neighborhoods _ where only 8 percent of adults haven't graduated
high schools and nearly half have a bachelor's degree or higher _
is $102 per person.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 poorest neighborhoods have per-capita lottery spending of
$191. The 25 neighborhoods with the greatest proportion of blacks
spend $182 a person, while the 25 most Hispanic neighborhoods spend
an average $224 per person on lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery, meanwhile, has made it easier for their best
customers to buy their tickets, flooding those communities with
ticket vendors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 most poorly educated neighborhoods, there are 973
residents per lottery vendor. In the 25 best-educated
neighborhoods, lottery vendors are nearly three times as scarce:
2,521 residents per outlet.
</P>
<P>
   The Post's findings match those of the lottery itself, which, in
an August 1998 survey, found that college graduates
disproportionately make up the Floridians who never play the
lottery. Conversely, high school dropouts are disproportionate
among those Floridians who play it the most.
</P>
<P>
   The Post's results also closely match those of the National
Gambling Impact Study Commission's survey released this summer of
more than 6,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   A call for limits
</P>
<P>
   That report found that 20 percent of all lottery players buy 82
percent of all the tickets. And within that 20 percent, there are
twice as many dropouts and blacks as there would be in the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   In its final report, the commission recommended ``that states
with lotteries reduce their sales dependence on low-income
neighborhoods and heavy players in a variety of ways, including
limiting advertising and number of sales outlets in low-income
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush _ who said he disliked the lottery's ``something
for nothing'' ethic when he took office but since then has asked
the lottery to increase sales by $524 million over the next four
years _ called The Post's analysis ``potentially flawed'' and
``statistically questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush cited lottery department figures showing that the income
and educational levels of the average player are slightly higher
than those of the average Floridian _ a statistic that fails to
address how heavily or lightly various segments of the population
buy lottery tickets. He did not respond to questions asking him to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery Secretary David Griffin said he didn't accept the
methodology of matching lottery sales in a particular neighborhood
with overall demographic characteristics. ``That right there, to
me, is flawed,'' he said, adding that the analysis could not tell
which residents within a particular neighborhood were buying the
most or fewest tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, who worked at the Ohio Lottery prior to coming to
Florida in July, added that he was not familiar with the national
commission's study results.
</P>
<P>
   Other lottery experts, however, validated The Post's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Cook, a professor of economics and sociology at Duke
University and the author of a book and numerous academic articles
on state lotteries, said the sales-to-neighborhood analysis, while
not perfect, is useful. ``It gives you a rough idea of what's going
on,'' he said. ``There's no perfect method.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally known anti-gambling activist Tom Grey said lotteries
around the country try to dismiss statistics that show heavy
lottery sales in poor, largely minority communities. But if the
communities' residents aren't buying all those tickets, Grey asked,
who is?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of wealthy people driving into those poor
neighborhoods to buy their tickets?'' Grey wondered, laughingly.
``Most people avoid those neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Florida Lottery's own surveys show that most
players buy tickets in their own neighborhoods for the sake of
convenience. The August 1998 survey found that up to 77 percent of
players buy their tickets close to home, while 11 percent buy them
near work and the remainder buy them at both places.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin did not dispute the heavier concentrations of lottery
vendors in poor neighborhoods, but said that is a function of
zoning laws and the locations of convenience stores and mom-and-pop
grocers that have traditionally wanted to sell tickets. ``It's just
the way the layout is,'' he said. If poor people are playing the
lottery more, he added, that's their right as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell anyone, whether they are poor, whether they are
wealthy: The lottery is here. It offers hope,'' Griffin said. ``I
wouldn't want anyone to buy a lottery ticket instead of a loaf of
bread. But you know what? If they are, that's their choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lottery as a pastime
</P>
<P>
   Lottery players in the poor neighborhoods that accounted for
some of the top sales in Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties
told The Post that they buy lottery tickets _ $10, $20, up to $100
a day _ for the entertainment value and with more of a sense of
resignation than hope. They know they are losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 80, the shipyard retiree, said he won $5,000 in July but
knows he spends more than he's won. ``I'm not married and I guess
it's a habit,'' he said. ``Whatever I have, I play.''
</P>
<P>
   James, 45, the appliance installer from Delray Beach, said he is
irked that poor neighborhoods do not see the new schools that the
wealthier areas are getting from Lottery proceeds, but he continues
to play anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``A poor guy like me is going to work and make a million and buy
a Mercedes?'' asked James. ``I play and I'm still losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, players tell the lottery's marketing
consultants their main reasons for buying tickets are ``to make
extra money'' and ``to fulfill dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambling experts said the contradiction is typical among
frequent gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see themselves as lucky,'' said Robert Ziller, a
professor of social psychology at the University of Florida and a
former Air Force psychologist in Reno, Nevada. ``They see
themselves as in control. Of course, in order to do that, they have
to fudge the figures in their minds. . . . They selectively attend
to the wins and not to the losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke University's Cook, who co-authored the national gambling
commission's survey this summer, said poorer, less-educated players
particularly are prone to the superstitions, such as numerology and
astrology, that attempt to turn picking numbers into a science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes more like investing in the stock market than
rolling the dice,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether players know exactly what they're doing is beside
the point for gambling foes. The real question, said Stanley
Marshall, director of the conservative James Madison Institute in
Tallahassee: Ought state government encourage and profit from the
lottery habits of the worst off?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to live to see the day when we've either abolished the
lottery or changed it so it doesn't exploit the poor,'' said
Marshall, a former president of Florida State University.
</P>
<P>
   Answered Lottery Secretary Griffin: ``The people voted and said,
`We want a lottery.' I'm not going to debate about whether it's
wrong or right.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW THIS SERIES WAS DONE:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales figures and the locations of the 12,751 Florida outlets
that sold 2 billion lottery tickets in budget year 1998-99 were
obtained from the Florida Lottery and sorted by postal ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   _ Population and demographic data were obtained from the U.S.
Census Bureau for all Florida ZIP codes, and updated using 1998
bureau estimates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tourist centers, outlets on Florida's northern border and
areas where census data could not be linked to ZIP codes were
eliminated from the analysis. Because of this, 9.8 percent of
lottery sales and 6.7 percent of total population were discarded
from the final analysis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Using a computer, the demographic data was linked to the
lottery data, producing a snapshot of the racial and economic
makeup of the neighborhoods surrounding lottery outlets.

WESTERN LEADERS BLAST RUSSIAN ULTIMATUM IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a growing chorus of outrage, leaders of western
nations condemned Russia on Tuesday for threatening to kill all
residents left in the Chechen capital of Grozny as part of a
campaign to end a move toward independence by the Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
   George Robertson, NATO's new secretary general, warned Russian
leaders that their threat is ``utterly unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's ultimatum for residents to leave Gorzny or face a
massive artillery and aerial bombardment ``is something civilized,
decent people are not willing to tolerate,'' Robertson told
reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after a meeting with President Clinton, Robertson called
the on-going Russian military assault on the city and the looming
threat ``disproportionate'' to the goals they seek.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said western leaders were not trying to isolate Russia
diplomatically. ``The message we give to them is not one of
hostility, it is of constructive advice on how we believe they
could best deal with the serious situation that they confront in
Chechnya,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that they will change their tactics and bear in mind
very much the humanitarian concerns being expressed across the
globe, as well as the implications for surrounding states,'' said
Robertson, who assumed the top NATO post in October.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders on Monday issued the ultimatum to Grozny
residents in the form of leaflets air-dropped over the republic
capital. ``You are surrounded, all roads to Grozny are blocked. You
have no chance of winning,'' read one such leaflet. ``Those who
remain will be viewed as terrorists and bandits ... All those who
do not leave the city (by Saturday) will be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, while expressing support for
the Russian military's bid to ``combat terrorism'' in the region,
said Tuesday that ``the manner in which they are carrying out this
activity is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Russian troops ``appear to be engaged in
indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians, and on a rather
substantial scale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that they must arrive at a political solution and
encourage them to do that,'' Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart repeated a warning President
Clinton made Monday. ``They will pay a price for pursuing a policy
that isolates them from the international community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders expressed similar outrage Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac called the Russian assault
``unacceptable'' and urged a peaceful solution. Italy's Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema said Tuesday that Russia's ``horrible and
unacceptable'' offensive must stop.
</P>
<P>
   While the West has ruled out a military response to the Russian
actions in Chechnya, European leaders were mulling possible
economic sanctions against Moscow, a topic expected to come up this
weekend at a European Union summit in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned of economic
repercussions if Russia does not reverse course. The West ``cannot
continue to assist Russia if Russia does not respect basic
humanitarian norms,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, took a different view on aid to
Russia, saying economic aid to Russia serves U.S. national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the aid that we provide to Russia, the vast
majority of it is to make our life safer,'' said Lockhart. ``The
vast majority of that aid goes to reducing their nuclear threat,
and I don't know the productivity of removing that assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian workers believe that the war in Chechnya has killed
hundreds of civilians, while causing up to 200,000 refugees to
flee. There are believed to be about 40,000 residents left in the
city, which once had a population of 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya declared independence from Moscow in 1991 as the Soviet
Union was disintegrating. Russia launched a military campaign
against the republic and destroyed much of Grozny in 1994 through
1996, although Russian forces ended up retreating from the region
after suffering heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent military foray, which includes about 100,000
Russian troops, was launched after several bomb attacks in Moscow
were blamed on Chechen separatists.

   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
wont be doing much New Years Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likainst the Unitev States.
</P>
<P>
   We will prevent that from occurring, said Air Force Lt. Col. Jon
Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and theyll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russias
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on themanifest itself on New Years Day, said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the
confrph6AsJQ

<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ A $2 billion-a-year industry doesn't survive on
luck alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated marketing efforts make up the backbone of the
Florida Lottery, which each day, seven days a week, 365 days a
year, spends an average $99,000 encouraging Floridians to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing, for example, that took note of two years of increases
for the low-prize Cash 3 and Play 4 games, and now plans to boost
sales by another $10 million this year with a spring advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for instance, that saw the tendency of many Lotto players to
open their wallets only when the jackpot hits ridiculous levels _
such as Wednesday's drawing, now estimated at $42 million _ and
responded with a plan to increase the game's take by $96 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bright, snazzy television commercials, catchy radio jingles,
newspaper ads that glamorize the fun and excitement of winning big
money _ all designed, according to internal Lottery Department
documents, to get the 25 percent of Floridians who don't now buy
lottery tickets to start, and the 75 percent who already buy them
to buy even more.
</P>
<P>
   How much more?
</P>
<P>
   This year, under a new governor who says he opposes the
lottery's ``something-for-nothing'' ethic, the agency wants
Floridians to spend $200 million more on lottery tickets than they
did last year, on the way to spending $500 million more _ a 25
percent increase _ by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers are ambitious targets for a lottery whose sales
have been essentially flat for nine years, and Florida Lottery
officials have undertaken a major restructuring to get there,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Retooling the flagship Lotto game to increase the number of
large jackpots the lottery believes are necessary to bring out
frenzied ticket-buying from infrequent players. Officials
accomplished this by worsening the already astronomical odds by 65
percent and doubling the frequency of drawings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Introducing, with a big advertising campaign, yet another game
to fill a perceived niche between the $20,000 prize available in
Fantasy Five and the multimillion jackpots in Lotto. ``Mega
Money,'' with its $200,000 top prize, debuted in May, and officials
hope it will sell $106 million in tickets by the end of the budget
year next June.
</P>
<P>
   _ Researching and specifically targeting, according to documents
obtained by The Palm Beach Post newspaper, players of Cash 3 and
Play 4. These games are highly popular among the poorest,
least-educated players, a Post computer analysis shows.
</P>
<P>
   This last goal, if accomplished, would only increase the already
disproportionate amount of money wagered on the lottery by
Florida's worst-off residents. According to the Post's computer
analysis, the lowest average education levels already account for
twice as many lottery tickets per capita than the best-educated
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   If income is factored in, then the least-educated and poorest
Floridians are spending nearly seven times as much of their money
on lottery tickets as the best educated and wealthiest _ with the
bulk of those sales concentrated in instant tickets and the two
daily games.
</P>
<P>
   The Post analysis also found that the least-educated
neighborhoods already have three times as many lottery outlets per
person as those neighborhoods where Florida's best-educated live _
with lottery vendors in thousands of convenience stores, 800 liquor
stores, even 156 payday loan stores and five pawnshops.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not just bad public policy,'' said Stanley Marshall,
head of the conservative James Madison Institute and a former
president of Florida State University. ``That's borderline
immorality.''
</P>
<P>
   Targeting gamblers
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials cringe at the notion that they target any
socioeconomic or ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not targeting advertising,'' Lottery Secretary David
Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the agency's own marketing documents show the lottery and
its advertising agencies use sophisticated analyses to aim both
products and pitches directly at specific audiences.
</P>
<P>
   A July 15 marketing plan by the Miami advertising agency Sanchez
and Levitan, for instance, concluded that among Hispanic players,
the average jackpot needed to boost ticket sales increased from $24
million in 1998 to $31 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the already prevalent notion among players that the
odds are too poor, the report advised that the recent Lotto
restructuring needed to be sold as ``a way to improve perceptions
of winning viability'' and doubling both ``fun'' and ``the chances
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Griffin disavows the ad agency's report _ as
well as any report predating his July 19 arrival, for that matter _
the advice was followed to the letter when the lottery rolled out
new and improved Lotto in October: ``The result will be more
chances to win, more rollovers that yield larger jackpots over the
long run, and a lot more excitement all the way around!'' according
to the department's news release announcing the change.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the news release was mentioned that the odds got far
worse: from 1 in 14 million under old Lotto to 1 in 23 million in
new Lotto.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery's print and television ads promoting new Lotto do
state _ in tiny print _ the odds for winning the new game, but
don't mention that they are considerably worse than before.
</P>
<P>
   Selling a dream
</P>
<P>
   Advertising experts point out that the medium's role is not to
tell the whole truth, but to sell a product. Just as McDonald's
doesn't explain in its ads how much fat and cholesterol are in a
Big Mac, the lottery ought not be expected to emphasize its lousy
odds, said Florida State University advertising Professor Barry
Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertiser is not going to present both sides of the
equation,'' Solomon said. ``Advertising is a form of advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all states with lotteries, however, sell them that way.
</P>
<P>
   Some, for example, ban the portrayal of children in lottery
advertising, under the rationale that minors are inappropriate in
something that promotes gambling. Others, like Wisconsin, require
that the odds of winning be prominently stated. Billboards there
devote more than half the available space to a listing of the odds
for the various prize levels.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia bans advertising that encourages anyone to play. ``No
inducements. Information only. We don't show Rolls Royces and
mansions and things,'' said spokeswoman Sherie Phaup, explaining
that the mere presence of a lottery was divisive in such a
conservative, religious state. ``It was a touchy issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The state of Massachusetts three years ago banned all
advertising except for ``point-of-sale'' displays, leaving a
$400,000 annual advertising budget for signs and posters in the
stores that sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has no such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery has used children in ads, in speaking roles in spots
highlighting families who have won Lotto. It has produced big,
extravagant ads that portray lottery games as high excitement. And
up until Griffin's arrival late this summer the odds of winning
weren't given at all.
</P>
<P>
   That has now changed, Griffin said. ``Odds go on everything.
That was my directive.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said he doesn't know why some Lotto billboards _ one in
Tallahassee, for example, about a block from lottery headquarters _
still do not present the odds of winning, but promised that, too,
will be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   An $800 million habit
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Jeb Bush took office, he said he did not like the idea
of the state, through the lottery, promoting a
``something-for-nothing'' ethic.
</P>
<P>
   How does he reconcile that with his approval for the lottery to
boost its sales from $2 billion to $2.5 billion by 2003?
</P>
<P>
   Bush told The Post that the state's obligation to maximize
education money from the lottery while preserving the ``dignity of
the state and the welfare of its citizens'' was ``a unique
challenge that requires a balance.'' He called the goal to increase
sales by $500 million _ and the lottery's contribution to education
by $200 million _ consistent with his goal ``to promote the slow
and sustained growth of the Florida Lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, is not the first governor to start out
criticizing the lottery but come, if not to embrace, then at least
to accept the agency that funnels $800 million into the state
treasury each year. Gov. Lawton Chiles called the lottery ``a
sucker's bet'' when he took office nine years ago, yet by the end
of his second term agreed to pledge 30 years of lottery proceeds to
pay off $2.5 billion in school construction bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Just as lotteries can make addicts of their players, critics
charge, so can they hook the state governments on the money they
generate.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why even anti-gambling governors such as Chiles and
Bush can learn to live with a $2 billion-a-year gambling
enterprise, said the Rev. Tom Grey, an Illinois minister who
travels the nation fighting attempts to institute lotteries and
casino gambling. To do so is easier than try to wean the government
off so much easy money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's government's dirty little secret,'' Grey said. ``It's
better to take the money and not look.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Florida, state government has proven it can rid itself of
a tax that generates $1 billion _ if it wants to, said Marshall of
the James Madison Institute, which this year merged with
then-candidate Bush's Foundation for Florida's Future, a nonprofit
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a precedent,'' he said: the intangibles tax, which
Marshall's group strongly supported eliminating because of its
effect on people who save, rather than spend, their money as well
as on businesses. The legislature and Bush are on their way toward
eliminating the various elements of the tax over several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a political will to do it, there's a way,'' said
Marshall, whose group provided the intellectual underpinnings for
the intangibles tax repeal as well as public school vouchers _ both
of which were embraced by Bush and Republican leaders. ``If we can
do it for the intangibles tax, why can't we do it for the
lottery?''

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ They know where you live. They know how much
Spanish language television you watch. They know how much you spend
on Lotto each week, and they think they have a way to make you
spend more.
</P>
<P>
   They are the Florida Lottery's Hispanic marketing experts, and
they've got your number.
</P>
<P>
   Lapsed Lotto player? Forty-four percent are Cuban, 12 percent
Puerto Rican and 22 percent Nicaraguan, according to research
generated by Sanchez and Levitan, the Miami-based advertising
company that handles the lottery's Hispanic advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Over 50 years old? Hispanics that age who play the lottery ``are
heavy television users'' but ``light newspaper users,'' according
to a July 15 marketing plan that talks about increasing sales of
the flagship game by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   New Florida Lottery Secretary David Griffin said the report was
created before his arrival and therefore carries no weight with
him, even though it was prepared and presented under interim
Secretary Sue Cobb, a fellow appointee of Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he does not intend to specifically target
minorities or demographic groups but did not see anything wrong
with a marketing plan aimed at Florida's largest ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of state government also make a point of seeking out
and addressing Hispanic residents _ the Health Department, the
Division of Elections, the Department of Education, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Those agencies, however, typically provide the same message to
Hispanics that they provide to the general population, just in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery, in contrast, pays Sanchez and Levitan $300,000 a
year _ on top of $2.5 million a year for its general marketing
campaign _ to treat Hispanics as a completely separate market for
its tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials are not only in Spanish, but aim at a completely
different popular culture. Witness last year's Candido the lucky,
dancing ticket vendor, who cavorts among a troupe of young,
beautiful women who sing his virtues as gold coins fall from the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   One recent television commercial in English is a series of
people winning the lottery to the jingle of ``Whole Lotta Lotto
Going On,'' a take off of ``Whole Lot of Shakin' Going On.'' But
that doesn't translate well into Spanish and commercials on Spanish
television are rarely based on a jingle.
</P>
<P>
   So for Spanish-language television, advertisers created ``Manolo
el Bodeguero,'' a caricature of the Cuban-Hispanic stereotype of a
know-it-all who talks so fast and incessantly that no one else can
get a word in. A bodeguero is a man who runs a bodega, a small
corner convenience-grocery store, the kind that sell so many
lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Sanchez and Levitan declined to be interviewed for
this report, referring all questions on the ad campaign back to the
Florida Lottery.

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Pop quiz: Of the following, the number one
purveyor of gambling last year was:
</P>
<P>
   A) Gulfstream Park;
</P>
<P>
   B) Palm Beach Kennel Club;
</P>
<P>
   C) Dania Jai-Alai;
</P>
<P>
   D) Publix supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   If you guessed Publix _ the same company that resisted opening
its stores on Sundays until 1983 and to this day avoids the word
``Halloween'' in its ads for much of Florida _ you guessed right,
according to statistics provided by the Florida Lottery and the
state Department of Business and Professional Regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In budget year 1998-99, the 483 Publix stores in Florida sold
more than a quarter of a billion dollars in lottery tickets,
accounting for one of every eight tickets sold in the entire state.
The total represents more than any other gambling enterprise in
Florida _ with the possible exception of casinos run by American
Indian tribes and the so-called ``cruises to nowhere,'' neither of
whom have to report their revenues to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Publix spokeswoman Jennifer Bush said the grocery chain offers
lottery tickets for the same reason it carries laundry detergent or
orange juice: The customers want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a moral issue. We are a retailer. We don't take
positions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our eyes, lottery tickets are just like a gallon of milk
... We know we have a lot of customers, obviously, who want to buy
that product.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials have attributed the reluctance about Sunday
hours to the desire to let employees spend the day with their
families. And using ``Fall Festival'' or ``Oktoberfest'' instead of
``Halloween'' in its Central and North Florida advertising was to
avoid offending some religious sensibilities _ similar to using
``Happy Holidays'' instead of ``Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the company, which received $15.6 million in
commissions last year, sells tickets as a service to its customers,
not the 5.5 cents it gets per $1 ticket sold. Lottery tickets are
sold at a separate counter, not the checkout aisles, and because
each sale is a relatively lengthy transaction, the company sees
little if any profit, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Publix, of course, is just one among thousands of chain and
independent stores selling lottery tickets at a total of about
11,500 outlets. Retailers start out selling only instant
``scratch-off'' tickets, and can, based on sales performance, be
awarded one of the 8,500 computerized ticket machines needed to
dispense tickets for Cash 3, Play 4, Fantasy 5, Mega Money and
Lotto. Vendors can lose their terminals if on-line ticket sales
fall below $800 a week for four straight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the other major supermarket chains in Florida _
Winn-Dixie and Albertson's _ also sell tickets, as do convenience
stores like 7-Eleven, Texaco, Lil' Champ, Circle K, Shell, Mobil
and Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   Some 800 liquor stores, package stores and bars also offer
tickets, as do 161 check-cashing stores, high-interest ``payday
loan'' establishments and pawnshops.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the vendors vary in their demographics, so do their
tickets sales.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than half of all tickets sold last year by Publix
stores _ typically found in middle- or upper-middle-class areas _
were for Lotto, favored by middle- and upper-middle-class lottery
players who hope one day to strike it really rich.
</P>
<P>
   In the liquor stores, located on average in poorer areas, Lotto
accounts for only 27 percent of all lottery sales. The daily Cash 3
and Play 4 tickets make up 32 percent, and instant tickets _ those
criticized by compulsive gambling experts as most often used by
addicts _ account for 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And at the check-cashing stores and pawnshops, Lotto accounts
for 17 percent of sales, while instant tickets make up 43 percent _
a percentage attributable to the fact that more than three-quarters
of the stores sell only instant tickets.

   CAMPAIGN-COST _ WASHINGTON _ As Al Gore and Hillary Rodham
Clinton pursue their political travels, taxpayers are footing most
of the bill. Just paying for their military airplanes costs more
than $4,000 an hour for her and $10,000 an hour for him. Campaign
reimbursements don't come close to the real cost and have ``always
been frankly ridiculous,'' said the head of one private watchdog
group. One escape: candidates using corporate jets, which also
brings controversy. And in the case of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, it's the increased cost of security that's raising
questions. (Malone, Cox News Service). 22.

 `CRADLE WILL ROCK': PANORAMIC PASSIONS ON A PLAYBILL FROM THE
1930s  
 (Eds: Production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A central event in Tim Robbins' sprawling, ambitious ``Cradle
Will Rock'' is Diego Rivera's creation of a lobby mural for
Rockefeller Center. And as the film watches the painter shape his
crowded sociopolitical cosmos, populating his canvas with starkly
symbolic figures engaged in moral struggle, Robbins works in much
the same way himself. Set in 1936, ``Cradle Will Rock'' is his own
sweeping cinematic mural, with both the overarching vision and
two-dimensionality that implies. It's a big, brave, sometimes
maddeningly reductive film that rises through sheer talent and
enthusiasm over its own limitations.
</P>
<P>
   This is shaping up as a darkly offbeat Christmas movie season.
With a spate of long, serious films ready to summon holiday visions
of death row (``The Green Mile''), life in a mental institution
(``Girl, Interrupted'') and family tragedy (``Angela's Ashes''), a
deadpan guerrilla comedy about Andy Kaufman (``Man on the Moon'')
and more, Robbins' film actually seems relatively festive by
comparison. Its own focus is on a single grand, theatrical gesture
that can be seen as crystallizing art, government and economics in
the midst of the Depression: the staging by Orson Welles and John
Houseman of ``The Cradle Will Rock.'' (Whether to avoid or create
confusion, the ``the'' has been dropped from the title of the
film.)
</P>
<P>
   This Brechtian agitprop work by Marc Blitzstein (``Have you
heard my latest musical?'' Kurt Weill was known to quip about it)
becomes, for Robbins, a defining event that yields a
``Ragtime''-like tableau. And when linked as it is here to the
famously ill-fated Rivera mural, its span grows even greater. From
Olive Stanton (Emily Watson), the homeless waif desperate to work
in the theater, to Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack), used here to
define the relationship between rich patron and rogue artist,
``Cradle Will Rock'' covers a vast amount of terrain.
</P>
<P>
   With astonishing temerity for a Hollywood feature, and as
further proof that Disney (``The Straight Story,'' ``Summer of
Sam,'' ``The Insider'') has taken admirable creative chances this
year, ``Cradle Will Rock'' also devotes much attention to the
Federal Theater Project. It shows how this WPA program to sustain
government-financed theater became hugely controversial, in ways
that would not only polarize the theater world but also directly
affect the ``Cradle Will Rock'' production. However dry that
subject matter sounds, the film's stellar cast and anecdotal
approach bring it to life. So Blitzstein (Hank Azaria) is seen
dreaming up his musical under the aegis of an imaginary Brecht. And
Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones), head of the Federal Theater, is an
energetic advocate for its many far-flung projects. Meanwhile, at
her government office, the well-named Hazel Huffman (Joan Cusack)
is a bureaucrat ever watchful for telltale leftist behavior, like
``mixed-race dating,'' while she attracts the bashful interest of a
ventriloquist (Bill Murray) who is one of the film's most affecting
characters. The would-be actor Aldo Silvano (John Turturro)
bristles at relatives who praise Mussolini. And Margherita Sarfatti
(Susan Sarandon), a Hearst newspaper columnist and onetime mistress
of Mussolini's, makes herself a glamorous liaison between European
Fascism and America's wealthy industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must confess that I'm more interested in the oil in paint
than the oil in derricks,'' the film's Nelson Rockefeller remarks.
And its curiously short, deep-voiced William Randolph Hearst
confides to a fellow magnate (Philip Baker Hall): ``Killing
strikers doesn't play to the public. You've got to find a way to
give them a dollar _ and take two!'' Characters like these might as
well be toting placards and speaking in cartoon balloons, and yet
``Cradle Will Rock'' seems to revel in the very deliberateness of
its oversimplifications. Its Orson Welles (played here by Angus
Macfadyen, an actor who was no less suited to playing Peter
Lawford) raves about art and theater so obnoxiously that it's a
wonder nobody throws a bucket of water at him.
</P>
<P>
   With performances that range from similar absurdity to cunning
impersonation (Vanessa Redgrave as a dizzy socialite, Ruben Blades'
Rivera), the film proves such a dizzying mix of attitudes that it
succeeds in remaining a moving target.
</P>
<P>
   And although Robbins might have drawn some of these characters
with less obviousness and more satirical bite, he ably keeps this
lively, complicated film on track. As the moment approaches for
``The Cradle Will Rock'' to see the light of day, the material
coalesces into something tough and purposeful, yielding a stirring
finale. Ultimately, the tenacious and intrepid Robbins makes it
clear that he does not intend this as a period piece at all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Whitney Museum of American Art announced in
March that for the first time in its 70-year history a team of
outside curators would produce its Biennial, no one involved was
quite sure how the process would work. Each of the six curators who
had agreed to help put together the giant survey of contemporary
art was from a different part of the country. None lived in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Whitney curators and the consultants they sometimes
hired usually spent about a year scouring the United States in
search of the best of contemporary art for the Biennial, the most
anticipated and the most criticized exhibition the museum produces.
It is the show everybody loves to hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us had trepidations at first,'' said one of the
curators, Lawrence Rinder, director of the Institute for
Exhibitions and Public Programs at the California College of Arts
and Crafts in San Francisco and Oakland. Andrea Miller-Keller, an
independent curator from Hartford, Conn., described the process as
``trying to tame an unhousebroken mongrel.'' And Valerie Cassel,
director of the visiting artists program at the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago, said she felt as if she were part of a
``six-headed monster that was ingested in one stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Whitney and its new director, Maxwell Anderson, had
little choice but to look entirely outside the museum. After
Anderson reorganized the curatorial staff on his arrival in
September 1998, the curator in charge of the Biennial resigned and
another senior curator left the museum. The remaining Whitney
curators were busy putting the finishing touches on ``The American
Century: 1900-2000,'' a two-part show that runs through January.
</P>
<P>
   Now, eight months after the team's first meeting, it has
produced the long-awaited list of artists whose works the curators
feel reflect the best of what has happened in contemporary art
during the last two years. The list is the culmination of hundreds
of visits to artists' studios from Lubbock, Texas, to Berkeley,
Calif., countless hours poring over slides and long debates in
cyberspace. The team also met the old-fashioned way, in person.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Biennial, which opens March 23 and runs through June 4,
is one of the Whitney's largest, with 97 artists. It is also one of
the most international. Twenty-one of the artists in the show were
born abroad but have migrated to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The artists who made the cut, especially the younger emerging
ones, are likely to see an instant boost in their careers. Even for
well-known artists inclusion in a Whitney Biennial offers an
instant status that can significantly increase the value of their
work.
</P>
<P>
   The show has no overriding theme, the curators said, but they
noted that painting is alive and well, and video is more important
than ever. So is technology.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to buck the trend of previous Biennials, which have
been criticized for being too reflective of the cliquish New York
art establishment and too reliant on ideas from the Whitney's
staff, this team selected a surprising group of artists with a
broad range of ages and mediums and a careful balance between the
sexes. The curators said they avoided picking too many of the
artists shown in trendy galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the least gallery-driven Biennial that we've
seen for a long time,'' said Michael Auping, chief curator at the
Modern Art Museum in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller-Keller said that before any of the curators agreed to
do the show they ``insisted on building a fire wall between
trustees, important collectors and influential galleries and
dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of selected artists includes some of today's hottest
names, like the winners of this year's Venice Biennale: Cai
Guo-Qiang, the Chinese-born installation artist; Doug Aitken, a Los
Angles video artist; and Shirin Neshat, an Iranian-born artist who
creates videos about the separation of the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Other names will surprise the art world: for example, William De
Lottie, , 57, an abstract painter and installation artist who works
out of his garage in Eastford, Conn., or E.V. Day, 32, who lives in
Brooklyn and is known for cutting spectacular evening dresses into
hundreds of pieces as if they had been in a violent explosion and
then suspending them in midair to suggest a mushroom cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected name is James Drake, 53, a photographer from
Lubbock who focuses on the lives of people he has met through the
Mexican Federation of Private Health and Community Development
Associations, an organization that deals with prevention and
treatment of diseases and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the range of backgrounds, a large number of participants
work in New York. ``Where we are today in terms of art is a
reflection on our migratory age,'' Ms. Cassel said. Many curators
said it was frustrating to discover that an artist from, say,
Miami, had moved to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, many works deal with political issues, curators
said, a reflection of what artists are thinking about in the here
and now.
</P>
<P>
   There are well-established artists like the sculptor Richard
Tuttle and the photographer John Coplans, and midcareer artists
like Dennis Adams, Dawoud Bey, Louise Lawler, Robert Gober and
Annette Lemieux. Curators said they sought a diversity of styles,
from the nontraditional portraiture of Salomon Huerta, Kurt Kauper
and Lisa Yuskavage to the abstract work of Ghada Amer, Linda
Besemer and Katherine Sherwood.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty artists will create site-specific installations,
including Rina Banerjee, whose elaborate assemblages of everyday
materials reflect her Indian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time the Whitney will include Internet art.
Visitors will be able to view the works on a large-screen
projection in the main exhibition as well as on a Web site. Works
by 27 cinematic artists will be on view at the Whitney as well as
at the institutions of the Biennial curators. The museum will also
introduce an audio tour that includes interviews with the artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an enormous amount of winnowing out,'' said Jane
Farver, director of the List Visual Arts Center at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the curators.
``Everyone had people they wanted in the show that didn't make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the list is final, every curator has some complaint.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no significant senior women and I'm smarting about
that,'' Ms. Miller-Keller said.
</P>
<P>
   The curator Hugh Davies, director of the Museum of Contemporary
Art in San Diego, said: ``If I were to do this again I would have
wanted more Los Angeles artists. I kept arguing that New York may
be the commercial center of the art world, but in terms of
creativity and education Los Angeles is perhaps eclipsing New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   In putting together the show from long distance, the curators
faced several obstacles. They had scheduled only three face-to-face
gatherings _ in Chicago, in San Diego and at the Whitney _ but as
they progressed they decided that neither electronic communications
nor conference call could substitute for meeting in person, so they
got together again at the Whitney. Still, most discussions and
presentations took place via e-mail, conference calls and on a
special password-protected Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Auping, the Fort Worth curator, said he couldn't imagine doing a
show like the Biennial without computer technology. ``I would feel
like the Flintstones,'' he said, adding that the images on the Web
site were handy reminders of the artists' work.
</P>
<P>
   When the group first met in April at the University Club in
Chicago, each curator was asked to submit a list of about 50 names
as an exercise meant to foster an understanding of each
participant's thinking. ``We were shocked and excited that there
were almost no overlaps,'' Rinder said. ``This meant we'd all learn
something and that there was no confirmed canon.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial list of artists was broken down by career stage:
emerging, middle, senior. By July curators were told to create new
lists that would contain 20 emerging artists, 20 midcareer artists
and 10 older ones. Film, video and Web-based artists were
considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   At first the curators decided that each would be allowed what
they called three passion votes, but in the end that is not how it
worked. Each curator voted on each artist and mostly at the
face-to-face meetings. But curators let their passions be known and
could often persuade colleagues to vote for an artist they probably
would not have considered had they been doing the show alone.
</P>
<P>
   Votes were cast over time. A curator could cast either a
three-vote (meaning the work of art was one they could not live
without), a two-vote (a work they endorsed) or a one-vote (they
would not die if the work wasn't accepted). The group slowly
trimmed a list of more than 200 artists to fewer than half that
number.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson did not vote, but did weigh in with considerations like
space limitations. ``I was the time-keeper, the pragmatist, '' he
said. ``I helped shape the show and gave the curators a sense of
what was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Auping volunteered to be in charge of the installation, which is
to be designed by Lana Hum, the Whitney's in-house exhibition
architect. ``I want to keep it as clean and straightforward as
possible,'' he said. ``We don't need to accelerate this show with
anything jazzy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't signal how the Biennial will look. ``It will
have a messy vitality,'' Davies said. ``It's bound to have some
rough edges. Maybe if we had another year it would be more
homogeneous.''
</P>

A LETDOWN FOR FLORIDA STATE'S WARRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN RECORD   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Peter Warrick is the best football player on
the No. 1-ranked college team in the nation, but a late-September
discount shopping spree cost him any chance of being recognized as
one of the best players in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, who was the leading contender for the Heisman Trophy
heading into October, was not among the five finalists invited to
Saturday night's trophy presentation at the Downtown Athletic Club
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very hurt,'' said Warrick, who highlighted FSU's first
practice since the end of the regular season with a 50-yard TD
reception from quarterback Chris Weinke. ``I know I made a mistake.
But what does something that happened off the field have to do with
what you do every Saturday?''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick was ultimately charged with misdemeanor theft for
purchasing, along with teammate Laveranues Coles, more than $400
worth of clothing for roughly $20 at a local department store.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Warrick missed FSU's games with Miami and Wake
Forest, but finished the season with 71 receptions for 934 yards.
In the regular-season finale at Florida, a 30-23 FSU victory,
Warrick had nine receptions for 90 yards and rushed for the
Seminoles first touchdown, taking the snap from center out of the
shotgun formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Saturday I came to play,'' Warrick said. ``I thought the
award was supposed to go to the guy who did the most to help his
team won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I did a lot for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick will get one more chance to prove his worth on Jan. 4,
when the Seminoles (11-0) take on second-ranked Virginia Tech
(11-0) in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching a lot of film on Florida State and I've
seen the moves that Warrick put on defenders this season,''
Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer said after the bowl lineup was
officially announced Sunday. ``It just about ruined my day. I don't
know how you cover him.''

EXPERTS CITE `GOVERNMENT-WIDE FAILURE' FOR PEARL HARBOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES J. LEWIS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A panel of historians and retired Navy officers
debated Tuesday _ the 58th anniversary of the Japanese raid on
Pearl Harbor _ whether the Navy and Army commanders there should be
blamed for allowing Japan's successful surprise attack that brought
the United States into World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A thin consensus emerged among the 10 panelists, commentators
and scholars that it was a ``government-wide failure'' that enabled
Japan to pull off one of history's most successful surprise
military attacks. A total of 2,403 U.S. military and civilian
personnel were killed in the Dec. 7, 1941, attack.
</P>
<P>
   The debate preceded a somber wreath-laying ceremony at the U.S.
Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue that was attended by a handful
of surviving crew members of the cruiser USS St. Louis, one of the
few American ships to get under way during the attack and engage
the Japanese carrier-based airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about who was responsible for letting Japan's attack
succeed have centered on the roles of the U.S. commanders there _
Navy Adm. Husband Kimmel and Army. Lt. Gen. Walter Short _ and on
the top military and civilian leaders in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Rosenberg, a historian and faculty member at the
National War College, said the evidence shows that Pearl Harbor
``was a government-wide failure'' because of mistakes in the
Washington headquarters of the Navy and War departments and at
Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg praised the Clinton administration's 1995
re-examination of Pearl Harbor responsibility that made the same
finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spreading the blame widely is a good conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The questions debated by the panelists included whether Kimmel
and Short were unfairly treated when they were relieved of their
commands and retired at lower ranks after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants agreed that even if the Pearl Harbor
commanders had been on a high state of alert, the overwhelming
numerical advantage held by the attacking Japanese force would have
inflicted the same catastrophic damage on the fleet, though at a
higher price in terms of Japanese planes lost.
</P>
<P>
   If the fleet had left Pearl Harbor to avoid the air attack, some
panelists said, the U.S. ships would have been vulnerable to
Japanese submarines. And if the U.S. ships had been sunk in the
deep ocean, U.S. Navy salvage crews would not have been able to
raise and repair the vessels, as they did in the relatively shallow
waters at Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Love, professor of history at the U.S. Naval Academy,
said Kimmel deserved to be relieved of his command because he no
longer had the confidence of President Franklin D. Roosevelt or the
Navy establishment or the American people. Love said dismissing
commanders was a common penalty among armed forces around the world
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Love also noted that some U.S. military personnel in the
Pacific, including some ship commanders at Pearl Harbor, were at a
higher state of alert than was Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kimmel should have told more of his subordinates about
the official ``war warning'' that Washington sent him on Nov. 27 so
the fleet would have known that top Navy officials were convinced
that war with Japan would start ``within the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Kimmel critic, author Norman Polmar, said Kimmel ``had
to know'' that Pearl Harbor was susceptible to a surprise air
attack because such a maneuver had been a common U.S. fleet war
game in the 1920s and 1930s and the attackers invariably won.
</P>
<P>
   Polmar also noted that one of Kimmel's fellow admirals warned in
1937 in an official Navy publication that Japan would likely launch
a surprise attack on a weekend, as in fact happened. Kimmel also
had to know about the British success in launching a surprise air
raid on the Italian fleet at Taranto in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Polmar also argued that Kimmel should have been more suspicious
when his intelligence aide told him that U.S. radio trackers had
lost track of Japan's aircraft carriers in early December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrier strikes on Pearl Harbor should have been on his
mind,'' Polmar said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel's defenders argued that the Navy Department in Washington
had withheld key intelligence, obtained by breaking Japanese radio
codes, that pointed to Pearl Harbor as the likely target for the
widely expected Japanese attack. The withheld intelligence also
indicated that the attack would come at dawn on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Edward L. Beach, a retired Navy captain, Pearl Harbor historian
and novelist, said the infamous ``war warning'' messages sent to
Kimmel were ``models of obfuscatory language.'' Indeed, the Nov. 27
warning sent to Kimmel specifically cited the Philippines or Borneo
or the Malay Peninsula as the likely places where Japan would
strike but made no mention of Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese attack, despite its tactical brilliance, was a
strategic disaster for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers hit Pearl Harbor when all three aircraft carriers
assigned to the U.S. fleet were elsewhere. The attackers also
failed to bomb the huge oil storage depots at Pearl Harbor, the
loss of which would have crippled the U.S. fleet even more. And the
attack abruptly ended the debate then raging in the United States
about whether to intervene in the war that had been raging for more
than two years in Europe and for 4 1/2 years in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Pearl Harbor!'' became the rallying cry for American
war mobilization and inspired the state of super vigilance that
characterized the United States during the 44 years of the Cold War
that began soon afterward.

 TV NOTES: NICKELODEON'S MILLENNIUM; NEWS NIELSENS; McCULLOUGH; FOX 
(bl)

   The World On Nickelodeon
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon, the cable channel for children that takes its
audience very seriously, has come up with its own way to observe
the Year 2000 in a special it has called the ``largest global
multimedia event'' ever produced for children: a 24-hour
commercial-free broadcast featuring children from around the world
describing the future they would like to see.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Nickellennium,'' the special is a six-hour film that
includes profiles of children representing a range of nations and
cultures and their comments about the world they live and the world
they would like to live in, as well as some music videos and other
entertainment segments. The film will be translated into nine other
languages and will use subtitles to translate for viewers in still
other languages.
</P>
<P>
   In a display of the global reach of Nickelodeon, the number of
countries carrying the film is 122. In the United States, Britain
and Australia, the film will run for 24 hours straight during New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   While it has no commercials, it does have a sponsor. McDonald's
is the one corporate underwriter for the project and is
participating in a tie-in that involves getting children into a
McDonald's sometime between now and New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   In McDonald's they can pick up what Nickelodeon is calling a
``wish bag.'' In each U.S. time zone (and all the others where
McDonald's restaurants are participating in the promotion) children
will be asked to make a wish, blow up their bags and pop them
together at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to extend the global theme, the channel will
observe the start of the new year each hour beginning at 6 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time, when the new year begins in Tonga.
</P>
<P>
   The film is the work of Linda Schaffer, a filmmaker commissioned
by Nickelodeon to travel the world for a year talking to children
about their views of the future.
</P>
<P>
   She found children around the world united in one concern: the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon expects children to drop in on an hour of the film,
not to watch it in one six-hour burst. In addition, Apple Computer
will offer a streamlined 90-minute version of the film over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The channel estimates that ``Nickellennium'' will be available
in almost 100 million homes worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Leads With News
</P>
<P>
   The ``NBC Nightly News'' solidified its leadership in the
network evening news competition, a race that may take on more
significance with the election year.
</P>
<P>
   In the November sweep rating period that concluded last week,
NBC won in virtually every significant category, with ABC's ``World
News Tonight'' second and the ``CBS Evening News'' third.
</P>
<P>
   NBC averaged 11.36 million total viewers, up about 6 percent
from last November. ABC had just under 11 million viewers, about
the same as last year. CBS had 9.7 million viewers, down 7 percent
from last November.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's lead was about the same among viewers of ages 25 to 54,
which is the main advertiser target for news programming.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 10th straight sweep month in which NBC's newscast
has finished first (one was a tie) but it was NBC's biggest winning
margin since May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough Leaving
</P>
<P>
   David McCullough, the longtime host and voice of the
award-winning ``American Experience'' series on PBS, announced
Tuesday that he was leaving the series in May at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Harry
S. Truman, has been with the series for its entire 12-year run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt now was a good time,'' he said in a telephone
interview Tuesday. ``It's a little bit like an actor who's been on
a show a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The big reason, he said, was his desire to focus on his next
book, a biography of John Adams that he has been working on for six
years.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough became a signature voice of the historical
documentary on public television, beginning with early work with
Ken Burns on films like ``The Brooklyn Bridge'' and continuing
through his first job as host on the program ``Smithsonian World.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he concluded that after several years with ``Smithsonian
World'' that television was taking too much of his time.
</P>
<P>
   But he relented when the producers of ``American Experience''
offered to film all of his introductions in his own home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've written all my own introductions,'' he said. He also
served as the narrator for several of the program's award-winning
films, including ``LBJ,'' ``D-Day,'' ``America 1900'' and ``The
Donner Party.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, a writer by trade and disposition, said he wound up
turning down ``more offers than I can remember'' for voice work,
including ``some for wine companies that would have helped with the
years we had tuitions to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   PBS has not yet named a replacement as host of the series. ``The
American Experience'' has become one of the most honored programs
on public television, having won 13 Emmy Awards, along with two
Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards and three George Foster
Peabody Awards.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough said he would serve as host on all the films this
season. Among the subjects, he said, are Houdini and Eleanor
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Entertainment
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, chairman of the 20th Century Fox television
studio, who recently expanded his duties to include running the
entertainment division of the Fox network as well, announced that
not one but two executives would succeed him as president of the
studio, Dana Waldren and Gary Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Both executives had served as executive vice presidents under
Grushow and they will continue to report to him. Under the new
structure at Fox Grushow has overall authority over both the
studio, which produces shows for every network, and the Fox
entertainment division, which remains the principal buyer of of
those shows.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow noted Tuesday that unlike ABC, which merged the
network's entertainment division with the production studio owned
by its parent company, Walt Disney, Fox would keep its two entities
``entirely separate.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow acknowledged Tuesday that problems with Fox's prime-time
schedule _ the network failed to initiate a single new hit show
this fall _ have absorbed most of his time since he expanded his
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to roll up my sleeves and roll around at the
network,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for some short-term issues at the network, Grushow said he
did not plan to expand Fox's game show ``Greed'' to more than one
night after ABC's announcement that ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' would be broadcast three nights a week starting in
January.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Greed'' is being tried out on both Thursday and Friday
night this week. Grushow said Fox wanted to see if ``Greed'' could
``solve some problems for us on Friday.''

   GISBORNE CITY, New Zealand _ The first sunrise of the new
millennium will be a cold and lonely moment as the midnight sun
dips below the horizon near Dibble Glacier in Antarctica, and then,
a few minutes later, creeps up again.
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the international date line, the silent Antarctic
dawn will take place 14 hours before the big ball descends to mark
the New Year in Times Square _ and more than 21 hours before the
sun rises in New York at 7:20 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is likely to be there on that distant glacier to see
the century's first dawn.
</P>
<P>
   This has touched off a rough and tumble competition among the
islands of the South Pacific for the claim of being the first
inhabited place to witness the first fresh sunbeams of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati and New Zealand's Pitt Island, near here
(the astronomers' favorite), are the main contenders. In another
part of the world, Katchall Island in the Indian Ocean is using a
different theory of time to claim the first island sunrise. It has
its scientific backers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Like the millennium itself, which purists point out does not
begin for another year, the competition is a matter of definitions
and technicalities: First midnight or first dawn? First permanently
or temporarily inhabited place? Local time or Greenwich Mean Time?
</P>
<P>
   And, particularly in the case of the often foggy Pitt Island, is
there a sunrise if the weather is bad and nobody sees it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just a matter of convention, but of course, the whole
business of the millennium is a matter of convention,'' said Dennis
McCarthy, director of the Directorate of Time at the U.S. Naval
Observatory in Washington, D.C. (``We are concerned with keeping
the time for the country here,'' he said, explaining his job title.
``So as far as time is concerned, that is what we take care of.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the year 2000 the year 2000? It's just a convention
established in the sixth century by Dionysius Exiguus,'' he went
on, referring to the Christian theologian who is believed to have
introduced the current system of numbering years. ``And I think
it's pretty much assumed now that he got it wrong, if he actually
was referencing the birth of Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, things have gotten heated in this part of the
world as New Year's Eve approaches _ a wild shifting of date lines,
time zones and daylight savings times that has produced some
strange geographical and temporal contortions.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this easternmost city of New Zealand yet another claim
dominates: first city to greet the new century. Or to put it
another way, first land mass to see the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Looking more like a small town than a city, this quiet
settlement of 30,000 people seems a pleasant enough representative
for the rest of us to greet the future. It is described repeatedly
by residents as ``a nice place to raise children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in the outside world think we're isolated _ we're
glad,'' said Mike Coyle, a member of the Gisborne District Council.
``The younger people, they like to move away, have their
excitement, then move back and enjoy their retirement. Or like me
you can hop in the car any time, drive seven hours to Auckland,
have a whale of a time and be back again on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the designation of Jan. 1, 2000, as the start of the
new millennium, all these South Pacific claims are wrong by one key
definition.
</P>
<P>
   They are based on local time rather than on Greenwich Mean Time
_ or Universal Time, as the scientists, if not the theologians,
call it. When the sun rises over the Pacific, it will still be
about 3 p.m. on Dec. 31 in Greenwich, England, ground zero for the
world's clocks. The new year, and the new century, will not yet
have officially arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only international standard for time across the world is
Universal Time,'' said Robert Massey, an astronomer at the Royal
Observatory at Greenwich. ``So our argument has always been that
the new millennium will begin on Jan. 1 at the stroke of midnight
along the Greenwich meridian.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the easiest way to measure who is first is to set your
clocks to midnight GMT and find out where the sun is rising. That
in a sense is the first sunrise.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, he said, the sun will be rising along a great
arc running from eastern Russia through China, down along the
border between Burma and Thailand, out into the Indian Ocean and on
down to the Antarctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the spots on this particular arc, it is Katchall Island,
part of India's Andaman and Nicobar archipelago in the Bay of
Bengal, that has decided to raise the cry of ``first.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time this happens, it will already be midday on Jan.
1 in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Why wait?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several places in the Pacific are making their own claims.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt Island
</P>
<P>
   The strongest claim appears to belong to Pitt Island, home to
fewer than 60 farmers and their sheep. It is a part of New Zealand,
but it lies in the blustery seas 500 miles off the coast _ and not
much farther than that to the north of Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt, the more easterly of the two Chatham Islands, will greet
the sunrise at 4:49 a.m. on Jan. 1, or 4:04 p.m. Greenwich Mean
Time on Dec. 31. It will be 11:04 a.m. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' asserted Sharon van Gulik, manager of the New
Zealand Millennium Office. ``Pitt Island and the Chatham Islands
are the first legitimately inhabited lands to welcome the dawn of
the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Legitimately inhabited,'' she said, means that those
contenders who move a few folk out onto a barren outcropping for
the event do not count.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing time changes made by some of her rivals so they can
claim to be first, Ms. van Gulik argued: ``No matter what time of
day you say it is, this is where the sun rises first. No matter
what you do to your date line, you can't change the tilt of the
earth. You just can't change it.''
</P>
<P>
   But although the tilt of the earth may be on their side, the
Chatham Islands must contend with a different sort of natural
phenomenon. The Chathams are known around here as ``the misty
islands'' and there is a good chance that the sunrise will be
obscured by fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's irrelevant,'' insisted Ms. Van Gulik gamely. ``The sun
rises whether or not you and I can see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiribati
</P>
<P>
   A second claimant is Kiribati (pronounced KIH-rih-bus), a
far-flung archipelago that until recently had been divided by the
international date line into two separate days. In 1995 it
unilaterally extended the date line in an audacious 1,000-mile loop
to embrace its easternmost outcropping, Caroline Island, and
immediately renamed it Millennium Island.
</P>
<P>
   The sun will rise there at 5:43 a.m. _ or 3:43 p.m. on Dec. 31
in Greenwich _the first Pacific island, by this reckoning, to greet
the dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be no legal reason why any country cannot
declare itself to be in whatever time zone it likes,'' the
Greenwich observatory said in a statement. But it did not seem
happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Millennium Island, Massey said, is that
``nobody actually lives there.'' In the first-sunrise sweepstakes,
he said, the atoll of 22 rocky islets is the tropical equivalent of
Antarctica's barren glacier.
</P>
<P>
   And at Christmas Island, the most easterly of the populated
islands of Kiribati, the sun will rise 27 minutes after it does at
Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   Tonga
</P>
<P>
   In Tonga, an archipelago of 170 islands, King Taufa'ahau Tupou
IV joined the competition in August by introducing daylight saving
time, moving the nation's clocks forward to get a head start on the
next 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a bit of research and there's something like 199
nations around the world that have daylight saving time,'' said
Semisi Taumoepeau, Tonga's director of tourism. ``It's good for the
family, good for productivity and it keeps crime down.''
</P>
<P>
   To Tonga's competitors, though, the timing of the change seemed
a little suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Daylight savings time moved Tonga's easternmost islands, the
Niutoputapu group, to 14 hours ahead of Greenwich. ``While people
are having breakfast there, we will already be celebrating the
millennium,'' Semisi said.
</P>
<P>
   Massey, of the Greenwich observatory, was having none of it.
``Just because they set their clocks forward doesn't make the sun
rise any earlier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji
</P>
<P>
   The most combative of the entrants is Fiji, where officials say
everybody else has the wrong idea. It is not Greenwich time that
counts, they say, but the international date line, most of which
follows the 180 degree meridian line and which passes through the
archipelago at three points. And it is not dawn that counts, but
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 180-degree meridian date line is the line where each day
starts and ends,'' declares a government statement addressed To
Whom it May Concern. ``The whole world counts down to midnight. Who
counts down to sunrise? If anything, most people are in bed with a
hangover by the time the sun comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   To help matters along, Fiji, too, moved its clocks forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair enough, good luck to them, it doesn't bother me in the
least,'' Massey said. But he added: ``You can affect the midnight
time but that won't affect the sunrise time.''
</P>
<P>
   The date line, created at an international convention in 1884,
is an imaginary north-south line drawn from pole to pole roughly
along the 180 degree meridian. This is the farthest point from the
``prime meridian,'' which runs through Greenwich, near London, and
where each new day officially begins.
</P>
<P>
   Moving westward across the date line, a traveler loses a day,
moving to a point where it is 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Moving eastward a day is gained. It is Sunday today; tomorrow it
is Sunday again.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons of convenience and politics, the dateline zigs
and zags away from the meridian _ between Tonga and Samoa, around
the Chatham Islands of New Zealand, jogging between Siberia and
Alaska and swerving to the east of Fiji. Its newest and most
spectacular bulge, encircling the islands of Kiribati, is
``ridiculous,'' the pugnacious Fijians contend.
</P>
<P>
   As these squabbling Pacific islanders are greeting the dawn on
Jan. 1, people in the United States may still be asleep on the last
cold winter morning of the old century.
</P>
<P>
   The Naval Observatory has calculated that the first sunrise in
the continental United States will occur in Maine at 7:04 a.m.,
simultaneously at Cadillac Mountain near Bar Harbor and at
Porcupine Mountain near Lubec. The first big American city to see
the new dawn will be Miami Beach, at 7:07 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest sunrises on American territories will have arrived
more than 15 hours earlier, though, on the Pacific islands of Guam
and Wake.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square plans to acknowledge many of the Pacific
celebrations in its 24-hour countdown, but after all this activity,
that countdown there of the last seconds of the year is going to
seem a bit late.
</P>
<P>
   But then, what's the hurry? There will be 365,241 more days to
greet the dawn before the fourth millennium arrives.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who rather liked the last one and want to cling
to it for a few final hours, the place to be is Falealupo, Samoa,
where the sun will set for the last time, at 7:02 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By then, history will already be hurtling ahead into the
unknown. It will be dawn in Greenwich, 6:02 a.m., on Jan. 2, 2000.

 &HT;    Home Depot conference outlines plans
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot is expected to leave a good impression with
analysts as the retailer wraps up its annual conference today.
</P>
<P>
   About 180 investors and analysts are attending the two-day
meeting at Home Depot's headquarters in Atlanta. On the heels of a
strong quarterly earnings report, Home Depot will likely reiterate
its road map for long-term growth. The retailer plans to release a
conference summary today.
</P>
<P>
   Although Home Depot has been keeping a lid on the details of its
Internet strategy, analysts will certainly have some questions
about electronic commerce. Last month Atlanta-based iXL Enterprises
announced it would help Home Depot with its Internet plans. The
retailer intends to open its Web site for product sales in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Other presentations will likely include early results from
Villager's Hardware, a new small-store concept being tested in New
Jersey, and the progress of the upscale Expo Design Centers. Home
Depot also has been testing a new store layout in four cities,
including Alpharetta, an Atlanta suburb.
</P>
<P>
   International growth is rising on analysts' radar, too. Home
Depot, which will have roughly $40 billion in revenue this year, is
expanding in Chile and Argentina. Over the summer it announced a
major expansion in Canada. Analysts expect Europe to become Home
Depot's next big move abroad.
</P>
<P>
   This year's analyst conference is Home Depot's third in as many
years. ``We originally planned to hold it every other year, but we
have so much to report on our new initiatives that we made it an
annual event,'' said Kim Shreckengost, vice president of investor
relations. ``We feel a responsibility to keep our investors
updated.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The towns of Nis and Pirot were
celebrating on Tuesday night after Serbian customs officials
released 14 tankers of heating fuel from the European Union that
had been blocked at the border for nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased that this is over,'' said Mayor Zoran
Zivkovic of Nis, which was scheduled to receive the bulk of the
fuel. ``It has been like a national version of Hannibal crossing
the Alps.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke by telephone from Nis just before going on stage at an
opposition rally.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the fuel to the two opposition-controlled towns
was more a relief than a victory for the local mayors and their
European benefactors, after wrangling with Serbian customs since
Nov. 24. Zivkovic has championed the plan as a chance for Serbia to
reopen ties with Western Europe. Yet it was not at all clear
whether future consignments would be allowed through any more
easily.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, called Fuel for Democracy, is Europe's attempt to
deliver aid to ordinary Serbs while circumventing the Belgrade
authorities. Last week, it appeared close to failure, when European
officials tried to recall the tankers.
</P>
<P>
   The 350 tons of fuel in the tankers represent three days of
heating fuel for the towns.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment is politically charged, because it is being sent
specifically to local authorities who oppose President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have criticized the plan as discriminatory
and say any assistance should be available to all Serbs. The
customs authorities held up the trucks for days with bureaucratic
checks, but released them on Monday night to proceed to Nis. The
tankers completed customs formalities today and delivered the fuel
to the heating plants.
</P>
<P>
   The customs officials gave no explanation for the change of mind
and seemed to have ignored a request by the European Union three
days earlier to let the tankers return to Macedonia. European Union
officials struggled on Tuesday to interpret the reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain very reserved,'' the chief of the European Union
mission in Yugoslavia, Michael Graham, said. ``The whole story has
been so bad that I remain very skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on Monday, European foreign ministers decided to
explore other ways to send the fuel. They had also planned to look
at expanding the program to other communities. But the delays with
the first delivery put off that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers sent a tough message to Milosevic by doubling the
names on their list of Serbian officials who are barred from
traveling to European Union countries. Close to 600 people,
including relatives and business allies of Milosevic, as well as
government officials, are prohibited from obtaining visas. The
first list, of 305 officials, was published in May during the NATO
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Like the fuel project, the travel restrictions are intended to
hurt Milosevic's government while sparing ordinary Serbs. This
week, Britain resumed issuing visas for Serbs in Belgrade.

COUNTING CROWS FRESH OUT OF FODDER 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Counting Crows singer Adam Duritz straddled the
Wiltern Theatre stage monitors Monday, eyes squeezed shut and
yelping, ``I wish I was a girl,'' while his improbable dreadlocks
swayed to and fro, you couldn't help thinking this was a band
that's clearly come off the rails.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bay Area group's debut album was issued at the tail end
of 1993, the rootsy sound of such classic-rock-tinged songs as
``Mr. Jones,'' ``Perfect Blue Buildings'' and ``Round Here''
provided a refreshing alternative to the steady stream of grunge
wanna-bes clogging the modern-rock airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Duritz and company have had a difficult time coming
up with a consistent product, instead taking solace in an
increasingly overbearing wall of guitars and meandering tuneage. As
evidenced on their latest disc, the uneven ``This Desert Life''
(DGC/Geffen), Counting Crows has plainly run out of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In concert, the ever-tortured Duritz is the focal point, and his
often unbearable, self-pitying lyrics and delivery detract from the
overall picture.
</P>
<P>
   But the musicians themselves are no slouches and when the
rock-star posturing and guitar antics subside long enough for a
song to be allowed to breath, such as during memorable performances
of ``A Long December,'' ``Rain King'' and ``Anna Begins,'' subtle
touches of accordion or Hammond organ lift the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, keyboardist Charlie Gillingham is the band's most
valuable if under-utilized asset.
</P>
<P>
   Opening with a muted reading of the hit ``Mr. Jones,'' the Crows
focused on new tunes such as ``Hanginaround'' from the current
album, a collection of sometimes melancholic pieces that lack the
spark of joy that fueled earlier tunes.
</P>
<P>
   The Counting Crows show _ which returns to the Wiltern on
Thursday and Friday and again Dec. 20-22 _ actually got off to a
distracting start. The band had unwisely chosen to preface its
appearance on stage with a driving segment from the original
recording of the Beatles tune ``Magical Mystery Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, there were several times during the next 90 minutes where
you got the feeling it would've been far more satisfying to have
simply sat in the darkened theater listening to that entire Beatles
album. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
Who: Counting Crows, Joe 90. &QL; 
Where: Wiltern Theatre, 3790 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. &QL; 
When: 7 p.m. Thursday, Friday and Dec. 20-22. &QL; 
Tickets: $30 and $35. &QL;

ACTIVIST HOPES TO END 2-YEAR STAY IN A REDWOOD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GENIELLA   NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAFFORD, Calif. _ Environmental activist Julia Hill, facing a
third winter of wind and rain from her tree-top perch in a northern
California redwood tree, says negotiations are under way with
Pacific Lumber Co. to end a protest that's attracted worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful, but feeling very cautious,'' Hill said Monday via
a cellular phone from the tarp-covered platform 180 feet up a
ridge-top redwood she calls ``Luna.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Dec. 19, 1997, Hill has been living in the tree to keep
Pacific Lumber from finishing a controversial logging operation
along a ridgetop above the Humboldt County community of Stafford.
The redwood tree, estimated by state foresters to be 600 years old,
was to be cut under terms of a state-approved timber harvest plan.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber representatives confirmed the talks with Hill's
representatives but, like Hill, declined to discuss details or
speculate on the possible outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're very concerned about her health and safety,''
said a company representative, who asked not to be identified
because of pledges of confidentiality both sides have made. Pacific
Lumber is willing to ``lean over backwards to reach reasonable
terms, but we would like to point out that we're not holding her
hostage. She can come down any time,'' said the representative.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have heartened the 25-year-old Hill, who acknowledged
her tree-top vigil has been ``the hardest two years of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a chilly Pacific storm front moved across the redwood region,
Hill said she's been assured by representatives who are negotiating
on her behalf that Pacific Lumber has agreed to spare the huge
redwood and a 200-foot buffer zone around it.
</P>
<P>
   The tree is growing near the site of a massive mudslide that on
Jan. 1, 1997, destroyed or damaged several homes in Stafford.
Activists contended the mudslide was triggered by logging
operations, but Pacific Lumber foresters have maintained it was a
natural occurence typical of what happens in one of the nation's
most geologically unstable regions.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, better known as Julia ``Butterfly'' in protest circles,
declined to talk about what she and environmental groups that have
supported her might have to give in return for saving the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect for Pacific Lumber, I'm going to keep to an
agreement to not discuss certain details,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the talks said that, under terms of a proposed
agreement, Hill and her supporters would have to pay $50,000 to
Pacific Lumber in return for the company imposing a logging ban at
the site. The money, the sources said, would in turn be donated to
Humboldt State University to fund future forestry research.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber also is seeking signed statements from Hill that
the company hopes will discourage future tree-sits as a protest
tactic, believing they are inherently dangerous, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said if the current talks succeed, she hopes within the
next several days to climb down and touch ground for the first time
in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to do the right thing. I'd like to be able to spend
Christmas with my family,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   She said, however, she's prepared to stay and weather another
winter if the negotiations fail, as similar efforts did last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's tree-top antic began in late 1997 when she joined in an
Earth First! logging protest after the Arkansas native viewed the
redwoods for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding to stay in the tree until it was permanently
protected from cutting, Hill attracted national notoriety as the
months turned into years. She's been interviewed via cell phone,
and in a few cases in person, by reporters from around the world.
Hill also has been visited by numerous celebrities at the protest
site, including actor Woody Harrelson and singers Bonnie Raitt and
Joan Baez. Earlier this year, Hill was chosen one of the 20 most
fascinating women in politics by the late John Kennedy Jr.'s George
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has completed a book on her experiences, which is scheduled
for publication next spring by Harper San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said she's ready to get on with her life. She said she
hopes a scheduled rally Sunday in Stafford to mark the second
anniversary of her protest will turn into a homecoming celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an agreement is reached, it would be the best gift I could
ever receive,'' she said.

THEY GROW UP FAST AND THEY DIE QUICKLY
</HEADLINE>

By JENNIFER BRIGGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the day after the Bonfire tragedy at Texas A&AMP;M University.
I am pulling into my parents' driveway in Arlington, Texas. There
is a strange car there. I see the Corps of Cadets sticker on the
back window. Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Oh my gosh, it's Ethan. One of two nephews who are like sons to
me. He's here. I just want to touch him. To feel his flesh. To feel
for sure that the tall, muscular body is warm as I grab his neck.
</P>
<P>
   He really is alive. He drove up here from College Station. So he
really is alive. He really was at the bottom of that Bonfire stack
as it fell. His brother Stuart is alive, too, though I haven't got
to touch him yet. Lord, how we all want to touch him.
</P>
<P>
   As I look back at what happened, and look forward at how we help
them heal, nothing is in order in my head because there is little
we can do to help them.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Ethan, the freshman, was next to climb the stack the night of
the accident that took the lives of 12 people. Literally seconds
from scaling that big nest of logs he had helped cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just heard this weird creaking noise,'' he said. ``The
snapping. And then the screams. There were screams everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, he was at the base, on the side where everything
fell. So many were trapped where he was.
</P>
<P>
   They dropped the big log his group was carrying and ran away,
with trees chasing them, and just as fast they ran back to pick
through the dead and injured. He and one other cadet were told to
run to the Corps dorm and alert their commanding officer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lights of my life, whom I see here in a
Superman-suit-and-cowboy-hat photo, was running through the dark at
3 a.m., a mile, to alert the sleeping cadets to the worst news they
may ever hear.
</P>
<P>
   They called their commanding officer ``Mister,'' as the freshman
are told to do. And then they told him. Then, hearts beating like
sparrows, they ran, banging on doors.
</P>
<P>
   Something terrible has happened at the stack. Help.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Stuart's shift, also. He is my oldest nephew, who had
been stupid a few weeks earlier and had ridden a motorcycle a half
block and fallen over somehow. As a senior, he was scheduled to be
at the top of that pile on one of those ropes during the very
moment it collapsed. An injury on the bike prevented it. If not for
a matter of seconds and stupidity, we could have lost two boys.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We coax our children onto the Shock Wave or the Texas Giant at
Six Flags when they are little. We run them up to the hospital when
they fall at a garage sale and they separate a shoulder _ and no
one knows for sure at first that they are hurt, because we hold our
breath for those five precious seconds after a child's fall,
waiting to see if they are just scared or really hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we know they are scared and hurt. But as the older
people, the alleged grownups, we know not where the hurt comes from
or where it will go. And we long for soccer bruises and
water-up-the-nose-at-the-lake tears.
</P>
<P>
   That water weenie of a little boy we bribed into a wet maze at
Sesame Place ran one mile to bang on doors and tell several hundred
young men about something the state of Texas will regret, but he
will never forget.
</P>
<P>
   He is the little boy I see here in a photograph of a plastic
swimming pool, all out of sorts because water went up his nose.
</P>
<P>
   I am in from out of state and sitting in the room I grew up in.
There is a quote as big as an old Polaroid at the top of Page 15A
of the Star-Telegram from Ethan: ``It was unmistakable. You could
hear the creaking, snapping sound and then the screams. There were
screams everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I ever be able to quit looking at it?''
</P>
<P>
   Below it, he is that half-naked portrait in a swimming pool,
smiling and squinting, fat-bellied, like some little Austin Powers
clone, sans suit.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We are at Sesame Place. They are both less than 10 years old.
Stuart and I go through the maze in that water thingy. Ethan will
not go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be a baby, Ethan,'' I say as I push him away and force
him into that hose vortex.
</P>
<P>
   Today, I cannot hold him close enough. That little boy at the
bottom of the stack, the bad part of the stack where everything
fell, after assisting those he could get to, ran a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over it plays out in my head until I am sick of my
brain replaying it. I just want to touch his flesh over and over.
But I don't. I don't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We are standing at the funeral of Jerry Don Self, one of those
killed in the collapse. Ethan is back at A&AMP;M. Stuart has his arms
wrapped around the woman he will propose to two days later. These
are babies.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart takes off his Corps hat. The program from his Uncle Bud's
funeral in July is folded neatly inside the plastic lining along
with the program for this funeral.
</P>
<P>
   They play Taps. It is warm. The heels of women's shoes poke into
the parched Texas soil. The clouds close in, and the sky begins to
cry little tears.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny droplets roll down shaved heads.
</P>
<P>
   I pick lint off his uniform. Such an absurd gesture at such a
time when a flag is flying halfway down a pole and tears are
rolling down young men's cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Don Self's mama looks like she has been in a terrible
accident. And she has. How can his grandmas even walk?
</P>
<P>
   Stuart looks like he did the day one of his grandfathers died,
drawn and red-eyed, almost 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I notice the tiny imperfections in the skin on his shaved head.
I want to touch his shoulder, to lean on him, but it is a private
grief I cannot fix.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We go back to the day it happened.
</P>
<P>
   I have a dream in the middle of the night. I believe it is real
at the time. It is maybe 1:30 or so. I think the old Arlington
Stadium, or maybe The Ballpark at Arlington, is falling.
</P>
<P>
   I dream The Boys are out there, and there are big brown bricks.
It may be the same time that the Bonfire is falling. I do not know.
But I know they are OK and something important has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me how in the world I could know anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   At College Station, it is 3 a.m., and it is not a dream. Our
youngest is picking through the dead and injured. Then he is
running.
</P>
<P>
   It is a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   My mother comes in at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart and Ethan are OK,'' she says, near crying. ``Something
collapsed by the stadium, and they were there. Ethan was on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that,'' I said. ``It all fell. I know they are OK.''
</P>
<P>
   My husband asks, ``How could you know that?''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unmistakable. You could hear the creaking, snapping
sound and then the screams. There were screams everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That quote happens to be sitting on a desk with the pictures of
these two young men. The three of us coming off Mr. Toad's Wild
Ride at Walt Disney World. We are laughing hysterically.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   I walked down the corridors of Baylor Medical Center with arms
on their shoulders, trying to explain that Christmas Eve in the
1980s, what it means when your mamma has a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   Or the day Pawpaw Cecil was buried, the future Corps of Cadets
chaplain crawled from bed and came to me at 1 a.m., asking what it
would be like when Jesus came again and if we would see Pawpaw
Cecil.
</P>
<P>
   I could even wiggle out of that one and try to explain my
thoughts on the matter, how if it happened like we thought it
might, we'd all be in the same place when the whole big drama had
played itself out.
</P>
<P>
   But I cannot explain this.
</P>
<P>
   So, though as a journalist I hate to admit it because of how we
are, but as a Christian, I must. I pray.
</P>
<P>
   So what do I say to the chaplain of the Corps of Cadets as he
grapples with his own grief and attempts to console so many others,
500 of whom he is in charge of, when he is only 22?
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you need me to pray for?'' I ask in one of perhaps
seven phone calls made to his room the day that it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pray for Ethan,'' he says on the phone. ``He saw a lot more
than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stuart was off to counsel four cadets and move logs.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I look again at all the photos before me.
</P>
<P>
   There he is in his boots _ not his senior boots of the Corps,
but the little ones. He has some play gun in his hand and some
Speed Racer kind of helmet on. It looks worse than the time Lisa
Green and I dressed up like Totie Fields and walked to Buddies
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   We are in parks; we are playing baseball as a family and wading
into water after a flood while my mother is hollering that we could
drown. Stuart and I are laughing.
</P>
<P>
   They are my dates at sports banquets I covered as a writer. I
reasoned that I would have a date, a boyfriend, for a moment in the
scheme of things, but these were my boys forever.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know they aren't. In the long run, I guess they all belong
to God. If they were terminally ill, either of them, I could send
them to Disney World and make them tuna sandwiches, wipe their
foreheads and fill them with Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   They are just terminally hurt.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unmistakable. You could hear the creaking, snapping
sound and then the screams. There were screams everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Did this little boy I built a wagon for on Christmas Eve in 1983
really see that?
</P>
<P>
   On that Monday, they played Taps at Moore Funeral Home. That's
where most of the dead in our family are. Even a dog's ashes were
recently (and surreptitiously) interred there.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell anybody we put 'em there with my Uncle Bud.
</P>
<P>
   As the cadets filed past the Self family, I went over to see
Uncle Bud. I told him something that someone in the family did that
was stupid and funny. Then I told him why we were all there.
</P>
<P>
   They would have been atop that pile, I explain. We were even
down there at College Station when they cut the logs, and then
Ethan came in all tired and dirty, happier to sleep than to eat the
hamburgers at the Aggie home we were at.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Look at your 1-year-olds. If you raise them good, their strength
may be inestimable.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much you love them, someday, their grief may
be insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   There is no ice pack, no splint, no chocolate or Power Rangers
coloring book that makes this ever go away.
</P>
<P>
   It is just there.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer and verses may help seal the wound for the religious. But
the bleeding will never stop for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In the room I am in, there is this huge bear that Stuart used to
sleep on. I got it when I worked at Six Flags Over Texas when he
was a baby and I was still a child. It is partially blind, having
lost one plastic eye in the procession of years that lead to garage
sales. He was salvaged. A little Febreeze and an eye transplant,
and he will be passed to our next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Dear God, thank you we still have a next generation.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Three generations of women stand in the rain, watching them get
ready to pull out of a house on Westwood Drive and go back to A&AMP;M
after the funeral. It is the driveway of their grandparents, where
they learned about road rash on trikes and sold Dr Pepper to the
lines of cars waiting to see the Christmas lights in the
Interlochen neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   They were driven out of this driveway to see Nolan Ryan's
5,000th strikeout. Today I stand in this driveway, after a funeral,
wondering how I can fix this. They separate that shoulder, break an
arm at soccer, don't make the baseball team in high school. That
can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   There are words that grownups with more experience at being
grownups than a 22-year-old can suck up through their throat and
spit out to both babies and grown children in other rough
situations.
</P>
<P>
   You tell them you are proud of them anyway, though these two
seldom failed. It's OK that you didn't make varsity.
</P>
<P>
   Or you throw 'em in the car and get over to the hospital for
those stitches.
</P>
<P>
   And you watch the wound heal.
</P>
<P>
   My nephews, whom I sit here this minute and look at in
photographs, with a doctor's kit, by a Christmas tree, with a
Superman suit in a cowboy hat, have more healing to do than they
can even know, and I can only guess at.
</P>
<P>
   What do we do? Send them cookies and Gumby's Pizza gift
certificates? Pray? Take them to CiCi's?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them have witnessed what is clearly an unspeakable
tragedy. There are no words to give our children at a time like
this.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Just after the funeral, Stuart says he is on the list of people
taking Aggie charters to California for another funeral.
</P>
<P>
   I hold my breath. I sigh, ``Well, that's good,'' half lying in
how I feel about a kid who has faced so much death going halfway
across a continent and back in a day on an unknown charter.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot fix this, either.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Here is the church where I answered an altar call when I was 10.
Gave my heart to Jesus by a Southern Baptist pulpit, as many good
Texans _ and bad ones _ do.
</P>
<P>
   We sing about saving a wretch like me, and sawing varsity's
horns off _ short. Two thousand mighty voices. I think how I have
got to call my friend Lisa, now in Indiana, and tell her we sang
the ``Aggie War Hymn'' in church and said ``hell,'' twice, right
there in First Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   I think about how Mr. Self's mamma looks like she could ...
well, not faint, but just implode.
</P>
<P>
   I think about this peri-menopausal thing and wonder if that is
why I feel like I could faint dead away right there _ or is it
because I will have no words for The Boys because I have no words
of comfort for myself, for anyone?
</P>
<P>
   We cannot fix this. It is not a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where I went to vacation Bible school. Here is where one
of my dearest sits in a uniform, wearing his senior boots. Alive.
Crying like a guy cries.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where grief has come home to rest.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not sleep long.
</P>
<P>
   We are at a funeral. Singing the ``Aggie War Hymn.'' The act
itself is a reminder that, we, my family, could be doing it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many are.
</P>
<P>
   They grow up so fast. They die so quickly.

BARAK HALTS EXPANSION OF WEST BANK JEWISH SETTLEMENTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was about
to land here on Tuesday night, Ehud Barak, the prime minister of
Israel, sought to defuse growing tensions with the Palestinians by
pledging to halt the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak stopped short of declaring a freeze on construction,
partly, and unsuccessfully, to avoid provoking the right-wing
members of his coalition. But he did call for a moratorium of
several months on new settler neighborhoods to avert confrontation
during a delicate period as the parties seek to reach the framework
for a final peace agreement by February.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be nothing on the ground,'' his spokesman, Gadi
Baltiansky, said, expressing the decision more bluntly than the
prime minister. ``No bulldozers will work on the ground. There is
no point in embarrassing or provoking the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's impending visit appeared to catalyze a minor crisis _
and potential resolution _ between the Israelis and the
Palestinians. The Palestinians walked away from the negotiating
table on Monday in protest of Barak's settlement policy, a move
that the Israeli government initially described as a stunt to lure
the Americans back into a salvage role in the two-way negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But, shortly before Albright flew into Israel, Barak apparently
decided that the Palestinian concern was deep-seated and needed to
be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, in the course of the next three months, are in a critical
political struggle, and therefore wisdom is needed and this
government has that wisdom,'' Barak said in a brief news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and his aides were caught
by surprise and initially didn't know quite how to react to Barak's
declaration. But the settler leaders, with whom Barak has tried to
build a cooperative relationship, immediately expressed their
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that Barak gives in to pressure and extortion and
he has succumbed to the pressure of Arafat and the Americans,''
said Benny Kashriel, the moderate leader of the Yesha Council, the
settlers' umbrella organization.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to meet Barak at his residence for
breakfast on Wednesday, to meet Arafat, the Palestinian leader, in
Ramallah later in the day, and then perhaps to return to Barak for
a second meeting.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the day in Damascus, Albright emerged from a
three-hour meeting at a hilltop palace with Hafez Assad, the Syrian
president, proclaiming to be ``more optimistic'' about the
possibility that Israeli-Syrian negotiations could be revived. She
declined to spell out why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussions about negotiations are very much like mushrooms,''
she said at a news conference. ``They do much better when they are
not in the light.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Jewish settlements in the disputed territory of the
West Bank is always a sore point between the Israelis and the
Palestinians. But when the Palestinians stopped the negotiations on
Monday, they were irked by a particular development. The Israeli
Housing Ministry, which is controlled by the settlers' National
Religious Party, had just sought bids for 500 new apartments in the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Barak's senior negotiator, Oded Eran,
publicly lent credence to the Palestinians' frustration, saying
that the Palestinian negotiators had told him repeatedly that they
were ``losing credibility in the eyes of the Palestinian public''
because of ongoing settlement activity.

N.Y. TIMES NAMES 2 NEW CRITICS FOR GROWING FILM FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times has appointed two new film critics
to review the growing number of new releases, executive editor
Joseph Lelyveld announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The critics, Elvis Mitchell, 41, of The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram, and A.O. Scott, 33, the Sunday book critic at
Newsday, will assume their duties in January, joining Stephen
Holden, who has been a staff critic for The Times for 11 years. The
three will share responsibilities, with Holden in particular also
writing regular critical essays in the Arts &AMP; Leisure section on
Sundays, said Lelyveld.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Maslin, the newspaper's senior film critic, announced
Sept. 21 that she was leaving the paper after 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, The Star-Telegram's film critic for two years,
previously reviewed films for The Los Angeles Herald-Examiner and
The Detroit Free Press. For the last 15 years, he has also been an
entertainment critic for ``Weekend Edition with Scott Simon'' on
National Public Radio. He was also host of the film-related
interview program ``The Treatment'' for KCRW, Santa Monica's public
radio station, and the host of the Independent Film Channel's
``Independent Focus'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has also written on movies for Rolling Stone, GQ and
Interview magazines. He was brought up in Detroit and attended
Wayne State University.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Newsday last April, Scott wrote for The New York
Times Book Review, The New York Review of Books, The Nation and The
New Yorker. He has been an editor at The New York Review and Lingua
Franca and has been a regular contributor on culture and politics
to the Internet magazine Slate. A recent article in Slate on Martin
Scorsese drew him to the attention of The Times, said Lelyveld.
Scott has a B.A. in literature from Harvard and a master's degree
in English from Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   Lelyveld said the increase in the number of critics was a
response to the growing number of movie releases. In 1990 The Times
ran 325 movie reviews; so far this year, the number is 375.

Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that ``The Cider House Rules'' is the best John Irving
adaptation to ever hit the screen is a little like saying that
lethal injection is our most wonderful form of capital punishment.
With Irving movies, what are the alternatives? The bittersweet and
brainless ``The World According to Garp''? The witless ``Hotel New
Hampshire''? The sappy ``Simon Birch''?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Irving has not been well-served by cinema, which could
be why he decided to write the screenplay for ``Cider House''
himself. And while the movie is a decided improvement over the
recent six-hour stage version, ``Cider'' remains a pretty thin
coming-of-age tale that frames its moral concerns in ways that are
a little too obvious. It's a decent film that's hampered by its own
illusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cider House'' follows the story of Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), a young man who grows up in the sheltering atmosphere of
the St. Cloud's orphanage in Maine. Homer is the favorite of the
orphanage's director, Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), but as he
grows older, he begins to feel confined. He also doesn't approve of
Dr. Larch's side business _ performing abortions.
</P>
<P>
   When Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) and Wally Worthington (Paul
Rudd) pay a visit to the good doctor, Homer decides to adopt them
and liberate himself from St. Cloud's. Homer sees the ocean for the
first time, picks apples with a group of itinerants and falls in
love with Candy after Wally leaves for Air Force duty in World War
II. He gradually forgets St. Cloud's, but Dr. Larch can't shake the
memory of Homer (although he tries, using generous doses of ether).
</P>
<P>
   It's all pleasant enough, with the low-key Maguire turning in
another fine performance, albeit one that is growing somewhat
familiar. The story's conflict comes when Homer is confronted with
a situation that tests his long-held views on abortion. If there's
little question about Homer's choice, it's because Irving has so
completely stacked the deck in his story, producing a situation
that would probably make Pat Robertson jettison his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, instead of delivering a truly provocative film, Irving's
``Cider House'' stands as a pretty slight tale of moral relativism.
Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom displays an eye for wintry
landscapes, which is appropriate, given the film's cold and
somewhat distant tone. Nobody, save Caine, makes much of an
impression, and his screen time is too scant to truly make you care
about his complex character.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax, the film's distributor, will undoubtedly spend millions
of dollars selling ``Cider,'' as this is the Oscar-hungry studio's
only real chance for academy gold. If they somehow manage some
nominations for this modest movie, it will be time for other
studios to wave the white flag and rename the Oscars in Harvey
Weinstein's honor. &QL;

   UN-SCULPTURED-ART (Somewhere in Nevada) _ Michael Heizer doesn't
want you to know where he lives, just that he's in the middle of
nowhere in the middle of Nevada. Heizer has just completed the
first phase of his sculpture ``City.'' The structures _ which he
calls ``complexes,'' using a term archaeologists use for buildings
at ancient sites _ are massive concrete and dirt mastabas,
rectangles with sloped sides. What now exists of ``City'' has got
to be one of the most massive modern sculptures ever built. After
nearly 30 years, Heizer has passed the first stage toward
completing what is essentially his own Chichen Itza in the desert.

   GREEN-MILE-FILM (Hollywood) _ ``The Green Mile'' will open on
Friday in theaters across the country. Directed by Frank Darabont,
whose first film, ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' drew seven Academy
Award nominations in 1995, it is also based on a Stephen King story
and also set in a prison. In this movie, Tom Hanks plays a Death
Row prison guard in the 1930s who comes to believe that one of his
prisoners, a gentle and somewhat dim giant played by Michael Clarke
Duncan, has supernatural healing powers and may, in fact, be a kind
of angel. By Rick Lyman.

sprightly genius he proves to be, too, in Peter Shaffer's
metaphysical melodrama, which combines speculative historical
musings with a meditation on divine injustice. Shaffer's play, a
revival, will open Wednesday at the Music Box Theater on Broadway.

   METROPOLITAN-OPERA (New York) _ Following the Metropolitan
Opera's ups and downs is a prime entertainment for any music-loving
city dweller. Though many call the house's vision dull, its
week-by-week operation offers plenty. Wagner's ``Tristan und
Isolde,'' now near the end of its limited run, has been a
considerable success. Assembled were Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner,
two principals who represent the present and the future of an opera
notoriously hard to cast. With them was one of the important Wagner
conductors of the century, James Levine, and a pit orchestra as
good as any in the world. Levine's ``Tristan,'' like much of his
Wagner, is very slow, but it was salutary to surrender to a
different point of view and follow it to a conclusion: a trip worth
taking. By Bernard Holland. Photo.

<P>
   LAS-VEGAS-OPERA (Las Vegas) _ What news on the Rialto? Since
spring, they've finished construction on the bridge and filled the
Grand Canal; a few blocks down, a new Paris has its Opera, Eiffel
Tower and Hotel de Ville; and ``O'' has spoiled me for ``The
Ring.'' Greetings from Las Vegas, self-styled Entertainment Capital
of the World, where I have lately landed to contemplate new
frontiers for opera: opera, for the purposes of this discussion,
standing for something greater than itself. Somewhat to the
surprise of observers unattuned to the cyclical rhythms of cultural
history, an art form that within the lifetime of composers now near
their prime was being written off as a moribund anachronism is
experiencing something like a renaissance. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

gold, jewels, armor and pottery _ is told in ``Gold of the Nomads:
Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine,'' an exhibition of 171
objects here at the San Antonio Museum of Art, through Jan. 30. The

Baltimore, where it moves in March. By Rita Reif.

<P>
   MORIYAMA-PHOTOS (New York) _ Daido Moriyama, 61, was everywhere
in New York this fall. The subject of exhibitions at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Japan Society and the Laurence Miller
Gallery; of a handsome catalog on his life and work (from the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and of essays in prominent art
magazines, he has enjoyed scholarly star treatment that no other
Japanese photographer has ever been given in this country. The
reviews were mainly raves. By Richard B. Woodward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOAMY-ART (New York) _ If outdoor earthworks are difficult to
preserve, an ``interior earth sculpture,'' which is how the
conceptual artist Walter De Maria described his 1977 installation
in a Manhattan building, has its own upkeep demands. Twenty-two
years ago, De Maria transformed a desirable 3,600-square-foot piece
of SoHo real estate into something useless. ``The New York Earth
Room'' is 250 cubic yards of earth, piled 22 inches deep. Today,
the work has art historical significance and also provides a
welcome respite from the shopaholics on SoHo's crowded streets.
Some 10,000 people visit the piece annually. One can't walk on it _
a glass barrier contains the earth and keeps people out _ but a
loamy smell definitely permeates the space. By William Harris.

   TV-BECKER (Undated) _ ``He's the most flawed character I've ever
written,'' says David Hackel, proudly, of Dr. John Becker, the
middle-aged lead character played by Ted Danson, the ex-``Cheers''
sitcom star. Becker is a politically incorrect malcontent with no
real counterpart in today's youth-obsessed sitcom world. Positioned
neatly at 9:30 p.m. on Mondays on CBS behind the hit ``Everybody
Loves Raymond,'' ``Becker'' the show regularly finishes in the
Nielsen top 20 and has become what Hackel, 51, a veteran sitcom
writer and producer, a bit nervously calls a ``stealth'' success.

   TV-WB (Undated) _ For three years running, the WB television
network has been the favored child of Madison Avenue ad buyers,
media types and teenage-girl America. A trio of freshman shows are
doing well: ``Popular,'' ``Roswell'' and ``Angel,'' the last an
offshoot of WB's flagship, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Of course,
none of the new shows have gone above No. 107 in the ratings, but
by WB standards they're hits. Each of the three has growing buzz
and critical support. Each is set in the present day in one of
three WB preferred locations: high school, college or
flunky-job-early-stage adulthood. By Margy Rochlin.

RUSSIANS COMPLAIN THAT WEST LINKS IMF AID TO CHECNYA CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian officials on Tuesday reacted angrily to Western
condemnation of Moscow's military tactics in Chechnya, warning that
threats to impose sanctions or interrupt aid are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials insisted that Russia is already feeling the
effects of the West's criticism through the International Monetary
Fund's decision in the past week to once again postpone delivery of
a $640-million credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that in this case, political considerations were
crucial in the decision-making,'' said First Deputy Prime Minister
Victor Khristenko. ``The IMF's status as a non-political
organization is in question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military's ultimatum to residents of the Chechen
capital of Grozny to get out of the city by Saturday or risk death
has provoked a torrent of criticism in Western capitals. In
Britain, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said that European Union aid
to Russia would be reviewed at a meeting next week if the Russian
military does not observe ``basic humanitarian norms.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has warned Moscow that it would pay ``a heavy
price'' if it continued killing civilians in a war that Russia
contends it is waging against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected the warnings.
``The language of economic sanctions and diktat is unacceptable,
all the more so when it concerns the issue of Russia's territorial
integrity and the fight against terrorism,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders and diplomats do not challenge Russia's right to
protect its territory against the Chechen separatists, and have
expressed support for Moscow's efforts to suppress guerrillas whose
attacks last August on a neighboring Russian region ignited the
latest conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But they have been increasingly outraged by what NATO
Secretary-General George Robinson called Russia's ``hamfisted''
tactics in a war that has caused uncounted civilian deaths, and a
chaotic exodus of more than 200,000 refugees. Robertson said the
Russian military campaign was both counter-productive, and
unacceptable to the international community.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of Western indignation over Russian
financial scandals, the criticism of the Chechen war has cast a new
pall over Russia's relations with the West, and several Russian
commentators are already warning of a new Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia is heavily indebted to its Western creditors, and the
Russian government, now as during the NATO war in Kosovo, has been
careful not to close off its relationship with Western partners.
But Russia's economic dependence is itself a source of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been eagerly awaiting the latest installment of
credits from the IMF; Russia has pledged to use the money simply to
offset outstanding debts to the fund. Without the money, Russia
would have cut back on its spending, and dip into hard currency
reserves. Otherwise, it would fall short of the tight budget
policies it pledged to adhere to in an agreement with the IMF last
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The $640 million credit, the second part of a $4.5-billion
package approved last year, was originally to be delivered in
September, once Russia showed it was in full compliance with the
fiscal requirements set forth in the agreement. But the fund
postponed the loan and pressed for new conditions, at the urging of
leading industrial countries. The conditions were aimed largely at
structural economic reforms, in part as a result of the Russian
financial scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to meet those new conditions - which include measures
setting higher standards of accountability and openness for
financial institutions - have been cited by IMF spokesmen as the
reasons for the latest delay.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, speaking to reporters
Tuesday, said he was not convinced that the reasons were not
political. ``The formal pretext is a supposed failure to implement
certain obligations,'' he said. `'We do not think so.''

CLERIC CHALLENGES BLACK LEADERS TO CONFRONT AIDS EPIDEMIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WIL HAYGOOD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a strongly-worded open letter, to be released in
Washington Thursday, Boston minister Eugene Rivers will call on
black American leaders to draw on their religious, intellectual,
and political resources to confront the AIDS epidemic that has been
raging across sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that efforts by black officials in America to confront
the crisis have been ``woefully inadequate,'' Rivers is urging a
broad-based response. His ideas range from forgiving the debt of
countries hardest hit by the virus to galvanizing students,
ministers, and the activist wing of America's black entertainment
community to try and force the crisis high onto the US political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning his letter with a ``Brothers and Sisters'' greeting,
Rivers immediately lays out his challenge:
</P>
<P>
   ``When a future generation of black scholars conduct their
historical research on the moral and political life of US black
leadership in the final decade of the 20th century, how shall they
judge our performance regarding the AIDS holocaust in Sub-Saharan
Africa?'' Rivers writes. ``How shall our inaction _ especially the
inaction of black men _ withstand the judgment of history?''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers notes other international calamities that were followed
by inaction, and says the political failure of others ``will not be
a sufficient explanation for why the most powerful and influential
black leadership class in the world failed to act decisively in
defense of their women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers heads the 21st Century Group _ a think tank composed of
young blacks whom he refers to as the ``intellectual arm'' of his
Boston-based 10-Point Coalition, which has long engaged in
grappling with urban crises.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve million Africans have already died of AIDS, and it is
estimated that more than 22 million others in sub-Saharan Africa
are infected with HIV, which causes the disease. By 2001, it is
projected that there will be 13 million AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has gathered more than a dozen ministers from various
denominations, along with intellectuals and activists around the
country, who will appear with him at the National Press Club, where
he will release his open letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have black churches, especially the seven major black
denominations, not used their unique position to serve as more
effective advocates for the needs and interests of millions of
orphans in Africa?'' Rivers asks in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   He outlines a three-pronged strategy based on public education,
political advocacy, and humanitarian assistance. Specifically,
Rivers calls on the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
and other international lending agencies to forgive the debt of
African countries devastated by AIDS so they can free up money to
cope with the epidemic. He urges the Clinton administration to
demand that Western pharmaceutical companies permit African
companies to lower the cost of AIDS-fighting drugs, and asks that
all elements of US black leadership mobilize to supply food,
clothing, medicine, and other humanitarian aid to AIDS orphans in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers also appeals in the letter to a variety of prominent
black journalists and entertainers to focus attention on the AIDS
crisis in Africa. And he asks the US special envoy to Africa, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, ``to bring his gifts for publicity and his
powerful rhetoric to mount a grassroots campaign for morally
responsible sexual behavior on the part of men of African
descent.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Rivers's interest, outlined as part of a four-part
Boston Globe series in October about the AIDS crisis in Africa, has
focused on the role that male promiscuity is playing in fueling the
epidemic on the continent. In his letter, he chides black American
leaders about their reticence to criticize African leaders who
refuse to bring up the topic of sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black leaders must challenge African leadership to be more
accountable to the needs of their own women and children,'' Rivers
writes in his letter. ``We must . . . challenge African leaders to
mobilize their societies to exact a high price for the rape of all
women, especially of innocent girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the Rivers approach is the realpolitik assumption
that given the historic indifference to the plight of Africa on the
part of white-dominated governments in America and the West, it is
up to American black leaders to take the lead on the AIDS crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black community will have to be at the vanguard of
addressing the AIDS isssue in Africa because no other community in
the world will care as much about the deaths of other black people
as we will,'' says Marcia Coleman-Adebayo, a former foreign policy
researcher for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation who has
worked with Africans struggling with the AIDS crisis. ``It's just
one of those truths we don't want to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ronald Clifton Potter, a minister based in Jackson,
Miss., is one of the signatories of the open letter who will appear
in Washington alongside Rivers. He believes black churches must
recast their outlook and philosophies to deal with AIDS in Africa.
``I think black churches _ and black leadership _ in this country
must begin to engage in prophetic discourse and activism,'' says
Potter, who also teaches history at the historically-black Jackson
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Potter says his main concern is the gnawing silence about the
AIDS problem that he sees deepening in the US black community.
``There exists a kind of code of silence,'' Potter said. ``My fear
is that black churches might not wake up to what's happening until
the AIDS crisis is placed at our doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. A.G. Miller, an associate professor of religion at
Oberlin College who also signed the Rivers letter, thinks US blacks
have come late to the AIDS in Africa crisis because of early
stories about the African origins of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general anger and suspicion by black folk, feeling
they were being blamed for something negative,'' Miller said.
``Underneath that, there was a sense of denial _ or a desire not to
identify with the disease. And in some ways maybe even attempt to
ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has been greeted skeptically by some veteran civil rights
figures as he proceeds with his AIDS plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some of what it takes: a big mouth and a sharp
tongue,'' says Julian Bond, chairman of the board of directors of
the NAACP and a longtime civil rights activist. ``That's part of
building a movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond cautions, however, that Rivers must bring other gifts to
such a challenge. ``The power of shame and embarrasment are
great,'' Bond says, ``but it takes more than that. It takes a level
of organization I'm not sure Rev. Rivers or any organization has.''
</P>
<P>
   Never shy about pricking the conscience of the black
establishment, Rivers says he expects grumbling about his foray
into international affairs. ``That will be unavoidable,'' he said
in an interview. ``They will say, `Who does that Negro think he is,
grumbling?' That comes regardless of who you are. You can be Martin
Luther King, they grumble. You can be Desmond Tutu, they grumble.''

ENGLISH-GERMAN MATCH LOOMS FOR 2002 WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're wringing their hands in England and Germany. They're
clapping their hands in Spain and Sweden. And in America, they'll
be sitting on their hands until springtime.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's preliminary draw in Tokyo for the 2002 men's World Cup
soccer tournament in Japan and South Korea, involving a record 195
countries, produced a dream (or nightmare) matchup for the ages as
the archrival English and Germans were tossed into the same
European group for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night over a beer we were joking about playing each
other,'' said England coach Kevin Keegan. ``Now, the joking will
have to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't laughing in Italy after the unseeded Azzurri had
drawn tough Romania. Or in Ireland, which was grouped with
powerhouse Netherlands and Portugal. Or in Scotland, which was
dumped in with Belgium and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   But there was relief among the Swedes, who need only hold off
the Turks to advance to the 32-team final, and also among the
Spaniards, who drew Austria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who have qualified for the last three Cups, were
merely bystanders Tuesday. They've been given a pass (along with
Mexico, Jamaica, and Costa Rica) into the 12-team regional
semifinals, which won't begin until next autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rest of the 35 countries from North and Central America
and the Caribbean have been trimmed to eight by next spring, the US
will be drawn into a four-team group that will include three
Central American teams, three Caribbean teams, or a blend that
would likely include Canada. The top two from each of the three
semifinal groups advance to a six-team final, with the top three
making the Cup field.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, pegged by London oddsmakers Tuesday as 200-1
shots to win the Cup, again will play 16 qualifying matches. Last
time, they finished second in a final group that included Mexico,
Jamaica, Costa Rica, Canada, and El Salvador and went on to finish
last in the 1998 Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion France and cohosts Japan and South Korea are
automatic qualifiers for the tournament, which for the first time
will be staged in two countries and possibly three if North Korea
accepts an offer to stage two matches. Europe will have at least 13
more entries, Africa five, South America at least four, and Asia at
least two more.
</P>
<P>
   All but five of the 203 eligible countries will compete in the
preliminary round. Meanwhile FIFA, the international soccer
federation, announced that the next women's World Cup has been
moved from 2003 to 2002 and in the future will be held during the
same year as the men's event.

</HEADLINE>
 NUKES-HNS  
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the hedquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a eam,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend though
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updting its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

   MIDEAST-ALBRIGHT (Jerusalem) _ As Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was about to land here Tuesday night, Ehud Barak, the
prime minister of Israel, sought to defuse growing tensions with
the Palestinians by pledging to halt the expansion of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank. Barak stopped short of baldly
declaring a freeze on construction, partly _ and unsuccessfully _
to avoid provoking the right-wing members of his coalition. But, in
an unexpected change of approach, he called a moratorium of several
months on new settler neighborhoods to avert confrontation during a
delicate period, as the parties seek to reach a framework final
peace agreement by February. By Deborah Sontag.

   FIRST-DAWN (Gisborne, New Zealand) _ The first sunrise of the
new millennium will be a cold and lonely moment as the midnight sun
dips below the horizon near Dibble Glacier in Antarctica, then, a
few minutes later, creeps up again. At the western edge of the
international dateline, the silent Antarctic dawn will take place
14 hours before the big ball descends to mark the new year in Times
Square _ and more than 21 hours before the sun rises in New York at
7:20 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2000. But no one is likely to be there on the
distant glacier to see the century's first dawn. This has touched
off a rough and tumble competition among the islands of the South
Pacific for the claim of being the first inhabited place to witness
the first fresh sunbeams of the future. By Seth Mydans.

routed in a furious 10-hour firefight against Russian helicopters,

Tuesday that he would resign. Stamper said that he wished to

CLERIC CHALLENGES BLACK LEADERS TO CONFRONT AIDS EPIDEMIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WIL HAYGOOD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a strongly-worded open letter, to be released in
Washington Thursday, Boston minister Eugene Rivers will call on
black American leaders to draw on their religious, intellectual,
and political resources to confront the AIDS epidemic that has been
raging across sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that efforts by black officials in America to confront
the crisis have been ``woefully inadequate,'' Rivers is urging a
broad-based response. His ideas range from forgiving the debt of
countries hardest hit by the virus to galvanizing students,
ministers, and the activist wing of America's black entertainment
community to try and force the crisis high onto the US political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning his letter with a ``Brothers and Sisters'' greeting,
Rivers immediately lays out his challenge:
</P>
<P>
   ``When a future generation of black scholars conduct their
historical research on the moral and political life of US black
leadership in the final decade of the 20th century, how shall they
judge our performance regarding the AIDS holocaust in Sub-Saharan
Africa?'' Rivers writes. ``How shall our inaction _ especially the
inaction of black men _ withstand the judgment of history?''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers notes other international calamities that were followed
by inaction, and says the political failure of others ``will not be
a sufficient explanation for why the most powerful and influential
black leadership class in the world failed to act decisively in
defense of their women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers heads the 21st Century Group _ a think tank composed of
young blacks whom he refers to as the ``intellectual arm'' of his
Boston-based 10-Point Coalition, which has long engaged in
grappling with urban crises.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve million Africans have already died of AIDS, and it is
estimated that more than 22 million others in sub-Saharan Africa
are infected with HIV, which causes the disease. By 2001, it is
projected that there will be 13 million AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has gathered more than a dozen ministers from various
denominations, along with intellectuals and activists around the
country, who will appear with him at the National Press Club, where
he will release his open letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have black churches, especially the seven major black
denominations, not used their unique position to serve as more
effective advocates for the needs and interests of millions of
orphans in Africa?'' Rivers asks in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   He outlines a three-pronged strategy based on public education,
political advocacy, and humanitarian assistance. Specifically,
Rivers calls on the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
and other international lending agencies to forgive the debt of
African countries devastated by AIDS so they can free up money to
cope with the epidemic. He urges the Clinton administration to
demand that Western pharmaceutical companies permit African
companies to lower the cost of AIDS-fighting drugs, and asks that
all elements of US black leadership mobilize to supply food,
clothing, medicine, and other humanitarian aid to AIDS orphans in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers also appeals in the letter to a variety of prominent
black journalists and entertainers to focus attention on the AIDS
crisis in Africa. And he asks the US special envoy to Africa, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, ``to bring his gifts for publicity and his
powerful rhetoric to mount a grassroots campaign for morally
responsible sexual behavior on the part of men of African
descent.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Rivers's interest, outlined as part of a four-part
Boston Globe series in October about the AIDS crisis in Africa, has
focused on the role that male promiscuity is playing in fueling the
epidemic on the continent. In his letter, he chides black American
leaders about their reticence to criticize African leaders who
refuse to bring up the topic of sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black leaders must challenge African leadership to be more
accountable to the needs of their own women and children,'' Rivers
writes in his letter. ``We must . . . challenge African leaders to
mobilize their societies to exact a high price for the rape of all
women, especially of innocent girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the Rivers approach is the realpolitik assumption
that given the historic indifference to the plight of Africa on the
part of white-dominated governments in America and the West, it is
up to American black leaders to take the lead on the AIDS crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black community will have to be at the vanguard of
addressing the AIDS isssue in Africa because no other community in
the world will care as much about the deaths of other black people
as we will,'' says Marcia Coleman-Adebayo, a former foreign policy
researcher for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation who has
worked with Africans struggling with the AIDS crisis. ``It's just
one of those truths we don't want to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ronald Clifton Potter, a minister based in Jackson,
Miss., is one of the signatories of the open letter who will appear
in Washington alongside Rivers. He believes black churches must
recast their outlook and philosophies to deal with AIDS in Africa.
``I think black churches _ and black leadership _ in this country
must begin to engage in prophetic discourse and activism,'' says
Potter, who also teaches history at the historically-black Jackson
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Potter says his main concern is the gnawing silence about the
AIDS problem that he sees deepening in the US black community.
``There exists a kind of code of silence,'' Potter said. ``My fear
is that black churches might not wake up to what's happening until
the AIDS crisis is placed at our doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. A.G. Miller, an associate professor of religion at
Oberlin College who also signed the Rivers letter, thinks US blacks
have come late to the AIDS in Africa crisis because of early
stories about the African origins of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general anger and suspicion by black folk, feeling
they were being blamed for something negative,'' Miller said.
``Underneath that, there was a sense of denial _ or a desire not to
identify with the disease. And in some ways maybe even attempt to
ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has been greeted skeptically by some veteran civil rights
figures as he proceeds with his AIDS plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some of what it takes: a big mouth and a sharp
tongue,'' says Julian Bond, chairman of the board of directors of
the NAACP and a longtime civil rights activist. ``That's part of
building a movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond cautions, however, that Rivers must bring other gifts to
such a challenge. ``The power of shame and embarrasment are
great,'' Bond says, ``but it takes more than that. It takes a level
of organization I'm not sure Rev. Rivers or any organization has.''
</P>
<P>
   Never shy about pricking the conscience of the black
establishment, Rivers says he expects grumbling about his foray
into international affairs. ``That will be unavoidable,'' he said
in an interview. ``They will say, `Who does that Negro think he is,
grumbling?' That comes regardless of who you are. You can be Martin
Luther King, they grumble. You can be Desmond Tutu, they grumble.''

HASBRO PLANS SWEEPING LAYOFFS IN REFOCUS ON ELECTRONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hasbro Inc. is planning to lay off 2,200 employees worldwide in
a sweeping restructuring meant to focus the nation's No. 2 toy
maker on hot new electronic toys and old standbys like Monopoly and
Play-Doh.
</P>
<P>
   The move is an attempt to keep up with the shifting sands of the
toy business, where on-line shopping has hurt traditional sales and
ever-more sophisticated children demand the latest and greatest of
silicon-based wizadry, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   That the announcement from the Rhode Island company comes just
weeks before Christmas, traditionally the hottest toy-selling time
of the year, emphasizes the fact that times are especially
turbulent for toy makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of the toy industry have definitely changed,'' said
Margaret Whitfield, analyst at Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull.
``Play-Doh is Play-Doh and Mr. Potato Head is Mr. Potato Head.
Those have been very strong for 30, 40, 50 years. Hasbro is going
to focus on those things and also look to the very big interactive
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro said it plans to shutter manufacturing plants in Tijuana,
Mexico, and Ashford, England, accounting for 1,850 of the job cuts.
Production from those facilities will be moved to other Hasbro
plants and to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that more and more games and toys have computer
chips in them,'' Whitfield said. ``It makes more sense to be in
Asia, which is where the technology is.''
</P>
<P>
   A small number of jobs will be cut locally, company officials
said. About 25 engineers, designers and administrators will lose
their jobs at Hasbro's interactive games unit in Beverly. The unit
had expanded so rapidly as the company dived into the wildly
popular electronic arena that it ended up with a large number of
products that didn't sell, including the Falcon 4.0 flight
simulator game, said Hasbro spokesman Wayne Charness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very high cost to produce the flight simulators and
a low volume,'' he said. ``The product mix changes constantly, and
we grew so quickly in that area that we identified a number of
things that needed to go.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional 60 jobs will go at the company's Pawtucket, R.I.,
headquarters as Hasbro cuts sagging toy lines for girls and
preschoolers _ both of which are dominated by rival Mattel Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasbro's PlaySkool is a distant second to Mattel's Fischer
Price,'' Whitfield said. ``In the toy business, it doesn't pay to
be a distant second.''
</P>
<P>
   Other US jobs will be lost from the closing of research and
development facilities in Alameda, Calif., and Chapel Hill, N.C.,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the recently difficult times in the toy industry,
leader Mattel, maker of the Barbie and Hot Wheels lines, was
punished by investors when its recently acquired Learning Co. unit
lost $105 million in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, meanwhile, had retrenched just two years ago, slashing
2,500 jobs worldwide. More recently, it suffered disappointing
sales of Star Wars toys, which it licensed in one of the most
expensive and sweeping merchandising deals in toy history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company is enjoying record sales, in part because of
the astonishing popularity of Furby, the furry electronic toy that
children can teach to talk, and products keyed to the video
game-cum-movie phenomenon Pokeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pokeman business is absolutely on fire,'' Whitfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Mr. Potato Head has enjoyed a comeback this month
because of the recent success of the movie Toy Story 2, which
features a loveable animated version of the toy. And Hasbro is
hoping to stir new interest in Star Wars toys with a
just-in-time-for Christmas re-release of The Phantom Menace, the
latest installment of the science fiction movie series.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro shares fell 1 1/8 to 20 5/16 in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, well below their 52-week high of 37.

</HEADLINE>
 NUKES-HNS  
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

HANCOCK WIDENS SEARCH FOR MISSING CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Widening its search for scores of missing customers,
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. has asked top state
officials across the country to help it track down policyholders
eligible for compensation when the big insurer converts to a
publicly-traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, in a December 6 letter to the Massachusetts Division of
Insurance, said it had contacted 13 secretaries of state from coast
to coast last month to ask for assistance in tracing policyholders
with unknown whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The move came after Massachusetts Secretary of State William
Galvin, who has criticized the Boston-based insurer for not keeping
tabs on customers, conducted his own search of state databases last
month and located 23,000 in-state customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, a leading life insurer, has drawn criticism for losing
track of one quarter of its 3.3 million insurance customers. It has
found half of them but still has to locate some 400,000 people
nationwide, including 73,600 in Massachusetts. The company has 3.3
million policyholders overall, but in its letter to the Division it
claimed 5 million customers across all businesses, including its
mutual fund operations.
</P>
<P>
   About 2.9 million policyholders are eligible for stock, cash, or
beefier policies when Hancock issues $2 billion in an initial
public stock offering on Jan. 27 or 28.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer wants help from authorities in California, Florida,
Michigan, New York, Ohio, Vermont and other states where residents
bought Hancock insurance in previous decades, typically burial
policies worth less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Policy holders are the nominal owners of a mutual.
</P>
<P>
   About 94 percent of voting policyholders, or over 1 million
people, approved Hancock's conversion last week. Missing
policyholders, who may have moved without leaving forwarding
addresses or died, cannot now vote but have until the end of the
year to step forward and elect stock or cash. Most policyholders
had until Nov. 30 to choose the form of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock president and chief executive-elect David D'Alessandro
said the insurer would allow missing customers to come forward and
claim stock up to seven years after the initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Burgay, a Hancock spokesman, said Tuesday that the time
period for claiming compensation after the public offering would
vary by state. ``It will vary from state to state, depending on the
laws,'' Burgay said.
</P>
<P>
   But Galvin cast doubt on the offer. ``Keeping the option open
after the IPO has raised concerns with the SEC,'' he said. The
Securities and Exchange Commission overseas Hancock's initial
public offering, while Galvin and the Division of Insurance have
regulatory power over the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said Hancock was concerned that missing policyholders
could intentionally delay coming forward in order to profit from
gains in the new stock, which is expected to rise in value. He also
criticized Hancock for not contacting approximately 15,000
Massachusetts customers whose addresses he said his office had
forwarded to Hancock one week before the Nov. 30 policyholder
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's bookkeeping has enraged some customers who claim they
were never mailed any information about the company's conversion.
Elsie C. Flaherty, a long-time policyholder, said she had received
no mailings from the insurer in a while. ``How can they just lose
everything?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock says its problems stem from customers who move without
leaving forwarding addresses.

BOURQUE, GETTING OVER FLU, SAYS HE'S COMING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He admits the last little stretch hasn't been a whole
lot of fun. The Bruins have been in a downward spiral the last
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Independent of that, Ray Bourque said, he hasn't felt his best,
and it has been apparent on the ice. The unlimited energy the
Bruins' captain usually displays and the extra jump that has so
often been his hallmark have been lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said the flu knocked him for a loop and he's just now
starting to feel like his old self. He missed practice back on Nov.
19 because of the illness, but suffered through the schedule
because he didn't want to miss any more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a fever and I was tired and weak,'' said Bourque. ``I
wasn't feeling right. I had that for about a week. I played a
couple of games with it and you're just trying to survive the
games, more or less. I did that and I felt better after a while.
Now, I just want to get to where I was before that happened and I
think I'm getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who turns 39 this month, started the season feeling
great physically. As frustrating as it was for the Bruins to go
winless in their first nine games (0-5-4), he said he had a lot of
energy. Now, after battling the flu, it's just starting to come
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to play better, and I'll get there,'' he said. ``When
you get run down and you're not feeling too well, just energywise
and skatingwise, it takes time to get that back, and that's the
thing that was lacking is that extra step you might have when
you're feeling really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque endorsed the last two days of hard skating that coach
Pat Burns put the players through. He said it was a chance for the
club to regroup, especially after the horrifying 9-3 loss to the
Chicago Blackhawks at the FleetCenter Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well needed,'' said Bourque. ``Right now, it's a good
week to work on conditioning and skating. We've worked hard the
last couple of days. We know we're a good team and we had a tough
game on Saturday and it's a matter of rebounding and getting back
to the things we should be doing and doing them better and harder
and I think that'll happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his 21 seasons, Bourque said, invariably
there is at least one game a year when the video should be burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year you go through certain times where it might be a
game or a stretch of games where you're not doing the right things
and you're not doing the job you should be doing,'' he said. ``We
had a good month last month and we won a lot of games and got
ourselves back into the race. Of late, we were getting ties or the
odd win but we weren't playing as well as we did at the beginning
of that month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something you could kind of sense. Little things were
kind of creeping in, and when you have a game like we did against
Chicago, it kind of brings everything to the forefront where you
say, `Hey, it's time to shape up here and get back to doing the
things that we should be doing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, like everyone on the team, suffered from execution
problems Saturday. It was so bad, it was shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' he said. ``You're sitting on the bench
and thinking, `Man, this has got to end.' But we still had a period
and a half or a period. We gave up nine goals but they easily
could've scored a dozen. We just didn't want them to get to 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough. You just want to try to survive those games or
have them end real quick. It was a long night and having it at home
is the tough thing. Fans are expecting you to play hard and they're
paying good money for the tickets and that's really tough because
you really feel for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that you're not trying, you just can't get anything
done. We were just horrible. It's kind of embarrassing when it
happens to you at home.''

 WINE POTPOURRI: All That Sparkles Is Not Gold   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO  _ Champagne, the mere mention of the word makes most
people happy. Could it be the bubbles or is the excitement all
about the wine? Whatever the reason, when people want a festive
drink, they usually turn to Champagne.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, Champagne producers had it all, since there were
no serious challengers at the time to the best sparkling wine in
the world. Then, a few of the larger Champagne houses began to look
outside the Champagne region for new places to make sparkling
wines. In the early 1970s, Moet &AMP; Chandon founded Domaine Chandon
in the Napa Valley and the race was on.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, other houses came onboard. But it wasn't until about 10
years ago that the quality of California sparkling wines began to
give the Champagne producers cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne, and most sparkling wines made by the  &LR; m &LR; e &LR; thode &LR; 
 &LR; champenoise &LR; , are blends of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and for some
producers, a little Pinot Meunier. Pinot Noir provides body and
structure, while Pinot Meunier lends ripe fruitiness and Chardonnay
gives the wine delicacy, finesse and freshness.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Champagne is restricted to three grapes, while sparkling
wine producers elsewhere in France and in other countries use other
grapes, like Pinot Blanc, Chenin Blanc and Riesling. Many of the
world's sparkling wines are excellent in their own style, but none
should be confused with Champagne. While California's Roederer
Estate, Domaine Chandon-Australia and Italy's Ferrari produce
exciting elegant stylistic sparkling wines, they are not Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   All Champagne and the best sparkling wines, are fermented and
aged in the bottle. The process, which can involve up to 300
hands-on steps, produces steady streams of pinpoint silvery
bubbles, a complex bouquet of fruit and a toasty yeast, not unlike
the scent of warm bread dough. The wines are balanced, crisp and
very refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Champagne Bible &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Champagne story is a fascinating one and few people are more
qualified to tell the tale than Tom Stevenson, an award-winning
English wine writer, who has earned the title ``champagne guru''
within the wine community.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson's new book, ``Christie's World Encyclopedia of
Champagne &AMP; Sparkling Wine,'' is a comprehensive timely examination
of Champagne and other French sparkling wines, plus a look at
sparkling wines from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Working from an assessment of 100 points, Stevenson rates the
hundreds of Champagne houses and other sparkling wine producers (98
is the highest rating for the likes of Krug, Pol Rogercq, Dom
Perignon and Salon). Scores drop off dramatically for the sparkling
wines of other countries, although Stevenson ranks Roederer Estate
(90) and Iron Horse (88) as two of his California favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson's book on Champagne and sparkling wine has become the
new bible for sparkling wine fans and is highly recommended.

take a look at the latest wine entry in the Dummies series,

McCarthy. Billed as ``A reference for the rest of us,'' the Dummies
book is an easy-reading guide to all aspects of Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy touches all the bases, from an explanation of the
Champagne method, to buying, storing and serving Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to compare this guide to Stevenson's

</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about the use of the names ``Champagne''
and ``sparkling wine.'' Some will tell you that Champagne is a
generic name like aspirin, while others, like myself, claim that
Champagne is made only in that region of France and everything else
is a sparkling wine. Campaigners for use of the word Champagne for
any wine with bubbles say that sparkling wine sounds blah. Well,
sparkling wine is the best term we have and I say let's keep using
it until someone comes up with something better.

CRITICS FAULT CLINTON ON AFRICA POLICY FOLLOW-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ No United States leader has voiced a stronger
commitment to Africa than President Clinton, but nearly two years
after he made an unprecedented tour of the continent, critics say
substance has yet to follow the US rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   This harsh assessment comes from former President Jimmy Carter,
who charged this week that US policy was scuttling efforts to end
Sudan's brutal civil war, and from a range of academics in both
Africa and North America.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago that Clinton whistle-stopped across the
continent, apologizing for slavery and for turning his back on
Rwanda's 1994 genocide, and promising a new era of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a parade of cabinet secretaries and special envoys
has voyaged across Africa. Earlier this week, midway through a
10-state tour to ``elevate African issues on our list of national
priorities,'' Richard Holbrooke, US ambassador to the United
Nations, vowed in a speech in South Africa that Washington would
focus on African crises when it assumes the presidency of the
United Nations Security Council next month.
</P>
<P>
   But back home, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the
cornerstone of Clinton's African trade policy, languishes in
Congress. American aid to South Africa has dropped from $210
million in 1994 to $47 million today. Africa accounts for just 2
percent of total US trade, and in relation to its population, the
United States ranks as the lowest donor to Africa of the 24 most
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the critics say, the United States has yet to
formulate an effective response to ongoing wars in Congo _ Africa's
first major multinational conflict _ or in Angola, where the rebel
movement, which was propped up by Washington during the cold war,
has obstructed attempts at peaceful democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is not a serious power in this part of the world,''
said John Stremlau, a visiting professor of international relations
at the University of the Witswatersrand in Johannesburg. ``There's
ample evidence of talking the talk, but they're not walking the
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the US State Department did not respond Tuesday
to several requests for comment on the criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Some say US policies do more harm than good. When the leaders of
Sudan and Uganda meet Wednesday in Kenya to discuss how to end the
16-year civil war in Sudan, their work will be complicated by a
food aid bill signed by Clinton last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's is Africa's longest running conflict and has claimed
close to 2 million lives. To the peril of regional stability, the
Clinton administration has used northern Uganda as a military
training ground for southern Sudanese rebels fighting the Muslim
government of Khartoum, which Washington accuses of supporting
terrorism. The new food legislation funnels relief exclusively to
the south, a step that aid officials and analysts say will enable
the rebels to spend resources rearming rather than feeding
civilians caught in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Sudan want to resolve the conflict. The biggest
obstacle is US government policy,'' said former President Carter in
an interview last week in Mozambique. ``The US is committed to
overthrowing the government in Khartoum. Any sort of peace effort
is aborted, basically by policies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent bill that the president signed is a devastating
obstacle to any furtherance of peace,'' added Carter, who is to
mediate the Sudan talks. ``For the first time, we have authorized
food aid just for the revolutionaries in southern Sudan. . .
Instead of working for peace in Sudan, the US government has
basically promoted a continuation of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech this week in South Africa, Holbrooke cited various
measures and figures to demonstrate that Clinton is following
through on his commitment to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Holbrooke said, the administration has helped to
develop local peacekeeping capacity through the African Crisis
Response Initiative. The United States contributed $8 million to
the Organization of African Unity, the continent's broadest
multinational organization; delivered $6 million last week to West
African security forces to help defuse the civil crisis in Sierra
Leone; and this week will make $1 million available to the Joint
Military Commission created by the terms of the recent cease-fire
between warring parties in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke also cited the payment of $926 million in arrears to
the UN and an allocation in the new budget of more than $100
million in debt relief for the poorest African nations.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say those numbers pale in comparison to the
financial and military commitment the Unitrf States made earlier
this year in Kosovo _ $5 billion and 7,000 troops _ and fade to
insignificance in the context of Congo's war.
</P>
<P>
   From South Africa, Holbrooke moved on to explore solutions to
the conflicts in Congo and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   The parties to the Congo fighting signed a cease-fire last July
in Lusaka, Zambia. It hasn't held. In Angola, meanwhile, government
and rebel troops resumed full-scale civil war a year ago after the
gradual disintegration of a 1994 accord.
</P>
<P>
   The UN is preparing to deploy 500 military peacekeeping monitors
in Congo, Holbrooke said, but the international community won't
become involved until ``the parties to the Lusaka Agreement. .
.respect their commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   That position is a cover for no US commitment at all, said Makau
Mutua, a professor of international law at the State University of
New York at Buffalo. The United States, he argued, could put
pressure on Uganda and Rwanda, the two countries that sparked the
war in Congo, to withdraw their support for the rebel factions. But
those countries are Washington's key regional allies in its stance
against the Sudan government, and Clinton so far has done more to
support them than rein them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the US intervened in Kosovo it faced a much more
formidable army,'' Mutua said. ``All the West has to do is put
10,000 troops in Congo and lean on Rwanda and Uganda. The crisis
would end in a minute. The fact is, the US has no intention to
intervene in Congo.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke also said the administration will back sanctions
against the Angolan rebels, who finance their war largely with
smuggled diamonds from the country's lucrative mines. ``We will . .
. hold a special Security Council meeting on Angola in January, and
we will immediately begin to seek ways to tighten the sanctions
regime,'' Holbrooke said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That's a welcome start, Stremlau and Mutua said, but it is late
and insufficient. During the Cold War and apartheid, the United
States and South Africa were instrumental in creating Unita, the
Angolan rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   Both have since distanced themselves from Unita, but Washington
and Pretoria ``bear a legal and moral responsibility to force an
end to Unita's murderous campaign,'' Mutua said. Given the close
ties between the United States and South Africa today, ``there is
no reason why they are not doing that.''

 WORKING COOK: Simple Fare Puts Guests at Ease  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; When you're stocking up on beef jerky, propane and
Power bars in case the Y2K meltdown actually happens, grab a few
lamb chops and some fish while you're at it. Even if you don't feel
like planning a big blow-out dinner for New Year's Eve, you can
still entertain at home with one of these low-key but stylish
recipes.
<P>
   The fastest recipe of the week, Ginger-Steamed Fish, is based on
a quick and easy Chinese cooking technique _ steaming fish fillets
with aromatic ginger and green onion, and seasoning them with a
mixture of vinegar, soy sauce and sesame oil. These simple
components serve as both a quick marinade and a light sauce after
the fish is finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint-Crusted Lamb Chops With Cranberry Couscous are a bit
more involved but still quick, since thin lamb chops take almost no
time to broil.
</P>
<P>
   Coat the chops with honey mustard to heighten the sweet and
spicy flavors in their minty breadcrumb coating. The crust itself
is a heady mix of fresh mint, garlic, seasonings and Panko
breadcrumbs, a great Japanese product that many supermarkets carry.
When piled upright on a bed of cranberry-jeweled couscous, the
crispy lamb chops make an impressive presentation for a dinner
party.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to have lots of people over and you don't
want to do a lot of last-minute cooking, prepare the Winter
Vegetable Stew With Cornbread Cobbler. The sweetness of carrots,
red onions and sweet potatoes are balanced by a hearty spice
mixture, and cauliflower, which is fairly neutral, soaks it all up.
But the best part of all is the savory cornbread cobbler topping.
</P>
<P>
   The stew takes some time to prepare, but the steps are easy and
the dish is such a cozy choice for New Year's Eve at home _ and
vegetarians will feel like they're celebrating, too.

 &LR; GINGER-STEAMED FISH
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups medium-grain rice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   6 teaspoons rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds thin white fish fillets, such as cod or red snapper
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 large green onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Begin cooking the rice according to package directions.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together the vegetable oil, vinegar, sesame oil and soy
sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Tear off 4 pieces of foil, about 12 x 6 inches each. Place a
fish fillet on each piece of foil. Turn up the edges by a few
inches around the fish to create a rim around the fish, so that
each fillet is in a tray that won't allow liquids to get out but is
still open on top.
</P>
<P>
   Season each fillet with salt. Spoon equal parts of the soy sauce
mixture on each fillet. Sprinkle the ginger and green onions on
top.
</P>
<P>
   Set up a large steamer, either bamboo or metal-mesh type, and
place 2 packages inside. Cover and steam until flaky, about 6 to 8
minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. Repeat with the
remaining fillets.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the packages carefully, reserving cooking juices. Place
each fillet over a bed of rice and drizzle with the juices.

   Preheat the oven to broil.
</P>
<P>
   Place the honey-mustard in a small bowl. Season the lamb chops
with salt and pepper. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the mint leaves in a food processor. Process until minced,
then add the garlic cloves and process until pureed. Add the
breadcrumbs, salt, pepper and cayenne. Pulse until the breadcrumbs
are fine and all ingredients are incorporated. Place the mixture in
a shallow bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Begin bringing 21/4 cups broth or water to a boil in a medium
saucepan.
</P>

<P>
   Place the chops crumb-side up on a foil-lined pan and broil
until browned, about 4 minutes. Remove pan from broiler, flip the
chops over and brush honey-mustard over the top and sides of the
chops. Sprinkle liberally with the crumb mixture, pressing it on to
form a crust. Return to the broiler and cook until medium rare,
about 4 minutes, depending on thickness of chops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, add the salt, oil and cranberries to the boiling
water. Stir in the couscous, cover and cook for 1 minute. Remove
from heat and let rest 5 minutes, covered.

 &LR; WINTER VEGETABLE STEW WITH CORNBREAD COBBLER
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 red onions, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 celery stalks, cut in large dice
</P>
<P>
   6 carrots, peeled and cut in large dice
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons spicy chile powder
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 (10-ounce) package large red or white pearl onions, cut in
half through root end
</P>
<P>
   10 cups vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   5 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into large dice
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1 head cauliflower, cut into flowerets
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   Cornbread Cobbler Topping (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large heavy stockpot over medium-low
heat. Add the onions, celery, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, chile
powder, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Saute,
stirring often, until the mixture is juicy, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the vegetables are cooking, bring a small saucepan of
water to a boil and prepare a bowl of ice water.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pearl onions in the boiling water and blanch until
skins are loosened, about 1 minute. Drain. Transfer the onions to
the ice water. When cool, remove the skins and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add the stock to the sauteed vegetables, stirring to scrape up
all the savory bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the sweet
potatoes and tomato paste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer
for 10 minutes. Add the cauliflower and pearl onions. Cover and
simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower is
tender.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the liquid from the vegetables into a large pot.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together the water and the cornstarch until dissolved.
Bring the stew liquid back to a boil and keep it at a simmer as you
slowly add the cornstarch mixture, stirring constantly, until the
liquid thickens.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the vegetables between 2 large casserole dishes and add
the thickened vegetable liquid to cover. (Set aside any excess
liquid for another use.) Top with large dollops of the cornbread
topping.
</P>
<P>
   Bake about 30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
</P>

 COOK'S BOOKS: Saveur Goes Overboard With French Cookbook  &HT;       
 By David A. Steinberg 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; French cuisine has always had its unrepentant
boosters, and none more so than the editors at Saveur magazine. The
handsome food periodical covers the whole spectrum of the world's
cuisines.
<P>
   Even so, the editors are, in their own words, not just
Francophiles, but outright French snobs. They set out to prove just
how snobbish with their newest compendium of recipes, and they
succeed _ big time.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, the recipes are exacting but often lacking in
technical detail. This is definitely not a book for a novice, and
in some cases not even for an intermediate cook. But if you have
the time and patience _ and pick and choose among the recipes _ the
results can be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The  &LR; Civet de Lapin  &LR; (Rich Rabbit Stew, to us Anglophones) is
wonderfully rich and satisfying, even if it did take almost six
hours to get to the table. The timing of the cooking was wildly
miscalculated: Reducing the sauce, for example, took four times
longer than specified. The recipe has several steps requiring
several pots and an infinite amount of patience, so be warned.
</P>
<P>
   The  &LR; Poussin Vall &LR; e &LR; e d'Auge  &LR; (Baby Chicken With Calvados and
Cream) was far more successful. While it, too, was undertimed in
the recipe, when cooked until done the results were spectacular and
as a whole much simpler and straightforward, with amazing flavor _
rich, tender meat in a cream sauce punctuated by Calvados. Use the
real stuff, though; substituting an inferior brandy will impact the
taste.
</P>
<P>
   In a myriad of ways, this is more than a cookbook. It reads like
a J. Peterman catalog of French cooking. Halfway through, I was
ready to scream if I encountered one more description of the
authors meandering through the wilds of Provence only to discover
the best duck demi glace ever created, or some such thing.
</P>
<P>
   With the majority of recipes, the editors inform you that the
dish cannot even hope to reach the pinnacle of culinary ecstasy
that it represents without a specific fish or wine or cheese that
can only be found in one certain section of France. They do offer
substitutes, but the subtext seems clear: Why bother _ it won't be
nearly as good. Argh!
</P>
<P>
   What, exactly, is the point of a cookbook that teases you with
recipes you can't possibly reproduce? Like the magazine, this is a
beautifully produced book with high-quality printing and an elegant
format, but the editors seem to be thinly disguised tourism agents
more than cooks.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't mind the frustration of not being able to live for
months at a time in some small farmhouse in the French countryside
or cursing the high tariff on imported French foodstuffs, then by
all means, this is a good book to buy. I'll stick with ``Julia &AMP;
Jacques.''

BABY CHICKEN WITH CALVADOS &AMP; CREAM
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 poussins or Cornish hens
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 cups pearl onions
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Calvados
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the poussins with butter and season inside and out,
generously, with salt and pepper. Truss poussins by folding back
the wing tips beneath the shoulders and tying the legs together
with kitchen string.
</P>
<P>
   Place the birds in a roasting pan so they do not touch. Scatter
the unpeeled pearl onions around the birds, then place the pan in
lower third of oven and cook for at least 45 minutes, until juices
run clear.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the poussins and onions to a serving platter and tent
with foil to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Place the roasting pan on top of the stove and bring the pan
drippings to a boil over medium-high heat, scraping with a wooden
spoon to loosen any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Warm the Calvados in a small pot, then add to the pan juices,
and carefully ignite with a kitchen match. Keep a lid nearby to
extinguish flames if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When the flames die out, stir in the cream and continue to
reduce the sauce until thickened, about 5 minutes. Adjust
seasonings as needed. Untie the string and discard. Pour sauce over
and around the poussins.

SUPPORTERS' CONCERN MOUNTS AS BUSH TV EFFORT   FALTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two weeks ago, Texas Governor George W. Bush's
closest advisers met to discuss how to prepare the Republican
presidential front-runner for his first debate of Campaign 2000 _
and only the third of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers rejected the idea of hiring a speech coach, and
didn't see the need to hold a ``mock'' debate, as candidates often
do for practice. Instead, convinced that Bush is one of the most
natural politicians ever to run for the presidency, they prepped
the candidate briefly on possible questions and sent him on stage
with the usual bromide to ``just be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the two debates that have been held in the last week,
some of those who know Bush best have been surprised at
his &UR;  &LR; sometimes-stilted performance, especially his tendency to
respond to a specific question with a generic, scripted answer.
Combined with Senator John McCain's rise in the polls in New
Hampshire, Bush's television performance has led to concerns among
some Bush supporters about his skills as a candidate and possible
shortcomings of his television persona.
</P>
<P>
   One top Republican official, for example, said Bush supporters
have told him that they are concerned that Bush's charm might come
across on television as arrogance and that he risks seeming smug
about the need for mastery on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush backers say the debate format so far has been unfair
to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think these two debates have highlighted what I
consider to be his considerable skills,'' said Bush friend Mary
Matalin, a top official in the 1992 presidential campaign of former
President Bush. ``He is held to a different standard and he gets
asked cheap-shot questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush biographer Bill Minutaglio said the governor's performance
has been surprising to many Bush supporters in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. has profited from his reputation as blunt,
forthright honest-spoken, unafraid Texan, a truly spontaneous
guy,'' said Minutaglio, author of ``First Son.'' ``Maybe now they
are seeing on the air a guy who is not able to duke it out as they
thought, maybe not as nimble on his feet as they hoped. He seemed
to be delivering chunks of previously scripted material.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides insist they are delighted with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been very straightforward, and he appears on television
as he is, real and direct,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
Noting that Bush debated once in his 1994 campaign and again in
1998, Hughes added: ``He has now done twice as many debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about the importance of one-on-one ``retail
politics'' in the early states, the vast majority of voters get
their impression of the candidates from television, making the
medium by far the most important vehicle of the campaign. While the
debates have had a small national audience, they are being closed
watched in the key primary states from which they have been
broadcast. The day after the New Hampshire debate, McCain appeared
with several former Bush supporters who said they had become
convinced that the Texan was unqualified to be presidency.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bush has many of the talents necessary to
project himself well on television. He is an extrovert who can be
charming, sometimes to a fault. In Texas, which has 18 times the
population of New Hampshire, most voters know Bush from television
and have elected him twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can campaign all day and night in Texas, and the majority
of people see him on television,'' Bush media adviser Stuart
Stevens said. ``Governor Bush is leading in almost every state of
the country. People are seeing him on television and they are
liking what they see. The formats of the debates are very limited.
There was a 32-minute period in the first debate where he didn't
get a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the two GOP debates so far, Bush's smiles and laughter
have been described by some commentators as smirks, and a number of
his answers have clearly come straight from speech scripts _ even
when the questions seemed to call for a factually tailored reply.
It is a pattern which has elicited some concern, even among
Republican allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear some saying that his friendly outgoing personality on
TV is mistaken for a smirk and smugness,'' one senior Republican
official said. ``A few have said to me, `He has to make sure that
charm is not mistaken for arrogance.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's problem may be that his engaging personality and his
effortless in-person banter doesn't project in the cool medium of
television, according to Linda Fowler, professor of government and
director of the Nelson Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   ``His folksy speech and slang, the way he drops consonants on
words _ they are part of Bush's warmth,'' she said. ``But without
the personal magnetism that people who've met him say is palpable,
the speech just sounds sloppy, and it seems unpresidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont
Graduate University in California, said, ``Bush isn't as guarded as
you need to be on television. ``His reactions to the other
candidates at times looked a little goofy and at times a little
smirky. He should never assume that the eye of the camera isn't
staring at him.''
</P>
<P>
   These problems were especially evident at two points in Monday's
debate. When Bush was asked to describe what he had learned from
reading a biography of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, the
governor gave a general answer about the need for America to be a
world leader without saying anything about Acheson. And when Bush
was asked what he would do if home heating oil prices rose in New
England, he gave a Texas-centered answer about encouraging more oil
exploration and spoke about the benefits of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   That created an opening for McCain to seize upon both questions
in a markedly different manner, telling how Acheson spoke with
President Harry Truman during the Korean conflict and warning that
Russia's war on Chechnya may lead to a spike in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intellectual combat'' between Bush and McCain,
said Marvin Kalb, executive director of Harvard University's
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy. Bush,
Kalb said, ``is a fine television performer, but the performance
lacks the gravitas that a lot of people have come to associate with
the presidency.'' As for McCain, the Arizona senator ``has
experience etched into his face,'' Kalb said, referring in part to
the senator's 5 1/2 years as a Vietnam prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   But even two of Bush's harshest critics _ both senior Democratic
party officials who watched the debates with keen interest _ said
that criticism of Bush's performance should be tempered. The two
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Bush
looks good in his television ads, which will be far more widely
viewed than the debates. They also said Bush performed well in a
recent lengthy interview on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Democratic officials said, Bush's performance
easily could be interpreted as one marked by discipline and the
intentional repetition of key themes, the sort of fealty to
campaign message which many political operatives deem essential to
winning an election. In the end, Bush's effort may be successful
even if viewers remember only one thing, that he casts himself as a
centrist ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget who Bush will be running against if he gets
the nomination,'' Fowler said. ``(Vice President Al) Gore and
(former Senator Bill) Bradley are not exactly Mr. Television
Personality. If Bush had to run against Bill Clinton, now that
would be really tough.''

<P>
   In preparation for holiday parties, Details magazine tackles the
toughest issue of the season: When a couple attend a party
together, are they expected to stay with each other all night, or
is it permissible for each to talk alone with other people?
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of a party is to mingle and talk to people other
than your girlfriend,'' says  &UR; Hilda Klinkenberg  &LR; of Etiquette
International.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the partner who knows more people should introduce
the other to the known people. If a name has been forgotten, admit
it and attempt an introduction anyway. ``Everyone forgets names,''
said Klinkenberg. ``It's a temporary embarrassment that's forgotten
in two seconds. However, people remember for a long time not being
introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time you pass your significant other, take two seconds to
acknowledge him or her. Nod at each other if you catch each other's
eyes across the room.
</P>
<P>
   Be close when you're eating. And if one person wants to leave
and the other decides to stay, the stayer should give the leaver
``not a peck, a smooch,'' say the experts.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Self magazine warns of the etiquette gaffe of saying ``Hi''
when one is introduced to someone else. The proper greeting is
``Hello'' or ``How do you do?''

   Can't get enough of hating  &UR; Richard Nixon &LR; ? Recently released
tapes reveal new levels of bigotry _ against Jews, blacks, Mexicans
and gays, for example _ including a special slam at everyone's
favorite city. In a recent Chicago Tribune column,
 &UR; James Warren  &LR; quoted a 1971 presidential conversation with  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Ehrlichman &LR; , in which both were lamenting the rise of liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco has just gone clear over,'' says Ehrlichman.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not just the ratty part of town,'' says the leader of
the free world. ``The upper class in San Francisco is that way. The
Bohemian Grove, which I attend from time to time. It is the most
faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine, with that San
Francisco crowd. I can't shake hands with anybody from San
Francisco.''

ideological astringency,'' writes  &UR; Owen Gleiberman  &LR; in the latest
issue of Entertainment Weekly, ``which is starting to look TRES
early '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Peter Sussman &LR;  was astounded to hear in Oklahoma Gov.  &UR; Frank &LR;

today; people don't treat you like you're human. And what makes

   NEW YORK _ New York's elegant big spenders and institutions have
always prided themselves on being able to socially embrace the new
and potentially scandalous, whether it was ``radical chic,'' the
latest art craze or the twist. But on Monday night at the Costume
Institute's annual gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they may
have surprised even themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, billed as a salute to rock style, brought out a
spectacular array of musical and show business luminaries, to say
nothing of rhinestones and cleavage. Puffy Combs and Jennifer Lopez
were there. So were Jerry Seinfeld, Christina Ricci, Maxwell,
Steven Tyler, Tom Ford, Elizabeth Hurley, Calvin Klein and Gwyneth
Paltrow, who came with her father, the producer Bruce Paltrow. The
rapper Lil' Kim wore a studded pink bikini so unabashedly skimpy
that it would have caused the windows in the room to fog up, if
there had been any.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Houston, among the last of the 850 guests to arrive for
cocktails, around 9 p.m., came with her husband, Bobby Brown, and
the Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, who had
made Ms. Houston's floor-length rhinestone coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just here to have fun and see our friends,'' said Ms.
Whitney, naming as friends Missy Elliott and Mary J. Blige, who
wore pants and a tunic of electric-blue mink.
</P>
<P>
   The Costume Institute gala, which the Met likes to call the
party of the year, has always had a reputation for being glamorous
enough to attract a melange of designers, social figures and
artists, yet dull enough to ensure that everybody gets home by a
reasonable hour. But because of the rock 'n' roll theme, fin de
siecle optimism or the efforts of the evening's chairmen _ Tommy
Hilfiger, Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer and Anna Wintour, editor in
chief of Vogue _ this year's gala attracted guests of a mix rarely
seen at a party in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There were tables full of young social figures, like Eliza Reed,
who looked as though she had stepped out of a Sargent portrait, and
Alexander and Alexandra Von Furstenberg, who wore a sheath of brown
leather. There was the Old Guard, including Nan Kempner; Annette de
la Renta, who wore a black knit top with a yellow silk ball skirt;
and Leonard Lauder, the chairman of the Estee Lauder Companies.
They all have deep ties to the city's cultural life. Lauder seemed
pleased when reminded that it was his mother, Estee, now in her
90s, who held the first dinner party at the Met, back in 1968, for
Florence Gould, the daughter-in-law of the railroad tycoon Jay
Gould.
</P>
<P>
   Rap stars and their contingents added more than outrageous
glamour to the occasion. They brought a racial diversity that has
been missing not just from fashionable events like this, but also
from fashion itself. The funny thing was, there seemed to be
nothing phony about the scene. It was not much more complicated
than Combs' going over to Oscar De la Renta, whom he got to know
during a Vogue photo shoot, and calling him `` D.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever think you'd see a scene like this?'' said Andre
Heon Talley, Vogue's editor at large, who was dressed in a long
Gucci leather coat embroidered with gold. ``Annette de la Renta in
her billowy couture silks and Lil' Kim in her Versace bikini. They
are the sum of the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if anyone brought the whole thing together, in ways that
were both exhilarating and worthy of Tom Wolfe, it was Combs. After
dinner was served, he got up on the stage and, with a children's
choir from St. John the Divine, sang the rap version of ``Every
Breath You Take.'' Soon all these couture-clad people were standing
and waving their arms like Combs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Oscar and Carolina Herrera,'' said Talley, nodding
toward their table. They were up and out of their chairs and
swaying. Mrs. de la Renta was trying to get John Richardson, the
Picasso biographer, to wave his arms. At one point, Combs paid a
tribute to, among others, Notorious B.I.G, the rapper who was shot
to death in 1997 in Los Angeles. He had the crowd on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wild,'' said Hamilton South, president of Polo
Ralph Lauren. ``I mean, we're at the Met.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kempner had the same thought. ``I think it's sensational,''
she said. ``Mr. and Mrs. Metropolitan Museum would be rolling in
their graves, but it's worth it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask the people involved with the Death Row drama ``The Green
Mile'' to tell you what the movie is about and you'll more than
likely receive a puzzled expression, followed by several moments of
hemming and hawing and then a pretty ambiguous answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this film about?'' asks its star, Tom Hanks, as if
he's just now sorting it out himself. ``Look, I'll be damned if I
know. I'm not sure. I think that in a lot of ways, it's like a lot
of the great myths that communicate the complexities of being a
human, the way really good folk tales were before they got turned
into Disney cartoons. It's a great paradox to be a human in this
world. There. That is what the movie is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the movie's high-powered ensemble each have their own
fuzzy takes on the subject:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jeter: ``It's about human relationships and last
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clarke Duncan: ``It's about an inner light that shines
in everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   David Morse: ``It's ... um ... got a universality. I don't know
... it just touches you.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Frank Darabont puts it this way: ``It's a Christmas
Death Row movie set in the 1930s South. We've got Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers, happy dancing mice and a man's head bursting into
flames. What's there to understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all you need to know is this: Darabont is doing the
Stephen King prison thing again. And that's good news for all those
people who voted ``The Shawshank Redemption'' as one of the
greatest films ever made (higher than ``Citizen Kane'' and
``Lawrence of Arabia'') in a recent Internet Movie Database poll.
(``That's the best pat on the back a director could receive,''
Darabont says.)
</P>
<P>
   Compared to ``Shawshank,'' Darabont had considerably more source
material this time from which to work. King released ``The Green
Mile'' in 1996 as a six-part serial, a Dickens-inspired gambit that
had its share of difficulties but also one great advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a story which is published in installments, simply put, you
cannot flip ahead and see how matters turn out,'' King says. ``That
is an appeal that I suspect only the writer of suspense tales and
spooky stories can fully appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   After adapting ``Shawshank,'' King's 100-page feel-good prison
novella, five years ago, Darabont waited (and waited) for another
project to direct. He did some script doctoring (most famously for
``Saving Private Ryan'') and was offered a number of ``Die Hard
rip-offs.'' (``Why they would think I was their man, I have no
idea,'' Darabont says.) But nothing struck a chord until he
received a phone call from King.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just kind of catching up with each other when he said
he had this idea he had been kicking around,'' Darabont says. ``And
he gave me a 30-second pitch, laying out the basic framework of
`The Green Mile.' I was really captivated by what he was saying and
told him to give me first crack at the screen rights if he ever
wrote it.''
</P>
<P>
   King did, and Darabont found himself back in familiar territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeating myself with another prison movie did give pause for
thought, but just briefly,'' Darabont says. ``It was just too good.
I couldn't say no.''
</P>
<P>
   After Darabont wrote the screenplay, many actors found
themselves thinking the same thing. Hanks was the first to come on
board, playing a compassionate Death Row prison guard who befriends
an inmate who possesses a mysterious and miraculous gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of looked at the screenplay with a jaundiced eye
because nobody could describe the thing to me,'' Hanks says. ``Then
I read it and, much to my surprise, found myself agreeing to do it.
It's just a great story. If my job is to go and make things that
are unique, then this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a string of eight consecutive critical and commercial hits,
Hanks' name has become the closest thing Hollywood has to an
official seal of approval. And the rest of the cast fell easily
into place. Morse, Barry Pepper and Doug Hutchison (playing the
heavy) fill out the Mile's guard unit; James Cromwell portrays the
sympathetic warden and Bonnie Hunt is cast as Hanks' wife. Graham
Greene, Sam Rockwell and Michael Jeter play the inmates and
newcomer Michael Clarke Duncan portrays John Coffey, the huge man
(and convicted murderer) with the strange powers.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, the African-American Coffey stands 7-feet tall and
fills a doorway without much room to spare. The list of actors
matching that description is a short one. Enter the 6-foot-5
Duncan. While making ``Armageddon'' together, Bruce Willis advised
the one-time bodyguard to read King's novel. Willis then called
Darabont and told him, ``I think I've got your John Coffey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole movie hinged on this role,'' Darabont says. ``So I
spent months looking for the right person. And there's something
about Michael ... he walks into a room and everyone is ready to
vote him into office. You can see his soul shining through his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Hanks: ``Michael has a personality that matches his size.
He's on the other side of the charisma spoke. For someone who was
making, really, just his second movie, he turned me into a big
fan.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of generosity is typical of Hanks, whom Morse
describes as an atypical star, someone ``who believes good things
happen between two people and not just by yourself. He's not a guy
who believes the movie is just about him.'' Hanks also catered
meals for the cast and crew on Fridays (In-N-Out burgers and sushi
were favorites) and even staged a fireworks show one night in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spielberg told me that Tom would spoil me for other actors,
and he was right,'' Darabont says.
</P>
<P>
   The generosity became important because Darabont went several
weeks over schedule in the six-month shoot, making everyone more
than a little exhausted in the process. As Hanks delicately puts
it: ``It felt like it took two years to make. Frank has very
specific ideas, and we shot a lot of film until he got exactly what
he saw in his head. The man has no life, you have to understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a perfectionist,'' Darabont says. ``I'll be the first to
admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a self-described ``long-winded bastard.''
``Shawshank'' clocked in at two hours and 22 minutes; ``The Green
Mile'' comes in right at the three-hour mark. Darabont has been
downright prickly on the subject of length, going so far in one
interview as to say long movies should be abolished in order to
save wear and tear on film critic Leonard Maltin's posterior. But
he admits three-hour films can be daunting for audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hear a movie is three hours long, I think, `Oh, golly. Do
I really want to go see this?''' Darabont says. ``And the answer is
_ and I'm not comparing movies here by any means _ if the movie is
`Schindler's List' or `Titanic,' yes, I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   Darabont acknowledges that executives at Castle Rock and Warner
Bros. weren't happy about the film's length, going so far as to
accuse him of ``losing his mind.'' But an enthusiastic test
screening in Scottsdale, AZ, apparently eased their fears, and the
arguments evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody sets out to make a three-hour movie, but a film has its
own organic length, whether it's three hours or 90 minutes,''
Darabont says. ``I've seen a lot of one-hour-50-minute films that
felt like eight hours.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Green Mile'' has been generating perhaps the best
buzz of any holiday prestige release, the hard-to-sell similarities
to ``Shawshank'' remain a bit sobering. Both films are difficult to
describe, set in a depressing environment and run long at a time of
year when people put a premium on their time.
</P>
<P>
   So why should ``The Green Mile'' fare any better than
``Shawshank,'' which was generally ignored by audiences during its
theatrical life?
</P>
<P>
   ``This one has Tom Hanks,'' Morse says. &QL;

THE COUPLE THAT PLAYS TOGETHER

<P>
   In preparation for holiday parties, Details magazine tackles the
toughest issue of the season: When a couple attend a party
together, are they expected to stay with each other all night, or
is it permissible for each to talk alone with other people?
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of a party is to mingle and talk to people other
than your girlfriend,'' says  &UR; Hilda Klinkenberg  &LR; of Etiquette
International.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the partner who knows more people should introduce
the other to the known people. If a name has been forgotten, admit
it and attempt an introduction anyway. ``Everyone forgets names,''
said Klinkenberg. ``It's a temporary embarrassment that's forgotten
in two seconds. However, people remember for a long time not being
introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time you pass your significant other, take two seconds to
acknowledge him or her. Nod at each other if you catch each other's
eyes across the room.
</P>
<P>
   Be close when you're eating. And if one person wants to leave
and the other decides to stay, the stayer should give the leaver
``not a peck, a smooch,'' say the experts.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Self magazine warns of the etiquette gaffe of saying ``Hi''
when one is introduced to someone else. The proper greeting is
``Hello'' or ``How do you do?''

   Can't get enough of hating  &UR; Richard Nixon &LR; ? Recently released
tapes reveal new levels of bigotry _ against Jews, blacks, Mexicans
and gays, for example _ including a special slam at everyone's
favorite city. In a recent Chicago Tribune column,
 &UR; James Warren  &LR; quoted a 1971 presidential conversation with  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Ehrlichman &LR; , in which both were lamenting the rise of liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco has just gone clear over,'' says Ehrlichman.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not just the ratty part of town,'' says the leader of
the free world. ``The upper class in San Francisco is that way. The
Bohemian Grove, which I attend from time to time. It is the most
faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine, with that San
Francisco crowd. I can't shake hands with anybody from San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Sally Jessy Raphael &LR;  will be out with her own makeup line
soon, reports Allure magazine, which also notes _ in possibly
related news _ that on average women cry between four and eight
times a month.
</P>
<P>
   _ In its year-end roundup, California Lawyer notes that
 &UR; Bernard Lewinsky &LR; ,  &UR; Monica &LR; 's father, received a solicitation
letter from  &UR; President Clinton &LR; 's legal expense trust. He returned
it with a note: ``You must be morons to send me this letter.''

ideological astringency,'' writes  &UR; Owen Gleiberman  &LR; in the latest
issue of Entertainment Weekly, ``which is starting to look TRES
early '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Peter Sussman &LR;  was astounded to hear in Oklahoma Gov.  &UR; Frank &LR;

</P>

answer. ... It's not easy to be a celebrity in the United States
today; people don't treat you like you're human. And what makes
news in the tabloids and some of the celebrity press is when the
journalist is able to reveal something humiliating about the
celebrity. So they often come to interviews with their defenses
up.''

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The Chronicle offers readers the recipe

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Short Ribs Enhance Any Occasion   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  I first encountered the braised short ribs with
truffles and Madeira sauce at Campton Place, the restaurant that
launched the careers of Bradley Ogden, Jan Birnbaum, and now Todd
Humphries.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Humphries left in 1999 to become executive chef of the
floundering Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant in St. Helena. He
also took his signature recipe with him. No matter where it goes,
it's a must-order item.
</P>
<P>
   The Madeira gives the fork-tender ribs a hint of sweetness
balanced by the earthiness of truffles. Since truffles are
expensive and not readily available to the home cook, you can leave
them out or substitute three or four finely diced shiitake
mushrooms, or a spoonful of white truffle oil at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The rich, aromatic dish is served with creamy mashed potatoes
whipped with lots of butter and cream. If you're like me, you won't
be able to stop eating them. The entire dish is a blend of luxury
and comfort food, making it a perfect dish for stay-at-home New
Year's entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   These delicious short ribs fit nicely into the menu at this
impressive casual restaurant that's run by the Culinary Institute
of America. With an open kitchen in the middle and an expansive
loftlike feel, the restaurant in the historic stone building is a
popular stop for people visiting Napa Valley. Since it's located on
a hill, the terrace in front offers a sweeping view of the valley.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant, 2555 Main St. (Highway &LR; 
 &LR; 29), St. Helena; (707) 967-1010. Open for lunch and dinner &LR; 
 &LR; daily. &LR;

BRAISED SHORT RIBS WITH PUREED POTATOES &AMP; MADEIRA TRUFFLE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   12 beef short ribs, bone-in
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 celery stalk, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle (750 ml) ruby port
</P>
<P>
   11/2 quarts veal stock
</P>
<P>
   Potato Puree (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Madeira Truffle Sauce (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Fresh chervil sprigs for garnishing
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season
the short ribs with salt and pepper and add to the pan. Brown on
all sides, turning as needed. This should take about 10 minutes. As
the ribs brown, remove them from the pan and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add the onion, celery and carrot to the pan and saute over
medium-high heat until lightly brown, about 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Drain excess fat from the pan. Add the port and boil until
reduced by about three-quarters, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Return the ribs to the pan and add veal stock to cover. If the
stock doesn't completely cover the ribs, add a little water.
</P>
<P>
   Bring to a boil. Cover and bake until the ribs are tender, about
2 to 21/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven, uncover, and let cool to room temperature.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Discard any fat that has solidified on top of the ribs. Bring
the ribs to a boil over high heat. Cover and place in the oven for
10 minutes to warm through. Transfer the ribs to a platter, tent
with foil, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Place the Dutch oven over high heat. Bring to a boil and reduce
the juices to a glaze consistency; this should take about 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place a mound of Potato Puree in the center of each dinner
plate. Make a well in the center of the potatoes. Place 2 short
ribs in the well. Spoon Madeira Truffle Sauce over the ribs and
garnish with chervil.

 AT THE SOURCE: Prized Meyer Lemons Make the Party   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 REEDLEY, Calif. _  The spotty phone connection sounded more like it
was from Greenland rather than Reedley, the Fresno County
agricultural town. But it may not be the phone company's fault.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am out here, making pomegranate jelly,'' said Art Lang from
his barn.
</P>
<P>
   We were calling about Lang's rare commercial crop, Meyer lemons,
but this particular day, the retired professor/farmer was making
jelly, which is yet another product that attracts a loyal following
to his booth at the San Francisco Ferry Plaza market, his main
winter destination.
</P>
<P>
   But Lang is always glad to talk about Meyers, the fragrant,
thin-skinned citrus fruit that's become something of a California
icon. Top chefs swear by the sweet-tart juice and hauntingly
fragrant skin of the lemon that's similar to the sweet varieties of
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   For entertaining at home, few ingredients beat the fresh
pick-me-up Meyers can bring to a host of recipes _ from a luscious
sorbet to a spunky glaze for salmon to a tart-sweet flourish for an
endive salad.
</P>
<P>
   California claims the Meyer as its own, even though it came from
China. Its parentage has never been reliably established, so it was
named for Frank N. Meyer, an American agricultural researcher who
brought it to California in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   At first the easy-to-grow Meyer thrived, but in midcentury,
believed to be the main carrier of a dread citrus disease, it
became the victim of the agricultural equivalent of a witch hunt.
Only after development of a disease-proof strain did the Meyer
regain ground. Still, because of its relative fragility _ less than
half the shelf life of the sturdy Eureka lemon _ it is more of a
backyard than a large-scale commercial crop.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, who cultivates 200 kinds of trees and vines on his 17-acre
spread and markets their yield under the Honey Crisp and HRI
labels, has just 40 Meyer trees but they yield enough _ about 160
pounds _ to keep his clients supplied during the waning months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Pacific Northwest dairy farmer, Lang earned his
Ph.D. in plant physiology from the University of California at Los
Angeles and has taught in the UC system as well as in Arizona and
Hawaii. He has farmed in the Central Valley for 18 years,
developing a way of drying fruit without sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   His is not an organic farm, but is about as close to organic
farming as you can get without making a total commitment, and his
citrus fruit is never sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   Lang retired from teaching 10 years ago, so life is not quite as
hectic as it once was. ``I work no more than 60 hours a week,''
says the 77-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Honey Crisp/HRI farms in Reedley (Fresno County) can be &LR; 
 &LR; reached by phoning (559) 638-3084. &LR;

 BEST WAY: Martini Time   By Sean Forsha 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Aman traveling to Martinez, Calif. in the 1860s
asked San Francisco bartender Jerry Thomas to mix him a
``pick-me-up'' _ and the martini was born.
<P>
   Since then, the drink has come to symbolize urban elegance. And
as quitting time on another year quickly approaches, the martini is
the cocktail that will escort many revelers blissfully into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   To determine the best way to make the classic martini, the
Chronicle's Food department evaluated brands of gin, ingredient
proportions and mixing methods.
</P>
<P>
   We put 10 gins to the test _ five in the medium price range and
five more expensive ones.
</P>
<P>
   Our mid-range winner was 80-proof Gilbey's London Dry ($8.99 per
750 ml), favored for what one staffer described as a ``distinct
juniper aroma.'' The upper echelon champion was the venerable
94-proof Bombay Sapphire ($16.99 per 750 ml), with the ``cleanest
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Next we used the Bombay Sapphire to mix with Martini and Rossi
dry vermouth in five combinations, ranging from six parts gin and
one part vermouth up to 15 parts gin and one part vermouth. We also
used straight gin as the control.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of 12 parts gin to one part vermouth _ 3 ounces of gin
to 1/4 ounce of dry vermouth _ was the clear winner, providing a
pleasant balance of flavors. The six-to-one ratio had what one
staffer described as a ``biting'' flavor, while the 15-to-1
combination did not provide the traditional martini taste.
</P>
<P>
   We next tested whether the blending method affects the drink.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking is said to ``bruise'' the gin which, for better or
worse, can bring different flavors and aromas into the cocktail.
The agitation of shaking dilutes the drink but at the same time
creates ice crystals which keeps the drink colder overall.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring the martini, which keeps the alcohol intact by
discouraging dilution, supposedly doesn't blend the flavors as well
as shaking.
</P>
<P>
   The test revealed very subtle differences between the two
methods. The chill of the shaken version made the cocktail more
drinkable. But in general, the flavors of both versions were much
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Our final test was to determine how the more moderately priced
Gilbey's gin, shaken in the preferred 12-to-1 ratio, would measure
up to the Bombay Sapphire. The more expensive gin won _ tasters
preferred the Bombay Sapphire martini, saying it was smoother and
more drinkable. But the Gilbey's produced a martini strong on
classic gin flavors and aromas. Ultimately, they were two different
cocktails, good for different drinkers. Such is the nature of the
martini _ it's a matter of personal preference.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   We found the best martini was made with 12 parts gin to one part
vermouth (3 ounces to 1/4 ounce), shaken or stirred _ depending on
whether you like the drink colder and slightly less alcoholic.
Using the higher priced Bombay Sapphire makes a smoother drink, but
the Gilbey's produces a classic cocktail.

 CHRON  
 TASTER'S CHOICE: Top Products Can Help Harried Host   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Looking for shortcuts for holiday entertaining?
Several products sampled by The Chronicle's Taster's Choice panel
over the last 18 months will save time and still please your
guests. The following scored best in their categories.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a small dinner party, try serving the  &UR; crab cakes &LR;  from
Mollie Stone's ($3.69 each at Mollie Stone's) as a starter.
Accompany with lemon wedges and a dollop of storebought aioli.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Riviera dei Fiori green olive tapenade &LR;  (61/2 ounces, $3.39 at
Draeger's) works well for a cocktail buffet or as a passed
appetizer. Put the pungent olive mixture in a pretty bowl
surrounded by toasted baguette slices. Or, spread the mixture on
crostini and top it with mild crumbled feta cheese, then arrange
the crostini on a platter.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Asian peanut sauce from House of Tsang &LR;  (111/2 ounces,
$3.79-$3.99 at many supermarkets) can also be a time-saver. Put a
bowl of the lemongrass-scented sauce on a buffet table surrounded
by cubes of grilled chicken breast for dipping. Or, use the sauce
to dress a Chinese chicken salad of iceberg lettuce, grilled
chicken strips and crisp-fried chow mein noodles. The sauce also
works well on a hot or cold salad of Asian noodles, chicken,
blanched snow peas and cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Dessert can be the most time-consuming of all, but you can
simplify by serving ice cream sundaes.  &UR; Haagen Dazs vanilla ice &LR; 
 &UR; cream &LR;  (1 quart, $5.19-$5.69 at many supermarkets) topped our
vanilla ice cream tasting. Drizzle it with  &UR; Susan Elaine's &LR; 
 &UR; Incredibly Rich Fudge Sauce &LR;  (93/4 ounces, $5.49 at Andronico's),
which scored first in the fudge sauce sampling. Baked cookies made
from  &UR; Tom's refrigerated prepared cookie dough &LR;  (1 pound,
$4.99-$5.25 at some supermarkets), which comes preformed into
rounds, pairs well with the ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   And since no holiday party can be complete without a cheery
glass of eggnog, try serving the panel's favorite brand:  &UR; Berkeley &LR; 
 &UR; Farms &LR;  (1 quart, $1.99-$2.99 at many supermarkets).

 Shake, Rattle and Stir Those Holiday Party Drinks  &HT;       
 By Tilde Herrera 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Cocktails will be flowing just as swiftly as
Champagne this holiday season, so it helps to have a few
ready-to-go recipes on hand to make the mixing easier.
<P>
   We have compiled a selection of special mixed drinks, including
a nonalcoholic specialty, that will add zest to any holiday
celebration. Some drinks are twists on standards, while others
create a new taste using old reliables.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a few tips to make your bartending successful.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Get creative, but not too creative.  &LR; A little of this and a
little of that sometimes produces a fine drink but more often than
not forces you to dump the mixture straight down the kitchen sink.
Often, a simple variation on a classic, time-honored cocktail is
all you need to create a fresh, exciting drink.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Plan proper amounts.  &LR; Choose a small number of cocktails but
keep essentials (beer, soda, bottled water, etc.) on hand. A good
rule of thumb when planning how much alcohol to buy is to figure
two to three drinks for each guest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Set up ahead.  &LR; Organize and chill ingredients. Keep lots of
ice on hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Remember the small touches.  &LR; Shake drinks thoroughly and use
proper glassware _ it will make you look like a pro.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Above all, be responsible.  &LR; Too many fruit and alcohol
combinations are not a good idea. These drinks have a large amount
of alcohol in them, so serve them in moderation only. Be wary of
guests who have more than one or two drinks per hour.
</P>
<P>
   To moderate the effects of alcohol, serve bread-based hors
d'oeuvres such as crostini, breadsticks or chunks of sourdough
served with a spinach dip.
</P>
<P>
   Holidays are meant to be festive. With creative yet sensible
planning, you will have a fabulous, safe soiree.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BROWN RUSSIAN
</P>
<P>
   This variation of the classic White Russian uses chocolate milk
instead of cream. The result is a cozy, mocha-flavored drink
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce vodka
</P>
<P>
   11/2 ounces Kahlua

<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Fill a collins glass or other tall 12 ounce glass with ice. Pour
in the vodka and Kahlua, then add the chocolate milk. Amount of
chocolate milk may be adjusted according to taste.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alternate serving suggestion:  &LR; Cold coffee may be substituted
for the chocolate milk. Simply pour freshly brewed hot coffee into
a cocktail shaker full of ice, shake, then strain into a collins
glass with the vodka/Kahlua mixture. If you like your coffee sweet,
dissolve sugar to taste in the coffee before you shake it with ice.

ROWECOM TO BUY NEWSEDGE FOR $228 MILLION IN STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an agreement that combines two of New England's
largest electronic content companies, RoweCom Inc. said it plans to
buy NewsEdge Corp. for about $228 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   RoweCom sells subscriptions to magazines and electronic journals
for organizations ranging from Intel Corp. to the CIA. NewsEdge
builds filtering software that sifts through vast electronic
databases and newswires for stories of interest to send to specific
users.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would give RoweCom access to that software, which the
company hopes would boost demand for other material RoweCom
delivers via sites on the World Wide Web, said chief executive
Richard Rowe. ``We've got to give people a reason for going there
every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NewsEdge chief executive Don McLagan said the companies first
discussed a content alliance, but decided a purchase would help
NewsEdge fund a faster expansion. ``It was like their strategic
plan and ours were made on the same copier,'' said McLagan, who
owns about 12 percent of NewsEdge's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Neither RoweCom nor NewsEdge is profitable, but RoweCom is
growing quickly as a sort of corporate Amazon.com, selling all
sorts of information products on line, ranging from consultant
reports to books. Before the NewsEdge acquisition RoweCom had
expected revenue of about $305 million this year and $622 million
next year, up from $19 million in 1998. Counting the NewsEdge
merger, RoweCom revenue now should be about $703 million next year,
said Jeffrey Sands, RoweCom's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   RoweCom has about 725 employees, while NewsEdge has about 400.
No layoffs are expected as a result of the merger, the companies
said. Rowecom is based in Burlington, Mass.; NewsEdge in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   NewsEdge president Cliff Pollan will remain as head of the unit,
which will maintain separate operations. McLagan said he plans to
leave the company after the merger is completed, in February or so.
</P>
<P>
   NewsEdge was formed last year when Desktop Data Inc. purchased
Individual Inc. Individual still operates as a unit of NewsEdge,
but it and RoweCom said they will consider the sale of ``a
significant portion'' of Individual's services, aimed at consumer
rather than business customers.
</P>
<P>
   RoweCom manages subscriptions for about 20,000 organizations
worldwide, while NewsEdge has about 1,500 corporate customers.
RoweCom has offices in Westwood, and in Paris and elsewhere in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, RoweCom will issue 0.26 shares
of its stock for each of the 17.4 million shares outstanding in
NewsEdge. RoweCom shares rose 1/4 to close at 50 3/8 in Nasdaq
trading Tuesday, valuing the total agreement at $227.9 million, or
7 percent more than NewsEdge's value before the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The deal still requires federal and shareholder approvals,
including that of
</P>
<P>
   NewsEdge's largest shareholder, Regan Partners LP in New York,
which holds about 25 percent of the stock. The agreement also
includes a breakup fee of $6 million that either side would have to
pay were it to back out of the deal. Late Tuesday McLagan said he
knew of no other offers.
</P>
<P>
   RoweCom was founded in 1994 by Rowe, who formerly was chief
executive of Westwood-based Faxon Co., a large subscription agency
for libraries. He was also associate dean of Harvard's Graduate
School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   After its initial public stock offering in March, RoweCom shares
rose to nearly $50 apiece in April, then fell below $20 as
investors worried the company was chiefly a sales vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Shares recovered as Rowe made the case that its subscription
services would lead to other business opportunities, said Michael
Hughes, an analyst at the J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. investment bank in
Nashville who follows the company. Hughes also noted RoweCom's
latest transaction will bring it about 80 salespeople now working
for NewsEdge.
</P>
<P>
   NewsEdge's Individual unit now has 43 employees overseen by
Ilene Lang, previously head of the AltaVista search engine when it
was owned by Digital Equipment Corp. In an interview Tuesday, Lang
said the unit had revenue of about $4 million from advertising and
e-commerce services last year and expects about the same this year.
But its user base has grown to about 1.2 million as of October, up
from 327,000 users in May, she said; the service hopes to reach
about 7 million users by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in NewsEdge fell 1/4 to close at 12 in Nasdaq trading
Tuesday.

TRUMP SAYS REFORM PARTY BID IS SERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Her shoes mean he's not serious, not yet at least.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, while presidential maybe Donald Trump made nice in
Los Angeles, his model girlfriend teetered beside him on pointy,
strappy stilettos. She stood on them, she walked on them, she
hardly winced when the crowd circling him Tuesday gained momentum
and she fell briefly behind.
</P>
<P>
   But if Trump wants to keep pace with the other presidential
contenders, model Melania Knauss will at some point have to forgo
fashion for comfort. No one can run in her shoes. And in Los
Angeles, The Donald insisted anew that he is seriously
contemplating a run at the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In California for the first time since forming a presidential
exploratory committee, the famous developer and the exquisite but
relatively unknown girlfriend he likes to describe as a
``supermodel'' had a get-acquainted session with party leaders,
dropped in on ``Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno, and took an
abbreviated tour of the Museum of Tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding like a candidate (lambasting the competition, Patrick
Buchanan in particular), acting like a candidate (thanking museum
officials by name), and looking like one, too (conservative navy
suit), Trump even had red-white-and-blue press badges printed up
for the events.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he showed his usual aversion to shaking hands (very
uncandidate-like). Before a news conference Monday, volunteers
distributed sanitizing lotion to reporters, the bottle top
emblazoned with Trump's Web address (www.donaldjtrump2000.com).
</P>
<P>
   Trump's presence _ not to mention the model's _ drew nearly 100
Reform Party leaders and activists to a Beverly Hills hotel, where
rooms start at $300 a night, and more than a half-dozen TV cameras
to the Museum of Tolerance, where admission is $8.50 a ticket for
adults, $5.50 for students. He requested both sessions, the former
resulting in a raucous Q&AMP;A with party members, the latter a forum
to announce his disdain for intolerance and distance himself from
party rival Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pat Buchanan should come here absolutely,'' Trump said
after an hour of seeing a presentation on the Holocaust of the
1940s and bigotry in America today. ``This would be a very logical
stop for Pat Buchanan. . . . His views are so far off . . . almost
anti-everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, looking surprisingly tall in a city where male
celebrities tend to be shorter than expected, crammed a lot of his
opinions into two days.
</P>
<P>
   At the L'Ermitage hotel, he riled some Reform Party members by
dismissing their platform as unformed and refusing to embrace
campaign-finance reform, one of their primary aims. On the
``Tonight Show,'' the billionaire stressed that his proposed
one-time tax on anyone with a net worth exceeding $10 million would
drive down the national debt, heat up the economy even more, and
keep capital in the country. Leno, however, could not resist noting
that Trump has never been elected president of anything, not even
his fifth-grade class.
</P>
<P>
   Trump responded by listing the positions he has held at his
companies, then laughingly agreed with Leno that he ran ``a
dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing polls of his own that show him a strong contender, Trump
said he expects to reach a decision by February. Other polls,
however, show him trailing behind primary opponents Buchanan, Ross
Perot and Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing is something Knauss will have to get used to, unless
one of Trump's newly hired political consultants suggests a
sensible pair of pumps. Then, at least, the schoolchildren who
greeted Trump with gleeful shouts but stared blankly at her despite
the magazine covers might recognize her as the country's first
potential First Girlfriend.

 CHRON   Bring on the Bubbles: Two sparkling menus guarantee a stylish 
 start to the New Year  
   
 By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; If you're among the many who will fete the
millennium by staying safely at home, you're probably planning a
minor splurge for dinner. Or maybe a major splurge. Chances are
you'll open a fine wine or two and pop a Champagne cork at
midnight.
<P>
   But given how rarely a new millennium rolls around, you might
want to consider an unconventional alternative: serving sparkling
wine from start to finish around a menu specifically designed for
it. Bubblies are made in so many styles, from bone-dry Ultra Brut
to gently sweet Extra Dry, so an all-sparkling wine evening can
provide a variety of tastes as well as a guaranteed good time.
</P>
<P>
   To do it right, we turned to two San Francisco chef-sommelier
duos who would know just how to orchestrate such an evening. We
asked chef Gary Danko of Gary Danko restaurant and chef George
Morrone of Fifth Floor to design three-course menus to go with
sparkling wines selected by their respective sommeliers,
Renee-Nicole Kubin and Rajat Parr.
</P>
<P>
   Morrone's menu includes a first course, main course and dessert.
Danko's opens with an appetizer, followed by soup and a main
course. To conclude the meal, he suggests a salad of winter greens
with blue cheese, walnuts and pears.
</P>
<P>
   The menu and sparkling wine choices follow (including a standard
retail price), along with the sommeliers' comments. We also asked
these two wine professionals to describe the various sparkling wine
styles and suggest some food affinities, and to give a quick primer
on opening and serving bubbly. Kubin's first rule: ``Do it more
often.''

GEORGE MORRONE'S MILLENNIUM MENU
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Lobster Carpaccio With Blood Orange and Fennel Salad; 1993 &LR; 
 &UR; Roederer Estate L'Ermitage  &LR; ($30).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the finest example of sparkling wine outside of
Champagne and definitely the best sparkling wine from California,''
Parr says. ``It has citrusy flavors, an orange zest nose and
amazing complexity. It's very fresh, very creamy. You don't want
sparkling wine to be too austere and lean.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Roast Pheasant With Sugar Pumpkin and Pimiento Essence; 1990 &LR; 
 &UR; Charles Heidsieck Brut  &LR; ($47).
</P>
<P>
   Parr says 1990 is the best vintage since 1959. ``The '90s have
amazing acidity but are very powerful, very rich. The Charles
Heidsieck in particular is nutty, smoky, almost like caramelized
pear. It is not an oyster Champagne, not a shellfish wine. You
definitely need meat to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Chilled Pineapple Soup With Pomegranate Sorbet; Non-Vintage &LR; 
 &UR; Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec  &LR; ($32).
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can have dessert with Champagne is to have it
with sweet Champagne,'' Parr says. ``This one is not cloyingly
sweet. It's almost like Moscato d'Asti in sweetness; it has orange
blossom and quince flavors. It's pretty rich, but with fresh
acidity, and it's very fragrant. There are tropical aromas in the
wine and the pineapple soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a sorbet, sparkling wine is always a good choice because
it's cold. If you have a cold dessert and a room-temperature wine,
your palate is going to be shocked. Here you have cold wine and a
cold dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; GARY DANKO'S MILLENNIUM MENU
</P>
<P>
   Sommelier Renee-Nicole Kubin offered two sparkling wine choices
for each course, the first more moderate in price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Buckwheat Blini With Caviar or Smoked Salmon;
Laurent-Perrier &LR; 
 &UR; Cuvee Ultra Brut  &LR; ($53) or &UR; 1993 Louis Roederer Cristal  &LR; ($135).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to balance a meal as a chef, and it's equally
important to do so as a sommelier,'' Kubin says. ``The first wine
should be almost aperitiflike in style _ crisp and dry with no
 &LR; dosage &LR;  (no added sugar), but something that has a creamy texture.
The Laurent-Perrier Ultra Brut has no  &LR; dosage &LR;  and is the only
ultra-brut widely available in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talk about the best wines of the world, without
question someone will throw in either Cristal or Dom Perignon or
Krug. These are absolutely stunning wines, but they are expensive.
I wouldn't pair them with food for any reason, because price
usually is an object. But they are truly a millennium treat.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Truffled Winter Vegetable Soup; 1993 Roederer Estate &LR; 
 &UR; L'Ermitage  &LR; ($30) or  &UR; 1990 Bollinger Grande Annee  &LR; ($60).
</P>
<P>
   ``On several occasions I've tried wines that basically overwhelm
that exotic (truffle) flavor, and that's a shame because the
truffle is the point,'' Kubin says. ``To make that flavor linger,
you need a toasty, yeasty quality that's usually only found in true
Champagne (from France), although Roederer L'Ermitage is a heck of
a wine. It's my favorite producer in California, hands down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bollinger 1990 is not too easy to find. Along with Krug,
it's one of two producers that actually use (barrel fermentation).
That gives great complexity and depth and richness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Roast Loin of Veal With Chanterelles; Vilmart Cuvee Rubis
Rose &LR;  ($42) &UR;  &LR; or  &UR; 1991 Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Rose  &LR; ($168).
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, people still think that rose is going to be
sweet. Or they say, `I don't want anything fruity.' I like for
people to think of rose as a red wine that has a bit of sparkle.
It's Pinot Noir,'' Kubin points out. ``The veal with chanterelles
is an elegant dish rather than meaty and powerful, so a rose works
beautifully. It's a very pretty match. One doesn't dominate the
other. The rose just brings out more flavor in the veal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vilmart is so wonderful. It's a family-run house and the
production is very small. It's been discovered here over the last
one to two years. It's quite deep in color, more than most ros &LR; e &LR; s.
That comes from leaving the fermenting wine on the grape skins,
versus adding color back (by adding red wine). At this price level,
few ros &LR; e &LR; s are made with such care.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Best Way to Open the Bubbly &QL;  &LR; 
Many eyes have been lost to sparkling wine corks, according to
Kubin's optometrist father. Sparkling wine should always be opened
with attention and care.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Kubin's method:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a knife to remove the top part of the foil by cutting
around the lower lip of the bottle. Leave the remaining foil on the
bottle for appearance.
</P>
<P>
   _ The cork will be covered with a wire cage. Do not remove the
cage until the cork is out of the bottle. Instead, with one thumb
firmly over the cork, untwist the cage wire with your other hand.
Then, still with your thumb over the cork and cage, angle the
bottle away from everyone and very slowly twist the bottle, not the
cork.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you feel the cork releasing, tilt the cork to release the
pressure slowly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't aim for the loud pop that people associate with
Champagne drinking. It's not only dangerous; it's bad for the wine.
A properly extracted cork releases a sigh, not a shout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; There's a Style and Type of Bubbly for Every Dish &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In general, when serving sparkling wines, follow the same
principles for matching still wines with food: Serve light, fresh
sparkling wines with lighter food, richer sparkling wines with
richer food. Work from lighter to heavier during the course of the
meal. Pour nonvintage wines before vintage wines.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a description of the various sparkling wine types:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Blanc de blancs &LR; : Made entirely from Chardonnay, blanc de
blancs are the cleanest, freshest-tasting, most austere of
sparkling wines.
</P>
<P>
   When young, they are a good aperitif; serve them with hors
d'oeuvres or smoked fish.
</P>
<P>
   As they age, they become more ``biscuity and briochelike,'' Parr
says. Pair older ones with a fish course or pate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Blanc de noirs &LR; : Made mostly or entirely from red grapes,
usually Pinot Noir blended with Pinot Meunier. These are typically
richer, bigger and more powerful than blanc de blancs.
</P>
<P>
   When young, they can accompany a fish course, including salmon
or tuna. When aged, serve them with poultry.
</P>
<P>
   The Champagne houses of Bollinger and Krug make the most
powerful blancs de noirs; older vintages can stand up to fillet of
beef.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Brut &LR; : Champagne or sparkling wine made in a dry style, as
the vast majority are. An all-purpose sparkling wine likely to go
with many things, and usually made from a blend of white and red
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Ultra Brut/Extra Brut/Brut Sauvage/Brut Zero &LR; : These are all
names for sparkling wines that have no dosage, meaning no sugar
added when the wine is disgorged.
</P>
<P>
   They are bone dry, appealing before dinner or early in the meal
with raw oysters, shellfish, caviar or crudites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Rose &LR; : When made by high-end producers in France and
California, these are the richest, most powerful and most
sought-after of sparkling wines.
</P>
<P>
   They are dry, never sweet. Their color comes either from
steeping the juice with the grape skins briefly during
fermentation, or from the addition of red wine at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not a sissy thing,'' says Kubin, who likes them with
substantial dishes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Extra Dry &LR; : Few producers still make this style which,
paradoxically, is not dry but slightly sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Serve this style with ham, pork, smoked turkey or chicken,
especially if there's a fruity accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Kubin suggests it for holiday meals with sweet components, such
as sweet potatoes or cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Demi-Sec &LR; : Sweeter than Extra Dry. ``Absolutely charming and
festive,'' says Kubin, who pours it with fruit tarts, apple
strudel, fruit sorbets and panna cotta.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Doux &LR; : Sweeter than Demi-Sec; serve with custard desserts,
such as creme caramel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Tips on Serving Sparklers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are answers to frequently asked questions about serving
sparkling wine.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's the best serving temperature?
</P>
<P>
   Cold but not icy. Chill the sparkling wine for several hours in
the refrigerator and keep it in a bucket of ice water (not just
ice) between servings. Serve vintage sparkling wines slightly
warmer to savor their nuances.
</P>
<P>
   _ How high do you fill the glass?
</P>
<P>
   To keep sparkling wine cold, fill the glass only halfway or a
little more, say Parr and Kubin. You can top it offup often; it
doesn't mean you're drinking more.
</P>
<P>
   _ What about leftovers?
</P>
<P>
   Use a sparkling wine bottle stopper to recork the bottle and
refrigerate. It should stay fresh and bubbly for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   _ How long can you keep an unopened bottle in the refrigerator?
</P>
<P>
   For months if it's on its side; for no more than two weeks if
it's standing in the refrigerator door.

 &LR; ROAST LOIN OF VEAL WITH CHANTERELLES
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 boneless loin of veal, about 2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped pistachio nuts
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/2 garlic clove, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   The Mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 pound chanterelle mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   The Sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 cups veal stock
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Trim off all fat and silver skin from the meat, then tie into a
roast with butcher's twine (or have your butcher do this).
</P>
<P>
   Combine the breadcrumbs, pistachios, parsley and garlic. Brush
the meat with mustard, then coat with the breadcrumb mixture. Place
on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.
</P>
<P>
   Clean the chanterelles well and slice them. Melt 1 tablespoon of
the butter in a nonstick pan over moderately high heat. Add the
mushrooms and saute until they render juices. Drain in a sieve and
reserve juices. Return the mushrooms to the pan, add the remaining
1 tablespoon butter, the parsley and garlic. Season with salt and
pepper and saute briefly to incorporate seasonings. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the veal to room temperature. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place the veal on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast until a meat
thermometer registers 125 degrees when inserted in the thickest
part of the roast, about 60 minutes. Let rest in a warm place for
10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the meat rests, reheat the mushrooms and make the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the mushroom juices to a pan and reduce to a near-glaze
over high heat. Add the veal stock and reduce to 1/2 cup. Remove
from heat and whisk in the butter. Season with salt. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly season the roast with salt. Slice thinly and arrange on
warm plates (remove the butcher's twine); add the chanterelles,
then spoon the sauce over the veal.

LOBSTER CARPACCIO WITH BLOOD ORANGE &AMP; FENNEL SALAD
</P>
<P>
   If blood oranges are not in season, substitute Satsumas.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 live lobsters, about 2 pounds each
</P>
<P>
   1 small fennel bulb
</P>
<P>
   2 blood oranges
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, minced
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   8 slices brioche or egg bread, toasted, each cut in half on the
diagonal
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To cook the lobsters:  &LR; Bring a large pot of salted water to a
boil. Plunge the lobsters into the pot and cook 4 minutes. Remove
lobsters and immediately place in ice water to stop the cooking.
When the lobsters are cold, drain and pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   Separate the tail from the body. Using a sharp knife, cut the
tail in half lengthwise. Remove the meat. Crack the lobster claws
and extract the meat, being careful to keep the claw meat intact.
Crack the knuckle and extract the meat, discarding the shell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the salad:  &LR; Place the lobster claw and knuckle meat in
a bowl. Using a mandoline or a very sharp knife, shave the fennel
crosswise into very thin slices and add to the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the zest from the lemon and mince it. Cut the zest from 1 of
the oranges and mince it. Remove any remaining skin and pith from
this orange and separate the segments from the membrane. Add the
segments to the bowl. Squeeze the juice from the remaining orange
into the bowl as well. Add the juice of the lemon and 1 tablespoon
of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and mix gently.
</P>
<P>
   Place 1 lobster tail half between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.
Using a meat mallet or a rolling pin, gently pound the meat until
it is paper thin. Be very careful not to puncture the plastic wrap.
When the tail is evenly pounded, use a plastic spatula or pastry
scraper to shape the ``carpaccio'' into a circle. Cut away excess
plastic. Repeat with the remaining lobster tail halves.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully remove the top sheets of plastic wrap. Invert each
carpaccio onto a chilled plate. Remove remaining plastic wrap.
Brush the carpaccio liberally with olive oil. Season with salt and
pepper. Sprinkle with parsley, capers, garlic, lemon zest and
orange zest.
</P>
<P>
   Add any remaining olive oil to the salad. Pile salad in the
center of each lobster carpaccio, making sure each portion gets 1
claw and 1 piece of knuckle meat. Garnish each plate with toasted
brioche triangles.

 &LR; ROAST PHEASANT WITH SUGAR PUMPKIN &AMP; PIMIENTO ESSENCE
</P>
<P>
   The pheasant stock, roasted pumpkins and pimiento essence may be
made one day in advance. Cool everything completely, then
refrigerate in air-tight containers until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 fresh pheasants, about 3 pounds each
</P>
<P>
   4 large carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 celery ribs, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 large yellow onions, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 head garlic, broken into cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup grapeseed oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 small sugar pumpkins, about 1/2 pound each
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 fresh pimiento peppers or small red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white truffle oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cooked dried beans, preferably cranberry beans
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped mixed herbs (parsley, thyme and tarragon)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   For each pheasant, cut off the legs where the thigh meets the
body. Cut out the backbone, leaving the whole breast still on the
bone.
</P>
<P>
   Put the backbones in a roasting pan with half of the carrots,
celery, onions and garlic. Drizzle with one third of the grapeseed
oil. Place in the oven and roast about 35 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until the bones and vegetables are well browned.
Drain off any fat in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the bones and vegetables to a stock pot, cover with
cold water and bring to a boil. Skim off any foam, reduce heat to
low and simmer gently for 2 hours. Strain. Reserve broth.
</P>
<P>
   While the bones and vegetables are simmering, place the
remaining carrots, celery, onions and garlic in a roasting pan.
Season the pheasant legs with salt and pepper and place on the
vegetables. Roast until the meat juices run clear, about 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the legs roast, prepare the sugar pumpkins. Cut off the
top third of each pumpkin and reserve. Scoop out the seeds with a
spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle a little olive oil inside each pumpkin, using 1
tablespoon total for all 4 pumpkins. Season with salt and pepper,
and replace the pumpkin lids. Roast in a 350 degrees oven for 45
minutes, or until the pumpkins are just tender. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle the pimiento peppers with the remaining 1 tablespoon
olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in a 350 oven for
25 minutes, turning frequently until the skin blisters. Transfer to
a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the peppers and remove stem and seeds. Set 1 pepper aside
for garnish. Put the remaining peppers and their juices in a small
saucepan with 1 cup of the pheasant broth. Bring to a boil, then
puree in a blender until smooth. Season with salt, pepper, lime
juice and coriander. Strain and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   When the pheasant legs are cool enough to handle, remove the
meat in bite-size pieces and place in a bowl. Discard bones.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the pheasant breasts with the truffle oil. Season liberally
with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining grapeseed oil in a large
skillet until almost smoking. One at a time, sear the breasts
skin-side down until golden brown. Transfer to a roasting pan and
roast in a 350 degrees oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven,
lightly season with salt and pepper. Cover with foil and let rest
for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dice the reserved pimiento pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cooked beans in a saucepan; add the pheasant leg meat
and 1 cup pheasant broth. Bring to a simmer and cook 3 minutes. Add
the butter, the diced pimiento and the herbs. Season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the pheasant breasts off the bone by running a sharp knife
along the breast bone separating the 2 halves. Leave the wing bone
intact. Slice each half-breast into 3 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Assembly:  &LR; Spoon a pool of pimiento puree in the center of each
warmed dinner plate. Place a sugar pumpkin in the center. Fill the
pumpkin with the cranberry bean ragout and top the pumpkins with
their lids. Arrange a sliced half-breast of pheasant on each plate.

MARTHA CAHOON, 94; WAS RENOWNED PRIMITIVE ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Martha Farham Cahoon, a primitive painter whose home is
now a museum of Americana in Barnstable, died Sunday in Cape Cod
Hospital in Hyannis. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cahoon was born in Boston. She was the wife of the late
Ralph Cahoon, who was also a primitive painter of national repute.
Their work consists predominatly of whimsical paintings on wood
with themes that often involved mermaids and hot air balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 17, I went to work for my father who was a
furniture painter in Harwich,'' Mrs. Cahoon said in a story
published in the Globe on April 2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After learning how to paint furniture, she taught her friend
Ralph the art of decoration, and after their marriage in 1932, the
couple were furniture decorators.
</P>
<P>
   One of their clients was Joan Whitney Payson, the future owner
of the New York Mets, who at that time had an antiques shop on New
York's Long Island. Admiring the Cahoons' work, she suggested one
day in the 1950s: ``Why don't you put frames around this stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   The couple did and soon their framed pictures were being bought
by the likes of Paul Mellon, Felix duPont, Joan Fontaine, and
Jacqueline Onassis, when she was married to President John F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Cahoon retired from
painting and turned her attention to crayon sketches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the Cahoon Museum of American Art opened in the
couple's former home and studio.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves a son, Franz of Cotuit; a sister, Osa Goldsmith of
Harwich; a brother, Eric Farham of Harwich; a grandson; and a
great-granddaughter.

<P>
   GUSAU, Nigeria _ Zamfara, the North Dakota of Nigeria, has
suddenly become this West African nation's most famous state. This
dusty part of northwestern Nigeria, a roadside blur of tiny
villages where farmers peddle yams to passing motorists, now stands
as the biggest challenge to Nigeria's fragile national unity.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the state government announced it would introduce
Shariah, the Islamic social and penal code, raising near-hysteria
in a country already divided nearly evenly _ and uneasily _ between
a Muslim north and a Christian south.
</P>
<P>
   In Gusau, the state capital, boys have already been segregated
in one of the two secondary schools and girls in the other; hotels
and bars have stopped selling alcohol, and green-and-yellow taxis
have profiles of a woman with a covered head painted on their
doors, signifying that only women can ride inside. The state has
placed ads in national newspapers requesting candidates to become
Islamic judges once Shariah is formally put into force Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's law is supreme,'' read posters that Zamfara's ministry
of information has placed all over Gusau. ``To be a good Muslim is
to stay within the limits of the Shariah. The Shariah does not
discriminate against non-Muslims. Support the Shariah today and
always!''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the state, Zamfara's actions have caused a kind of
panic. Will people be arrested for carrying beer across the state
border into Zamfara? Will the authorities cut off thieves' hands?
Will adulterers be stoned to death? Was the move a conspiracy by
northerners displeased that they had lost power and influence in
the new civilian government? These were among the questions raised
by newspapers in Lagos, the commercial capital (and former national
capital) in the south.
</P>
<P>
   As other states in the heavily Muslim north declared their
intentions to follow suit, Nigeria's young civilian government
faced a fresh, unexpected challenge to this old question: How do
you keep the 110 million people in Nigeria _ an artificial creation
of British colonialists in 1914, an impossible patchwork of
religions, languages and 400 ethnic groups _ together in a
democracy?
</P>
<P>
   For most of Nigeria's history, the British colonialists and
post-independence military rulers welded the country through sheer
force. A few years after independence in 1960, the eastern Ibo
tried to secede in the Biafran civil war, which killed 1 million
people. The reconciliation policy that followed came to be
considered a model one: ``No victor, no vanquished.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, generals seized power in coups, contending that
only the military could keep the country unified, a refrain heard
elsewhere in Africa where territorial boundaries were also drawn
arbitrarily.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Gov. Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi said Zamfara's actions should
have no national repercussions, and that none had been intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shariah is not going to cause havoc to the country,'' he said
from his official residence, where a mosque is being built in the
courtyard. ``It will bring peace and unity here. It is entirely a
local affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shariah is fundamental human rights,'' he added. ``Now we are
in a democracy. Whatever we want, we have the right to.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians outside Zamfara, especially those from the
predominantly Christian south, do not see it his way. To many of
them, Zamfara's introduction of Shariah is the stirring of a
militant Islam in the north that, if unchecked, will lead to a
north unified politically and religiously against the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shariah law, if implemented, is the beginning of the
disintegration of Nigeria,'' said Young Harry Adokiye, a southern,
Christian member of the national legislature in Abuja. ``Is the
police force which is funded from our common purse now going to
enforce Shariah? What does Zamfara produce? They are being
sustained with oil from the south. How can they sustain Shariah law
with resources from the Christian south? We appeal to them to stop
it because nobody survives a religious war.''
</P>
<P>
   Between these extremes, Haruna Salihi, a professor of politics
and Islam at Bayero University in Kano, said that Zamfara would
lead to a rethinking of Nigeria's federal structure. Power, which
had been centralized in the hands of a few generals, will have to
be shared under civilian rule, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had had democracy in the past,'' Salihi said, ``we would
have already reappraised the limits of the federal government and
recognized the authority of the states.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zamfara contends that the Nigerian constitution, which
guarantees freedom of religion, allows it to choose Shariah. The
state will retain the penal code found elsewhere in the country,
but Shariah will govern daily life here, and Islamic judges are to
be trained to settle civil and criminal matters for Muslims, said
Shinkafi, the deputy governor. Non-Muslims, who make up about 10
percent of the state's two million people, will not be affected by
Shariah, he added, though others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Zamfara's critics say the changes amount to turning it into an
Islamic state, a point that Shinkafi rejects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Yoruba Christian whose
sweeping investigation of the past has taken aim at and angered
many of the Muslim military and political elites of the north, has
reacted cautiously. During a visit to the United States, he called
Zamfara's introduction of Shariah unconstitutional; since his
return to Nigeria, he has remained quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking power May 29, Obasanjo has faced a series of ethnic
clashes and revolts that have strained Nigeria's unity. Militants
in the Niger Delta, the southern region that produces the country's
two million barrels of oil a day but has derived almost no material
benefit from it, have grown so violent that soldiers were deployed
there recently.
</P>
<P>
   In November, in the third significant conflict since July
between the Yoruba and the Hausa, dozens of people were killed in
Lagos in a dispute over space in a market. The Yoruba involved were
part of the Yoruba Oodua People's Congress, which advocates
secession for the ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In a clear signal that he would not favor his own ethnicity,
Obasanjo, a former general who ruled the country in the 1970s, said
on national television, ``Anyone who calls himself OPC should be
arrested, and if he doesn't agree, he will be shot on sight.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zamfara, the deputy governor said that the implementation of
the Shariah was a reaction to the corrupt, crime-ridden country
that Nigeria had become. In recent weeks, he said, prostitutes had
been run out of the state, gambling houses padlocked, and highway
robberies had declined.
</P>
<P>
   To Shinkafi and others, the state was merely recalling the
rightful place that Islam and Shariah occupied in northern Nigeria
before the British arrived. Under the Sokoto caliphate, which
extended across present-day northern Nigeria, Shariah was law. To
this day, personal issues like marriage and inheritance are often
settled informally according to Shariah.
</P>
<P>
   If Zamfara is allowed to enact Shariah on Jan. 27 _ short of
some national government action to prevent it _ it is unclear what
role government police officers will play and how strictly Shariah
will be interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of Shariah law has already infringed on the
rights of non-Muslims, said people attending Mass one recent Sunday
morning at Our Lady of Fatima Roman Catholic Church in Gusau.
Christian women said they were refused entry into the
green-and-yellow taxis because their heads were not covered. Others
who rode on the back of motorcycle taxis reported being harassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shariah is a time bomb,'' said the Rev. Linus-Mary Awuhe, a
priest at the parish. ``It will embolden the Muslims, and
eventually the Christians will have to react. So there will be
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   But among Muslims _ even among those who said they were not
fully aware of the implications of a society governed by Shariah _
the Zamfara government's action appeared to win support.
</P>
<P>
   In Gusau's main market, a collection of stalls dotting a field
of sand and parched grass, cries of ``God is great!'' could be
heard on a Sunday afternoon. Muslim merchants left their stalls and
prayed in unison in an open area.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Shariah announcement, there had been a lot of
``biri-biri,'' or cheating, in the market, said Murtalla Musa, 21,
who was selling ginger. ``But now it is reduced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced on a big bag of rice, Sani Maishinkafa, 40, a civil
servant and rice trader, said he doubted that the state government
had thought of Shariah for only religious and moral reasons. ``If
you are a politician,'' he said, ``you capitalize on many issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a Muslim, you will not dispute Shariah,'' Maishinkafa
said. ``So naturally, I support it. If you are saying no to
Shariah, you are saying no to your religion.''

THE GOLDEN LEGACY OF SCYTHIAN WARRIORS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RITA REIF

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In the fifth century B.C., the Greek historian
Herodotus met the Scythians on the northern coast of the Black Sea
and was so impressed by their customs and their splendid gold
artifacts that he wrote vividly about them in ``History.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, that account provides historians with a broad sketch
of the lifestyle of these nomad warriors, the spiritual ancestors
of the Cossacks who moved swiftly _ and with bells on _ through
history. They migrated in the eighth century B.C. from Central Asia
to Assyria and then to the rich grasslands north of the Black Sea,
now called Ukraine, before disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Scythians, how they lived, died and were buried
with the things they coveted _ gold, jewels, armor and pottery _ is
told in ``Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient
Ukraine,'' an exhibition of 171 objects here at the San Antonio
Museum of Art, through Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The show was organized by the museum and the Walters Art Gallery
in Baltimore, where it moves in March. It travels then to the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Royal
Ontario Museum in Toronto, the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art in
Kansas City, Mo., and the Grand Palais in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Herodotus wrote in greatest detail about the funeral rites of a
Scythian king who was embalmed and whose body was then taken by
wagon on a 40-day procession seen by all the people under Scythian
rule. The king was buried on a straw mattress, flanked by spears,
and under a canopy of beams covered with reed thatching. Buried
with him were a concubine, members of his household and
possessions, especially his gold artifacts. The grave was marked by
a monumental mound of earth.
</P>
<P>
   What mystifies some historians today is Herodotus' geographical
description of the royal cemetery's location, which he wrote was at
Gerrhus, ``in the land of the Gerrhi,'' a site that has never been
found. Archaeologists began to unearth Scythian gold objects in
Ukraine and elsewhere 250 years ago. The objects were dated, but
the original owners were not identified, and the pieces were sent
to the Hermitage Gold Collection in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Since excavations began again in the late 1970s, scores of the
thousand-plus tombs in Ukraine have been opened and studied, and
their contents have remained in Kiev, either at the Institute of
Archaeology or the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, the
museums that lent most of the works in this show.
</P>
<P>
   In organizing the exhibition, Gerry Scott III, curator of
Ancient Art at San Antonio, worked with Ellen D. Reeder, curator of
Ancient Art at the Walters. Ms. Reeder, the show's curator and the
editor of its catalogue with Harry N. Abrams ($60, hard cover; $39,
paper), will become the deputy director for art at the Brooklyn
Museum next month.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that recent excavations and modern
scholarship have answered some questions about the art of the
Scythians. The information available goes well beyond what was
known in 1975, when Scythian gold was last seen in a museum
exhibition in this country in ``From the Land of the Scythians:
Ancient Treasures From the Museums of the U.S.S.R.,'' at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The excavated gold serves as the best guide to the Scythian
customs and their travels. Armor and swords were found buried with
both men and women, who were also warriors, in some of the earliest
tombs from the seventh and sixth centuries B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Other early possessions also reveal the tribal culture that the
Scythians brought with them to Europe. That expressed the animal
style in imagery of the cycle of life and transformation: birds
emerging from the antlers of a deer, a recumbent stag looking
vulnerable or ready to spring from earth to sky and, on a
cone-shaped finial, a fallen deer heroically resisting a spotted
leopard.
</P>
<P>
   Scythian goldsmiths adapted the imagery of other people in their
own imaginative ways. They borrowed the linear mane of Assyrian
horses to portray that of a boar in panels of scrolls on a Scythian
scabbard. And like the Assyrians, the Scythians embellished
drinking vessels with animals, as is seen in one of the show's
charmers, the handle of an ancient cup in the form of a boar with
silver fangs and flat feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek influence was even stronger. ``Only a handful of
objects in this show would be considered purely Greek,'' Ms. Reeder
said. ``A lovely sphinx earring is Hellenistic in style, but the
less refined nose suggests that the maker probably did not study in
Athens.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the forms may be Greek but the custom
represented is not: an image of a woman on a bow-and-arrow case
looks Greek until you notice that she is perched on an upended
footstool, something no proper Greek would do, Ms. Reeder said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Scythians' own inimitable style, sound and motion
were paramount. ``Sounds were as vital as speed to Scythian
warriors,'' Ms. Reeder said. ``They were a people on the move with
hoofs pounding, wheels creaking and the blowing of horns in the
wind. They created things that came alive with sound. They wore
rustling gowns, tinkling earrings, robes awash with pendants that
jingled. Even the finials on their wagon poles rattled to announce
their coming.''

MCCAIN SEES DANGER TO US IN WEAK MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain, a highly decorated
veteran of the Vietnam war, asserted Tuesday that US military
preparedness is dangerously inadequate, and said that the country
is increasingly vulnerable to attack from rogue states such as Iraq
and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Concord Rotary Club, McCain, a leading
candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said the new,
post-Cold War threats make necessary construction of a national
missile defense system, even if that means US withdrawal from the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty concluded with the Soviet Union in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said the United States should become more active in
supporting resistance movements against rogue regimes, and named
specific weapons systems he considered unnecessary, elimination of
which would provide some of the funds needed to modernize the
military and increase preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should sit down with Russia and see whether the ABM treaty
could be altered to permit both of our countries to respond to
ballistic missile threats,'' he told a crowd of about 170 Rotarians
and guests at a local restaurant. But ``if these talks fail. . . .
I will withdraw from a treaty that has become a relic of the Cold
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many arms limitation agreements, the ABM treaty contains a
provision allowing countries to withdraw from the pact in cases of
threats to supreme national interest. The ABM treaty requires six
months notice of intention to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   McCain advocated what he called a policy of ``rogue state
rollback, in which our goal is not simply to contain rogue regimes,
but to drive them from power.'' He said he would provide money,
materials, training and equipment to resistance forces in and
around rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviets agreed to
leave themselves open to missile attacks which, it was thought at
the time, could only come from one another. Now, US-Russia conflict
is improbable, but North Korea, Iraq and Iran all are working on
long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In an expanded version of the Concord speech scheduled for
delivery in New York Tuesday night, McCain said US vulnerability to
missiles has become a major incentive for rogue states to develop
the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Among other presidential contenders, former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley says he would not build a missile defense system. Texas
Gov. George W. Bush says he would. Vice President Al Gore supports
development of a missile defense system, but would not commit to
deploying it until costs and chances of preserving the current
treaty were evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   McCain laid blame for the poor level of US military preparedness
on Republican and Democratic political leaders rather than on the
uniformed leadership of the military services.
</P>
<P>
   He said the C-130 military transport aircraft, the B-2 stealth
bomber, and the Seawolf submarine all should be taken out of
production and that numerous unneeded military bases, which have
been kept open by congressmen eager to avoid unemployment and
dislocation in their districts, should be closed. These and related
steps would save up to $20 billion a year that could be used for
modernization of forces to face current threats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took pains near the beginning of his remarks to absolve
military leaders of blame for the lack of preparedness, faulting
instead what he called gross neglect of real military needs by
Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and by the administrations
of presidents Clinton and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that for years Congress has forced the Air Force to buy
more C-130s than its leaders wanted, while military salaries were
kept so low that 12,000 enlisted personnel are ``left with no
choice but to accept food stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in the New York text he added that ``our military
planning focuses on maintaining the force structure that proved
effective in winning the last war, while too little attention has
been given to . . . future conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to allow embedded biases in the Pentagon or
political influences to resist innovative and forward-thinking
approaches to force planning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain invoked memories of the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl
Harbor, the 58th anniversary of which was observed Tuesday, saying
the primary legacy of the event which precipitated US entry into
World War II was that ``it had taught America the perils of
military unpreparedness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we spend barely 3 percent of our gross domestic progress
on defense,'' he said. ``The last time we spent so little on
defense was 1940 _ the year before Pearl Harbor.''

&HT;     U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

NEAPOLITAN WINE FINDS HIGH NOTES, TOO

<P>
   ATRIPALDA, Italy _ One of the most startling changes in
Campania, the region of Naples, has been the improvement in the
local wines in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Mastroberardino firm, headquartered here in the hills east
of the city, has set the pace for generations. In recent years it
has produced classic wines made from native Campanian grapes _ a
premium white Fiano di Avellino, fresh yet honeyed, called More
Maiorum, and a majestic, long-lived red, Radici Taurasi, made from
aglianico and often called the Barolo of the south. Both varietals
date to the time of the Greeks and the Romans.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mastroberardino family has split, but Piero
Mastroberardino, 33, continues to innovate and to modernize; the
winery is one of the most technically advanced in all of Italy. In
March, he will introduce a new premium wine called Historia, a
robust red with long aging in oak.
</P>
<P>
   Mastroberardino has plenty of competition these days, which you
can sample at some Naples restaurants. At Don Salvatore, I drank a
refreshing, slightly sharp wine from the D'Ambria vineyards on
Ischia. Masaniello offers a subtle, intense fiano made in small
lots by Romano Clelia.
</P>
<P>
   Other names to look for include Villa Matilde, for red aglianico
and fruity white made from falanghina, another intriguing old
grape, and Feudi di San Gregorio, for a whole line of exceptional,
well-balanced wines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Villa Matilde's wines, fairly widely distributed in the United
States, are often a bargain, at well under $20 a bottle. High-end
Mastroberardino and Feudi di San Gregorio wines can be expensive
(as much as $60), but both firms also make smaller wines, like
Greco di Tufo, a brisk white, that cost only about $10 to $15. They
are also widely available in the United States.

BOND YIELDS DOWN FOR 3RD STRAIGHT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond yields fell for the third consecutive day
Tuesday after government reports showed a rise in productivity and
a drop in labor costs, easing investor concern about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond rose 17/32 to 99 1/32. The yield,
which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.20 percent,
from 6.24 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The government raised its estimate of growth in third-quarter
productivity to 4.9 percent, the fastest pace in almost seven
years, from a prior estimate of 4.2 percent. Productivity is an
index of output per hour worked.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, the Labor Department said unit labor costs
for the third quarter declined 0.2 percent, which brought the
year-over-year trend to just 1.5 percent, down from 2.3 percent in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said, ``It soothed the market's inflationary concerns at least for
the time being and resulted in a further decline in bond yields.
However, this drop in bond yields is not likely to last into the
first quarter, as investors' inflationary expectations and desired
real rate of return will likely push bond yields back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed,'' said Fine, ``with the economy continuing to grow
very strongly, and with the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, the
Fed is likely to remain in a tightening mode until it sees
definitive signs that economic growth is slowing to a
noninflationary pace. While no move is expected at the Dec. 21
Federal Open Market Committee meeting to ease the transition
through Year 2000 concerns, the central bank appears to be on a
direct course to raise short term rates once again during the first
quarter of the Year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also auctioned $10 billion of a new 52-week bill.
They were awarded at a rate of 5.35 percent, which was a bit better
than expected, with the bid to cover ratio, or the number of bids
compared to the total amount being sold, decent at 3.21 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury securities also received a boost in the afternoon after
the Federal Reserve Board entered the market to buy long dated
issues, and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, made no
mention of monetary policy in a midmorning speech at the Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   While the market hit the daily highs after Greenspan's speech,
most market participants attributed the gains to a ``coupon pass''
or the outright purchase of Treasury securities by the Fed, which
bought $915 million worth of securities maturing between Aug. 15,
2022, and Nov. 15, 2027.
</P>
<P>
   With trading activity on the decline heading into the year-end,
traders said the Federal Reserve's purchases were enough to lift
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this thin market it doesn't take much to push the market
either way,'' said Robert Pugliese, a senior vice president and
director of fixed income for J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca
Raton, Fla.

HILLARY'S HOLIDAY FAREWELL
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is a happier Christmas season for Hillary
Clinton than last year's holiday when the president was being
impeached by the House and about to face trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   She soldiered on with a smiling face and a heavy heart,
presiding with composure over the annual White House festivities as
though she had not a worry in the world. The parties went on as
usual. The country saw a president and first lady determined to
prop up the nation's spirits no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   But Monica Lewinsky is now a receding memory, the Clinton
presidency has survived and the first lady is about to make history
as a Senate candidate in New York. This year she really does have
something to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Right after Christmas she will leave behind the unique trappings
and public exposure of the White House, as soon as the Secret
Service completes the installation of security features in her new
home in a New York City suburb. In what was one of her last
appearances as an active first lady, she showed off the latest
glorious White House decorations on Monday for a mob of reporters
and camera folk.
</P>
<P>
   It was a muted variation on the bizarre scene of a year ago,
when the good cheer inside the White House contrasted sharply with
the political gloom outside. The journalists didn't come just for
the decorations then, and they didn't come just to ogle the
gingerbread houses, the swooping ribbons, hand-crafted ornaments
and shimmering trees now either.
</P>
<P>
   They came to get a glimpse of Hillary Clinton's magic act,
always a classy performance. Martha Stewart would have been proud
of the first lady's earnest spiel on behalf of the skilled artists
who decked her marble halls and created nearly 12,000 ornaments for
the Blue Room tree alone. Yet Clinton seemed uncomfortable in her
hostess role, a bit less sparkly than usual, her thoughts already
shifting from her role the president's partner to her new status as
the New York Democratic Senate challenger.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the extended Clinton family will spend this
Christmas together in the White House. The mansion is so
beautifully enveloped in soft red velvet swags, fruit-laden Della
Robbia wreaths and elegant gold bows that it would be a crime not
to hang around to enjoy it. But she refused to answer a question
about her holiday plans for next year, which will come in her
husband's last month as president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chatter in the tabloids, it is unlikely that the
couple will divorce, at least so long as he still holds office. But
a separation short of the legal niceties seems the way they are
going.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends suggest that she will spend more time in New York
than originally planned when she said she would be in Washington
roughly one week every month. She has been criticized for coasting
on her status as first lady instead of sufficiently making the
required rounds in her adopted political base. It is becoming
urgent that she spend a lot more time in the state so that the
perception of her identity shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the nation's capital, she is seen as a political bird in
flight, leaving us behind for an unknown future as a candidate in a
race she could well lose. But if she wins, she will be back as a
senator and will need yet another new address, inevitably one less
grand than the mansion she now occupies.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she still nominally presides over a White House
that is always at its most spectacular during the December
holidays. The staff begins preparing for the extravaganza in
February. There is nothing else like it.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 12,000 shrimp and 285 gallons of eggnog will be
served at receptions during the next two weeks. Inside the White
House there are 28 decorated Christmas trees and 324 wreaths. Some
2,000 musicians will perform in the mansion during tours and
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   This year's theme honors national treasures _ those historic
structures, documents and art that record our history and our
traditions. Hillary Clinton has led a crusade in the past year to
preserve these objects, many of which are threatened by decay,
natural disasters and improper conservation. Replicas of some of
our most famous landmarks and public figures carved in wood or
marzipan line marble mantels, stand on tables and hang from the
central East Room tree.
</P>
<P>
   Such a fantastic setting can be hard to leave behind for the
horrors of a New York campaign. But what's wrong with a somewhat
early departure? She would have only one more year there anyway.

AGING AND GRUMPY, BUT A LITTLE LIKE SAM MALONE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDY MEISLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The food at the corner coffee shop, albeit cooked and served by
a comely ex-model, is terrible. Parking in the Bronx is bad and
getting worse. Every car on the street is a rolling rap concert.
</P>
<P>
   Whining hypochondriacs live stubbornly into their 90s;
sweet-faced inner-city children waste away from HIV. You
(italics)can(end italics) center a sitcom on an egotistical,
self-righteous misanthrope, if he's played by a famous actor
associated with a well-loved comic character in his past.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the world is nasty, brutish and almost totally unfair.
God _ whether you believe in him or not _ almost inevitably acts in
an irritatingly inscrutable manner, and all of the above, serious
and frivolous, fairly comprehensively sums up the concept,
execution and comedic underpinnings of the most unconventional and
underpublicized hit comedy on the air today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most flawed character I've ever written,'' says David
Hackel, proudly, of Dr. John Becker, the middle-aged lead character
played by Ted Danson, the ex-``Cheers'' matinee idol whose sitcom
star seemed permanently eclipsed after the failure of his heavily
promoted ``Ink'' in 1996. Becker is a politically incorrect
malcontent with no real counterpart in today's youth-obsessed
sitcom world.
</P>
<P>
   Positioned neatly at 9:30 p.m. on Mondays on CBS behind the hit
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Becker'' the show regularly finishes
in the Nielsen top 20 and has become what Hackel, 51, a veteran
sitcom writer and producer, a bit nervously calls a ``stealth''
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS has to be very happy with it,'' says Tim Spengler,
executive vice president in charge of national broadcasting for
Western International Media, a Los Angeles media management
company. ``It drops off only one share point from its hit lead-in,
which in this day and age is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   What the ``Becker'' audience seems to be responding to is
Danson's portrayal of a man who, for pure irascibility, recalls
bygone characters like ``Taxi's'' noisome dispatcher Louie De Palma
and Bill Bittinger, the scabrous talk show host of NBC's
short-lived ``Buffalo Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in his Paramount Studios office, Hackel
described Becker this way: ``He has clear attitudes about things.
You may not agree with them, I may not agree with them, but when he
speaks, everybody listens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is an unhappy person, but not all the time. I think
he is a very frustrated person, and sometimes depressed. I think he
is also one of those guys who sometimes thinks the rules are for
everyone else besides him. He is not a consistent character, and he
is often dead wrong. But by being consistent and wrong, I contend
that he is the most human character I've ever written.''
</P>
<P>
   To be precise, John Becker is a twice-divorced general
practitioner with a lower- and lower-middle-class Bronx practice,
and _ astounding for a sitcom character _ a car and an apartment
considerably junkier and dingier, respectively, then the ones he
would probably own and inhabit in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Becker usually opens each episode with one of his trademark
jeremiads against some form of societal absurdity or injustice,
real or imagined.
</P>
<P>
   For example: ``Parents are too permissive. Today, you let the
kid cry; 10 years from now, he's running a chain of crooked
lemonade stands. Next thing you know, he's got a gun in my back at
an ATM.'' Or: ``The only people dumber than talk radio listeners
are talk radio callers. It's an entire audience made up of the
infirm, the unemployed and the insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker's outbursts are usually met with scorn or censure by the
supporting characters, including Margaret (Hattie Winston), his
efficient nurse and office manager; Linda (Shawnee Smith), the
dingbat receptionist; Reggie (Terry Farrell), the
model-turned-hash-slinger with whom he has a warily platonic
relationship, and Jake (Alex Desert), a blind newsstand operator
with whom he has the closest thing to a male friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The plots are basically extensions of Becker's peevish tics and
obsessions. In one episode he insists on his right to call an
Asian-American motorist he has collided with a bad driver. In
another, after being shot during a robbery, he's as rude to the
female emergency physician treating him as he normally is to his
own patients; in another he deals with a woman excessively grateful
to him for saving her life (``Jesus sent you to me!'') as if she
were a crazed stalker.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, Becker's basic decency is reluctantly
revealed. In the episodes above he (1) eventually convinces
everybody that he was simply venting his spleen at bad drivers in
general, (2) starts an awkward, prickly love affair with the E.R.
doctor and (3) discovers to his embarrassment that the grateful
woman is a Roman Catholic nun in mufti.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, too often to be accidental, Becker and his
colleagues discuss a matter not often dwelt upon in sitcoms: the
presence or absence of a Supreme Being.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do debate God's existence,'' says Hackel. ``The existence
of a sort of greater good, of an arbiter of right or wrong.'' The
main combatants are Margaret, a devout Christian who insists that
Becker and his healing powers are a gift from God, and Becker, who
protests shrilly that nobody or nothing could be at the helm of
such a messed-up world.
</P>
<P>
   In one episode, a supposedly psychotic shoe salesman (played by
the comedian Steven Wright) comes to Becker's examination room and
says he often hears the voice of God _ who goes by the name Larry.
Becker refers the patient to a psychiatrist, who silences the voice
with drugs, but in the end the salesman confesses to Becker that he
has stopped taking his medication, because he misses Larry's
advice.
</P>
<P>
   In another episode, Becker angrily shakes his fist at the sky
(for reasons too complex to recount here) and declares that
``they'' are out to get him. ``That's interesting,'' Margaret says
acidly. ``You're being persecuted by a God you don't believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackel admits readily that a character as abrasive and unlikable
as Becker is almost by definition unsuitable as a sitcom
figurehead. And that only Danson's skills as an actor _ plus the
reservoir of audience good will he built up playing Sam Malone, the
charming ladies' man of ``Cheers'' _ made ``Becker'' a viable
comedic vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee at a West Los Angeles restaurant, Danson agrees with
the second part of that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baggage I bring to anything new after 11 years of `Cheers'
is that Ted is a nice guy,'' he says. ``I think that there is a
comfort zone I bring to the part that allowed me a bit more time to
establish this character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Malone and Becker have something in common also,'' he
adds. ``Both are lonely men, very lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Danson, now 51, says he is pleasantly surprised to be able to
shake off old typecasting and establish a new sitcom character,
especially after ``Ink,'' the much hyped and reworked CBS project
in which he played a swaggering newspaper columnist still in love
with his ex-wife and editor (his real-life wife, Mary Steenburgen).
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory about that one,'' says Danson, ``is that if you're
not a stand-up comedian _ a Cosby or a Seinfeld _ it's a mistake to
hire people to find your comedic voice, which is what happened.
What we are is actors, and what we need to do is find somebody
else's passionate self-expression and then ask very nicely if we
can be in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Danson adds that after the demise of ``Ink'' (after one season)
he was extremely pessimistic about ever returning to sitcoms. ``We
still totally believe in him as a TV star,'' says Leslie Moonves,
president of CBS Television, ``but after `Ink' went off we'd sent
him a number of things that he rejected. There was a real chance he
wouldn't be coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Hackel, after stints on shows like ``Webster'' and
``Wings'' and as a consultant on ``Frasier,'' decided to take a
chance and develop a sitcom about a spokesman for political
incorrectness. It eventually became ``Becker.''
</P>
<P>
   Danson (and Ms. Steenburgen, he adds) saw the role as an
interesting challenge for him. CBS planned to introduce the show in
January 1999 but rushed it onto the air in November 1998 in place
of the quickly canceled ``Brian Benben Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lee of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Becker'' quietly
prospered and, according to Moonves, is a cinch for renewal. As for
Danson, he notes with some satisfaction that although he is still
usually hailed on the street with cries of ``Sam Malone!'' he has
heard a ``Becker!'' or two recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I like,'' he says, ``is that I play my real
age.'' But that's not all he has in common with Becker, Danson
admits. In the last few years, he says, he has ``become a little
bit more judgmental.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the little stuff I have opinions on, about nearly
everything,'' he explains, but not about the big issues. ``And you
can ask my fellow actors, you can ask my wife, it flips across my
face with less charm the older I get.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIMYKANIYE, Russia _ Last week, it was the Islamic rebels who
held this rustic settlement, only two and a half miles from the
outskirts of Grozny, the Chechen capital. Their fortified trenches,
the deepest Russian soldiers have seen here, edged the fields and
stretched along the railroad tracks leading from the city.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russian troops rushed to encircle Grozny, the outnumbered
rebels were routed in a furious 10-hour firefight. Russian gunships
and artillery pounded the trenches, illumined by countless flares
and backed by armored combat vehicles and tanks, until the
surviving Chechens fled to Grozny through a covering fog.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders boast about their use of maneuver and
deception. But the most enduring impression from a three-day visit
to Chechnya was of massive firepower. It was as if Gen. Colin
Powell's doctrine of overwhelming force as the key to victory, used
so efficiently in the U.S.-led war against Iraq, had been
transferred to the Caucasus and applied Russian-style.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 100,000 heavily equipped Russian troops
in Chechnya, more than twice the number that Moscow used in the
1994-1996 war against the rebel province. In contrast, the Islamic
rebels have an estimated 6,000 fighters in Grozny and perhaps an
equal number of militants in southern Chechnya, according to
Russian estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The huge scale of the Russian operation is apparent on the Terek
Ridge, the high ground just north of Grozny, which has become a
stronghold for Russian armor and artillery. And it is evident in
the fields to the south, which are pockmarked with craters.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the town of Mozdok, just northwest of Chechnya, do
not have to look out their windows to see if the skies are clear.
They can tell from the roar of Russian warplanes, as they take off
on their bombing missions.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of Russia's generals, military force is a blunt and
often indiscriminate weapon, but it is clear they are wielding a
sledgehammer. While Western critics complain that the artillery and
air strikes have unnecessarily harmed civilians, they have been an
important part of the Russian military's strategy to limit its
casualties and maintain support at home.
</P>
<P>
   Any war, of course, involves uncertainties. Foreign
correspondents are rarely allowed to places like Primykaniye, and
it has to be presumed that the Russians do not fly in journalists
to document their mistakes or setbacks. Some Russian soldiers in
Chechnya have reported heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that the Russian military decided from the
outset that this would be a very different type of war from the
first, ill-fated campaign in Chechnya. In that conflict, Russian
troops raced into the center of Grozny at the outset and took
tremendous losses.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Russian commanders have vowed not to ``storm'' the
city. But that does not mean they will not occupy the city. It
means they hope to bombard the rebels into surrendering, and may
advance if they do not _ but only after laying siege to the city
and laying down a withering curtain of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are commanded to seize it, we will,'' said Lt. Gen.
Vladimir Bulgakov. ``If we are told to wait until the surrender, we
can wait as long as is necessary. There is no way for the militants
to leave.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Primykaniye is a rural settlement, and its capture was part of
the Russian campaign to encircle Grozny. Bearing the scars of the
recent fight, Primykaniye's fields are tattooed with the tread
marks of Russian armor.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad track that runs through here was peeled back as if
the rails were rubber so that Russian armor could freely pass. One
corner of the local brick mosque has been blown away.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the nearby village of Tsentora-Yurt stands
untouched, a reward, say Russian officials, to those who refused to
aid the rebels and cooperated with the Russian army.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Primykaniye began Thursday after rebels from the
militants' 57th regiment fled Argun, a town about six miles east of
Grozny and the scene of a ferocious Russian assault.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels took up positions in an elaborate maze of fortified
trenches and tunnels, which included a 12-foot-deep bomb shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with machine guns, mortars and anti-tank grenades, their
goal was to bloody the Russian troops and prevent them from
encircling the Chechen capital. It is not known how many of them
there were; the Russians say there were between 100 and 150
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians had several advantages. With two companies of
motorized infantry, they had 200 men, giving then a numerical edge.
The Russians were equipped with tanks, armored combat vehicles,
artillery and attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also took advantage of the terrain. There were no
basements and alleys for the rebels to hide in, as in Grozny, and
there was plenty of room for the Russian army to maneuver and bring
the full weight of its combined arms to bear.
</P>
<P>
   After Russian scouts detected the rebel trenches, Maj. Andrei
Morozov, the 32-year-old battalion commander, divided his force in
two. One company moved forward as if it were going to attack
straight into the enemy lines, hoping to draw enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   When the rebels started shooting, the Russians observed their
positions and unleashed helicopter gunships and artillery against
them. The field near the trenches is still festooned with the red
and white parachutes of flares, which the Russian solders fired
into the night sky to light up the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Then the second company flanked the Chechens from the left. By
midnight, the Russians had seized the first line of trenches.
Fearful of being cut off, the rebel force took advantage of a thick
fog to flee to Grozny and live to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians claimed they killed 50 rebels with no loses of
their own, but it was impossible to verify this. No rebels were
captured, and the Russians said they had already buried the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgakov credited the victory to ``deception and maneuver.'' As
he spoke, the bombardment began again in the Chechen capital,
testifying to the military's raw might. As Russian warplanes
completed their bombing runs pyres of smoke swirled high over the
Grozny skies.

MODERNIST TO LEAD SALZBURG FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mg) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The celebrated Salzburg Festival, which was thrown into
turmoil this summer when Austria's president, Thomas Klestil, led a
conservative attack on its eclectic programming, has named Peter
Ruzicka, 51, a German conductor and composer, as artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   He will succeed Gerard Mortier, who will step down in September
2001 after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In picking Ruzicka after a nine-month search, the festival's
board has refused to bow to pressure to appoint a traditionalist as
director. Rather, with the presidency of the festival already
occupied by a conservative, Helga Rabl-Stadler, music experts said
the board had opted for someone who would probably continue
Mortier's policy of encouraging both contemporary music and
contemporary interpretation of the classical repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Ruzicka, who is artistic director of the Munich Biennial for New
Music Theater and artistic adviser to the Royal Concertgebouw
Orchestra in Amsterdam, has made his name as a manager and a
musician in several significant positions in Germany, and as
artistic director of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra and of the
Hamburg State Opera and the Hamburg State Philharmonic Orchestra.
He has not yet indicated his plans for his first Salzburg season in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Mortier, artistic director of the Theatre de la Monnaie in
Brussels before accepting the Salzburg post long held by Herbert
von Karajan, quickly upset traditionalists by introducing 20th
century composers as well as avant-garde theater directors.
Opposition to what the festival called the reform era surfaced
after Mortier announced in March that he would not seek a third
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Salzburg last summer, Klestil, whose position as
Austria's president is largely ceremonial, called for a return to
the ideals of the festival's founder in 1920, composer Hugo von
Hofmannsthal.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil described Mortier's approach as ``confrontation instead
of harmony, provocation instead of agreement, spectacle instead of
fidelity to the work, `demolition' drama instead of humanistic,
spiritually elevating theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortier responded with a letter to Klestil and, when that went
unanswered, counterattacked in interviews, noting that the
president's speech was a reflection of the state of culture in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is being asked for here is the kind of art that lies, and
alongside that, an attempt to limit Austria to a small fraction of
itself,'' Mortier said in one interview. ``It is as if Alban Berg
were not precisely as Austrian as Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   For a festival with Mozart as its spiritual father, Mortier's
definition of its program policy gives a sense of how priorities
have changed. It reads, ``The classical heritage should be conveyed
through a contemporary idiom, for today's audiences; the great
works of the 20th century are to be presented in a valid form;
ample space is accorded to contemporary works.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year's festival, which runs from July 23 through Aug. 31,
will include three Mozart operas, operas by Berlioz, Offenbach,
Gluck and Wagner, and the world premiere of ``Love From Afar,'' an
opera by the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho.

PITINO HAS HIGH PRAISE FOR NUGGETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Celtics coach Rick Pitino is expecting a difficult test
against Denver Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are extremely athletic, the most athletic team we will
have faced all season,'' Pitino said Tuesday. ``They are unique
because they have so many 3-point shooters. They shoot it at the
(center position) and we are not used to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets took a 94-77 win at Philadelphia Monday as Nick Van
Exel scored 34 points, including 19 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they are playing good basketball,'' Pitino said.
``Van Exel is so good he can take over a game, much as he did
against Philly in the fourth quarter. Defensively, they are like us
_ young, aggressive. They are the No. 1 shot-blocking team in the
league (8.29 per game) and you've got to play smart offensively to
exploit their weaknesses. If not, they will block your shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great talent and they are tough-minded. Plus, they
make their free throws. It sounds simplistic, but a lot of the time
it comes down to foul shooting, and if it does, they are going to
make them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screen test
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce is anticipating a matchup against former teammate
Ron Mercer. ``He's having a good year and I wish him the best of
luck,'' Pierce said. ``It is going to be a lot of fun playing
against him. But we are not taking each other lightly. It is going
to be a tough assignment and I'm up for the challenge. His strength
is coming off screens, and if I can keep him from doing that, I'll
have a good night. If I can talk to him during the game and
distract him, good. But he never talked much in practice.''. . .
Boston's Eric Williams, a former Nugget, said, ``I have no grudges
about being traded. I still have friends in the organization. I
understand the situation. I was younger when I got traded the first
time and my idea then was different. I thought it was guys who
weren't producing or playing up to their ability who were the ones
who were traded. Now, I know that is not always what happens. I am
just going to go out and try to win the game.''. . . Walter
McCarty, recovering from a nine-stitch cut in his chin suffered
during a 77-74 loss at Philadelphia Saturday, participated in
Tuesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's my line?
</P>
<P>
   Before Dan Issel returned to coach the Nuggets this season, he
spent time as a sports-talk radio personality. One of the most
memorable lines from his media career came when he referred to Tony
Battie as ``El Busto,'' meaning that the Nuggets' No. 5 overall
pick in the 1997 draft couldn't play. ``I was given the credit _ or
blame _ for saying that,'' Issel said, ``but it's not really my
line. I was quoting one of our (media) guys, who called him that.
Unfortunately, the way it goes now is that I said it.'' Issel
paused and said with a laugh, ``But, hey. I was on talk radio. You
know those guys don't have any credibility.'' Battie averaged 8.4
points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1 blocked shot his first season. He
wasn't the only high pick of the '97 draft traded after one year.
The players selected in Spots 3 through 6 are no longer with the
teams that drafted them.

 &HT;    Gordon sacks crew chief Whitesell
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That feel-good feeling between driver Jeff Gordon and
crew chief Brian Whitesell took a surprising turn on Tuesday.
Whitesell was replaced by Petty Enterprises' Robbie Loomis.
</P>
<P>
   Loomis, crew chief for the No. 43 car and John Andretti for nine
years, had spent all of his 14-year NASCAR career working for Petty
Enterprises. He had turned down numerous job offers during the
years because of loyalty to the Petty family.
</P>
<P>
   But Loomis finally changed his mind when given the chance to
work with a perennial Winston Cup contender.
</P>
<P>
   Whitesell, who appeared to be on the way to a lengthy working
relationship with Gordon as crew chief, was moved to the position
of team manager. He was Gordon's hand-picked successor when
long-time crew chief Ray Evernham resigned in October to lead
Dodge's return to Winston Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won his first two races at Martinsville and Charlotte
after Evernham's departure. But the honeymoon ended quickly after
Gordon failed to finish higher than 10th in the final five races,
including a disastrous 38th in the season-ender at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Whitesell became a prime target for criticism from the driver's
die-hard fans, who claimed that Evernham already had the car setups
in place for Martinsville and Charlotte before leaving Hendrick.
Crew chiefs normally complete basic preparations at least two races
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also lost five members of his ``Rainbow Warriors'' pit
crew, who signed contracts to work for Robert Yates Racing this
season without notifying Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has been dedicating most of the off-season to structuring
a new pit crew from outside candidates and those in the Hendrick
organization. ``I'm really excited to have someone with such great
talent and experience join our team,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the Winston Cup garage knows (Robbie's)
capabilities. His expertise and racing savvy will add a great deal
of depth to our team. And he and Brian will make a great
combination.''

 By LAURA INGRAHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    During the 1980s the Republican Party won three consecutive
elections, in part by convincing the public that Carter, Mondale
and Dukakis were ``tax and spend'' liberals ready to blow the
taxpayers' money on ineffective social programs.
 &HT;    And with the next presidential election only 11 months away,
that old charge is flying again. But this time it's the Democratic
frontrunner who is playing the deficit hawk: In a recent attack on
rival Bill Bradley's health-care plan, Vice President Al Gore
sounded more like Reagan than like Roosevelt.
 &HT;    After feeling Bradley breathing down his neck in New Hampshire
earlier this fall, Gore has seen his popularity rise again after he
launched an aggressive, no-prisoners assault on his opponent. So
last week, when Bradley told The Washington Post that he wouldn't
rule out a tax increase to expand health-care coverage to millions
who are uninsured, Gore pounced.
 &HT;    ``Look, we have the largest surplus in the history of the United
States,'' he told reporters. ``This is not the time to be talking
about tax increases.''
 &HT;    Gore even sidestepped a question about whether there is any
current domestic priority he feels strongly enough about to raise
taxes.
 &HT;    What's going on here? Al Gore, a fiscal conservative?
 &HT;    Not quite. But it's more evidence of how profoundly the
conservative economic message has affected the American political
debate, and how well Al Gore has learned from his boss.
 &HT;    Despite his left-leaning, ``Earth in the Balance'' proclivities,
Gore apparently realizes that none of that nonsense resonates
beyond the Ivy League elites who still think that the government
should grow, not shrink.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton sailed into office pledging a new, centrist
Democratic agenda, then turned his back on that with Hillary's
big-government health-care reform. The results were disastrous, and
in no time at all the president was pushing for more money for the
Pentagon and proposing a tax-reduction package of his own, albeit a
minuscule one.
 &HT;    Sure, his State of the Union pronouncement that ``the era of big
government is over'' may have been just another clever White House
spin, but it helped condition the public against those that would
take the country the other way.
 &HT;    Gore may be trying to keep Clinton's character at arm's length,
but he desperately hopes that some of the president's campaign
savvy has rubbed off on him. Hence his effort to use Bradley's
``maybe-I'll-tax'' slipup to position himself as the pragmatic
Democratic choice.
 &HT;    ``I'm talking about tax cuts, Sen. Bradley is talking about tax
increases,'' Gore said.
 &HT;    Maybe George W. Bush or John McCain can borrow some of Gore's
best anti-Bradley lines if Gore implodes and Bradley actually gets
the nomination.
 &HT;    Ever vowing to stay out of a dogfight with Gore, Bradley was
forced to backpedal after the vice president's sharp attacks. A
Bradley spokesman insisted that the candidate was speaking only
hypothetically, and wasn't really for tax increases. But the damage
had already been done.
 &HT;    For the past six years, editorial pages have regularly predicted
that the ``far right'' or ``Christian right'' of the Republican
Party would cause the GOP to crash and burn. The public simply
isn't that socially conservative, the argument goes.
 &HT;    Speaker Newt Gingrich's abrupt departure from the House this
year, like Congress' wobbly popularity, suggests that those
prognosticators had a point. America doesn't want a crusade,
whether led by self-proclaimed Republican ``revolutionaries'' or by
self-righteous Democrats.
 &HT;    Bill Bradley doesn't understand this. He speaks of the need for
candor in politics as he earnestly outlines his crusade for
national health-care insurance.
 &HT;    ``This is about just going out and saying who you are and what
you believe,'' he told campaign workers recently, ``and maybe you
can win by doing that.''
 &HT;    Not if recent history is any guide. While America may not be
salivating for a Forbes-style tax cut, neither is it in the mood
for a tax increase, even one that addresses a growing domestic
concern. Democrats who want to dabble in new, large-scale
government spending are in a fiscal box. Gore is using it to his
political benefit, while Bradley is just, well, cornered.
 &HT;    Today's Democrats are a far cry from the struggling liberals of
the 1980s. Thanks to President Clinton, they've shed their
pacifist, anti-military, anti-free-market, pro-big-government
reputation. Reagan-era Democrats would have been openly calling for
increased federal oversight of the Internet, while this
administration has been wary of stepping on the toes of the
economy, which has won Al Gore some key supporters in Silicon
Valley.
 &HT;    Of course Bradley isn't alone in thinking that liberal crusades
can work nationally. We saw successful crusades last week in
Seattle, with unions and environmentalists teaming up to disrupt
the administration's efforts at global-trade talks. Positioning
themselves against efforts to open world markets, they are
yesterday's left.
 &HT;    But Gore has to do more than simply paint Bradley as a knee-jerk
liberal if he wants to take the baton from his old pal Bill. He
himself must resist what still comes naturally _ proposing
government solutions and government controls on the scale demanded
by the old left.

NORTH KOREAN DIPLOMAT RAILS AGAINST NONEXISTENT `WALL OF
DIVISION'  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A North Korean diplomat used a rare news conference
here on Tuesday to rail against a nonexistent 150-mile-long
concrete ``wall of division'' that the South Koreans supposedly
erected 20 years ago across the buffer zone between North and
South.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat, Chu Chang Jun, is North Korea's longtime
ambassador to China, one of his country's few allies. He demanded
the ``immediate dismantling of the cursed reinforced concrete wall
that artificially bisects the nation that had lived in harmony
generation after generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ``never to be pardoned criminal act,'' the wall was erected
across the peninsula 20 years ago this Dec. 29, Chu said. It is ``a
huge structure,'' he said, 16 to 26 feet tall and 33 to 62 feet
wide at the base. Far from a defensive rampart, it is a ``northward
invasion bridgehead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wall exists only in North Korean propaganda, according to
South Korean and American diplomats and others who have visited the
area. But with a hostile North Korea keeping large numbers of
troops and tanks near the border, the South Koreans, aided by the
United States, have strewn large concrete tank barriers and sentry
stations as well as fences and minefields along their side of the
tense demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter Korean War of 1950 to 1953 ended with a truce but no
treaty, and the buffer zone separating the peninsula has been
volatile ever since.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Chu gave an implacable summary of North
Korean views on relations with the South and its sponsor, the
United States. He spoke beneath large pictures of the late North
Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, and his son, the current leader, Kim
Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   Chu's comments seemed out of step with diplomatic developments,
making the news conference seem even odder. Reeling from years of
economic collapse and famine, North Korea seems to be opening its
doors a crack in a quest for more economic aid, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea and Japan are seriously discussing a restoration of
diplomatic relations. The United States lifted many trade
restrictions after North Korea agreed not to carry out a second
test of a long-range missile, and talks on improving ties have
proceeded fitfully.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, has pursued a ``sunshine
policy'' of broader economic and cultural contacts with North
Korea, and the North has recently allowed more exchanges. Chu said,
``the sunshine policy brings confrontation instead of
reconciliation,'' and called it ``very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Chu also denied reports _ verified by many journalists and
diplomats _ that tens of thousands of North Koreans had crossed the
border into China to escape famine and hardship. ``There have been
no illegal border crossings,'' he said.

WASHINGTON STATE'S TOUGH TANKER SAFETY RULES ARGUED IN SUPREME
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Washington state's tough safety rules for oil
tankers navigating Puget Sound came under attack at the Supreme
Court Tuesday from an odd alliance of tanker owners and the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The state enacted the rules in 1994 in an effort to prevent a
disaster like the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989, which caused
environmental damage in Alaska. Among the regulations at stake are
requirements that crew members be drug- and alcohol-free, that an
extra pilot be on board during bad weather, and that the officers
and deckhands speak a common language.
</P>
<P>
   But the oil industry and the Clinton administration argued that
the state has no right to regulate oil tankers plying local waters
because they are already regulated under a federal law called the
Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Also, they argued, various international
treaties require uniform criteria for oil tanker operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to decide by next summer whether
to uphold or overturn the state regulations, which previously were
upheld by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington and by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The justices gave little indication of how they might rule.
Several, including Justices Stephen Breyer, Anthony Kennedy, David
Souter and John Paul Stevens, expressed consternation at the
reasoning the Appeals Court used in upholding the state law, but
they did not express an opinion about the result.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the justices, particularly Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, expressed concern about
whether federal regulators could adequately address the
peculiarities of local waters.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist referred to a ``very strong local interest'' in a
requirement such as ``in heavy fog in Seattle harbor you have to
have a tug.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, would be loathe to read some general federal
statute as preempting something like that,'' Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's arguments were from a consolidation of two lawsuits,
United States vs. Gov. Gary Locke and International Association of
Independent Tanker Owners vs. Gov. Gary Locke. The dispute has
drawn broad attention because of its import for environmental
protection and for states rights.
</P>
<P>
   Among those filing briefs in support of the state are seven
Washington counties that border on Puget Sound, 21 states and
territories, seven fishing groups from around the country, a
variety of environmental organizations, and a citizen's group from
Prince William Sound, Alaska, where the Exxon Valdez ran aground.
</P>
<P>
   The tanker industry and the federal government have won support
from 15 foreign governments and a variety of shipping associations
and business groups. Those groups are largely concerned with
preventing their members from having to comply with different
regulations in different states, which they say would be confusing
and potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The debate inside the courtroom featured an arcane discussion of
the circumstances under which states can regulate merchant vessels
that are already regulated by the Coast Guard under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Benner, an attorney for the tanker owners, said that
throughout American history it has been the job of the federal
government to regulate merchant shipping. He said that the state's
regulations are ``an intrusion by state government into an area
exclusively regulated by the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   David Frederick, the assistant to the solicitor general at the
Department of Justice, warned that state regulations would
``eviscerate thousands of pages of international treaty law'' and
that ``It would greatly upset uniformity if each of the 23 coastal
states could pick and choose which requirements it wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick said that state officials are ``proposing to
imprison'' tanker operators for failure to comply with state rules.
(State officials say that during the five years the rules have been
in effect, no one has been imprisoned, and few tanker operators
have even been cited for a violation.)
</P>
<P>
   Washington state was represented by William Collins, a senior
assistant attorney general, who argued that the state is entitled
to enact regulations that complement, and do not contradict,
federal tanker rules. He called state regulators ``a second set of
eyes on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the state's legal brief, the waters of Washington
state are more difficult to navigate than those in Prince William
Sound because of persistent fog, heavy fishing traffic and narrow
waterways. State officials argue that an oil spill could be
devastating to fish and wildlife and to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, the sides squared off over the
environmental issues. Jeffrey Needle, an attorney for
environmentalists, blasted President Clinton for allowing his
Justice Department to argue against Washington state regulators
just a week after extolling the importance of the environment in a
speech before the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of Washington's environment should not be
sacrificed in the name of international trade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the state lawyer, said that with five oil refineries in
Washington state, it is important that state officials be able to
protect the environment and the economy from the damage of an oil
spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard is a hardworking organization, but they have
limited resources,'' Collins said. ``In the state of Washington,
we've stepped up to the plate and dedicated some of our resources
to try to protect our own waters. If the court rules against us,
then ... that choice will be taken away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benner, the industry lawyer, said tanker owners want to be
environmentally responsible but are entitled to a uniform set of
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trade all over the world, and we don't want to have safety
procedures that vary from place to place and locale to locale,''
Benner said. ``We're very sure we're on the environmental high
ground here. There's an extensive federal system in place ... and
if you start tinkering with it around the edges ... these vessels
are put in harm's way.''

   Price returns to Tech as member of coaching team
</P>
<P>
   By J.C. Clemons
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Price left the glitz and glamour of an NBA
playing career and a seven-figure salary. Price swapped them to
become an assistant college basketball coach whose paycheck only
approaches six figures.
</P>
<P>
   But don't cry for Price.
</P>
<P>
   For the former NBA player of the year turned No. 3 Georgia Tech
assistant, the price of the trade is just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was the right time to call it a career,'' said
Price, 35, who after 13 NBA season retired a year ago before the
1999 season. ``Of course, I miss playing a little bit, but my body
tells me every day it was the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of other factors, too, especially my family
situation. I played for three different teams the last three years,
and we were tired of moving around.''
</P>
<P>
   Price will be on the bench in Athens tonight when Tech (3-1)
plays its annual grudge match against Georgia (3-3), and nobody is
happier with his move to the sidelines _ besides Yellow Jackets
coach Bobby Cremins _ than his wife.
</P>
<P>
   With four children under the age of 10, family matters played a
major factor in their return to campus life.
</P>
<P>
   Five-star hotels ? Gone. Limousine rides to NBA All-Star-Game
functions? A thing of the past. The roar of the crowd? No more.
</P>
<P>
   In their place comes bedtime stories read by dad, dinner
together most nights and school field trips and church gatherings.
All as a family, and the Prices are eating it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's really great,'' Laura Marbut Price said. ``We're
loving it because we just really needed time for family. It so
great for the kids. It's liking having a really normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefits we have for the family far outweigh the joy we
had watching him play. The lifestyle that went along with playing
in the NBA, I don't miss that at all. It sounds selfish, but it's
selfish for all the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there was a bit of altruism involved as well.
</P>
<P>
   Price was one the first top recruit Cremins landed after
arriving at Tech in 1981-82 from Appalachian State. After Tech
struggled to a 10-16 finish in Cremins' first season, Price arrived
from Enid, Okla., and fortunes turned.
</P>
<P>
   Tech went 13-15 in '83, but Price averaged 20.3 points. More
importantly, he was named ACC rookie of the year, an honor seven
other Jackets would achieve as Cremins' recruiting prowess grew.
</P>
<P>
   In '84, Tech reached the NIT, and Cremins first NCAA Tournament
appearance came the next season. That began a string of nine
consecutive NCAA berths, including a Final Four march in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the Jackets have made the NCAA field just once,
1996, in the past six seasons. Having returned to Atlanta, it was
hard for Price to witness the decline of the once-proud program.
And even tougher, the criticism directed at Cremins, the man who
built it.
</P>
<P>
   Price who spent his first year of retirement volunteering as an
assistant to Duluth High coach Joe Marelle, who was battling
cancer. But when vacancies became available after last season's
15-16 finish, he signed on with Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark did it for me, and for Georgia Tech,'' Cremins says.
``It's worked out well. Everybody respects him. He has such a great
presence and is such a wonderful person (that) players respond to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, who accepted a non-recruiting position to stay close to
home, focuses mainly on player development and already is producing
results. Seemingly overnight, point guard Tony Akins has been
transformed from shaky freshman -- 32 percent field-goal shooting,
148-138 assists to turnovers -- to dependable veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible to be able to work with a great NBA point
guard like Mark Price,'' says Akins, who is averaging 13.6 points
and 6.0 assists, is making 41.4 percent of three-pointers and is
operatging with a 2.3-1 assists-to-turnover ratio. ``When he says
something, you just know he knows what he's talking about. ... You
listen and take it to heart because he's done it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, who made an NBA record 90.4 percent of his career
free-throw attempts, has played shot doctor for the Yellow Jackets,
especially forward Alvin Jones. A career 56 percent free-throw
shooter entering the season, Jones has made 30 of 44 (68.2
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Good shooting, Price says, is a result of form -- and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is teaching, a lot of it is mental approach,''
Price said. ``But it's a process that doesn't happen overnight.
Once you get a guy with better technique, then he has to go out and
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   With such sudden success, could a head-coaching shot be in
Price's future? His father, Denny, coached at the high school,
college and pro levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the type of guy who focuses on what I'm doing
right now,'' he said. ``I have no master plan.''
</P>
<P>

HARVARD SUES MAN SELLING DOMAIN NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just a week after the federal government outlawed
trademark ``cyberpiracy,'' Harvard University is using the new law
to sue a Boston man who is trying to reap a small fortune by
selling Harvard the Internet rights to its own name.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard filed a civil suit Monday in US District Court in Boston
alleging that Michael Rhys and Michael Douglas -- believed to be
the same person -- and the company Web-Pro, violated trademark
infringement and cyberpiracy laws by registering 65 Internet domain
names incorporating the words Harvard and Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   After paying $70 to register each name with Network Solutions,
Web-Pro's web site listed ``HarvardYardSale.com'' as a client and
offered to sell domain names such as harvard-law school.com,
virtualharvard.com, and harvardgraduateschool.com for a minimum of
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other names, such as harvarddivinity.com, were offered for a
minimum of $2,000. In all, the lowest bids being asked for all the
names totals about $325,000.
</P>
<P>
   Domain name selling has become big business on the Internet.
Just last month, the Los Angeles-based Ecompanies paid a Houston
entrepreneur a record $7.5 millon for rights to the domain name
business.com.
</P>
<P>
   The web site GreatDomains.com auctions domain names. While it
lists the average price at $32,338, some names are being offered at
staggering prices: $10 million for America.com; $2 million for
Celebrities.com and $1 million for Houses.com.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to the college last October that was attached to
the lawsuit, Rhys wrote, ``I will soon be offering many Harvard
related domains for sale to the general public. I would like to
offer the first right of refusal to Harvard itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robert B. Donin, general counsel for Harvard
University, said, ``I think this is pretty brazen. We want to make
it clear that we intend to vigorously pursue cybersquatters and
defend Harvard's trademark.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University, established in 1636, first trademarked its
name in 1827 and has used the Radcliffe name in interstate commerce
since 1879, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   So-called cybersquatters, who have rushed to buy Web addresses
to sell them later at a profit, were targeted in the
Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act that was enacted Nov.
29 on the heels of fierce lobbying by Hollywood film stars who
complained loudly about web sites bearing their names that provided
links to pornographic and gossip sites.
</P>
<P>
   Political figures have also been affected. Hillary Rodham
Clinton paid $6,000 earlier this year to buy hillary2000.com from a
cybersquatter who had registered the domain name.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, part of an omnibus bill dealing with intellectual
property rights, allows trademark owners to recover statutory
damages ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 after proving their
trademarked name was registered by someone wanting to sell it back
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Attorney Jerome Gilson, who also represents Harvard
University, said the suit is among the first in the country filed
under the new law, but the school isn't seeking any money from Rhys
or Web-Pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want him to stop doing what he's doing,'' said Gilson,
adding that Harvard's attorneys sent Rhys a cease and desist order
but never heard back from him.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys, 35, who also owns domain names umassboston.com,
umassmedical.com and the-mass-media.com, didn't return telephone
calls or emails from the Globe Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Donin said Web-Pro's use of Harvard's name on the Internet is
``very damaging to the university's reputation and it can also be
very confusing to the public, which may believe that we are
involved in this activity or that we have somehow licensed or
sanctioned this activity.''

YAHOO LEAP HELPS DRIVE NASDAQ TO 4TH STRAIGHT RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Techno-mania continued in the stock market Tuesday as
the Nasdaq composite index rose to a fourth consecutive record,
partly because of a huge jump in the price of shares of Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   But other indexes struggled, and ended lower. Trading volume was
heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a second big drop in the price of Coca-Cola, the Dow
Jones industrial average slumped 118.36 points, or 1.05 percent, to
11,106.65. A number of Wall Street analysts downgraded Coke's stock
Tuesday, a day after the beverage giant's chairman and chief
executive said he would resign his positions in April, an
announcement that stunned the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Coke closed at 60, down 4. Since M. Douglas Ivester
said he was leaving the company, the stock has lost 7 percent of
its market value.
</P>
<P>
   A bad day for drug stocks contributed to a slide in the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which closed at 1,409.17, down 14.16
points, or 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the performance of the Dow and S&AMP;P was
eclipsed by continued rapid demand for the technology shares that
dominate the Nasdaq composite index. Issues like Cisco Systems,
Ciena and Yahoo pushed the Nasdaq composite index up 40.91 points,
or 1.15 percent, to 3,586.92.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.09 billion shares,
and more than 1.5 billion shares traded on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the session was dominated by Yahoo, the Internet
media company that at the close of trading became part of the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   The imminent addition of Yahoo to the index prompted mutual
funds that mimic the composition of the S&AMP;P to sell shares of the
499 other companies to make room for Yahoo. Yahoo will have a far
bigger weighting than the company it is replacing, Laidlaw Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's shares have been rising steadily since Nov. 30, when the
S&AMP;P said Yahoo was going in its index. But analysts were stunned by
what happened yesterday: Yahoo's shares closed at 348, up 67 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a week almost $42 billion in Yahoo's market capitalization
has been created out of thin air,'' said William Meehan, chief
market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``The only news has been that
the stock is being added to the S&AMP;P index.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks that are added to a widely-used index like the S&AMP;P
generally rise after the decision is made to put them in. But the
54 percent gain in Yahoo's shares in the last week is a seismic
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, stocks back off about three percent after the
change in the index is made,'' Meehan said. ``Given the run-up in
Yahoo's shares we have seen in the last week, I suspect that in
this case it might be a little bit more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Herrman, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed in
Overland Park, Kan., which has some $27 billion under management,
called the run-up in Yahoo's stock ``unbelievable.'' But in the
next breath he added that for a while yet technology shares are
likely to appreciate further.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a performance basis, everybody is forced to put more money
into technology,'' he said. ``Right now, technology is nearly 30
percent of the S&AMP;P 500 and people are talking about it going to 40
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this vision of the Nasdaq as a diver that is about to
jack-knife,'' he added. ``But I don't think we will visit that
issue until sometime next year.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for big drug stocks and health company issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 3 1/2, to 66 11/16. Eli Lilly dropped
by 3, to 66 1/2. And Johnson &AMP; Johnson slumped 3 7/16, to 93 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses were mild compared to the experience of Visx Inc.

MOSCOW EASES DEMAND THAT CIVILIANS LEAVE CHECHEN CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ The Russian government on Tuesday backed away
from an ultimatum that civilians leave the Chechen capital of
Grozny by Saturday or face a deadly bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Russian warplanes dropped thousands of leaflets over Grozny in
recent days, urging residents to use any means possible to escape
the city before Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The demand spurred alarms in Western capitals that thousands of
Chechnya's civilians could be killed or injured. President Clinton
said he was gravely concerned, and there were calls in some Western
European capitals to cut off Western credits in protest.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo
softened Moscow's stance, saying there was no deadline for the
civilians to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not set any time period,'' Rushailo said during a tour
of Chechnya, which ended with a stop at the sprawling Russian air
base base here. ``We think that people who are capable of leaving
the war zone should do it as soon as possible so not to risk their
lives and those of their relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that the Russians plan to cease their
punishing artillery and bombing attacks on Grozny. The Chechen
capital has been pounded as the Russian military has tried to force
the Islamic fighters into submission. Refugees say the strikes have
been much fiercer than during the 1994-96 Chechen war, when Russian
tried to suppress a secessionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it mean that Russia has given up its attempt to
persuade the thousands of civilians still in Grozny to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military is in the process of establishing a safe
corridor for refugees from Grozny leading north to the town of
Pervomaiskoye, where a checkpoint has been established. There the
refugees will be processed and sent to two tent cities at
Znamenskoye in northern Chechnya, which the military is rushing to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russia is no longer insisting that Grozny's residents
leave by this Saturday, and it has stopped issuing the chilling
warnings to civilians that they risk death if they stay after that
date.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some officials suggested that the Russian military had caught
Russian civilian policy-makers by surprise with its Saturday
deadline and created an unnecessary international firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Russia climbed down from the talk of a deadline,
however, top officials expressed scorn for the West. Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin, the favorite to succeed President Boris Yeltsin,
complained that the West simply did not understand the situation in
the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   That is a sentiment that has a lot of support among the Russian
public, which blames the rebels for a rash of bombings in Moscow
and other Russian cities and for hundreds of kidnappings before the
war that made Chechnya one of the world's most lawless and
dangerous regions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's poll ratings have risen sharply after he initiated the
military campaign against the Chechen rebels last September and
displayed his willingness to stand up to the West. And there was
far more of an outcry in the West over the ultimatum than in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If representative of foreign countries are so worried about
the events in the northern Caucasus they should not only exert
pressure on the Russian leadership,'' Putin said. ``Let them use
their influence to persuade the bandits to free Russian citizens
who have been taken hostage and the many foreign hostages who are
still kept by the bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Russians relaxed their ultimatum to the civilians,
there was no softening of the Russian line regarding the Islamic
militants. Col. Gen. Victor Kazantsev, the commander of Russian
forces in the northern Caucasus, insisted that there was no
ultimatum for civilians, but that the rebels had a week to leave
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   How the Russian military plans to enforce its demands to the
militants remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question, however, was not the political sparring
between the East and West, but the fate of Chechnya's civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of often-confusing statements, it was still unclear
whether many of Grozny's civilians would use the new safe corridor.
Some are too sick to leave, while others may be afraid of arousing
the rebels' ire.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is apparent how the checkpoint and tent cities could
accommodate a new flood or refugees if Grozny's residents are in
fact persuaded to evacuation the city.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Koshman, the deputy prime minister in charge of policy
on Chechnya, has estimated there are still 45,000 to 50,000
civilians in Grozny. Other estimates put the number at 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rushailo said the checkpoint at Pervomaikoye will be able to
process about 3,000 people a day, but the tent cities at
Znamenskoye only have room for 4,500. That means that that the rest
of the refugees would have to find accommodations with relatives or
in camps that have yet to be built.

 &HT;    Odom gives Clippers hope when not much else does
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They are the Lost Angeles Clippers, a team seemingly
destined to wallow in a nether world of underachievement and
malady.
</P>
<P>
   So, when three teams passed on Lamar Odom in the June draft, the
feeling permeated that maybe the succession of calamities that have
enveloped L.A.'s other team could be near a merciful conclusion.
Without hesitation, the Clippers snapped up Odom, generally
regarded as the most skilled player in the draft but passed over
because of a series of questionable acts.
</P>
<P>
   After making himself eligible for the draft and hiring an agent,
Odom had tried to renege. He was a no-show at the Chicago predraft
camp, and he broke all but one appointment for individual workouts
He also did not attend the predraft media session in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When Odom did work out for four teams, the Clippers were
impressed at his ability, at 6 feet 10, to make plays from the
perimeter and inside, through scoring or passing. They wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   And for a change in Clippers lore, Odom wanted the Clippers,
inasmuch as he wanted anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a challenge; I love challenges,'' he said.
``That's what pushes everybody in the world, whether you're working
on Wall Street or you're sweeping. It's a challenge to prove
everybody wrong and show everybody that we can play in the NBA and
be competitive and, hopefully, make a run for it.
</P>
<P>
   He made those comments before the season began, so he knew full
well how difficult the process will be with the Clips. As usual in
the franchise's cursed past, injuries beset the club and stunted
the kind of growth expected from its young talent. Center Michael
Olowokandi and forward Maurice Taylor both missed time because of
injury.
</P>
<P>
   And with a questionable backcourt, Odom's display of star
potential has been enough to net the Clippers only a 4-13 record
going into tonight's meeting with the Hawks at Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Odom's presence gives the Clippers hope. He's averaging
18.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.4 assists, and, along with
Houston's Steve Francis, is an early front runner for NBA Rookie of
the Year. And for the first time since anyone can remember, they
have a player other fans want to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamar, to be a rookie and only 20 years old, has so much
confidence,'' Clippers point Eric Murdock said. ``I think all great
players have a certain cockiness about them that allow them to
think they can't be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   His signature game so far came last month in Minnesota, when
Odom could not be stopped by the Timberwolves and Kevin Garnett in
the late stretch of an 89-85 Clippers victory. Odom played the
entire game, getting 13 of his 22 points and notching the decisive
basket over Garnett with 16 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed why he's probably going to be the rookie of the
year,'' Minnesota coach Flip Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   Odom's response to the display? ``The best part about playing in
the league is that every night you're going against somebody that's
going to make you bring it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he brought a less-than-sparkling personal history with
him, Odom has been diligent about letting what he calls the ``real
Lamar Odom'' show. And in the discovery, Odom brings a youthful yet
sound approach to life and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his purchase of a penthouse with a beach view in the
Los Angeles area his most prized acquisition since getting a
three-year, $7.5-million contract. Unlike most NBA players, or most
people, Odom does not own car. In fact, he doesn't even know how to
drive. He catches rides with teammates or takes taxis to games or
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a New York thing,'' the Queens native said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his girlfriend have a two-year-old daughter, and she
represents Odom's lifeblood, even more than basketball does. His
father left home when Odom was 6 and later became addicted to
heroin, although he since has beaten that habit. Odom lost his
mother to colon cancer when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a good father is very important to me, because I didn't
have the best relationship with my father,'' he said. ``Those teen
years, I couldn't be told anything. I had a little bit of erratic
behavior, and I just want to be there for my daughter so she
doesn't have to go through the same things that I went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I've made some mistakes. I'm only (20). But I think
that I've learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake now evident is that by the Chicago Bulls, Vancouver
Grizzlies and the Charlotte Hornets, all of whom passed on Odom's
limitless talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge, huge steal,'' Olowokandi said. ``Those teams
that passed on drafting him, I don't have a clue why they did that.
Reports say that he wasn't decisive, but the last time I checked,
that wasn't a personality or character flaw.''

COMMENTARY: SENSELESS IN SEATTLE II 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the Seattle World Trade Organization summit meeting is
over we can ask: Was it a turning point, or just an exclamation
point? That depends entirely on how the protesters and governments
interpret Seattle. Here is my own guide:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What the serious protesters got right: &LR;  My environmentalist
allies say my criticism of the protesters in Seattle was too
broad-brush. There were some serious groups there raising serious
points, particularly the notion that the WTO has no need or right
to be so secretive. If it is deciding that a U.S. law banning tuna
caught in nets that also catch dolphins is a trade barrier, the WTO
should at least allow environmentalists to file a brief or meet
with judges. The WTO can't promote open trade by ruling in the
dark. It would enhance its own legitimacy if it opened up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What the protesters got wrong: &LR;  The biggest negative fallout
from Seattle is the way it smeared free trade. I fear that
politicians all over America will look at Seattle and say, ``Wow,
if that's what you get when you support free trade, I'm hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been a real stand-up guy on free trade _
until last week. I know in an election year he has to tip his hat
to the AFL-CIO. But we can't afford the full-body kowtow. Clinton
effectively kidnapped the Democratic Party seven years ago, moved
it into the Republican economic agenda _ including free trade,
Nafta and the WTO for China _ while holding onto much of the
Democrats' social agenda. But his tacit ally in this was Newt
Gingrich. As long as the ``evil Newt'' was out there with his
extreme agenda, Clinton was able to hold the Democrats behind him.
But what you saw in Seattle is what the activist base of the
Democratic Party looks like _ without the fear of Newt. It is a
wildly diverse coalition that, without strong leadership from the
top of the Democratic Party, could really pull it over a cliff on
free trade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where we go from here: &LR;  ``It's amazing how caught up some
activists are in the old world,'' says Paul Gilding, the former
head of Greenpeace who now advises multinationals on sustainable
development. ``The old model is you go into the streets, raise the
outrage of the community, get the government to pass a law, the
companies resist, eventually a compromise is reached and in five
years things change.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups making the biggest difference today are those working
with multinationals and consumers _ showing the companies how they
can be both green and profitable, while making clear to them that
if they don't upgrade their environmental and labor practices, the
activist community will mount a campaign against them through the
Internet and consumers all over the world. ``The smart activists,''
says Gilding, ``understand that the market, and global integration,
is now king, and this can be a great boon to environmentalists and
a great threat to big companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the WTO ruled against the U.S. laws banning tuna caught in
nets that also catch dolphins. But I just went to my Giant
supermarket and checked every can of tuna. They all said: ``Dolphin
safe.'' Now how could that be? Because the smart activists ignored
the WTO ruling, mobilized consumers to pressure the tuna companies,
the tuna companies pressured the fishermen and Flipper got saved.
That's how you change the world. If we didn't have free trade with
Mexican fishermen, would we have been able to pressure them into
using dolphin-safe nets on the tuna they sell us? Not a chance.
``Our decision to go dolphin safe was purely based on consumer
feedback,'' Michael Mullen, spokesman for StarKist tuna, told me.
``We get about 1,000 calls and 300 consumer e-mails a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws and regulations protecting workers, water and trees still
matter. My argument is simply that the best way to strengthen those
laws, and to get developing countries to abide by them, is by
activists mobilizing consumers, pressuring companies and using free
trade _ not choking it.
</P>
<P>
   But too many unions and activists want the quick fix for
globalization: just throw up some walls and tell everyone else how
to live. There was a country that tried that. It guaranteed
everyone's job, maintained a protected market and told everyone
else how to live. It was called the Soviet Union. Didn't work out
so well. In the end it probably did more damage to its environment
and workers than any country in history.

NASA PROMISES THOROUGH INQUIRY OF FAILED MARS MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARS-MISTAKES) 
(sw) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ In the aftermath of the failed $165 million
Mars Polar Lander mission, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration on Tuesday promised a thorough investigation of its
causes and implications and a ``major rethinking'' of the strategy
for the entire Mars exploration program.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said that as a result, the next landing attempt,
planned for launching in 2001, might well be postponed for more
than two years. That spacecraft is almost identical to the polar
lander and so may have to be modified to correct any shortcomings
revealed in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced we will go forward with a lander in '01,''
said Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space
science. ``Right now, I have no confidence that that would be a
successful mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiler said in a teleconference with reporters from NASA
headquarters in Washington that the goal was still to return a
sample of Martian soil and rock in 2008, but that it might prove to
be impossible without extensive improvements in flight hardware and
interplanetary communications.
</P>
<P>
   He said the goal of searching for evidence of past Martian
climate and conditions possibly conducive to life remained valid
and would not be changed. ``I would not like to miss an opportunity
if it can be avoided,'' Weiler said, ``but we're not going to be a
slave to schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   An independent review of the exploration strategy was expected
to examine whether the design, size and relatively low budget for
the polar lander were adequate for the task of flying to Mars,
landing on strange terrain and working in an extremely cold
climate. After the $1 billion Mars Observer vanished in 1993, NASA
shifted from such large, high-priced spacecraft for new planetary
expeditions to a ``faster, cheaper, better'' policy. Several small,
low-cost craft could be launched at frequent intervals for the cost
of a large craft and reduce the risk of all being lost in one
mishap.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were serious failures,'' Weiler said, referring to the
polar lander and its companion, Mars Climate Orbiter, which
disappeared while approaching the planet in September. ``Perhaps
they are teaching us a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission officials said the exact cause of the polar lander's
failure might never be determined because they could not receive
any engineering data from it during the final 11 minutes before the
planned soft landing. Even if the craft's antennas had had a clear
view of Earth, signals from the transmitters could not have
penetrated the envelope of electrified gases surrounding the craft
as it heated up on the plunge through Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler and mission officials suggested that one modification on
the next landing spacecraft might include a larger radio
transmitter and a greater supply of electrical power to maintain
contact with Earth through the entire descent.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas to be considered by the review board include the
possibility of replacing one or more spacecraft now planned for
flight in 2001, 2003 and 2005 with substitutes that would be sent
to Mars mainly to test improved and more reliable technologies.
Another proposal, Weiler said, is to place several communications
satellites in Mars orbit to improve Mars-to-Earth radio links and
perhaps radio beacons to help spacecraft zero in to an orbit of the
planet or to a landing. The beacons, he said, might have helped the
climate orbiter correct its trajectory before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Polar Lander appeared to be heading right to its target
near the south pole when it was last heard from before its final
descent. With the communications blackout depriving them of clues,
mission engineers declined to speculate on what possibly went
wrong. All they know is that they have listened seven times for
some radio signal, without success.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest attempt early on Tuesday, Richard Cook, the
project manager, said that flight control team had ``played its
last ace,'' but would continue trying to make contact for another
two weeks or so, though their chances of hearing anything were
extremely remote. They are considering a plan to command the Mars
Global Surveyor, orbiting the planet since 1997, to fly over the
landing site in coming weeks and take pictures that might reveal
the polar lander's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly disappointed,'' Cook said, ``but we're
extremely determined to recover from this and go on.''  &QL;

<P>
   With the nation's biotechnology industry being denounced as the
creator of ``Frankenfoods,'' at least one company has been working
to get groups of church members, union workers and elderly
residents to speak in support of genetically engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Monsanto Co. helped pay for a demonstration in
Washington by about 100 members of a Baptist church, said an
organizer of the protest. The church members marched around a group
of anti-biotechnology activists who were dressed as Monarch
butterflies and as a 30-foot-long ear of corn.
</P>
<P>
   While the anti-biotechnology activists held up posters
denouncing ``mutant corn,'' the church members waved signs saying
``Biotech saves children's lives'' and ``Biotech equals jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the anti-biotechnology activists said church members
told them that they had been paid $25 to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   But Terry Wade, a spokesman at Burson-Marsteller, a public
relations firm based in New York, disputes that contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out there because they believed in the cause,'' Wade
said. ``While we may have paid for their lunch and for a bus, we
did not pay anyone to demonstrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Burson-Marsteller had been asked by Monsanto to contact people
supporting biotechnology, a spokeswoman for Monsanto said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Larry DeNeal, who helped organize the protest by the Mount
Lebanon Baptist Church of Washington, said a few protesters had
been given $25 because they paid for their own lunch and
transportation to the rally.
</P>
<P>
   The other demonstrators had received lunch and a bus ride to the
rally, DeNeal said, which Monsanto and other companies helped pay
for. DeNeal identified one of the other companies as Archer Daniels
Midland, an agricultural company based in Decatur, Ill., but a
spokeswoman for the company said it was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   Paying people to demonstrate would have violated Monsanto's
ethics policies, the company spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is abhorrent to us,'' she said, adding that the company
planned to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Wade said it was also against Burson-Marsteller's policy to pay
anyone directly to state a particular view.
</P>
<P>
   DeNeal said many of the church members support gene-altered
foods because some scientists are using biotechnology to develop
crops that may help feed the growing populations in sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The protest in Washington, which occurred outside a hearing by
the Food and Drug Administration on the gene-altered crops, was
part of an effort by some biotechnology companies to counter
demonstrations by environmental and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Monsanto Co., Du Pont, Novartis AG and other
biotech companies have formed a series of industrywide alliances
and have set aside tens of millions of dollars to fight what they
view as an ugly campaign that has vilified the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bioengineered crops have been the subject of ferocious debate
for months in Europe, where public opposition to genetically
modified foods led to calls for additional research, labeling and
even the banning of such products altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Now environmental advocates in this country have mounted their
own effort to turn public opinion against such products, putting
the biotechnology industry on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   In response, employees and consultants from Burson-Marsteller
have been trying to recruit people from churches, labor
organizations and senior citizens groups to speak at FDA hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Before a hearing in Chicago on Nov. 18, Burson hired Jerry
Morrison, a consultant who has worked to organize labor groups.
Morrison said that he had spoken to eight groups, asking them to
speak at the Chicago hearing.
</P>
<P>
   An employee of Direct Impact, a consulting firm owned by
Burson-Marsteller, also called the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union, asking for their support at the FDA
hearing in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The labor union declined, a union member said.

SUPREME COURT BACKS LIMIT ON SPREAD OF POLICE RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCOTUS-TANKERS) 
(bl) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld a California
law that bars commercial information services from obtaining some
police records that are made available routinely to journalists and
others who agree not to use the information ``to sell a product or
service.''
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 7-2, the court resolved a closely watched First
Amendment case on narrow, largely procedural grounds, making little
if any new law. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's majority
opinion said the case was not about restricting commercial speech _
the basis on which the lower federal courts had found the 1996 law
unconstitutional _ but about access to government records, which
the government has a nearly free hand to grant or to withhold.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 California law, similar to laws in many other states,
allows access to police records showing the addresses of people who
have been arrested or are the victims of crimes to broad categories
of users, including journalists, scholars and private
investigators. But the law bars access to those who cannot
truthfully sign a statement that the information ``shall not be
used directly or indirectly to sell a product or service.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was challenged, before it took effect, by United
Reporting Publishing Corp., which sells arrest records to lawyers,
insurance agents, alcohol counselors and other clients who plan to
use the information in their businesses. United Reporting, which
also publishes a newsletter containing arrest information, sued to
block enforcement of the law without first trying to meet
conditions for access. It is now free to make a new effort to
qualify, as a preface to challenging the law ``as applied'' rather
than ``on its face,'' Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   As a suit challenging the validity of the untested law on its
face, he continued, the case was essentially abstract and presented
the court with ``nothing more than a governmental denial of access
to information in its possession.'' He added: ``California could
decide not to give out arrestee information at all without
violating the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Los Angeles Police Department vs. United Reporting
Publishing, No. 98-678, overturned a ruling by the 9th Circuit U.S.
tates Court of Appeals, in San Francisco. Further proceedings in
the lower courts could clarify or even change the decision; United
Reporting might, for example, be able to show on the basis of the
newsletter it publishes that it is engaged in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the decision disappointed organizations that had looked
to a court that has been notably solicitous of commercial speech to
place some limits on the government's ability to set differential
access restrictions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision ``creates more questions than answers,'' said
Ronald Plesser, a lawyer who filed a brief representing a group of
electronic publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm an online information service, am I a journalist or a
commercial republisher?'' Plesser asked in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   As a hypothetical question, Plesser wondered whether, if the
Supreme Court had a Web site, it could prohibit downloading by
anyone who was going to repackage and sell the information.
</P>
<P>
   In a concurring opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg emphasized
that ``once address information is in the public domain, the
statute does not restrict its use in any way.'' She also said that
while California could limit its release of government information,
it could not do so on impermissible grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``California could not, for example, release address information
only to those whose political views were in line with the party in
power,'' Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, said that while he agreed that the case
presented an issue of an access restriction rather than a direct
restriction on speech, the law was so irrational as to be
unconstitutional. While California's goal was to protect personal
privacy, Stevens said, that goal could not be served by the
restriction on commercial use as long as the news media and others
could obtain the information and publish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the state might simply withhold the information from all
persons does not insulate its actions from constitutional
scrutiny,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Goldstein, who successfully argued the appeal for the Los
Angeles Police Department, said in an interview Tuesday that at its
simplest level, the decision meant only that ``you shouldn't go
around invalidating statutes without seeing how they work in
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Goldstein added that the online information industry's
``core concern that they'll be cut off from information in a
discriminatory way remains a live and unresolved question.''
</P>
<P>
   While six justices signed onto Rehnquist's opinion, each of the
six also wrote or joined a concurring opinion elaborating on the
chief justice's spare eight pages.

TAYLOR RESIGNS AS GLOBE CHAIRMAN; GILMAN NAMED AS REPLACEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five months after he was removed as The Boston Globe's
publisher, Benjamin B. Taylor resigned Tuesday as chairman of the
newspaper's board, his only remaining Globe post.
</P>
<P>
   After the board accepted Taylor's resignation, it elected
Richard H. Gilman, who succeeded him in July as publisher, as its
new chairman. Gilman disclosed Taylor's resignation, effective Jan.
13, in a memorandum to the newspaper's employees.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting Taylor's resignation, the board of the Globe
Newspaper Co. passed a resolution expressing its ``deep
appreciation'' for his service to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution continued: ``As a distinguished reporter and
editor and as an inspiring publisher noted for his integrity, high
standards, and personal warmth, Ben Taylor contributed greatly to
the Globe's improvement and quality during the three decades of his
unwavering dedication to the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Co. named Gilman, then its senior vice
president of operations, as Globe publisher July 12. The surprise
move ended 126 years of Taylor family leadership of the Globe. The
change, six years after the Times bought the Globe, came at a time
of declining Globe circulation and slowing advertising revenue. The
only reason given was ``differences in approaches to management.''
</P>
<P>
   In a personal note, Gilman said he was ``grateful to Ben for his
professionalism, graciousness, and respect during the transition
period over the summer. My hope is that together we can build upon
what Ben has helped create, to continue a legacy that has great
meaning to Boston, New England, and the world of journalism.''

BU PROFESSOR WHO DIDN'T ATTRIBUTE SENTENCE QUITS POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The professor forgot to attribute one sentence in a
lecture, and the lapse cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   Now, colleagues at Boston University of media professor John
Schulz have rallied to his defense, complaining that the climate in
the academic world has become so frenzied that repeating even a
quick proverb can be construed as cribbing.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, the chairman of the department of Mass Media,
Advertising, and Public Relations, resigned his administrative post
Tuesday after he admitted pulling a passage from a weekly political
magazine and using it, unattributed, in a lecture in front of 400
freshmen last week. He will keep his position as a professor.
</P>
<P>
   Some colleagues protested the resignation, noting that his
explanation was plausible _ he failed to attribute the brief quote
because he was pressed for time to finish the lecture _ and
questioning whether it was truly plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   But Schulz himself insisted that an ethical lapse, no matter how
small or unintended, must be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act was accidental, and not intentional, but that is
immaterial,'' said Schulz, in his formal resignation statement to
the faculty Tuesday. ``The failure to attribute a source is a
serious offense in a university dedicated to the pursuit of truth
and in a college that is committed to teaching ethics to future
communicators.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, a decorated war hero and 21-year journalist with the
Voice of America, appeared as a guest lecturer in ``Perspectives in
Communication'' last week, and ended his lecture by reading a
seven-line sentence taken from an article in the Nov. 29 issue of
The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, a student posted a note in the chat room for
the course and sent a note to the dean of the School of
Communications, saying she had just read the same sentence in the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Brent Baker called Schulz into his office Friday and asked
him about the incident. Schulz acknowledged using the passage, and
instantly said he would resign as department head.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz said he had walked out from behind the podium with a
wireless microphone, trying to project a more relaxed atmosphere in
the lecture hall. As he reached back to the podium to get the notes
where he had written down the quote, he caught a glimpse of his
watch and noticed that he was running six or seven minutes behind
the time he'd allotted for the lecture. He was eager, he said, to
leave enough time for questions and answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening in horror, I thought, `My Gosh,' I think (the
student) is right,' '' Schulz said Tuesday, recalling his
conversation with the dean. ``I could see that watch in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident recalls another case at the BU School of
Communications eight years ago, when Dean H. Joachim Maitre was
forced to resign after the Globe reported that he had used a film
review by critic Michael Medved as a commencement speech. Maitre
remained on the faculty for several years, resigning only his
dean's position. Baker said Tuesday that he has asked Schulz to
stay on the faculty, as well, and teach his usual load of courses
in international communications.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz appeared in front of the class again Tuesday to apologize
to the students, explaining that he had indeed lifted the phrase,
which likened Italian media magnate Silvio Berlusconi to an amalgam
of American political and media figures, from George W. Bush to
Donald Trump. When he finished, the students applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But his colleagues questioned whether Schulz had to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scheme of things, this seems very minor,'' said
communications professor Norman Moyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tell a group of journalism students, `The job of a
newspaper is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable,'
and I don't say it's from `The Front Page' or Ben Hecht, is that
plagiarism?'' he asked. ``You try to attribute things, but when
you're speaking for an hour and a half and you're trying not to
lose the attention of your students...the whole thing just makes me
sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it's his decision, it's hard to criticize, but in a lot
of ways I'm sorry he did. If it had been ordered by the powers that
be, I would have protested it.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalism professor Caryl Rivers questioned whether the lapse
really meets the definition of plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plagiarism implies publication. Most professors don't see
their classroom lectures as publications, and do not say, what have
I annotated, what have I cited,'' she said. ``It's very different
from when we give a formal lecture. A classroom lecture, you want
to be a freewheeling one. Do you have to worry, `Did I have a
source for everything I said?' That's one of the questions being
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he accepted the resignation with regret, and the
``utmost'' respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason the faculty is so upset is that we respect
John so much,'' he said. ``They're sort of falling to both sides of
the issue. They have a lot of respect for someone who would stand
up and teach the students that there's no double standard for
faculty and students. You just don't see this much in America
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz himself pushed aside any questions about whether this is
really plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the definition that says `purposeful' or
`accidental,' '' he said. ``It's just, `misrepresenting of others'
works or ideas.''

 &HT;    Deadline looms as Braves free agents wait
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Faced with losing up to 20 percent of its postseason
roster in one swoop, the Atlanta Braves played it close to the vest
Tuesday night. As close as rules allow.
</P>
<P>
   The National League champions withheld making formal arbitration
offers to their free agent players until the midnight deadline,
leaving the fate of six players uncertain to the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   While the Braves are hardly expected to make an arbitration
offer to retain 40-year-old Otis Nixon, the team faces a critical
decision on whether to keep outfielder Gerald Williams. Other
Braves who have filed for free agency but can be retained with an
offer to arbitrate a 2000 salary include shortstop Jose Hernandez,
outfielder-first baseman Brian Hunter, catcher Greg Myers and
right-handed reliever Rudy Seanez.
</P>
<P>
   All teams faced the midnight deadline for offering players who
had filed for free agency an opportunity for arbitration. Those
players have until Dec. 19 to accept the offer, or are subsequently
prevented from negotiating with their former clubs until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   All but Seanez were on Atlanta's postseason roster last October
and Seanez would have been, had it not been for August elbow
surgery. With 15 veterans already under contract, the Braves can
help determine the veteran makeup of the 2000 roster by how many
arbitration offers it makes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams remains the most important component, after emerging as
a critical player when he was moved to a full-time leadoff hitter
Aug. 5. The Braves finished 39-14 with Williams batting first and
while he is less than a prototypical No. 1 hitter (.339 onbase
percentage), his value grew higher as the season wore on.
</P>
<P>
   He may able to more than triple his $1.4 million 1999 salary on
the open market. As an alternative, the Braves are keeping close
watch on prospect outfielder George Lombard, who was hitting .278
in the Venezuelan Winter League.

PLAYING WITH FIRE IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia's war to recapture Chechnya has been waged from the start
with a blatant indifference to the suffering of civilians, but
there is something particularly ominous about the ultimatum the
Russian military command has issued to civilians trapped in the
city of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in the bombing and shelling of the Chechen
capital, leaflets were dropped warning civilians to leave the
encircled city before this Saturday ``by any means possible.'' The
accompanying threat could not have been more chilling. ``Only in
this way,'' the leaflet said, ``will you be able to avoid death.''
</P>
<P>
   This threat would be bad enough if it meant merely that the
current Russian tactic of standing off and firing bombs, shells,
and rockets into Grozny will continue. There have been signs,
however, that something much more lethal is being planned _ a
resort to terror weapons that would not only violate the 1949
Geneva Convention against the targeting of civilians but would
transform Russia into a rogue state comparable to Saddam Hussein's
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a former US national security adviser, Zbigniew
Brzezinski, citing Central European intelligence sources, wrote in
The Wall Street Journal of a Russian plan to use fuel-air
explosives and chemical weapons to exterminate large numbers of
Chechens. Last week the same warning came from Pavel Felgenhauer,
who is known for his longstanding contacts in the Russian military
command and who was defense analyst for many years in Red Star, the
paper of the Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sources in the Russian military say plans are made to use
aerosol explosive bombs, also known as `vacuum bombs,' in Grozny,''
Felgenhauer wrote last Thursday in the Moscow Times. These bombs
form flammable clouds that are then ignited and can kill everyone
hiding in underground bunkers built in Grozny during Soviet times
to withstand a nuclear attack. If these weapons ``don't dislodge
the Chechen fighters from Grozny, other, even more powerful weapons
of mass destruction may be considered,'' Felgenhauer warned.
</P>
<P>
   A story that the Chechens are preparing to use nerve gas against
Russian forces _ a rumor spread by Russian intelligence and
recycled in the Russian press _ ``may be a pretext for the Russian
military to begin a gas attack themselves and to blame it on the
Chechens beforehand,'' Felgenhauer reported. He explained that the
rumor was preposterous because the Chechens do not have access to
Russian nerve gas stockpiles, cannot mass-produce chemical agents,
and lack an effective delivery system for chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A resort to weapons of mass destruction would come as the
logical culmination of Russia's tactics in Chechnya. It has been
clear for some time that Russian political leaders and military
officers want to avoid the calamitous tactics of the 1994-96 war in
Chechnya. Russian soldiers will not be sent into Grozny to wage
urban guerrilla warfare against Chechen fighters.
</P>
<P>
   It is equally clear that the Kremlin's anti-Chechen and
antiterrorist propaganda has prepared the Russian public to accept
the most inhumane methods to expunge Chechen ``banditry'' and
Chechen independence. The Clinton administration and its allies
should be no less clear in warning the Kremlin not to use weapons
of mass destruction in Chechnya.

JUSTICES WEIGH STATES' RIGHTS VS. TREATY RULES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding a foreign policy component to its
exploration of federal-state relations, the Supreme Court on
Tuesday heard arguments on whether states can set safety and
environmental standards for ships entering their harbors that are
stricter that federal regulations or international agreements the
United States has signed.
</P>
<P>
   The justices appeared torn between their solicitude for state
sovereignty _ ``Why shouldn't the state have something to say about
that?'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist demanded at one point
with reference to staffing and operational requirements set by
Washington state _ and their concern that states not be in a
position to prevent the federal government from meetings its
international obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has made international uniformity a key issue,''
David Frederick, an assistant solicitor general arguing for the
federal government, told the court. ``It would greatly upset that
uniformity if 23 coastal states were able to pick and choose'' the
regulations they would enforce.
</P>
<P>
   The case is a joint appeal by the federal government and the
International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, an
organization known as Intertanko, representing owners of 2,000
tankers of United States and foreign registry. Both are asking the
justices to overturn a decision by the federal appeals court in San
Francisco, which ruled last year that a series of regulations that
Washington state adopted in 1995 were not pre-empted by federal law
even when inconsistent with federal regulations and international
standards.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Washington adopted its regulations after the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in 1989, which dumped 11 million gallons of oil into waters
off Alaska. The state and a coalition of environmental groups that
support the regulations are defending them as an appropriate
response to the concerns raised by that ecological disaster,
tailored to the specific navigation challenges of Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case concerns Washington's authority to prevent oil
spills,'' William Collins, the state's senior assistant attorney
general, told the court, adding that ``the whole system of
cooperative federalism can make the waters safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Congress had not expressly barred the states from
regulating in this area. He said that while ``it's clear that Coast
Guard regulations would pre-empt the state if there's a conflict,''
the state's regulations, properly viewed, complemented rather than
conflicted with the federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion appeared difficult for the court to accept. The
Washington regulations, for example, establish language proficiency
requirements for some officers, requiring them to be able to speak
English and also to communicate in a language understood by the
crew. Justice Stephen G. Breyer objected that a crew on a given
ship might speak ``14 different languages, and I don't think any of
us could meet that standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins replied that in the state's judgment, for safety
purposes the officers had to be able to give orders in languages
their crew could understand.
</P>
<P>
   The state also requires records to be kept of alcohol and drug
testing, to be performed on foreign as well as domestic ships even
before the ships enter Washington's waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We require the testing of both because we can't think of any
reason that foreign crews hold their liquor better,'' Collins said.
The state has a ``zero tolerance'' policy for alcohol, while Coast
Guard regulations permit blood alcohol levels of up to 0.04
percent. Another Washington regulation requires three officers on
deck under certain conditions, while Coast Guard rules require two.
</P>
<P>
   Various treaties, based on the principle of reciprocity, assure
that ships that are certified by their own ``flag nations'' as
meeting international standards will be accepted in the waters of
all countries that have signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's pre-emption doctrines are technical and
complex, and much of the argument in the case, United States vs.
Locke, No. 98-1701, consisted of a debate over which of several
pre-emption theories was most applicable. The two sides also
debated the continuing relevance of a 1978 Supreme Court decision
that found Washington's regulations for the design of oil tankers
to be pre-empted.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Benner, arguing for the tanker owners'
organization, tried to put the case in a broader historical and
political perspective. The nation's founders ``knew this industry
very well,'' he said. ``They knew its links to international law.
They knew each vessel carried with it the physical projection of
the sovereignty of another country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the decision in this case by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals ``for the first time in history countenanced an
intrusion by a state into this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Although unrelated as a legal matter, the case bears some
similarity to a case the court accepted for review last week, on
whether a Massachusetts law limiting the state's commerce with
Myanmar, formerly Burma, violated the federal government's
exclusive right to conduct foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of briefs filed in Tuesday's case underscore
the range of concerns. On the one hand, the governments of Canada
and 14 other countries, including Belgium, Greece and Japan, urged
the court to overturn the appeals court's decision. ``Shipping is a
truly international enterprise'' on which countries must be able to
speak with one voice, one groups of countries said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, 20 states, including New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, told the court that the case raised ``concerns at the
heart of the states' police power.''  &QL;

NEW PLAN ON ARMS CHECKS IN IRAQ COULD LEAD TO END OF SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A new arms inspection plan that could lead to
the suspension of nine years of sanctions against Iraq sometime
next year may go to the Security Council for debate on Wednesday,
Western diplomats said Tuesday. British and American envoys,
augmented by State Department officials, spent Tuesday trying to
build a consensus that would avoid a Russian veto.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that on Wednesday the foreign ministers of key
Security Council countries, including Secretary Of State Madeleine
Albright and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia, would discuss
the proposals by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   While a formal vote by the 15-member council may not take place
until the weekend, there is a sense among council members that the
next day or two will be crucial to future policy on Iraq. At stake
are not only the creation of a new arms-monitoring body and the
laying out of a rough timetable pointing to relief from the
crippling international embargo if Iraq complies with inspectors,
but also the future of the ``oil-for-food'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The economic sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, and are to remain in place until Iraq demonstrates it
has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction. The oil-for-food
program is intended to soften the effects of the embargo on
ordinary Iraqis by permitting Iraq to sell controlled amounts of
oil in order to purchase needed civilian goods.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been given two short extensions, prompting Iraq
to stop exporting oil for the last three weeks in protest. The next
deadline is Saturday, and diplomats say that the program is likely
to be extended for the full six months. If there is agreement on
the arms inspection plan this week, the oil-sales plan would be
phased into the overall Iraq surveillance program. Under that
program the oil-sales agreement would be enhanced in several ways,
primarily by removing the limit on sales, although supervision of
the money earned would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats say that significant differences remain on
several points between the Russians on one hand and the British and
Americans on the other, primarily over how to judge whether Iraq is
in compliance with inspectors. On that judgment rests the trigger
that would lift sanctions for renewable periods of 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   Several council members said that it is important to have
Russian support for the plan to demonstrate to Iraq that the
council is firmly committed to resuming arms inspections. In a
trend that has been developing since the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991, diplomats find themselves trying to factor in
Russian domestic political pressures as well as Moscow's long ties
to Iraq as they search for consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Thomas Pickering, the American undersecretary of state,
came to New York to speak with Sergey Lavrov, the chief Russian
representative on the council, who returned on Monday from Moscow.
In Moscow, Lavrov took part in four days of talks with Tariq Aziz,
Iraq's deputy prime minister, who urged the Russians to oppose the
arms inspections, Aziz said Tuesday in a speech in Baghdad. He did
not say much about the Russian response, but he did repeat Iraq's
strong opposition to the new plan and again demanded the immediate
and unconditional lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats thought that Lavrov had toughened his position
somewhat Tuesday after the talks with Aziz and consultations with
Russian colleagues, but others speculated that the Russian envoy's
harder line in talks may have been a bargaining tool as discussions
enter their final hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraq negotiations are being conducted for the United States
by Peter Burleigh, a Middle East and Asia expert who is about to
depart as deputy chief representative here. Richard Holbrooke, the
chief American representative, is on an extended tour of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense among diplomats that the Americans regard this
as the final push on Iraq, nearly a year after British and American
bombing raids to punish Iraq for its failure to cooperate with
Unscom, the first arms inspection team. If the new resolution
creating Unscom's successor passes, the United States and other
members will be seen to have acted decisively after months of
dithering. Iraq will resist new inspections, but that confrontation
will open a new phase in its relations with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   If the resolution creating the new body, the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission, is vetoed, however,
sanctions against President Saddam Hussein's government will remain
in place indefinitely _ which many in Washington would welcome. The
only question then becomes whether the embargo would begin to erode
as nations tired of an inconclusive policy and eager to strike
business deals would begin to break the rules and deal openly with
Iraq. That problem, however, would no longer belong to the Clinton
administration but to its successor.

TIPSY FALSTAFF TOASTS A NEW COVENT GARDEN
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Its housewarmings completed, its 30-month renovation
almost so, the Royal Opera House opened on Monday night with a new
production of Verdi's ``Falstaff.'' Behind it, or so the company
hoped, are years of financial turmoil, questionable management and
a creaky if endearing physical plant.
</P>
<P>
   From the listener's point of view the work is done. The theater
has the glow of gilt and red plush without the total loss of
patina. The glassed-in Floral Hall adjacent to the Covent Garden
site offers open spaces suitable for serious milling and personal
display at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   News that construction work was still going on backstage came
indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le Grand Macabre,'' the Ligeti opera scheduled to open in a
few days, had been canceled. ``Falstaff,'' in Graham Vick's jokey
staging, passed without serious incident, though rumors coming out
of rehearsals had predicted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Vick and his production team of Paul Brown, Thomas Webster and
Ron Howell made sure our eyes did not forget the centrality of
tipsiness to this compact beauty of an opera from Verdi's old age.
</P>
<P>
   Scene 1 was bathed in red, and so steeply raked and bowed was
the stage that players threaten to slide feet first into the
orchestra pit. Not only were the abilities to sing and act
required, but so was the sureness of the mountain goat.
</P>
<P>
   The scene changes were clever. Beds inflated and deflated,
appearing and disappearing _ as do people and props _ through
trapdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Scene 2 was a charming abstraction of rolling green hills; lemon
trees rose like periscopes from the stage floor. In the laundry
basket sequence, acrobats were busy.
</P>
<P>
   Vick was eventually the victim of his own cleverness.
</P>
<P>
   The pranks and surreal look in Act III wore out their welcome.
The production had its moments of high and provocative fun, but
Falstaff himself, who is after all more tragicomic than ridiculous,
seemed a little out of place in the middle of all the high jinks.
</P>
<P>
   He was played, superbly, by Bryn Terfel. The body makeup helped,
but it was Terfel's manner that turned him from young singer to
tired lothario. The diction was extraordinary. The voice never
forced, never faltered. The singers around him were first rate:
Barbara Frittoli, Desiree Rancatore, Bernadette Manca di Nissa and
Diane Montague as Verdi's quartet of women, and the excellent
Roberto Frontali as Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The lightness of Kenneth Tarver's tenor as Fenton did not matter
in a house that continually surprises the infrequent visitor with
its paradox of grandness and intimacy. Bernard Haitink conducted
with his customary muscle and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falstaff'' was preceded by a gala evening on Wednesday that
was repeated on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Split between opera and dance, the program offered different
meanings of the word gala. Music told us that opera was serious
business and that patrons ought not to forget it. Dance gave the
opinion that galas were a form of flattery: Here are snippets of
what we do best. Here is what has endeared us to you.
</P>
<P>
   The musical half, taken up largely by scenes from Wagner and
Beethoven, verged on grimness, flattered the operatic voice not at
all. ``Die Walkure'' (here the end of Act I) was vocally a labor of
love but labor nonetheless. Deborah Polaski's bruising,
hard-working soprano showed the wear of her long and profitable
career in the Wagner repertory. Placido Domingo worked hard to make
Siegmund sound liquid, almost Italian.
</P>
<P>
   The finale of ``Fidelio'' had little to do with singing at all.
Beethoven bends the human voice against its will to his musical
designs. The choruses were thrilling and the vocal counterpoint
ingenious, but one can think of more succulent advertisements for
the new Royal Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's gala made it clear that this was an opera house, not
a concert hall. The house orchestra could barely fit onstage, with
string players spilling on either side. Live and present in the pit
for ``Falstaff,'' the instruments sounded blunt and remote in their
elevated state. Singers, equally live and present on Monday, stood
out beyond the proscenium and were not easy to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful Overture to Weber's ``Oberon'' at the start
enjoyed soft, lovely (and extremely difficult) horn playing. The
ballet excerpts, so swiftly managed and gracefully organized,
delighted the audience. Next to them the medium of opera was made
to sound glum and puritanical.

 &HT;    CEOs don't stick around
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The penthouse office is a vulnerable and volatile
place to be these days.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover at the top has been rampant most of this decade, as
chief executive officers at more than half of the nation's Fortune
500 firms have departed. The latest to join the long list of
short-term CEOs is Coca-Cola Chairman and Chief Executive M.
Douglas Ivester, who will be leaving in April after 2 1/2 years in
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``CEOs are changing like baseball managers,'' said John
Challenger, head of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an international
outplacement firm that tracks workplace trends. ``The focus and
pressure is so intense now. They're under so much pressure today to
meet high earnings expectations that are jacked up quarter by
quarter. They're also facing much more activist boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all are being forced out. Others _ many of them years
younger than their predecessors _ are cashing in lucrative stock
options and leaving for even richer career paths or new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, some 200 CEOs have retired, switched jobs or been
ousted. Last month alone, 70 CEOs _ roughly three each business day
_ left their companies, up from 54 in October, according to
Challenger.
</P>
<P>
   In the revolving-door world of the new executive suite,
long-reigning CEOs _ like General Electric's Jack Welch and
Ivester's predecessor, the late Roberto Goizueta _ are increasingly
rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the dynastic reign anymore,'' says Jeffrey
Sonnenfeld, an Atlanta expert on CEOs who last year headed a panel
commissioned by the National Association of Corporate Directors to
examine CEO succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shift in the (work) ethic regarding the tenure and
the desires of senior executives,'' said Paul Winum, Atlanta-based
managing director of RHR International, a firm that has management
psychologists who work with top management around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The climb to the top is no longer marked by longevity at one
company.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, time at the top is short _ and so is the patience of
highly ambitious CEOs looking for continual challenges and for
investor-minded corporate boards intent on improving record
performances.
</P>
<P>
   The average CEO stays less than five years now vs. eight to 10
years in the 1980s, according to SpencerStuart, an executive search
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was because of forced resignations,'' said
Alexandra LaJoux, research director for the Washington-based
National Association of Corporate Directors. ``Now, it's because
they're wealthy and they can jump to better and better
compensation. There's a great demand for CEOs. They're not going
out to pasture or to be with their grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their predecessors, many of today's top executives reach
the pinnacle of their careers relatively early.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual today for a person to be appointed CEO of a
major corporation in their 30s and 40s, said Carl Sloane, a Harvard
Business School professor of business administration. ``It's no
longer reserved for gray hairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the ambitious executive elite gets antsy after a
few years in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people at the top have enjoyed tremendous financial
benefits, which have been related to the tremendous growth in their
companies, and the compensation levels are extremely lucrative,''
said Winum.
</P>
<P>
   CEO compensation has come under fire, especially this decade, as
top executives' pay has far outpaced ordinary workers' incomes.
Some shareholders and labor unions have complained for years that
even the worst-performing CEOs are paid handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   Executive compensation, frequently including stock options, has
paralleled the rise in the stock market. As a result, those
lucrative packages have helped many top executives walk away
wealthy at a relatively young age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure to deliver on analysts' expectations quarter
after quarter after quarter becomes very wearing,'' said Paul
Lapides, director of the Corporate Governance Center at Kennesaw
State University. ``CEOs more so than in the past are finding
themselves wearier keeping up with those expectations over longer
periods of time. So after two, three or four years, a CEO may
decide to move on to a different career challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of them are walking away with millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's stock holdings, for example, are worth $188 million.
Similarly, Carl Ware, head of Coca-Cola's Africa Group who recently
announced he was leaving at the end of 2000, will get $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compensation, especially at Coca-Cola, has been extremely
lucrative for executives,'' notes Judith Fischer, managing director
of Executive Compensation Advisory Services in Alexandria, Va.
Fischer also noted that many executives ``break out of brick and
mortar (industries) and enter into high-tech start-up businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   George Shaheen, former chief executive of Andersen Consulting,
in September became head of Webvan, an Internet grocer.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, corporate boards _ determined not to repeat the
messy showdowns with CEOs that plagued companies such as General
Motors Corp., Sears, Kodak and Kmart earlier this decade _ have
taken more strident roles and have put top management on short
leashes.
</P>
<P>
   If CEOs can't cut it, boards will cut them loose. ``It's very
rare that you see cronyism between boards and the CEO,'' Sonnenfeld
said. ``There was a lot more protection in the past.''

   NEW YORK _ If outdoor earthworks are difficult to preserve, an
``interior earth sculpture,'' which is how the conceptual artist
Walter De Maria described his 1977 installation in a building in
Manhattan, has its own upkeep demands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years ago, De Maria transformed a desirable
3,600-square-foot piece of SoHo real estate into something useless.
``The New York Earth Room'' is 250 cubic yards of earth, piled 22
inches deep. It was introduced at what was then the Heiner
Friedrich Gallery and was intended to be the gallery's last show.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich, who went on to help found the Dia Center for the
Arts, left the heaps of dirt in situ. In 1980, Dia decided to
reopen the installation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, the work has art historical significance and also
provides a welcome respite from the shopaholics on SoHo's crowded
streets. Some 10,000 people visit the piece annually. One can't
walk on it _ a glass barrier contains the earth and keeps people
out _ but a loamy smell definitely permeates the space.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can ask questions of Bill Dilworth, the project's
caretaker-curator for the last decade. He's there every Wednesday
through Saturday, from noon to 6 p.m. Dilworth, 45, can supply
arcana like the field from which the dirt was gathered, the
landscaping company that sifted it and the fact that the former
factory space in which it is housed was designed to hold 120 pounds
per square foot. ``The Earth Room,'' says Dilworth, ``breaks down
to 77 pounds per square foot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once a week, he waters and rakes it to keep the piece looking
fresh and fertile. In the summer when the space is closed, Dilworth
digs holes in selected spots to make sure there is no damage to the
floor. ``Micro-organisms survive in it,'' he says. ``Mushrooms
grow. They used to come up more regularly than they do now. I ate
them, and they were delicious.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dia maintains two additional De Maria installations. ``The
Broken Kilometer,'' comprising 500 solid-brass rods, has been
housed in SoHo since 1979. (Guess what needs to be polished?)
``Lightning Field,'' 1977, a one-mile-by-one-kilometer outdoor
sculpture made up of 400 stainless-steel poles, in Quemado, N.M.,
is low-maintenance by De Maria standards. Still, lightning strikes
the poles very occasionally, and sometimes someone has to repair a
bend or a melted tip.
</P>
<P>
   All earthworks need upkeep of some sort. There is one exception
to that rule, however: Robert Smithson's famed ``Spiral Jetty'' of
1970, which has been submerged for years in the Great Salt Lake in
Utah.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A streamlining process designed to add value for
consumers of content by reducing their comprehension experience is
currently being efforted by public-sector entities and
bleeding-edge corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Both government agencies and some companies are now trying to
use clearer, simpler writing than they did in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ah-ha!
</P>
<P>
   The plain-language movement is enjoying a resurgence, and this
time it could have staying power. Disdaining jargon and celebrating
short, conversational sentences with active verbs, the latest
effort began two years ago when the Securities and Exchange
Commission ordered mutual fund companies to rewrite their
prospectuses by Dec. 1, 1999. With the help of consultants, the
movement has expanded to other government agencies and to companies
like Ford Motor and Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton instructed federal agencies last year to
rewrite by 2002 all documents that the public sees. The Food and
Drug Administration this year mandated that labels on
over-the-counter drugs be easier to understand by 2005. The SEC is
mulling similar rules for two popular financial products sold by
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the push is a recognition that new sources of information
_ like the Internet, 24-hour cable television and an explosion in
junk mail _ have overwhelmed people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume of information that people get and the speed at
which they get it has grown exponentially,'' said Irene A. Etzkorn,
an executive vice president at Siegel &AMP; Gale, a New York consulting
firm. She oversees the division that rips up and rewrites
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can't quickly discern information,'' she added,
``they discard it.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials hope their use of simple language will make
Americans more likely to trust what they hear from Washington.
Marketers, for their part, see a golden opportunity to rise above
the cacophony and convince consumers that they should buy a
product. Plain English can also help corporate managers explain
their company's strategy to employees and thereby increase
workplace efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, simpler writing bolsters revenue and cuts costs.
The Veterans Benefits Administration, for example, said it expected
to save about $500,000 a year because, after training employees in
its life insurance division how to write more clearly, the response
rate on one of its letters shot up to 62 percent, from about 35
percent. One telecommunications company, which Ms. Etzkorn declined
to identify, came to Siegel &AMP; Gale after its confusing bills caused
cellular-phone customers to spend an average of 45 minutes a month
talking to a service center, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At its worst, the detractors of plain English say that it can
dumb down documents, making them less accurate or less useful to
the experts who make up much of their audience.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the debate over sparse language is not new.
Aristotle, Renaissance philosophers, the authors William Strunk Jr.
and E.B. White and the investor Warren E. Buffett have all weighed
in on the topic. Others, including some in the Carter
administration, made pushes to encourage plain English that did not
stick.
</P>
<P>
   But today's effort is more sustained, partly because it
intersects with several economic trends that favor it. Deregulation
can cause onetime monopolies like local phone companies to want to
communicate with their customers more clearly. The Internet forces
marketers to think about presenting information in catchy new ways.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the SEC's ruling on prospectuses has created a cottage
industry of plain-language consultants, like Simplify in New York
and Firehouse Communications in Malden, Mass., that are seeking to
drum up new business by rewriting annual reports, 401(k) statements
and financial-services brochures. Siegel &AMP; Gale, which pioneered
the business almost three decades ago, has seen its document group
double in size since 1996. Some big law firms have also tried to
become experts in the area.
</P>
<P>
   When the consultants finish with a report, the differences can
be stark. Consider Texaco, whose executives began to think more
carefully about how they write after hearing about the SEC's ruling
on mutual funds. Many sections of their 1996 annual report _ the
last before their plain-language initiative _ appear as a sea of
uninterrupted text, highlighted by bureaucratic words (heretofore)
and oil-industry jargon (maturing fields).
</P>
<P>
   Try wading through this one: ``Texaco's total cash provided by
operating activities of $3.8 billion for the year 1996 reflected
strong operational earnings and a net inflow of $375 million,
primarily comprised of a cash dividend from Caltex (related to the
sale of Caltex' interest in NPRC), proceeds from advanced payments
on long-term natural gas sales agreements and the collection of
nonrecurring receivables (primarily insurance recoveries relating
to environmental matters), which were partially offset by payments
related to litigation and other matters.''
</P>
<P>
   If you picked up the report, said Joseph DeNardo, a Texaco
accountant and one its authors, ``you'd want to throw the book
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent annual report, by contrast, features narrow
columns of text, which are easier to read, and short, explanatory
sentences. Many sections start with a definition, rather than a
string of revenue numbers: ``In our upstream business, we explore
for, find, produce and sell crude oil, natural gas liquids and
natural gas.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sentence of the letter from Peter I. Bijur, the
company's chairman, contains 15 words, down from 51 two years ago _
despite the hard times for the oil industry that might have given
him reason to obfuscate Texaco's 78 percent decline in net income.
</P>
<P>
   Making such changes is not easy, however. ``People think it's
like a translation, that you turn big words into small words.
That's not it at all,'' said William M. Lutz, an English professor
at Rutgers University in Camden, N.J., and perhaps the most famous
plain-language advocate today. He has a consulting business and
earlier this year published ``Doublespeak Defined'' (HarperCollins,
1999), a dictionary of jargon.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lutz joined two Postal Service employees at the
agency's headquarters in Washington to make final changes in its
annual report. They had sent a rough draft to 40 of the agency's
top officials and were now squirreled away in a cubicle the size of
a conference room, surrounded by Thanksgiving leftovers and
McDonald's wrappers, scribbling away and dodging yet more
bureaucratic bullets. Colleagues kept stopping to drop off their
own suggestions. One manager debated which preposition to use in
one sentence. Their intentions were usually good, said R. Timothy
MacDonald, one of the writers, but convoluted language crept in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `You have to be perfect and exact and include
every little nuance,''' MacDonald said. ``Finally, you've got this
beast.''
</P>
<P>
   So he and a colleague, alongside Lutz, sifted through every
comment, at one point wrangling for 20 minutes over a sentence.
Lutz left at 7 p.m. to take a train to Philadelphia so he could
teach a class the next day. MacDonald stayed at the office until
1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will confuse the final product with an E.B. White essay,
but the emphasis on simplicity is apparent throughout the report.
It uses ``we'' and ``our,'' rather than ``the Service'' and
``USPS's.'' The section on transportation is only 27 lines, down
from 42 last year, because many of the statistics that had appeared
in long-winded sentences are now part of a chart.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Such struggles are common, particularly because the changes
often involve blunt criticism. ``There was a tremendous objection
to this at the beginning,'' DeNardo of Texaco said. Almost three
years later, though, the practice has become ingrained, and some
managers use plain language even in internal memos, he added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Similar changes have happened at Schwab and at American Century
Investments, both of which have simplified many documents besides
prospectuses. When employees ``saw we could do this with something
as complicated as a prospectus, there was a shift in perspective,''
said Roberta Laughlin, American Century's manager for education and
guidance. ``It's almost a mantra now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plain-language advocates hope they can next persuade phone and
cable companies to simplify their materials as they begin competing
with one another. Already, AT&AMP;T has hired Siegel &AMP; Gale to design
monthly bills that the company sends separately from local phone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But with a few notable exceptions _ among them the annual report
by Texaco and sales and leasing contracts for Ford cars _ plain
language is not yet common outside of the government and the
financial-services industry. Even in finance, said Paula R. David,
the director of client marketing at the Boston consulting firm,
Funds Distributor Inc., ``We had expected the industry to embrace
this more than it did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority decided merely to comply'' with the SEC rules
rather than rewrite all of their documents, Ms. David said.
</P>
<P>
   The language mavens say that raises a disquieting question,
particularly in the ninth year of an economic expansion: If a
recession comes, will companies decide that cutting consulting
costs is more important than cutting words? &QL;

 &HT;    Coke stock sinks after Ivester's retirement announcement
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly every company pays the price on Wall Street
when it's the subject of unexpected and disappointing news.
</P>
<P>
   But for Coca-Cola, known over the years for running a smooth
operation with stellar management and predictable performance, the
price appears to be quite high when it drops a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive day Tuesday, the company's stock got
hammered after news that Chairman and Chief Executive M. Douglas
Ivester will retire in April, passing the torch to Douglas Daft.
</P>
<P>
   Shares fell 6.25 percent, or $4, to close at $60.
</P>
<P>
   The selling accelerated Tuesday as more than 18 million shares
changed hands, compared with about 13 million Monday. That far
surpasses the average daily volume of about 4.4 million shares
during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday's announcement, the stock has lost 12 percent of
its value.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really extraordinary, what's happened,'' said Manny
Goldman, global beverage analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``It's the
perception of management uncertainty that I think has hurt the
stock. When push comes to shove, it's management that counts,
whether it's Coca-Cola or Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft, whose main experience with the company has been in Asia,
is the company's new president and chief operating officer. He is
slated to succeed Ivester in the top spot at the annual shareholder
meeting in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great confidence in Doug Daft,'' analyst Andrew Conway
of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter wrote Tuesday in a research report.
``However, Mr. Daft has a huge job in transitioning to his new
role. We do not believe he has the breadth of experience that Mr.
Ivester has accumulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway, who downgraded the stock to ``neutral'' from
``outperform,'' said it will take time for Daft to become more
familiar with regions for which he has not been responsible,
including the Americas and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the reasons Ivester is scheduled to stay at the
helm until April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug Ivester and Doug Daft will be working together closely
for the next few months in order to ensure a thorough transition,''
said company spokesman Ben Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   That transition will be on the minds of the company's board of
directors when it meets next Wednesday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the company's troubles on Wall Street is concern about
whether Ivester's retirement means its financial rebound may be
weaker or slower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Conway, for example, predicts next year's growth in case sales
will be 5 percent _ still well below the company's historical
target of 7 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, investors looked at Coca-Cola as a company that
can grow earnings from now until the end of time,'' Goldman said.
``That perception has been diminished. ... Coke has had
earnings-per-share growth in the mid-teens or higher for many
years. Now people are questioning that going forward.''

 &HT;    McCain touts military pay hike
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) sketched out a plan
for national defense Tuesday that would boost soldiers' morale by
fattening their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate proposed salary increases
and tax cuts for men and women in the armed forces that would cost
$5.7 billion over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The package is aimed at 12,000 enlisted personnel who need food
stamps and other aid to make ends meet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a stain upon the nation's honor that should shame us
all,'' McCain said, using the 58th anniversary of the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor to talk about military preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed both Democrats and Republicans for allowing a
deterioration of the military and pledged to get rid of unneeded
defense programs, including the Georgia-built C-130J transport
plane, to pay for higher wages and a more efficient fighting force.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to lavish attention on New Hampshire as a new
poll Tuesday showed him narrowly leading Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters/WHDH-TV poll showed McCain leading Bush 35 percent
to 32 percent. The difference is within the the poll's margin of
error of 4.7 percent, but the survey is significant because McCain
trailed Bush by 19 points in the same organizations' poll in
October.
</P>
<P>
   McCain appeared to benefit from his performance in the Dec. 2
debate in New Hampshire, the first to include Bush, according to
the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's outline for the military was the second in a
string of policy speeches he is giving in December.
</P>
<P>
   As in his talk on foreign affairs last week, McCain called for
building a missile defense system that would also be extended to
American allies around the globe. He acknowledged that such a
system would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would try to negotiate with the Russians to modify
it, but that he would withdraw from the treaty if the Russians
refused.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also discussed his ``rogue-state rollback,'' a plan to
use a variety of means including covert military aid to push for
new leaders in Iraq, North Korea and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's most specific proposal was to increase military pay
3 percent a year for the next three years, on top of the 4.8
percent raise in the new federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, men and women stationed overseas would not have to
pay federal income taxes, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modernizing weapons systems is important, but personnel issues
must come first,'' McCain said in remarks prepared for delivery
Tuesday night in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The pay increase would cost $4.3 billion over three years, while
the tax break would come to $800 million a year, McCain spokeswoman
Nancy Ives said.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to reporters following a speech at the Concord Rotary
Club, McCain actually spoke of a larger salary increase, totaling
16 percent over four years. Ives said he used the wrong numbers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain traveled to New York to receive the Intrepid Freedom
Award at the Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum. He served aboard the
aircraft carrier in the 1960s.

EXPERTS SAY STINTING OF TIME, PEOPLE AND MONEY LED TO LOST MARS
MISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARS-LANDER) 
(sw) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A string of embarrassing mistakes that doomed the $125 million
Mars Climate Orbiter in September may have helped pave the way for
the disappearance this week of the $165 million Mars Polar Lander,
NASA officials and private experts said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
issued a blistering 45-page report on the loss of the climate
orbiter, the first of two spacecraft meant to renew NASA's
exploratory push this year to the red planet. The report's findings
and recommendations included suggested ways to avert disaster with
the sister craft, which has fallen silent since trying to make its
planned landing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the November report found potential problems
in the complexity of the lander's engines and called for much
last-minute polishing and repairing to try to increase the odds of
a safe touchdown near the Martian south pole.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in light of the new failure, experts inside and
outside the space agency said that common troubles in the sister
programs and perhaps the anticipated engine woes accounted for the
current ominous silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell into cutting too many corners,'' a senior official at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which designed the two
spacecraft, said in an interview. ``We have to be smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   John E. Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American
Scientists, a Washington group, said NASA's climate orbiter
investigation showed that the Mars program had been desperately
short of time, personnel and money, with designers pushed to the
breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen this,'' Pike said. ``Anybody who has tried to
do too much work without enough people immediately recognizes the
symptoms. Stuff doesn't get done. Things fail.''
</P>
<P>
   The common problem behind the setbacks, Pike added, ``is some
combination of inadequate funding and inadequate management
preparation for low-budget missions.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of the first failed mission found poor training,
communication and support for the spacecraft team. Such failings,
experts said, will be key suspects in the new investigation as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the successful 1997 Mars Pathfinder mission, which the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory built and ran, the Mars Climate Orbiter
and Mars Polar Lander were designed by the Pasadena laboratory but,
in a cost-cutting move, built by Lockheed Martin Astronautics of
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The current pair of lost spacecraft cost about half as much as
their predecessors, the $270 million Pathfinder and its companion
orbiter, the $300 million Mars Global Surveyor.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the recent climate orbiter failure was
conducted by a nine-member NASA panel led by Arthur G. Stephenson
of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., and its
findings were made public on Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, painting a picture of widespread design and
management woes, cited not only a single main culprit but eight
contributing factors ``that led directly or indirectly to the loss
of the spacecraft.''
</P>
<P>
   A mixup between English and metric units in navigation data was
cited as the main reason the spacecraft went off course, and
probably to its destruction, as it was trying to orbit Mars in
September. All radio contact with the craft was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing flaws cited by the panel included insufficient team
training, undetected errors in computer models of thruster firings,
failures of the navigation team to know the spacecraft's
orientation in space, inadequate effort by system engineers to
track and double-check all mission aspects, a tendency for
communications to be too informal, failure to weigh the need for an
additional engine firing and the overworking of the navigation
team.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also faulted communications between the design
team at the Pasadena laboratory and the spacecraft builders in
Denver, calling some of the technical dialogues ``inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the panel made eight observations and
recommendations about the Mars Polar Lander in a bid to ward off
related failures. Several significant ones centered on the engines
and the lander's descent.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the panel warned that the hydrazine fuel for the
lander's retrorockets might freeze in space, producing ignition
delays, irregular pulses and possibly leading to a topsy-turvy
landing.
</P>
<P>
   The panel suggested that fuel-line heaters be turned on early to
begin warming the hydrazine, a precaution that NASA officials said
on Tuesday was taken before the lander began its descent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also expressed worry that the lander's 12 thrusters
had to act ``in unison to ensure a stable descent,'' and that such
a complex feat had never been tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be recognized that under extreme, worst-case
conditions,'' the panel said, ``some thrusters could produce near
zero thrust and some could produce nearly twice the expected
thrust.''
</P>
<P>
   It called for the design team to thoroughly review descent
preparations ``because of the extreme complexity of this landing
maneuver.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Stone, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's director, said
in reaction to the November report that the laboratory had
``mobilized the very best talent'' to fix identified flaws.
``Special attention,'' he said, ``is being directed at navigation
and propulsion issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a member of the reporting panel said its findings
were ``very valid'' in light of the new failure and were ``the
beginning of what we're doing'' by way of conducting an intensified
probe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Weiler, NASA's head of space science, told reporters
on Tuesday that a formal investigation of the polar lander
disappearance would include many experts who had investigated the
loss of the orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the particular kind of navigation error that
doomed the Mars Climate Orbiter in September was clearly not to
blame in the current vanishing act, since all signs in the final
hours and minutes of mission indicated that the Mars probe was
right on target.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added that factors like quality control would be
looked into carefully in the new investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's off the table,'' Weiler said.

   NEW YORK _ Characterizing New York City in a phrase or a
sentence is usually the activity of people who don't live here.
Those who do live here realize the vastness and the endless
contradiction of this wonderful, if trying, place and leave the
pronouncements to visitors. One description, however, does seem to
apply: ``world capital of success; world capital of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   A metaphor and microcosm of such a New York is certainly the
Metropolitan Opera, if indeed an operation so big can be called a
microcosm of anything. So large are its resources, so intricate its
workings and so wide its ambitions that the triumphs take on a
special profile, while the less than glorious hours present a
target unusually hittable by those who do not especially wish the
house well.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Met's ups and downs is a prime entertainment for
any music-loving city dweller. Though many call the house's vision
dull, its week-by-week operation offers plenty to chew on. Wagner's
``Tristan und Isolde,'' now near the end of its limited run, has
been a considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   Assembled were Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner, two principals who
represent the present and the future of an opera notoriously hard
to cast. With them was one of the important Wagner conductors of
the century, James Levine, and a pit orchestra as good as any in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Levine's ``Tristan,'' like much of his Wagner, is very slow, but
it was salutary to surrender to a different point of view and
follow it to a conclusion: a trip worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   In this production, high-resolution reproductions of Romantic
realism are abandoned in favor of something more abstract and
compact. Geometry replaces trees and rocks. Dieter Dorn creates
stage pictures that are unadorned and filled with a dignified
quietude. The Met's Tristan and Isolde are very big people, and yet
with their tenderest moments cast in silhouette and shadow, the
music of Act II floats largely free of corporeal references, and
the stage becomes true to both eye and ear.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four years ago, I would have agreed that Ms. Eaglen and
Heppner were more Wagnerian voices than Wagnerian singers. I think
that with this ``Tristan,'' the passage from technique to pure
music has largely been made. We seem to be climbing out of the
trough of mediocre singing that has trapped opera for almost a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking still is an Italian-repertory tenor to succeed Luciano
Pavarotti and Placido Domingo, but there is youth and strength
nearly everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of this ``Tristan,'' and I don't think triumph is
too strong a word, seems startling next to Boito's ``Mefistofele,''
a few weeks prior. The Met bears no original responsibility for
this seedy affair, which arrived here as a loaner from a consortium
of other opera companies. But one wonders how it was let inside at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The opera, despite a few soaring moments, is a little vulgar to
begin with. The present production had made its way from Europe
across much of the United States and, along the way, settled into a
vague dilapidation. Its garishness, which no amount of age and
fading can expunge, includes troupes of color-coded angels and
devils with wings and horns.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of this production created a lose-lose proposition.
For if the humor is unintentional, they are naive; if it is
intentional, they become something worse: cynical.
</P>
<P>
   A cultural machine as big as the Met's necessarily generates
politics and business as well as art. ``Mefistofele'' is at the Met
because of who took the title role. Samuel Ramey has made a
subspecialty of the part, and the current production has traveled
with him, providing its star not quite a one-man show but something
close to it.
</P>
<P>
   Ramey is a distinguished performer, and who is to deny him? His
international career is huge, but he is faithful to his American
roots and more particularly to the Met. He does the role well, and
the house can please a loyal son and his fans without the expense
of building a production of its own.
</P>
<P>
   At the performance I saw, the audience had a good time, but by
any measure this is not the quality of opera Metgoers are used to.
Put it down, perhaps, to the pressures of a repertory house: seven
performances, six days, a week.
</P>
<P>
   Some productions are just bad judgment to begin with, but in the
case of singers, the margins for error are thin indeed. Sudden
illness can tear a hole in an otherwise luxurious event, one that
no substitute can adequately fill. It happened with Verdi's
``Traviata'' last year, when multiple cancellations left the house
with upscale sets and mediocre or inappropriate singers wandering
around them.
</P>
<P>
   Second casts, the singers who relieve first-string operatives at
later performances of a run, can be unrelievable disasters,
especially at the prices the house is obliged to charge. One Met
official told me in a moment of weakness that there were evenings
when he wished he could simply cancel the performance and go home.
But for a financially self-sustaining operation like the Met, a
dark house means serious money trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the wonderful evenings spent in this house: at
Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of Spades,'' Britten's ``Death in Venice''
and ``Billy Budd,'' or Offenbach's ``Tales of Hoffmann.'' Now,
after the elaborate cleverness of John Corigliano's ``Ghosts of
Versailles'' and the general paleness of Philip Glass' ``Voyage,''
the Met tries a new American opera again, this time with John
Harbison's ``Great Gatsby.'' Good or bad, we won't be bored.

PINCAY POISED TO SET ALL-TIME VICTORIES RECORD

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before Ricky Walker retired as a jockey to become a racing
steward in Texas, he gave a shot at competing against the best in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   One of Walker's most memorable times on the track was not about
a horse he rode, but about a jockey he competed against, Laffit
Pincay Jr., who is ready to break Bill Shoemaker's all-time victory
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I rode against him, I was in front of him
turning for home,'' Walker said. ``But he was pretty hard with his
whip, and you could just hear him coming from back there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Walker got back to the jock's room after the race, he could
see why Pincay was such a powerful presence. All it took was for
Pincay to take off his shirt before he dressed into a new pair of
silks for the next race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a massive little muscle man,'' Walker said. ``A ball of
muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay is 52 years old, but the muscles haven't gone away. And
just like that day he was riding behind Walker, people at the
racetrack can hear him coming.
</P>
<P>
   Through 36 years and more than 44,500 rides, Pincay has won
8,831 races. It leaves him two victories short of tying Shoemaker's
record, three to beat it. And, with Pincay scheduled to ride seven
horses Wednesday at Hollywood Park, the record could be history by
day's end.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, as Pincay has drawn closer to ``Shoe,'' he
has been riding at a furious rate. Going into the weekend, Pincay
had ridden 26 winners in 23 days. He leads the jockey standings for
the first time in years at Hollywood Park. And he won his first
major stakes races in almost a year on Sunday when he rode Lazy
Lode to win the $400,000 Hollywood Turf Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, he's one of the greatest riders we've seen in our
game,'' Hall of Fame trainer Ron McAnally said. ``He's riding
terrific right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case not so long ago. In fact, it looked as if
Pincay was washed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only me, but I think even Laffit was wondering a few years
ago if he could still do this or if he should retire,'' said
McAnally, who once put Pincay on horses like two-time Horse of the
Year John Henry in the '80s and two-time Breeders' Cup winner
Bayakoa in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The low point possibly came at Santa Anita near Pasadena,
Calif., in 1997. Pincay lost the first 38 rides of the meet before
he finally got one to the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   But Pincay wouldn't have ridden that winner if it weren't for
the fact that the scheduled rider showed up late for work.
</P>
<P>
   So, after the race, Pincay admitted he was thinking about making
some drastic changes to his career. He was considering moving from
the competitive Southern California circuit to Northern California.
In terms of comparison, it would almost be like a baseball player
moving from the majors to Triple A.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record means a lot to me, first of all, because I think
`Shoe' is the greatest rider I have ever ridden against,'' Pincay
said. ``It's a record I thought no one would ever break.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, when I got to 8,000 wins (in 1993), I thought I might have
a chance at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pincay was losing the battle in Southern California. He
always had trouble maintaining the required weight for a jockey.
That's less than 120 pounds, and Pincay says doctors have told him
he normally should weigh 140 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Pincay would eat one cracker for lunch _ and
scrape away the salt before eating it. And there's another part of
his diet that has become one of the legendary stories in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay was traveling with trainer D. Wayne Lukas when lunch was
being served on the airplane. Pincay turned down the meal, and
instead took a peanut out of his shirt pocket. He split the peanut
in two and slowly ate the first half. He waited, then slowly chewed
the remaining portion.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas might have seen it that one time, but Pincay said he has
had many one-peanut meals.
</P>
<P>
   The weight struggle, made harder with advancing age, was getting
to him. He said he came close to fainting several times _ even
while on a horse. With young riders such as Gary Stevens, Alex
Solis and Kent Desormeaux becoming more established in California,
trainers were using Pincay less and less.
</P>
<P>
   So, Pincay actually retained a Northern California agent to
start booking rides. But when the time came, Pincay wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to give it another try,'' he said. ``I didn't
want to move. I just bought a house, and I didn't want to leave my
wife here.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Pincay knew, if he had to move to a less competitive arena
in order to break the record, he would cheapen something very
important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing pretty bad at the time,'' he said. ``I was
desperate to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than leave, Pincay kept fighting. He started
experimenting with foods he had never eaten much before. He
consumed fruits and gave up bran. He ate less fatty meats like
chicken and fish.
</P>
<P>
   And he increased his exercise regimen. In that new home, he
added a small gym and ``I reacted in a way I never thought I
would,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he could keep going. He said he won't retire immediately
after breaking the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying riding more than any other time in my life,''
Pincay said. ``As long as I feel that way _ I don't know if it's
going to be one, two or three more years _ I'm going to keep
riding.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe set a record that will never be broken. nn

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The global effort to rid the world of polio received a
major boost Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Foundation, a Ted Turner charity, announced
it would donate $28 million toward the eradication of the disease,
a goal the World Health Organization and the Atlanta-based Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention hope to reach by the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was joined by software tycoon Bill Gates, whose Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation will give an additional $50 million to the
polio effort. The two philanthropists challenged other foundations,
and governments as well, to further increase funding for the
international campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful news,'' said Dr. Stephen Cochi, who directs
CDC anti-polio programs. ``It is a big boost to the eradication
effort to have two new partners in the global fight against
polio.''
</P>
<P>
   The donations will not go directly to the CDC, UN or WHO. They
will be spent on training staff, equipping laboratories and
improving transportation of vaccines and investigators where polio
is still a major problem, according to David Harwood, spokesman for
the UN Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based group, which Turner established in 1998 to
distribute $1 billion to UN projects over 10 years, focuses on the
environment, women's health and children's health.
</P>
<P>
   The $28 million, which comes out of the $1 billion endowment,
``is the first major multi-year gift we have made,'' Harwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans think of polio as a defeated disease. Vaccine
discoveries in 1955 and 1961 ended the summer panics that emptied
parks and swimming pools, and the last known case in the Americas
was identified in 1994. (Several rare cases occur in the U.S. every
year due to immunizations gone wrong.)
</P>
<P>
   But in more than 30 countries in the Mideast, South Asia and
east and central Africa, the polio virus still circulates freely,
attacking children 3 years old and younger, and crippling them for
life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the CDC, WHO, UNICEF and other organizations launched
an international collaboration to eliminate polio from the world _
a goal that has been reached for only one other disease, smallpox.
Since then, recorded cases of polio have sunk from more than
350,000 to about 6,000 worldwide, though experts fear 10 times as
many cases go unreported because of poor public-health surveillance
in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Because polio causes symptoms in only a percentage of those who
are infected _ and because trade and rapid travel have created
intimate connections between countries _ authorities believe the
whole world will remain at risk until polio is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   To reach that goal by the end of 2000, and confirm it by the end
of 2005, requires three separate strategies, Cochi said: high
levels of routine vaccination among children less than a year old;
sophisticated surveillance and laboratory analysis to identify
cases that occur despite vaccinations; and special efforts to
blanket under-developed countries with additional protection
through national one-day mobilizations and house-to-house ``mopping
up'' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   WHO has made the special-effort campaigns a high priority in 10
countries, five with the highest remaining rates of polio
transmission and five where ongoing wars make thorough immunization
difficult: Afghanistan, Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Somalia, Sudan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Combatting polio in those countries is extremely expensive and
labor-intensive. During National Immunization Days, which happen in
polio-endemic countries at least twice a year, it demands enough
organization to line up every child in the country younger than 5
to receive a dose of vaccine, as well as enough coordination to get
viable vaccine to the thousands of stations distributing it. One
such campaign is scheduled for Dec. 19 in India.
</P>
<P>
   Between campaigns, polio eradication requires having enough
trained staff to make regular visits to rural hospitals and
clinics, identifying cases of paralysis from recent records; track
down the sick child in rough or disorganized terrain; take careful
samples that are forwarded to a worldwide laboratory network; and
find the child again 60 days later to see whether the paralysis has
persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the greatest need will be for these funds,''
Cochi said. ``To carry out these activities successfully, you have
to have a structure and network in each country, going down to the
district level, with trained personnel who are that country's
nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly donated funds will also go to support the
international network of laboratories that analyze potential cases
of polio and alert health authorities to its persistence, the UN
Foundation's Harwood said. That will bring ongoing benefits once
polio is eliminated, he added: ``What the polio-eradication
initiative really wants to do is train people in the countries, so
a public-health infrastructure is created and the knowledge the
personnel gain can be sustained. That way it can be used in the
future, against other diseases beyond polio.''
</P>
<P>
   Though eliminating polio is a cherished global goal,
international authorities had recently warned that it could not be
achieved without significant additional investment. WHO estimated
earlier this year that the eradication campaign would fall $500
million short of its $1.25 billion price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, WHO, UNICEF and the service organization Rotary
International, the volunteer shock troops of the anti-polio effort,
warned that an additional $50 million was needed just to buy the
vaccines that should be administered next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on track to eradicate polio,'' WHO Director-General Dr.
Gro Harlem Brundtland said Tuesday in response to the Turner and
Gates gifts. ``One of the biggest challenges we now face is raising
the necessary funds to finish the job on time. With this kind of
contribution, a polio-free world is within reach and one of the
world's largest health initiatives can be brought to a successful
conclusion.''

world's largest health initiatives can be brought to a successful
conclusion.''

 &HT;    U.S. billionaires give support to polio eradication cause
 &HT;    (EDS: MOVING TO (a) General news, (f) Financial and (l)
Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The global effort to rid the world of polio received a
major boost Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Foundation, a Ted Turner charity, announced
it would donate $28 million toward the eradication of the disease,
a goal the World Health Organization and the Atlanta-based Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention hope to reach by the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was joined by software tycoon Bill Gates, whose Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation will give an additional $50 million to the
polio effort. The two philanthropists challenged other foundations,
and governments as well, to further increase funding for the
international campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful news,'' said Dr. Stephen Cochi, who directs
CDC anti-polio programs. ``It is a big boost to the eradication
effort to have two new partners in the global fight against
polio.''
</P>
<P>
   The donations will not go directly to the CDC, UN or WHO. They
will be spent on training staff, equipping laboratories and
improving transportation of vaccines and investigators where polio
is still a major problem, according to David Harwood, spokesman for
the UN Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based group, which Turner established in 1998 to
distribute $1 billion to UN projects over 10 years, focuses on the
environment, women's health and children's health.
</P>
<P>
   The $28 million, which comes out of the $1 billion endowment,
``is the first major multi-year gift we have made,'' Harwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans think of polio as a defeated disease. Vaccine
discoveries in 1955 and 1961 ended the summer panics that emptied
parks and swimming pools, and the last known case in the Americas
was identified in 1994. (Several rare cases occur in the U.S. every
year due to immunizations gone wrong.)
</P>
<P>
   But in more than 30 countries in the Mideast, South Asia and
east and central Africa, the polio virus still circulates freely,
attacking children 3 years old and younger, and crippling them for
life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the CDC, WHO, UNICEF and other organizations launched
an international collaboration to eliminate polio from the world _
a goal that has been reached for only one other disease, smallpox.
Since then, recorded cases of polio have sunk from more than
350,000 to about 6,000 worldwide, though experts fear 10 times as
many cases go unreported because of poor public-health surveillance
in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Because polio causes symptoms in only a percentage of those who
are infected _ and because trade and rapid travel have created
intimate connections between countries _ authorities believe the
whole world will remain at risk until polio is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   To reach that goal by the end of 2000, and confirm it by the end
of 2005, requires three separate strategies, Cochi said: high
levels of routine vaccination among children less than a year old;
sophisticated surveillance and laboratory analysis to identify
cases that occur despite vaccinations; and special efforts to
blanket under-developed countries with additional protection
through national one-day mobilizations and house-to-house ``mopping
up'' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   WHO has made the special-effort campaigns a high priority in 10
countries, five with the highest remaining rates of polio
transmission and five where ongoing wars make thorough immunization
difficult: Afghanistan, Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Somalia, Sudan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Combatting polio in those countries is extremely expensive and
labor-intensive. During National Immunization Days, which happen in
polio-endemic countries at least twice a year, it demands enough
organization to line up every child in the country younger than 5
to receive a dose of vaccine, as well as enough coordination to get
viable vaccine to the thousands of stations distributing it. One
such campaign is scheduled for Dec. 19 in India.
</P>
<P>
   Between campaigns, polio eradication requires having enough
trained staff to make regular visits to rural hospitals and
clinics, identifying cases of paralysis from recent records; track
down the sick child in rough or disorganized terrain; take careful
samples that are forwarded to a worldwide laboratory network; and
find the child again 60 days later to see whether the paralysis has
persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the greatest need will be for these funds,''
Cochi said. ``To carry out these activities successfully, you have
to have a structure and network in each country, going down to the
district level, with trained personnel who are that country's
nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly donated funds will also go to support the
international network of laboratories that analyze potential cases
of polio and alert health authorities to its persistence, the UN
Foundation's Harwood said. That will bring ongoing benefits once
polio is eliminated, he added: ``What the polio-eradication
initiative really wants to do is train people in the countries, so
a public-health infrastructure is created and the knowledge the
personnel gain can be sustained. That way it can be used in the
future, against other diseases beyond polio.''
</P>
<P>
   Though eliminating polio is a cherished global goal,
international authorities had recently warned that it could not be
achieved without significant additional investment. WHO estimated
earlier this year that the eradication campaign would fall $500
million short of its $1.25 billion price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, WHO, UNICEF and the service organization Rotary
International, the volunteer shock troops of the anti-polio effort,
warned that an additional $50 million was needed just to buy the
vaccines that should be administered next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on track to eradicate polio,'' WHO Director-General Dr.
Gro Harlem Brundtland said Tuesday in response to the Turner and
Gates gifts. ``One of the biggest challenges we now face is raising
the necessary funds to finish the job on time. With this kind of
contribution, a polio-free world is within reach and one of the
world's largest health initiatives can be brought to a successful
conclusion.''

CALIFORNIA COMPANY BUYS AUTO INDUSTRY DATA NETWORK
</HEADLINE>
  (mg) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A privately held California company announced on
Tuesday that it had bought the assets and operations of the auto
industry's private data network, the latest in a series of moves by
automakers as they begin switching their vast purchasing systems to
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have been developing
software to set up electronic marketplaces next year on the
once-obscure private network. The marketplaces could be used to
conduct bidding and to place purchase orders for auto parts or even
for services like health care for employees.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to use the software on the Internet as well. Ford hopes
to do so but still has concerns about whether Internet transactions
will be safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Automotive Industry Action Group, a consortium of GM, Ford,
DaimlerChrysler AG and 1,600 of their parts suppliers, sold the
network's computers, software, patents, copyrights and brands to
the Science Applications International Corp., a company in San
Diego. SAIC will manage the Automotive Network Exchange, as it is
known, although auto industry executives would remain on the
network's governing committee. Terms of the sale were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Buchanan, a steel industry executive on one of the
committees that helped design the Automotive Network Exchange, said
the sale was necessary because the group did not have the money
needed to expand the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``SAIC brings some deep pockets to the table,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   SAIC said it planned to add features, including video
conferencing.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers believe that the network offers tighter security than
the Internet. Users have special phone lines to the network's
computers, although there are plans for dial-up access.
Transmissions would be heavily encrypted.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are working on ways to take bids for
multimillion-dollar auto parts contracts over the Internet but are
wary that rivals might figure out a way to steal information.
Whatever system is used ``has to be secure, because none of us want
to be able to see each other's product development plans as they're
buzzing through the lines,'' said Mark Baughman, Ford's manager of
supplier electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   David Barnas, a GM spokesman, said the automaker believed it
could safely conduct electronic commerce with suppliers over the
Internet and did not need to rely exclusively on the elaborate
security of the private data network.
</P>
<P>
   The network connects the automakers' computers to those of 250
suppliers; 200 more suppliers have applied to join the network. The
network has already been used to exchange confidential blueprints
of car models and to transmit bids for auto parts contracts.
Automakers also use the network to send hourly updates of assembly
plant activity to suppliers, who then send auto parts in time for
them to be installed on vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The data network will be expanding into other industries tied to
the automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals and health care insurers in southeastern Michigan will
start using the network next spring to exchange information, said
Dennis McCafferty, the vice president for product development at
the Greater Detroit Area Health Council.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Trent, SAIC's senior vice president for e-business, said
the company hoped to bring other industries onto the network.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   SAIC is owned by its 36,000 employees and is best known for its
purchase in late 1997 of Bell Communications Research, the research
arm of the regional Bell telephone companies. SAIC, which had $4.7
billion in revenue last year, also designs military and scientific
computer systems.

OWNER OF TAMPA BAY TEAM TRIED TO SELL IT TO BUY N.Y. JETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a strange twist to the nearly completed process of selling
the Jets, the owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last month
attempted to engineer the sale of his own football team in order to
make a run at buying the New York Jets, three people involved in,
or familiar with, the proposed transaction said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The brief, but audacious, maneuver began in late November when
Malcolm Glazer, the Bucs' owner, assigned his investment banker, SG
Cowen, to find a buyer for the Bucs. The maneuver now appears to be
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Glazer, an executive vice president of the Bucs and one of
three Glazer sons involved with the team, denied the story through
a spokesman, Reggie Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for SG Cowen, a prominent sports industry financier,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   For Glazer to execute his unusual plan, he would have most
likely required the approval of the finance committee of the
National Football League, if not the entire ownership. One owner
said, ``I don't think the league would stand for it.'' Glazer is a
member of the finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   The only transaction in the NFL that was remotely similar to
Glazer's proposal occurred in 1972, when Robert Irsay bought the
Los Angeles Rams and then swapped them for the Baltimore Colts,
owned by Carroll Rosenbloom. If the league had approved Glazer's
plan, he would have then placed the team in trust for SG Cowen to
sell because he would not have been able to sell the Bucs in time
to buy the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   He would have also needed to persuade the Hess estate and
Goldman, Sachs, which is handling the Jets' sale, to delay the
process in order for him to formally apply to buy the New York team
and to examine the Jets' finances. Wednesday is the deadline for
bidders to submit final offers for the Jets. Charles Dolan, the
chairman of Cablevision; Robert Wood Johnson IV, an heir to the
Johnson &AMP; Johnson fortune, and Sam Grossman, a real estate
developer from Phoenix, are the leading suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Three executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
that Glazer believes the Bucs have attained maximum value because
of the success of the $168 million Raymond James Stadium, which
opened in 1998. It was financed when Hillsborough County voters
approved a half-cent sales tax increase in 1996. The vote survived
a lawsuit that charged that the stadium served no public purpose.
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams are selling at a premium, with the Washington Redskins
(plus FedEx Field) going for $800 million and the new Houston
franchise costing $700 million earlier this year. Forbes magazine
recently estimated that the Bucs are the league's third-most
valuable team, at $502 million. Forbes valued the Jets at $363
million, No. 17 on its list.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been able to unload the Bucs (8-4), Glazer would have
sold a team now in a first-place tie with the Lions in the National
Football Conference Central division. Tampa Bay plays Detroit on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Glazer would very likely have had a more difficult time
attaining maximum value with the Jets, who have a lease at Giants
Stadium that yields relatively low revenues. One of the pitches
used to market the Jets is the possibility of a new stadium in the
future, which would have much more lucrative terms for the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Glazer, 71, who is from Rochester, N.Y., acquired the Bucs four
years ago for $192 million, then a record, after several attempts
to buy an NFL team, including the New England Patriots. He is the
president of First Allied Corp., a holding company for his
investments in food service equipment, food packaging,
broadcasting, health care and marine protein.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Amid continuing criticism over the police department's
handling of the protests here last week that eclipsed the World
Trade Organization meeting, the city's police chief announced
Tuesday that he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   The chief, Norm Stamper, said he wished to ``de-politicize'' the
investigations that are under way into police preparations for the
global trade talks, which drew 35,000 protesters downtown. The
demonstrations quickly turned into a tumultuous affair, televised
worldwide, in which the police sprayed tear gas and rubber pellets
at many peaceful protesters along police lines near the meeting but
failed to stop the window-smashing and looting by a relatively
small group of vandals less than a block away. The National Guard
was called in to help restore order.
</P>
<P>
   In his resignation letter to Mayor Paul Schell, Stamper praised
his officers for the ``restraint, discipline, perseverance and
incredible courage'' he said they showed in the face of the
protests, and noted that there were no deaths or serious injuries
reported during nearly a week of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   But the police and Schell have been hit by complaints from
virtually all sides: from protesters and residents of neighborhoods
in and around downtown who say the tear gas, pepper spray and
rubber pellets they endured were wildly inappropriate; by merchants
who say the vandalism caused at least $3 million in damages and
much more than that in lost holiday sales, and even from some
police officers, who have spoken up to assert that the department
was unprepared for the protests.
</P>
<P>
   In handing in his resignation, Stamper may take a bit of the
political heat off of Schell, although the mayor made a point of
dismissing any suggestion that he had sought or forced the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was Norm's, and Norm's alone,'' Schell said at a
news conference Tuesday morning, adding that he had tried to talk
the chief out of resigning. But the mayor's critics, including some
City Council members, quickly cast the resignation as an effort to
make Stamper the scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   And the resignation may be only the beginning of the political
fallout from an event that was intended to showcase Seattle as a
world-class city and friend to both free speech and free trade.
Schell, who is up for re-election in 2001, turned back questions
Tuesday morning about whether he himself might resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to step down,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Schell, a former director of community development and dean of
the University of Washington's school of architecture and urban
planning, had wanted to provide the protesters a broad forum to
make their points, and he and Stamper had spent months working with
leaders of the protest forces to ensure the demonstrations would be
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor spoke of Seattle offering a model of ``constructive
debate'' on trade issues, and, as the protests got out of hand, he
appeared stunned and saddened, saying: ``This administration has
people who marched in the 1960s _ the last thing I wanted was to be
mayor of a city that called in the National Guard.''
</P>
<P>
   For that approach, he has certainly drawn some praise, and one
snap poll late last week by a local television station, KOMO-TV,
the ABC affiliate in Seattle, found that 26 percent of Seattle
residents interviewed said they had a higher opinion of the mayor
at the end of the week than they had at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   But in the main, he has been roundly criticized for the way the
city prepared for and handled the protests. The City Council is
opening hearings into the events, which will be open to protesters,
residents, merchants, police officers and anyone else who wants to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   At least two civil-rights groups are calling for investigations
into police conduct, and the local branch of the NAACP also called
for an inquiry into an incident in which officers stopped a black
City Council member, Richard McIver, who was headed to a WTO
reception. Despite showing his identification, McIver said, he was
pulled out of his car, had his hands wrenched behind his back by
two officers and was nearly arrested.
</P>
<P>
   And the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has
sharply criticized the city's imposition of what the group believes
was an unconstitutional no-protest zone in a roughly 30-block area
of the downtown.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was something of a subtext to the chain of events leading
to the decision by Stamper, 55, to resign after nearly six years as
head of the force. While widely praised in some quarters of this
relatively liberal city for his numerous outreach efforts to the
community, he was deeply unpopular with many conservative political
leaders and with some police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Just half a year after taking over in February 1994, he upset
some officers when he wore his uniform in a gay-pride parade but
forbade his officers from wearing their uniforms at a ``March for
Jesus'' on the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when one of his officers shot and killed an unarmed
black man during a domestic-violence dispute, Stamper apologized at
a community meeting organized by black leaders for what he termed a
``wrongful death.'' Later, though, he told reporters that he
supported an inquest jury's conclusion that the shooting had been
accidental.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he told a Seattle Post-Intelligencer columnist that as
a young police officer in San Diego, he had beaten up gays and used
racial slurs to harass members of minority groups. ``Gay bashing
was not only acceptable, it was more or less required,'' he said,
and he added that he had ``regularly jacked around young people and
people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   While he expressed deep remorse for those actions and gained
some praise for his candor, many police officers in Seattle and
elsewhere were outraged, believing Stamper had branded them all
racists and gay-bashers. Shortly after the column appeared, Stamper
interrupted a vacation to apologize in person to veteran officers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And most recently, Stamper's department was weathering a scandal
over its failure to unearth details about a case in which a veteran
homicide detective was suspected of stealing $10,000 from a crime
scene and his sergeant was accused of covering up the crime. (A
first trial of the detective ended in a hung jury.)
</P>
<P>
   Stamper alluded to some of his roller-coaster history in his
letter to Mayor Schell, saying: ``Although my personal beliefs and
political views have often been at odds with many of my colleagues,
I've managed to love almost every moment of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stamper's action Tuesday was clearly linked to the
handling of last week's protests.
</P>
<P>
   While merchants and many protesters were furious, so were police
officers. Some have already talked of suing the city, and Tuesday
morning the police union president, Mike Edwards, said that many
officers were equipped with deficient equipment and forced to spend
as much as 20 hours straight on the police lines without food or
other support.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Smith, a 10-year veteran of the force, complained last
week to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that the department was
completely unprepared, despite advance warning that the town would
be flooded with protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like they closed their eyes and said, `I hope
nothing happens,''' he told the newspaper, which also reported news
of Stamper's impending resignation in this morning's edition, hours
before the mayor made it official.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper said he had intended to resign sometime next year
anyway, after he had seen the force through both the WTO
demonstrations and any disruptions that might occur in the city
because of the Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief, who once wrote an undergraduate thesis at San
Diego State University titled ``The Community as DMZ: Breaking Down
the Police Paramilitary Bureaucracy,'' said he decided to make it
clear now that he was intending to leave, probably sometime around
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's natural for people to say, `Well of course the
police chief is going to say this or say that, do this or do that
because he wants to keep his job,''' he said Tuesday at the news
conference. ``What I've said is, I'm not abandoning my job, I'm
retiring from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell, by contrast, said that he had no intention of his
leaving his job, and believed that he could be a part of bringing
the city back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole community's hurting, I'm hurting,'' said the mayor.
``And I think that it's time to understand what happened, what can
we learn from it as a community. And before we start assigning
guilt the first step is, let's get the facts. All of us, together.
And then make our conclusions.''

 &HT;    Profile of the Father: Daft's son speaks out on newly-announced
CEO dad
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next boss of the world's biggest soft drink
company didn't join the corporation 30 years ago to sell more
Coca-Colas.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Daft, who grew up in a small coal-mining city in
Australia, just wanted to see the world, says his 21-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad had always wanted a chance to travel overseas,'' says
Nicholas Daft, a senior majoring in Asian studies at Williams
College in Williamstown, Mass. ``I don't think he had ever traveled
out of Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick's father phoned him at his dorm room Saturday morning to
say it looked like he would be getting a new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Oh really?'
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Yes. Mister Ivester is retiring, and he asked me to be
chairman.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was very emotional,'' Nick says. ``It was something
that my dad had not expected at all. All I could think was how
proud I was of my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coca-Cola board held a special meeting the next day to vote
on the changes, and on Monday, the company announced Ivester's
planned retirement and Daft's selection as his eventual
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't working at Coke with the desire to be chairman,''
Nick says.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the son's descriptions of his 56-year-old father.
Coca-Cola's next leader appears to be unlike Ivester, a former
company accountant who often works seven days a week and publicly
shows few interests outside of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nick says his father works hard during the week, ``but for him,
weekends are times for him to enjoy himself.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been easy lately. As head of Coca-Cola's Middle and
Far East Group, Daft has spent the last two years trying to undo
the company's troubles in nation's where economies have been on the
slide. He travels two or three weeks a month and endures three or
four days of jet lag each time he returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has traveled more in the last couple of years than he ever
has,'' Nick says. ``My mother (Delphine) has traveled with him and
that has made it a lot easier for my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   In a management restructuring in October, Ivester gave Daft
additional responsibilities to head operations in Africa and at the
new Schweppes Beverages Division. This week, Daft was promoted to
president and chief operating officer, and the board indicated he
will become chairman and chief executive officer in April.
</P>
<P>
   Nick says his father likes to joke around, but one thing
particularly irks him: people giving up when faced with difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done that a couple times. My dad is a big believer in
just sticking with something.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Daft fly fishes with a passion: in Utah, in
Massachusetts near his son's college and in Switzerland, where the
family owns a chalet and has often spent summers and Christmas
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 42, Douglas Daft began taking ski lessons, so that
he could join his children on the slopes. (His daughter, Alexandra,
26, is married and works at a department store in Portland, Ore.)
</P>
<P>
   The family remains close, according to the son.
</P>
<P>
   Daft and his wife see their children regularly. They have
visited their son at college six times just since September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time for me to have a good meal out of the dining
hall,'' Nick says. But they don't go to college bars. ``My dad is
usually asleep by 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick describes his father's upbringing in New South Wales as
middle class. Douglas Daft's parents owned a shoe store near the
city of Cessnock about two hours north of Sydney in eastern
Australia. It's a community where the dominant coal mining industry
has been on the wane for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked hard,'' is the message Nick has gotten about his
grandparents. But it wasn't all sweat. Douglas Daft played piano
and, along with a friend, would trot out show tunes at a local
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt he would do well in life,'' said Daft's
80-year-old mother, Bessie, who still lives in Australia, ``because
of the way he went from better to better.'' Daft also called his
``mum'' about the good news. She told the Australian press she
``went wobbly at the knees'' after learning of the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Daft encourages his son to do well at school, ``but he said
sometimes he himself didn't do quite as much work as he should have
done'' in college. After college, the elder Daft got a job as a
math and science teacher at a high school in Sydney. It was there
that he met Delphine, a French teacher, whom he would later marry.
</P>
<P>
   Daft joined Coca-Cola as a planner in Sydney, but it led to a
life on the road for him and his family. Nick was born in Hong
Kong, his sister in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The family later moved to Japan, then to Atlanta, when Daft got
a promotion eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the travel and the many countries, Nick said his
father repeated a basic motto: ``Be kind with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to business, his father was most proud of his
success in building up Coca-Cola's sales in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is just a hard worker who has confidence in what he is
doing,'' Nick says. ``But he will listen to other people's
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Daft has most often sought counsel from retired
Coca-Cola President Donald Keogh and Steve Weiss, a longtime friend
and consultant to Coca-Cola who came to Atlanta around the same
time as Daft and his family.
</P>
<P>
   As for his father's new job, Nick says, ``I think my dad just
wants to restore the confidence in Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that it really is a great product, that it serves
a great purpose.''

A SOCIALIST, MINDING THE PAST CAREFULLY, CLOSES IN ON CHILE'S
PRESIDENCY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ In a country still emerging from a quarter of
a century of revolution and counterrevolution, the presidential
campaign of Ricardo Lagos flies the red Socialist Party flag and is
infused with the memories of revolutionary dreams dashed by the
military coup of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A Lagos campaign headquarters here is decorated with a poster
emblazoned ``With Allende Always,'' memorializing the last Chilean
Socialist Party member to occupy the presidential palace. When
Lagos joined in a televised debate with Joaquin Lavin, the main
conservative candidate, last month, the widow of President Salvador
Allende Gossens, who died in the coup, sat in the front row
cheering the man she hopes will revive her husband's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But with Lagos slightly ahead in the polls as Sunday's election
nears, he and his aides have engaged in a critical reassessment of
the party's performance in the Allende years in speeches,
interviews and before a panel of military officers and human rights
lawyers negotiating how to atone for the thousands of people who
disappeared during the regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who
overthrew Allende.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos and other Socialists have implicitly blamed the party's
radicalism for the country's hyperinflation, shortages and economic
collapse in 1972 and 1973. They have conceded that the Socialists
went far beyond their governing partner, the Communist Party, in
encouraging peasant land invasions, worker takeovers of factories,
and even calling on military units to mutiny, acknowledging that
such actions were a crucial cause for the coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the interests of the party before the interests of the
people,'' Lagos said last week at a campaign stop full of symbolism
_ the presentation of a book of speeches and essays written by
Radomiro Tomic, the Christian Democrat who ran for president
against Allende in 1970. Quoting Tomic, Lagos added, ``There are no
innocents in the destruction of Chilean democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ricardo Nunez Munoz, the Socialist Party president, said in
an interview: ``It's wrong to say that the CIA, the armed forces
and the bourgeoisie alone brought down the Allende government. It's
obvious we need to admit we made critical economic and political
errors that were as decisive if not more decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's possible some are frightened by the prospect of
another Socialist president, but while Ricardo Lagos is a son of
the Allende years, he and we know another Allende-like experiment
would only be a colossal failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the self-criticism are in large part tactical at
a time when most Chilean voters reject either political extreme.
But the often painful reflections underscore how far the Socialist
Party has come from the days it sent fighters to join Che Guevara
in Bolivia, declared its overriding philosophy as Marxist-Leninist
in 1967, and accepted the help of East German intelligence agents
to spirit out its main party leader in the days after the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that many Christian Democrats and other moderate
voters are still fretful that a victory for Lagos could threaten
the country's stability even though he is running in a coalition
supported by the Christian Democratic Party. That swing vote _
representing up to 10 percent of the electorate _ is also being
sought by Lavin, a former low-level economist in the Pinochet
dictatorship whose campaign statements have been surprisingly
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jose Antonio Viera-Gallo, a Socialist who served as deputy
secretary of justice in the Allende government, said, ``Lagos has
to win the heart of the Christian Democratic Party and show he is a
candidate of unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos was poised to become Allende's ambassador to the Soviet
Union at the time of the coup. Now, after stints as education and
public works minister in two governments led by Christian
Democrats, he hews to an extremely moderate line. During the
campaign he has posed with David Rockefeller and George Soros for
photographs that have been displayed prominently in the Chilean
press, and he has pledged to push forward with privatization of the
ports and public water systems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As for the state copper company, expropriated and nationalized
by Allende, Lagos has pledged to seek joint ventures with foreign
investors to expand the company's reach to international markets.
He has promised not to negotiate with the Communist Party to win
its backing if, as expected, no candidate wins a majority on
Sunday, forcing a runoff election in January.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has even broken with human rights advocates by pledging
that if elected he will continue the current government's policy of
contesting the efforts by a Spanish judge to extradite Pinochet
from Britain and try him on charges of torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the limits of the possible and I understand that I have
an obligation to lead the citizenry on a responsible path,'' Lagos
told business leaders last month. Lagos did not name Allende in his
speech _ he rarely ever mentions the former president _ but he
repeatedly drew a sharp distinction between the government he plans
to lead and the only one previously led by a Socialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about opening the Pandora's box of populism,'' Lagos
told the business leaders. ``The world has changed and we have all
learned.''
</P>
<P>
   The learning process, Lagos and other Socialist Party leaders
said, began almost immediately after the coup, when Socialist
activists spread throughout Europe and Latin America in exile. Many
party members gradually moderated their views while living in the
Netherlands and Sweden, where they were influenced by local Social
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Most party leaders went to East Germany, where they were treated
to generous allowances and special educational and housing
privileges otherwise granted only to East German Communist Party
leaders. But tensions grew in the party when the German hosts told
the Chilean Socialist rank and file that they did not have the
right to travel outside East Germany, or even move from one East
German town to another, without the explicit permission of their
party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The party finally split in 1979 between a pro-Soviet faction and
a more Social Democratic faction, which moved to join other exiles
in Italy and France and some even back to Chile to organize
nonviolent protests. The reformist winds of Eurocommunism made a
big impact on many in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico Berlinguer, the reformist Italian Communist Party leader,
made an important impression on the Chilean Socialists when he
wrote three essays criticizing the Allende government for pressing
a far too radical agenda without first organizing broader support.
Out of those writings came Berlinguer's eventual coalition with the
Italian Christian Democrats, and they contributed to the Chilean
Socialists' own alliance with the Chilean Christian Democrats
despite that party's early support for the Pinochet coup.
</P>
<P>
   Also vital to the transformation was the rise of Solidarity in
Poland in the early 1980s, when many Chilean Socialists came out in
support of the union against the communist regime. ``You can't cry
out for human rights and fight for a dictatorship of the left,''
Viera-Gallo said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the changes there are still Socialist Party
members who express discomfort with the free enterprise system. In
a nod to the left, Lagos has run on the slogan ``Growth with
Equality'' and promised to make the fight against unemployment his
No. 1 priority. Socialist leaders cannot help but express their
glee over the irony that their candidate is the likely next
president, while Pinochet has been under house arrest outside
London for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-seven years after being thrown out so cruelly in a
coup, a president of our party taking power would give us great
satisfaction,'' said Nunez, the Socialist Party president with a
mirthful grin. ``But Lagos is not going to enter La Moneda as the
second Allende.''

MARKETPLACE: CENDANT AGREES TO SETTLE FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
(mk) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cendant Corp., the big franchiser that operates Ramada Inn
hotels and Avis car rental agencies, agreed Tuesday to pay its
stockholders $2.8 billion to settle charges of widespread
accounting fraud that wiped out billions in the company's market
value. The settlement is by far the largest ever in a securities
class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders, led by the pension funds of New York state,
New York City and California, contended that CUC Inc., a computer
and telephone shopping services company that combined with HFS Inc.
in 1997 to form Cendant, had greatly inflated earnings and profits
and that executives no longer with the company sold shares before
the irregularities were publicly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that engaged in egregious and fraudulent
practices,'' said H. Carl McCall, the New York state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Newark, N.J., and the Securities
and Exchange Commission are continuing criminal investigations into
the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cendant plunged to $19 from $35 on April 16, 1998, a
day after the company announced widespread accounting
irregularities at CUC, reducing the company's value by $14.4
billion. McCall said that the New York State Common Retirement
Fund, the New York City Pension Funds and the California Public
Employees' Retirement System lost a combined $89 million on that
day. .
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the pension funds, which held 11.7 million shares
when the fraud was disclosed, expected to recover 40 percent to 60
percent of their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant did not detail the accounting irregularities in April,
but the company reported in August 1998 that more than $640 million
in profits reported for the previous three years had been
fictional. The inflated profits, state officials said, helped to
drive up the share price of CUC and make it attractive to potential
merger partners. CUC executives, along with other shareholders,
benefited individually as the stock price rose.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than two weeks before the August announcement, the
former chairman and chief executive of CUC, Walter Forbes, and
eight former CUC directors resigned from the board. Forbes has
denied any knowledge of the accounting irregularities. Four other
senior CUC executives resigned after the disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $2.8 billion settlement, Cendant also agreed,
at the insistence of the pension funds, to several changes in its
corporate structure to create a more independent board and to
prevent executives from increasing stock option benefits without
the consent of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a unique class action waged by large plaintiffs and
not your typical class action by owners of 100 shares or so,'' said
John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in
corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These large pension funds,'' he said, ``were properly trying
in this action to not only recover financial losses but to realize
their priorities in corporate governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Silverman, the chief executive of Cendant, said the
settlement ``brings closure to this most unfortunate event.''

FOR A GENTLE GIANT, A BIG FIRST STEP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ When Michael Clarke Duncan steps out of his
Chevrolet Suburban, one of the really, really big ones, he makes it
look like a Volkswagen Rabbit. At 6-foot-5 and 316 pounds, he is a
human wall, and his hand, which he offers with a smile of unalloyed
delight, is big enough to swallow a grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, I wanted to come to Hollywood,'' he said. ``It
was something my mother always wanted to do, but nobody pushed
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Until just recently, Duncan, 36, could still walk down a crowded
street or work out at his local gym without people turning their
heads or, except in rare instances, asking for his autograph (and
most of the times that happens, he said, people are mistaking him
for the actor Ving Rhames).
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, ``The Green Mile'' opened in theaters all over
the country. Directed by Frank Darabont, whose first film, ``The
Shawshank Redemption,'' drew seven Academy Award nominations in
1995, it is also based on a Stephen King story and also set in a
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In this movie, Tom Hanks plays a Death Row prison guard in the
1930s who comes to believe that one of his prisoners, a gentle and
somewhat dim giant played by Duncan, has supernatural healing
powers and may, in fact, be a kind of angel.
</P>
<P>
   Not too bad for a guy who, just a few years ago, was sitting in
a fleabag hotel talking to cockroaches, who once almost gave up
acting to join the Los Angeles Police Department and who spent most
of his years in Hollywood playing security guard and limo driver to
a who's who of black actors and comedians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really like a gift from God,'' Duncan said. ``I tell
people, `It's just like a cliche, but it's true: in Hollywood,
dreams can come true.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Duncan has put his struggling days
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still take my camera to every premiere, to every photo
shoot,'' Duncan said. ``Tom Hanks or somebody will say to me,
`Michael, you are the only actor who carries a camera.' I tell
them: `Hey, I know it's no big deal for you guys. But it's still a
very big deal to me.' I mean, you know, I'll see Billy Crystal
walking up and it's like, wow, Billy Crystal, so I snap a picture.
I want to have something later on to prove that this really
happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks allowed as how, yes, it is true about Duncan and his
camera. ``He brings cameras pretty much everywhere that is
connected to the movie,'' Hanks said. ``He just can't believe that
he has been invited to these places. But as far as anyone ragging
him about it, well, I don't know who would do a thing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was born and raised on Chicago's South Side and studied
communications at Alcorn State University in Mississippi before
taking a job back home for the gas company. ``I was out there
digging ditches, for years, when I finally realized that if I
didn't do something pretty soon I was going to be digging ditches
for another 20 years,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   He hooked up with the national touring company of a play called
``Beauty Shop, Part 2,'' not as an actor but as the security guard.
They toured 56 cities before the play came to Los Angeles and
Duncan decided, OK, this is it. He took a room in a Hollywood
hotel, as cheap as he could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was eating Chicken McNuggets every night,'' Duncan said. ``I
couldn't get a job. I didn't know anybody. There were these big
cockroaches on the wall every night and, after a while, I started
talking to them. I was a little worried that I might be going
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he was down to his last $20. He called his mother and
said he thought he might have made a mistake and was thinking of
coming home. ``She told me, `You're not going to get anything
unless you give it your all,''' he said. ``She said that if I had
given it my all and it still wasn't working, then I could quit. But
if I hadn't given it my all yet, I had to keep trying.'' So he
stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, he found work _ as a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, LL Cool J, Jamie Foxx
_ most of the big emerging black actors of the time. ``After a
while, I started to get cool with them,'' he said. And he got an
agent, who helped him land some small roles on some of the
television series starring his clients, like ``The Jamie Foxx
Show'' and ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually he played a bouncer at a nightclub, or was featured in
prison scenes, the big scary guy who gave the star a comic moment.
``I didn't mind it,'' he said. ``It was something to get my feet
in.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, he was getting small roles in movies: ``Back in
Business'' in 1997, playing a prison guard; ``A Night at the
Roxbury'' in 1998, playing a bouncer; ``The Players Club'' in 1998,
playing a bouncer, and ``Bulworth'' in 1998 playing, for a change
of pace, a bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   Then he landed the role of Bear, one of Bruce Willis' drilling
crew in the 1998 blockbuster ``Armageddon.'' It was while he was
shooting ``Armageddon'' that Willis told him about a script he had
read for ``The Green Mile,'' which included a part that might be
right for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce told me about the part and said that if I was
interested, he would call the director, Frank Darabont, and tell
him about me, but that from then on it was up to me,'' Duncan said.
``I told him, yes, of course, but I didn't know if he'd really do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He really did it. And Darabont called in Duncan and he got the
part. The shoot, he remembers, was grueling. There was take after
take, often with him having to weep copiously for hours. ``I needed
a lot of energy because we were doing like 5, 6, 7 takes, and then
14, 15, 18,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The character Duncan plays in the film is huge but utterly
gentle and sweet, speaking in quiet whispers much of the time.
``Which is just antithetical to the way he really is,'' Hanks said.
``He's a big man with a big personality. He was always taking every
opportunity on the set to stand up and declaim at the top of his
voice. He'd hop up on a table and get everyone's attention and say,
`I'd just like to thank everybody for what we did today.'''
</P>
<P>
   And now Duncan finds himself with a big movie in the theaters
and the beginning rumbles of Oscar talk. He is fully prepared to
sign more autographs ( Hanks coached him on how to sign his name
quickly, after he saw Duncan painstakingly writing out his
signature in a slow, careful script) and he's excited about taking
part in awards nights, if it comes to that.
</P>
<P>
   But he's going to bring his camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself at things like that now, and there comes a
moment in the evening when I think, oh, it's time for me to go get
the limo,'' Duncan said. ``Then I remember, no, somebody else is
doing that for me now.''

THE EMPIRE-BUILDING SAFRAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Brazil, France, Lebanon, Syria, Israel)   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ When the Safra family built a mansion
resembling the palaces of Roman nobles in this city's opulent
Morumbi neighborhood, Joseph Safra, the younger brother of the late
financier Edmond J. Safra, acknowledged that the structure was
``out of context'' for a relatively poor country like Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the building is indicative of the grandiose
dealings of a family who, since their arrival in Brazil in the
early 1950s, after fleeing from Lebanon, have assembled one of this
country's largest conglomerates. Whether it is in banking,
telecommunications or even in the cultivation of eucalyptus trees
used to produce paper, the Safras have been synonymous in Brazil
with financial might.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no small wonder that news of the death last week in
Monte Carlo of Edmond J. Safra, a naturalized Brazilian who helped
construct his family's enterprises here in addition to his own
banking empire, shook this country's business culture. The shock
was magnified by the realization that violent deaths can occur in
wealthy places far away from crime-plagued urban Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is large that Edmond Safra left what is thought to
be a dangerous place only to die such a way in a reputedly safe
place,'' said Fernao Bracher, president of Banco BBA-Creditanstalt,
a Sao Paulo investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Safra's death seems to have been far stranger than
originally reported. The police first said that hooded intruders
killed Safra in an arson attack on his penthouse. They have now
charged an American nurse of Safra, Ted Maher, with starting the
fire. Maher reportedly told the police that he had not intended to
kill anyone and had fabricated the intruder account. He said he set
fire to a waste basket in the apartment in an effort ``to draw
attention to himself'' and win the gratitude of his boss for
thwarting the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Many puzzling questions remain, including how such a person
could have penetrated the inner circle of a reclusive banker who
had been preoccupied with his security.
</P>
<P>
   The Safras have been known in Brazil for the lengths to which
they go in search of security. For example, Joseph and Moise Safra,
the main surviving shareholders of Banco Safra SA, Brazil's
fifth-largest bank, commute by helicopter to avoid traffic jams and
the potential danger that kidnappers are lurking somewhere on the
way from their residence to the bank's headquarters in Sao Paulo's
financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Ezequiel Nasser, a nephew of Edmond, Joseph
and Moise Safra, was kidnapped here and held until his captors
received an unspecified ransom. Afterward, the Safras, one of
Brazil's most prominent Jewish families, hired a squad of Israeli
security agents to train their Brazilian bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   If members of the Safra family shared a concern for security,
they built businesses with similar gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Safra left Brazil in the early 1960s for Switzerland to
establish his own bank, an institution that was a precursor of
Republic New York, part of the family's efforts to cobble together
a small banking group. The torch was handed to Joseph Safra, now
60, to lead the family's growing enterprises in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Banco Safra, their flagship company, has emerged as
one of Brazil's soundest and most respected financial institutions,
largely focused on a small, affluent clientele with origins similar
to the Safras, who were originally bankers in Aleppo, Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond banking _ including financial institutions in the United
States, Israel and Uruguay _ the family has branched into other
areas. In telecommunications, the Safras own a big minority stake
in BCP Telecomunicacoes, the Sao Paulo cellular phone unit of
BellSouth, and they are important competitors in Brazil's
eucalyptus pulp industry, through a minority stake in Aracruz
Celulose SA, the country's largest pulp company.
</P>
<P>
   The Safras are also large landowners and have established
extensive cattle-ranching operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other Jewish family in Brazil, and few other Brazilian
families for that matter, rival the Safras in the scope of their
business strategies since they are transnational and very Brazilian
at the same time,'' said Jeffrey Lesser, a professor at Connecticut
College, who has written on the history of Brazil's Jews.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Brazilian clan that personified the globalization
of business and finance, it would probably be the Safras. The
languages that are used in the family's dealings _ a reflection of
their diverse group of clients and business partners _ include
Portuguese, English, French, Spanish, Hebrew and Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I don't express myself well in Portuguese,'' Joseph
Safra, who arrived in Brazil after he turned 20, said in a rare
interview with the news magazine Veja in 1998. ``I'm afraid of
being interpreted wrongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the country's 110,000 Jews, the Safras are known for their
philanthropy. They recently financed the construction of the
largest temple in the country, an ornate structure serving Sao
Paulo's Sephardic Jews _ largely of Spanish, Portuguese, Middle
Eastern and North African descent.
</P>
<P>
   The family is also known for its efforts to soothe tensions
between the country's Sephardic Jews and the East and Central
European-descended Ashkenazic Jews. The Safras supported a recent
resurgence of interest among some Ashkenazim here in Orthodox
Jewish culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Safras, and Edmond Safra especially, were able to
transcend the concern with parochial things,'' said Henry Sobel,
senior rabbi of Brazil's largest Ashkenazic synagogue.

BUSH SEEKS TO COUNTER PERCEPTION THAT HE IS A LIGHTWEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Alan Keyes spoke unspecifically about candidates who
seemed merely to repeat scripted lines and might not get anywhere
without their family connections.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain offered an anecdote about former Secretary of State
Dean Acheson that implicitly underscored George W. Bush's failure,
after receiving a question about Acheson, to provide any similarly
concrete information.
</P>
<P>
   And Orrin Hatch relegated his commentary on Bush's abilities to
a broad joke based on the presumption that Hatch would win the
Republican nomination and be in a position to select Bush as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have eight years with me, and, boy, you will make a
heck of a president after eight years,'' Hatch told Bush during the
forum for Republican presidential candidates here on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the levity, subtlety or indirection in their
approaches, these three candidates were essentially calling Bush a
lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   And they were signaling that in the few precious months before
the thicket of Republican primaries in which Bush remains a heavy
favorite, perhaps the most vigorous line of attack against him will
be that he lacks the intellectual heft and poise to lead the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As the jokes and jabs fired off by comedians like David
Letterman and Jay Leno and cartoonists like Garry Trudeau suggest,
that is the most popular evolving caricature of Bush: nice suit,
nobody in it.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here on Tuesday morning, Bush articulated
his defense against that insinuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Here's my credentials','' Bush, the governor of Texas,
said. ``I've been in the business world. I've been an entrepreneur.
I've been in a decision-making position in the second largest
state. I've been elected governor twice in an incredibly important
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he possesses an advantage that Senator Hatch of Utah
and Sen. McCain of Arizona, despite their longer careers, do not
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys, the other two elected officials, have spent a lot
of time in Washington,'' Bush said. ``If you listened carefully,
everybody was attacking Washington last night. Well, I'm the one
person who's been a chief executive outside of Washington. But
people are going to have to make up their minds. We've all got our
strengths, we've got our weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The forums on Monday night and last week were in part
opportunities for his opponents to home in on Bush's perceived
weaknesses, just as the events were chances for Bush to counter the
perception that he is intellectually unprepared for the presidency.
But his caution and reserve have made it nearly impossible for him
to accomplish that so far.
</P>
<P>
   One did not have to be a student of Bush's prior public comments
to hear, in most of his remarks during Monday's debate, ready-made
sound bites and locutions that were anything but spontaneous. Bush
was clearly reciting bits of prewritten text _ hardly unusual for a
political candidate _ but he sometimes had to travel a good
distance from what he had been asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a question about the lessons of a biography of
Acheson that he had said he was reading, Bush worked his way around
to this line: ``Our nation's greatest export to the world has been,
is and always will be the incredible freedoms we understand in the
great land called America.''
</P>
<P>
   It was straight from his standard stump speech, and minutes
later, when Bush pondered the relationship between the United
States and China, it made an encore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Bush said, ``in my earlier answer, I said our greatest
export to the world has been, is and always will be the incredible
freedom we understand in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Bush was not the only candidate hewing to
predetermined prognostications. Gary Bauer has yet to meet a topic
that does not allow for a rosy invocation of former Presidents
Lincoln and Reagan, just as Hatch can pivot from just about any
subject to a pitch for his campaign's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   And at least Bush nails most of his lines. As Steve Forbes tried
to make his way through an obviously planned joke about lobbyists,
mosquitoes and swampland, he ended up in his own oratorical
Okefenokee.
</P>
<P>
   But for a constellation of reasons, including the fact that Bush
rose so quickly in politics, he is the candidate battling the rap
that he is insufficiently schooled in policy and insufficiently
engaged in serious matters.
</P>
<P>
   He is the one whose failing performance on a televised pop quiz
about lesser-known leaders of countries in turmoil launched a
thousand quips, helping to turn him into Leno's favorite whipping
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush released his new slogan today: `He'll Get Tough
with What's-His-Name','' Leno joked last month.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Letterman cracked, ``The guy may have bonehead
stamped all over him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, during the forum in Manchester, N.H., Bush
was asked to rattle off a reading list. On Monday night in Phoenix,
he was asked to prove he had slogged through one of the books on
it, the Acheson biography.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush's response, a collection of lines from a recent foreign
policy address, possibly indicated nothing more than his refusal to
play the dutiful student for judgmental and occasionally
condescending teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But it opened a door, and as McCain nudged through it with his
own observations about Acheson, the McCain campaign's
communications director, Dan Schnur, sought to make eye contact
with reporters in the press room and flashed them a devilish,
triumphant smile.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said on Tuesday, ``In a minute's time, it's hard for me to
give a full book review, but I was able to convey what I wanted to
convey.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked during the debate what he would do if the robust
surpluses he projected did not materialize; he simply insisted that
they would, and forged ahead with tangentially related, mostly
rehearsed remarks about how his tax plan would help low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   This may simply have portrayed a disciplined candidate sitting
wisely on a big lead, and several political analysts said that
Bush's answers seemed thoughtful and considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making progress,'' said Tony Dolan, a former aide to
President Ronald Reagan who is advising Hatch. ``I think his
handlers may have made a mistake in keeping him out of sight early
on, because I think he matures through this kind of process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has yet to exude the kind of confidence and comfort
that he has in some of his policy speeches, and his rivals have
cleary taken note of that.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur declined to detail Bush's vulnerabilities, but talked up
the strengths that McCain brings into debates in a way that seemed
designed to draw a particular contrast.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best things we have going for us is John McCain's
experience, his knowledge of the world, and his knowledge of both
public policy and the historical context behind that policy,''
Schnur said. ``The great thing about a debate like this is it gives
him a chance to show how well prepared he is to be president in all
those respects.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CHOOSING HIS FAMILY OVER MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mets lost a first baseman Tuesday but Lynda Olerud gained a
fulltime grandson. She gets to have 15-month-old Garrett Olerud
living only 20 minutes away from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like your own parents, when you want to go
away on a short trip, or just for the afternoon.'' she said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She would not celebrate blatantly because the Olerud family has
only good things to say about New York and Toronto, where her son,
John, has played his entire major league career.
</P>
<P>
   It is a huge continent. Even in first class, the spine starts to
ache somewhere over the Dakotas, and then there are the time zone
changes, living out of a suitcase, to satisfy the deep need to see
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is a destination city for thousands and thousands of
young people who have heard the siren call of the internet and the
coffee bars on a misty night and the views from many a hillside.
For John and Kelly Olerud, it was about parents and grandparents,
church and home.
</P>
<P>
   Any fan who observed John Olerud's calm persona in his three
years at Shea Stadium would understand that the Oleruds never tried
to hold up the Mets for extra millions, for an extra year on the
contract, as a payoff for the separation. Olerud missed a stable
life near his family around Bellevue, Wash., just east of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real family man,'' Lynda Olerud said Tuesday. ``I'll
tell you, it was an agonizing situation. There is such charisma in
New York, we were treated so well. John is very loyal, and I think
he does not like disappointing people.''
</P>
<P>
   The son held off his decision because he truly enjoyed the city
and the people and the team. His manager in Toronto, Cito Gaston,
had made the bizarre prophecy that John would be so unsettled by
the rowdy demeanor of Met fans that he might retire at an early
age. In fact, Olerud lived in Manhattan and occasionally rode the
No. 7 elevated train, the easiest way to go at rush hour, and he
smiled wryly at the intensity of the big city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had so much fun as in New York,'' his mother said
Tuesday. ``John and Bobby Valentine just clicked right away. The
infield.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while last summer, overheated Mets' fans were claiming
that Olerud, Edgardo Alfonzo, Rey Ordonez and Robin Ventura were
the best defensive infield in history.
</P>
<P>
   Well, New Yorkers do tend to be grandiose. The Oleruds are the
opposite. They hark back to the placid Norwegians who survived the
plains and the Dirty Thirties of the Depression. Some of them
stayed in their respective Lake Wobegons while others found their
way to salt water again.
</P>
<P>
   The family's roots are deep in Seattle. John Olerud, the father,
caught seven years in the minor leagues and went to medical school
and became a dermatologist. Tuesday the son recalled how excited
they were in 1977, the first year of the Mariners, when he turned
9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember they had the Pepsi Junior Mariners, where you got a
certain number of tickets and a batting glove,'' the son said
Tuesday, recalling that his first favorite player was Bruce Bochte,
a .282 hitter who played five years in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense of security in being close to each other. When
John was a baseball star at Washington State, he fell down one day
while running a lap. His father grabbed the first plane to the
school and slept in his son's hospital room for a week, until the
specialists discovered the aneurysm, which was repaired in a
six-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has been very lucky in a lot of ways,'' the mother said.
Up to now, they considered themselves lucky just to be in touch
long distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I went to spring training,'' Lynda Olerud said
Tuesday. ``With the satellite dish, we could watch every game, and
there is always the telephone. Kelly came back five or six times a
season.''
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of Garrett Olerud, the mother admitted, ``I
felt a little more needy.''
</P>
<P>
   When John became a free agent after the season, his family
members made their feelings known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty overt,'' John said Tuesday. ``People said,
`Selfishly, this is what I would like, but ultimately it's your
decision.'''
</P>
<P>
   His mother admitted she voiced her opinion, but she added, ``I
don't know if my vote counted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, John Olerud took $20 million for three years, less
than he probably could have extorted from the Mets, but as Lynda
Olerud said Tuesday, ``There are some things money can't buy.'' You
cannot hug a grandchild via the satellite dish.

U.S. PLANS SUIT AGAIN GUN MAKERS ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC HOUSING
RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID STOUT  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move to force the firearms industry to adopt
safer ways of doing business, the federal government said Tuesday
that it was preparing a lawsuit against gun makers on behalf of the
3 million people who live in public housing projects, where
shootings have taken a heavy toll for years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development have been laying the groundwork for the suit in recent
months in hopes that the threat of federal action would intensify
pressure on the gun industry to change how it makes and sells
weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has decided to throw its weight
behind suits filed by more than two dozen cities against gun
companies in hopes that a far-reaching settlement might be achieved
once and for all, saving lives and enabling conscientious gun
makers and dealers to do business, said Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo and Bruce Reed, President Clinton's domestic-policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the federal goal is a settlement, not a drawn-out
lawsuit. ``If all parties act in good faith, we'll stay at the
negotiating table,'' he said. ``If not, we are prepared to
litigate. We feel we're in a strong position.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said if no settlement is reached, the government's suit
would be filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of the nation's
3,200 public-housing authorities _ enclaves where the government
spends $1 billion a year on security, but where many children are
so afraid of stray bullets that they sleep in bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from executives in the firearms
industry. A group that represents gun makers, wholesalers and
dealers has been conferring for months with New York State Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer on a gun-industry code of conduct in hopes of
heading off a lawsuit that Spitzer has threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Tuesday night that he welcomed the federal
intervention. ``This is a tremendous boost to the effort,'' he
said, ``and should lead to substantial additional pressure being
put on the industry.'' Spitzer compared the threat of his lawsuit
to a dagger. ``The feds' is a meat ax,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that more than 500 murders are committed in a typical
year among the 100 largest housing projects, with 70 percent of
those involving firearms. These statistics, as well as accidental
shootings involving children who find hidden guns, give the housing
authorities strong legal standing to sue, Reed asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that the federal government, like the cities that have
already sued the firearms industry, seeks curbs on advertising;
compulsory child-safety locks on handguns and, perhaps most
important, stricter rules on sales and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``One percent of the gun dealers sell 50 percent of the guns
that turn up in crimes,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the HUD said he had talked to Spitzer; Connecticut
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who has also been involved in
the campaign against the firearms industry, and to most of the
mayors of cities that have sued gun makers. ``Unanimously, they
were enthusiastic about our coming in,'' said the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo and Reed said that their goal is a ``global settlement''
with the gun interests, not unlike that which was reached with the
tobacco industry. And like the tobacco settlement, a general
settlement with the firearms industry would not necessarily
preclude smaller settlements involving particular companies and
cities, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said HUD lawyers have been conferring with their
counterparts in the White House, the Justice Department and the
Treasury Department, whose Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
regulates segments of the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Any wide-ranging settlement _ or lawsuit, if an agreement cannot
be reached _ would almost inevitably involve such familiar names as
Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., Smith &AMP; Wesson, Colt's Manufacturing, Beretta,
Glock and Mossberg &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies have been in discussions with Spitzer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a situation not unlike the tobacco negotiations, two big gun
makers were said last summer to be negotiating with Spitzer. That
might have broken the solidarity of the gun interests _ much as
cigarette manufacturers disagreed on their strategy _ but the gun
companies have since closed ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Any federal settlement talks probably would cover limits on how
many guns could be bought at one time; better record-keeping, an
independent monitoring group and better protection for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have safety caps on aspirin bottles, but not on guns?''
Cuomo said. ``Where's the logic?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the measures that federal officials would seek are
already laws in some states. In recent years, Congress has wrestled
often with gun-control issues, especially after a particularly
gruesome mass killing. Some federal measures have been made into
law, others talked about more or less seriously over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The cities that have sued gun makers include Boston, Newark,
Atlanta, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Cleveland, St. Louis and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As with the tobacco industry, there is an uneven history of
litigation involving gun interests. Often, the firearms makers and
dealers have won, but not always.
</P>
<P>
   New York is not among the two dozen cities that have sued. But
last February, a federal Court jury in Brooklyn found 15 of 25
firearms makers named as defendants negligent in case involving
illegally obtained handguns. The private plaintiffs argued that the
companies fostered illegal trafficking because of their marketing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago also filed a suit last year, accusing 12 suburban stores
and several gun makers and wholesalers of creating a public
nuisance by selling guns to people who took them into the city and
committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, a state judge in Cincinnati threw out the city's
suit against firearms makers, declaring that the city was wrongly
asking a court to change how guns are made and sold _ something on
a legislature could do.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, an Illinois state judge ruled just last week
that a suit brought by families of three Chicagoans killed by
handguns could proceed. The survivors accuse the gun industry of
knowingly creating an underground market in handguns.

 UNDATED: unfortunate event.''

<P>
   Lawyers who negotiated the settlement said they could not
discuss how much of the $2.8 billion they would receive because
U.S. District Judge William Walls had placed the terms of their
payment under seal until all litigation is complete. But James
Newman, an expert on class-action suits and the publisher of
Securities Class Action Alert, said it was likely they would
receive about 15 percent of the $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining portion of the settlement is to be distributed to
shareholders in proportion to their loses, said Leonard Barrack, a
partner in the Philadelphia law firm of Barrack, Rodos &AMP; Bacine,
which worked out the settlement with Cendant along with its
co-counsel, Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger &AMP; Grossmann in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders and Cendant are suing Ernst &AMP; Young, the company's
former accountant. The suits contend that the auditor certified
CUC's false financial statements. In its suit, Cendant accused
Ernst &AMP; Young of malpractice and breach of contract. As part of the
settlement, Cendant said it would pass on half of any monetary
awards in its case against the auditor to its shareholders. Ernst &AMP;
Young has said that Cendant's claims are without merit.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.8 billion is nearly double the $1.5 billion that
Prudential Securities paid in 1994 to settle claims by investors,
many of them elderly, who lost money on high-risk limited
partnerships they could ill afford. But it was roughly 10 times
greater than the $270 million that American Continental Corp.
agreed to pay investors in its Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan unit in a
series of settlements in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlements are starting to be much larger,'' Newman said,
``because of the overheated stock market. The prices of shares are
so inflated that when bad news comes out billions of dollars are
lost and investors are finally getting a decent recoupment of their
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall and Alan Hevesi, the New York City comptroller, said the
state and city pension funds had no plans to sell their stock in
Cendant. ``The culture or philosophy of our pension fund management
is to invest for the long run, not for a quick hit,'' McCall said.
``If we can have an influence on the company for the long run,
that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pulled out now,'' he added, ``we would suffer some
losses because the stock is worth less than when we bought it.''
Aides to McCall said they could not immediately determine the
average cost of shares to the pension funds but that they
calculated their losses from the mid-30s price when the stock
plunged. Cendant closed at $18.375 Tuesday, up $1.1875 on news of
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cendant can again be valued based on the performance of our
businesses without the overhang of this litigation,'' Silverman
said. He said that the investigations by the U.S. attorney's office
and the SEC ``will not affect the company or its current officers
and directors.''
</P>
<P>
   The pension funds leading the suit reached an agreement with
Cendant that the majority of its board would be independent, that
the audit, nominating and compensation committees would be made up
of independent board members and that all directors would be
elected annually.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Bloom, a spokesman for Cendant, said that several changes
had already been made. Nine of the board's 14 members are
independent directors, he said, and independent directors make up
the entire membership of the audit and compensation committees. He
said a new nominating committee was being formed.
</P>
<P>
   He said Cendant planned to ask shareholders to approve one-year
terms for board members at the annual meeting next spring,
restoring a practice at HFS before the merger with CUC.
</P>
<P>
   The measure on stock options was designed to prevent a practice
known as ``repricing'' in which the exercise price of options is
lowered when a company's market value drops. ``Many times
management is responsible for a drop in the stock price, and they
shouldn't be compensated for that,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom said Cendant had put the stock option requirement into
effect immediately by executive order.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sweeping national study of homeless people served by shelters,
soup kitchens and other programs found that almost half were in
their first episode of homelessness, 44 percent had worked at least
part time in the previous month, and 42 percent said that what they
needed more than anything was help finding a job.
</P>
<P>
   But the study, based on Census Bureau surveys in 1995 and 1996
and the most comprehensive study of homelessness ever, also found
that over all, the homeless were deeply impoverished and most were
ill. Two-thirds were suffering from chronic or infectious diseases,
not counting AIDS, 55 percent were without health insurance and 39
percent had signs of mental illness. Twenty-seven percent reported
a childhood history of foster care or institutional placement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a definitive description of what we're dealing with
when we talk about the quote, unquote, homeless,'' Andrew Cuomo,
secretary of housing and urban development, said on Tuesday in
discussing the study, which was based on interviews with 12,000
service providers and 4,000 homeless clients. ``There is no simple
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their handicaps, 60 percent of the homeless living alone
and 76 percent of those living in families successfully left
shelters for permanent housing when they received the services they
needed, including housing subsidies, health care, substance-abuse
treatment, education and job training, according to the study's
surveys of representatives of about 40,000 programs that serve the
homeless nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   While the study did not offer an estimate of the overall
homeless population, its 600 pages of statistics included figures
showing that an estimated 470,000 homeless people sheltered on an
average night in February 1996 were only a quarter of the people
who were homeless at any one time during the year. The previous
national survey, done in 1987, estimated the number of homeless
people, including those in the streets, at 500,000 to 600,000 on
any night.
</P>
<P>
   The study took three years to complete because it required the
collection and analysis of an extraordinary amount of data and
involved 12 federal agencies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on homelessness, including Martha Burt, the director of
social service research at the Urban Institute, which prepared the
report to be released by the housing department on Tuesday,
cautioned that like any point-in-time snapshot, this survey
over-represents the more chronically homeless, who are more likely
to be mentally ill or addicted to drugs, and under-represents the
people who become homeless sporadically for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are bookends,'' Cuomo agreed. ``You have a pent up need
for affordable housing and you have populations with underlying
problems _ they are both driving the system.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when cities around the country are using law
enforcement to move homeless people out of public places, Cuomo
added, the study underlines that punitive ordinances and police
crackdowns will not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need outreach to get people off the street _ not a police
officer with handcuffs,'' he said. ``You need transitional services
as a second step, and then by definition you need the third step,
which is permanent housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the surprises in the study was that while New York, Los
Angeles and other larger cities provided the most beds for the
homeless, they helped a smaller portion of their poor residents
than some smaller cities like Minneapolis, San Francisco and St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the booming economy, Ms. Burt said, there is no reason
to believe the picture drawn by the study has changed
significantly. The poverty rate remains almost the same, and other
Housing Department studies show that rising rents and a steep
decline in housing subsidies have left 5.3 million poor families in
housing that was unaffordable or severely substandard _ a record
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is better but we are also cutting way back on the
safety net,'' Ms. Burt said. ``This is poverty-related as well as
disability-related. Lots of people have problems; we have alcoholic
senators _ they're not homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeless people are among the poorest in the nation, with
incomes averaging half the federal poverty level. Forty percent of
those surveyed said they went without food one or more days in the
previous month, compared to 3 percent of other poor Americans.
Almost a third of all homeless clients surveyed said that they had
slept on the streets or in other places not meant for habitation
within the week before the survey. Yet, those in central cities
were better off than their counterparts surveyed in 1987, mainly
because they were more likely to have government benefits like
public assistance and food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that most of these folks don't have Medicaid is a
pretty damning statistic,'' said Dennis P. Culhane, a professor of
social welfare policy at the University of Pennsylvania. The rates
of mental illness were unchanged since the 1987 survey, a fact,
Culhane added, that suggests known solutions to the homelessness of
the disabled _ treatment and supportive, permanent housing _ are
not being fully used.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows the strengths of the expanded system of
homeless services, largely provided by non-profit and
religious-based charities financed by the government, Culhane said,
but also shows the limits of that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the suspicion in many towns that the homeless come
from somewhere else, the study found that 29 percent of homeless
families and 46 percent of single homeless clients said they were
not living in the same place where they became homeless. In all
cases, Ms. Burt said, they had moved from a smaller place to a
bigger one.
</P>
<P>
   Major reasons included the lack of jobs and affordable housing
in the place they left, and the presence of relatives or friends
and job possibilities in the city or town where they were
interviewed, as well as the availability of shelters, missions and
other services.
</P>
<P>
   Serious childhood traumas were common among the homeless people
surveyed, the study found, with 25 percent reporting childhood
abuse, 33 percent having run away from home, and 21 percent having
experienced homelessness as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you also see in this report is the failure of our
primary, early intervention system,'' Cuomo said. ``You are
creating tomorrow's homeless today.''

CHARGES IN DISAPPEARANCE OF MADALYN MURRAY O'HAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (no byline)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted a
Michigan man on kidnapping, extortion and robbery charges in the
1995 disappearance of the atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair and
two of her relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accused Gary Paul Karr of Novi, Mich., and
several accomplices of kidnapping O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray
and her granddaughter, Robin Murray-O'Hair, and robbing them of
$500,000 in gold coins, vehicles, watches and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also accused Karr of transporting stolen property
across state lines and of using interstate communication facilities
to commit an act of violence. If convicted of all the charges,
Karr, 51, could face life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment was the latest chapter in a mystery that began
when the three, who are believed dead, vanished without a trace
shortly after Murray bought $500,000 in gold coins from a dealer in
San Antonio on Sept. 29, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, who is in custody on federal felony firearms charges, was
not charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, one of America's best-known atheists, was a plaintiff in
a 1963 Supreme Court case that led to a prohibition on prayer in
public schools. The investigation into her disappearance was
stymied until March 24, when federal authorities searched the
Austin apartment of David Waters, a convicted felon who had worked
as an office manager at the Austin headquarters of O'Hair's
organization, American Atheists Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although Waters, 52, was not mentioned in the indictment,
federal officials consider him a suspect in the disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   In a 36-page affidavit released shortly before Waters pleaded
guilty to federal firearms charges on Aug. 20, Edmund Martin, a
special agent with the Internal Revenue Service, said the Karr and
Waters ``planned and executed the scheme to abduct, kidnap and
murder'' the three.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors declined to comment on whether Waters would
be charged.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Blagg, the United States Attorney for the Western
District of Texas, said the indictment of Karr was ``not the final
chapter of this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   `` We are continuing our throughout effort to make sure that
justice is served in this matter,'' Blagg said.

 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from Europe.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ My tongue is stupid, but my heart isn't,'' remarks the
errant genius Mozart in ``Amadeus.'' And a sprightly genius he
proves to be, too, in Peter Shaffer's metaphysical melodrama, which
combines speculative historical musings with a meditation on divine
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Here is perhaps the defining musical figure of our waning
millennium, burrowing about under his wife Constanze's dresses and
spewing forth largely unprintable language _ when he is not
composing ineffably beautiful sounds. These are the very same
notes, of course, that have made a possible murderer out of his
envious colleague, the court composer Salieri.
</P>
<P>
   How can a supreme artist be such an ignoble imp? The question is
tackled in Shaffer's play, a revival of which opens Wednesday at
the Music Box Theater on Broadway. It is being directed by Sir
Peter Hall, after successful engagements in Los Angeles and, last
season, in London, both with the same British leads.
</P>
<P>
   David Suchet, the veteran character actor known in the United
States as the enduring (and portly) detective Hercule Poirot on
television, makes his Broadway debut as the resentful Antonio
Salieri, a self-described ``mediocrity'' whose abiding argument is
not with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart but with God.
</P>
<P>
   Among his complaints: that Mozart's very laugh is God's way of
mocking Salieri, an artistic hack consumed by self-loathing and yet
admired _ wrongly, as he well knows _ by the Austrian court of
Emperor Joseph II.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the object of Salieri's cascading fury is another
Broadway newcomer, Michael Sheen, 30. Playing a prodigy so
poisoned, whether literally or figuratively, that he dies in 1791
at the age of 35, Sheen has been acclaimed for laying bare both the
fear and unknowable brilliance behind his character's brattish
persona. As Suchet said admiringly of his co-star: ``He avoids the
trap of just being a giggling fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen explained how he does so over coffee in London shortly
before traveling to Los Angeles for the play's pre-Broadway run.
``Mozart is possessed by his talent,'' Sheen said. ``It frightens
him if he thinks about his gift, which is why he can't think about
it, which is where, I think, a lot of the scatological stuff comes
from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Mozart's way of switching off,'' added Sheen, his
accent flecked with the sound of his native Wales. ``There's
something so powerful inside him that he can express it as long as
he doesn't get in the way of it. But he can't sit around and talk
about it too much; that's too frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   About Sheen's performance, Sir Peter, the director, said:
``Michael has combined the part's two extremes. He's terribly
moving and also extremely badly behaved; he's got grace and wit and
a complete childlike anarchy let loose as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen hardly seems the anarchist. In conversation, he bashfully
explained away several days of beard stubble as ``just laziness,
because I've had a week off.'' It was about to vanish in
preparation for his return that evening to the rotating repertory
at the National Theater, where he had opened nearly eight weeks
before as the abusive Jimmy Porter in a revival of John Osborne's
classic ``Look Back in Anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance, and Gregory Hersov's production, received
favorable reviews, with critics praising Sheen's ability to find
the defensiveness and hurt in one of modern drama's best-known
aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone willing to play both Jimmy Porter and Mozart shows a
fondness for roles pitched at extremes, which accounts in large
measure for Sheen's reputation as one of his generation's finest
British stage actors. He has played Romeo and Henry V, the latter
for the Royal Shakespeare Company, as well as the title part in
Ibsen's ``Peer Gynt,'' as staged for a world tour by Yukio
Ninagawa, the Japanese director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself more and more acting at 150 percent all the
time,'' said Sheen, whose onstage intensity belies a boyish
appearance that has earned him descriptions like ``elfin'' and
``puckish.'' ``I've got so used with Mozart and Jimmy,'' he said,
``as soon as I come onstage, to being right up there. Having to
work at that level and find subtlety and complexity while going at
100 miles an hour is tough, and you do learn a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mendes, the theater and film director, called Sheen ``a
stage creature clearly'' and attributed that to the actor's Welsh
roots. ``I'm serious,'' Mendes said. ``He's Welsh in the tradition
of Anthony Hopkins and Richard Burton: fiery, mercurial,
unpredictable.'' Indeed, Sheen comes from Port Talbot, their
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Mozart poses a fiercely animated assignment, as
conceived by Shaffer, the author also of ``Equus'' and ``Lettice
and Lovage,'' among other plays. But experience indicates it is not
a role that wins prizes easily.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway in 1980, the first time around, ``Amadeus'' won five
Tony Awards, including one for Ian McKellen's florid Machiavel of a
Salieri. Tim Curry's manic-eyed Mozart went unrewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Milos Forman's 1984 film of the play won eight Academy Awards,
among them best picture and for the screenplay adaptation by
Shaffer; F. Murray Abraham's gravely obsessive Salieri was another
victor, whereas Tom Hulce's infantilized Mozart was not. After
opening in London, the current version received five Olivier
nominations and won one, for William Dudley's costumes. In the
supporting-performance category, Sheen lost out to Brendan Coyle in
``The Weir.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sir Peter first staged ``Amadeus'' at the National Theater in
1979 and then on Broadway, returning to it fresh last fall.
Speaking of Curry's performance and that of Simon Callow, who
originated the role in London, he said: ``Simon gave us something
of the punk Mozart of that particular time. He was extraordinarily
outrageous and engaging, like a puppy you shouldn't have let into
the house. Tim on Broadway had a great deal of poetry in him, a lot
of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, who was a child in 1979, did not see either original
production. Instead, he talks of the way in which playing Jimmy
Porter has helped him to deepen his understanding of Mozart.
``They're both, in a sense, tyrannized by themselves,'' said the
actor, who has found Mozart and Porter ``the two most similar
characters I've ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mozart,'' he went on, ``part of the tragedy is you see
that it isn't just the establishment, as represented by Salieri,
that destroys him; you see that he's sort of destroyed anyway _ by
himself, by his own talent, by the double-edged nature of genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen attributes his fondness for the stage to a childhood
steeped in Gilbert and Sullivan, musicals and amateur dramatics. It
didn't hurt, he said, that his father, who worked in personnel
management, ``would always have liked to have been an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the simple fact that the theater offers he has
received have excelled those in film, though he did appear
alongside Julia Roberts' in the 1996 flop ``Mary Reilly.'' He was
seen to better effect last year in ``Wilde,'' playing Robbie Ross,
the romantic prospect Oscar Wilde passes over in favor of Lord
Alfred Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the stage, Sheen focuses much of his time around Lily,
his new daughter _ she will be a year old at the end of January _
by the actress Kate Beckinsale, Sheen's partner. The two met in a
touring production of Chekhov's ``Seagull'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beckinsale has been making her name in films, from ``The
Last Days of Disco'' and ``Brokedown Palace'' to the forthcoming
movie version of Henry James' ``Golden Bowl,'' with Nick Nolte and
Uma Thurman. Sheen has mostly worked in the theater since leaving
the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art early in order to
appear on the West End in 1991 with Vanessa Redgrave in ``When She
Danced.''
</P>
<P>
   Because his stage roles have been so absorbing, Sheen has tried
to imagine what would happen were his various characters to meet.
``If you could combine Jimmy Porter and Mozart,'' he said, smiling,
``that would be a formidable force in the world.'' He paused:
``It's one long dinner party inside my head.''

BARAK HALTS EXPANSION OF WEST BANK JEWISH SETTLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to expand by approx 500 words: greater details on politics of
Barak's `freeze', why he acted as he did; Palestinian reaction;

(HLW)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was about
to land in Israel on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Ehud Barak was
seeking to defuse growing tensions with the Palestinians by
pledging to halt further expansion of Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak stopped short of baldly declaring a freeze on
construction, partly _ though unsuccessfully _ to avoid provoking
the right-wing members of his coalition. But in an unexpected
change of approach, he called a moratorium of several months on new
settlers' neighborhoods to avert confrontation in a delicate
period, as the parties seek to reach a framework final peace
agreement by February.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be nothing on the ground,'' Barak's spokesman, Gadi
Baltiansky, said in an interview, expressing the decision more
bluntly than the prime minister. ``No bulldozers will work on the
ground. There is no point in embarrassing or provoking the
Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Albright's visit, a minor crisis brewed between
the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Palestinians walked away
from the negotiating table on Monday to protest what they saw as
Barak's expansionist settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government initially described the walkout as a
stunt to lure the Americans back into a salvage role in the two-way
talks.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before Albright arrived here, Barak apparently
decided that the Palestinian concern was deep seated and needed to
be addressed. ``We, in the course of the next three months, are in
a critical political struggle, and therefore wisdom is needed and
this government has that wisdom,'' he said in a brief news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and his aides were caught
by surprise and did not know quite how to react to the declaration
or even what it meant. They received no direct explanation from the
Israelis and followed the story on the local news, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not receive anything, so it is difficult to comment on
things I have no knowledge about,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlers' leaders, with whom Barak has tried to build a
cooperative relationship, immediately understood that he had drawn
a line and expressed their disappointment. ``It turns out that
Barak gives in to pressure and extortion and he has succumbed to
the pressure of Arafat and the Americans,'' said Benny Kashriel,
the moderate leader of the Yesha Council, the settlers' umbrella
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to meet Barak on Wednesday at his house
for breakfast, to meet Arafat in Ramallah later and then, perhaps,
to return to Barak for a second meeting. After spending the day in
Damascus on Tuesday, Albright emerged from a three-hour meeting at
a hilltop palace with President Hafez Assad proclaiming to be more
optimistic about the possibility that Israeli-Syrian negotiations
could be revived. She declined to spell out why, and a senior
administration official later said Albright needed to talk to Barak
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussions about negotiations are very much like mushrooms,''
Albright said at a news conference in Damascus. ``They do much
better when they are not in the light.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue of Jewish settlements in the disputed territory of the
West Bank is always a sore point between the Israelis and the
Palestinians. But when the Palestinians stopped the negotiations on
Monday, they were irked by a particular development. The Israeli
Housing Ministry, controlled by the settlers' National Religious
Party, had just published tenders, the bid specifications, for 500
apartments in the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that, depending on whose count is used, Barak's
government had authorized the construction of 1,800 to 4,000 units
in the West Bank since taking office in July. Barak's office uses
the lower tally, and the Palestinians the higher count. All the
approvals were for expanding existing settlements. Barak has said
no new settlements will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of housing starts has been accelerated by Housing
Minister Yitzhak Levy, leader of the National Religious Party.
Barak has not stood in his way until now.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has contended that the publication of tenders for the
1,800 units completes a process of authorization that started under
the right-wing government of his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that Mr. Levy as the housing minister has been
doing exactly what he wants to do without asking anybody,'' said
Mossi Raz, a spokesman for Peace Now, an Israeli peace group.
``Barak doesn't want to confront him, because he thinks in two
months he will have an agreement, and then he needs Levy and the
settlers behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also repeatedly said the tenders were irrelevant, even
though they deeply upset the Palestinians. Because it takes four to
six months for construction to begin after a tender has been
published, nothing will proceed until after the February deadline
for a framework peace agreement, he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Barak has insisted, Israeli authorizations will mean
nothing in land that is to be given to the Palestinians, and it
will be none of the Palestinians' business in settlements that will
become Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning, so apparent to Barak, has eluded the Palestinians
and sounded like a runaround to them, and some members of Barak's
own Labor/One Israel Party complained to him about the seeming
expansion policy on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Barak's senior negotiator, Oded Eran, publicly lent
credence to the Palestinians' frustration, saying that the
Palestinian negotiators had repeatedly been telling him that they
were ``losing credibility in the eyes of the Palestinian public''
because of continuing settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the first sign of a change, the prime minister's office said
earlier Tuesday that no new housing starts would be authorized. The
Palestinians did not think that went far enough.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday evening, though, Baltiansky said in an interview that
no new construction would start, ``including on those tenders
already approved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's words were less precise. He said on Tuesday evening:
``I feel that at this stage, in these months, when we are in the
midst of negotiations with the Palestinians on the final status
agreements, there is no point, and to a certain extent it hinders
the policy of Israel, to begin housing starts that have no chance
of being finished in any event.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser to Arafat, Nabil Aburdeineh, responded late
Tuesday night: ``He refused to utter the word, `freeze.' So what
does this mean? Albright is coming. So they want to play games.''

U.S. PLANS SUIT AGAIN GUN MAKERS ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC HOUSING
RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs byline to add 2nd name) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID STOUT with RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move to force the firearms industry to adopt
safer ways of doing business, the federal government said Tuesday
that it was preparing a lawsuit against gun makers on behalf of the
3 million people who live in public housing projects, where
shootings have taken a heavy toll for years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development have been laying the groundwork for the suit in recent
months in hopes that the threat of federal action would intensify
pressure on the gun industry to change how it makes and sells
weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has decided to throw its weight
behind suits filed by more than two dozen cities against gun
companies in hopes that a far-reaching settlement might be achieved
once and for all, saving lives and enabling conscientious gun
makers and dealers to do business, said Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo and Bruce Reed, President Clinton's domestic-policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the federal goal is a settlement, not a drawn-out
lawsuit. ``If all parties act in good faith, we'll stay at the
negotiating table,'' he said. ``If not, we are prepared to
litigate. We feel we're in a strong position.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said if no settlement is reached, the government's suit
would be filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of the nation's
3,200 public-housing authorities _ enclaves where the government
spends $1 billion a year on security, but where many children are
so afraid of stray bullets that they sleep in bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from executives in the firearms
industry. A group that represents gun makers, wholesalers and
dealers has been conferring for months with New York State Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer on a gun-industry code of conduct in hopes of
heading off a lawsuit that Spitzer has threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Tuesday night that he welcomed the federal
intervention. ``This is a tremendous boost to the effort,'' he
said, ``and should lead to substantial additional pressure being
put on the industry.'' Spitzer compared the threat of his lawsuit
to a dagger. ``The feds' is a meat ax,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that more than 500 murders are committed in a typical
year among the 100 largest housing projects, with 70 percent of
those involving firearms. These statistics, as well as accidental
shootings involving children who find hidden guns, give the housing
authorities strong legal standing to sue, Reed asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that the federal government, like the cities that have
already sued the firearms industry, seeks curbs on advertising;
compulsory child-safety locks on handguns and, perhaps most
important, stricter rules on sales and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``One percent of the gun dealers sell 50 percent of the guns
that turn up in crimes,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the HUD said he had talked to Spitzer; Connecticut
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who has also been involved in
the campaign against the firearms industry, and to most of the
mayors of cities that have sued gun makers. ``Unanimously, they
were enthusiastic about our coming in,'' said the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo and Reed said that their goal is a ``global settlement''
with the gun interests, not unlike that which was reached with the
tobacco industry. And like the tobacco settlement, a general
settlement with the firearms industry would not necessarily
preclude smaller settlements involving particular companies and
cities, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said HUD lawyers have been conferring with their
counterparts in the White House, the Justice Department and the
Treasury Department, whose Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
regulates segments of the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Any wide-ranging settlement _ or lawsuit, if an agreement cannot
be reached _ would almost inevitably involve such familiar names as
Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., Smith &AMP; Wesson, Colt's Manufacturing, Beretta,
Glock and Mossberg &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies have been in discussions with Spitzer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a situation not unlike the tobacco negotiations, two big gun
makers were said last summer to be negotiating with Spitzer. That
might have broken the solidarity of the gun interests _ much as
cigarette manufacturers disagreed on their strategy _ but the gun
companies have since closed ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Any federal settlement talks probably would cover limits on how
many guns could be bought at one time; better record-keeping, an
independent monitoring group and better protection for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have safety caps on aspirin bottles, but not on guns?''
Cuomo said. ``Where's the logic?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the measures that federal officials would seek are
already laws in some states. In recent years, Congress has wrestled
often with gun-control issues, especially after a particularly
gruesome mass killing. Some federal measures have been made into
law, others talked about more or less seriously over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The cities that have sued gun makers include Boston, Newark,
Atlanta, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Cleveland, St. Louis and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As with the tobacco industry, there is an uneven history of
litigation involving gun interests. Often, the firearms makers and
dealers have won, but not always.
</P>
<P>
   New York is not among the two dozen cities that have sued. But
last February, a federal Court jury in Brooklyn found 15 of 25
firearms makers named as defendants negligent in case involving
illegally obtained handguns. The private plaintiffs argued that the
companies fostered illegal trafficking because of their marketing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago also filed a suit last year, accusing 12 suburban stores
and several gun makers and wholesalers of creating a public
nuisance by selling guns to people who took them into the city and
committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, a state judge in Cincinnati threw out the city's
suit against firearms makers, declaring that the city was wrongly
asking a court to change how guns are made and sold _ something on
a legislature could do.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, an Illinois state judge ruled just last week
that a suit brought by families of three Chicagoans killed by
handguns could proceed. The survivors accuse the gun industry of
knowingly creating an underground market in handguns.

PAIR CHARGED IN FIRE THAT KILLED 6 FIREFIGHTERS

   WORCESTER, Mass. _ As firefighters raced into a burning
warehouse Friday night in search of reported squatters a homeless
couple who lived inside and allegedly started the fire during a
fight were a short walk away, listening to music knowing that the
building was ablaze, investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Julie S. Barnes and her boyfriend, Thomas S. Levesque, never
reported the fire after they tried, but failed, to put out the
blaze that ultimately killed six firefighters, authorities charged.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Barnes, a 19-year-old high school dropout, and
Levesque, 37, were being held on $1 million bail after being
charged with six counts of involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester authorities say the two accidentally started the fire
when they knocked over a candle during an argument.
</P>
<P>
   As the fire gained strength, destroying their belongings, they
tried to save their dog and cat, but gave up. So, authorities said,
they walked to the Worcester Center, a downtown mall, where they
listened to music, before spending the night at a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   During their arraignment, Barnes kept her head down. Levesque,
whose hair was uncombed, tried covering his face with his arm and
winced as a judge read the bail amount.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about the couple, who had reportedly lived in
the vacant Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. with other
homeless people for several months. Barnes dropped out of Wachusett
Regional High School when she was a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night Levesque's father, Gerard Levesque interviewed
outside his home here, had little to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry for the people that died,'' Levesque said, his
voice cracking. ``That's all we're sorry for.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday firefighters continued to comb through the smoldering
wreckage in search of five firefighters still buried in the rubble.
The body of one of the firefighters, Timothy Jackson, 51, was
removed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Thurday a memorial for the six men at the Worcester Centrum is
expected to draw as many as 20,000 firefighters from across the
country and as far away as Australia. President Clinton is expected
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a story that is already tragic, seemed even sadder,
as it became clear to some officials that the deaths of the six
firefighters might might have been avoided. It was a poignant
reminder of the heroism of the firefighters, officials said, who
went into the burning warehouse trying to save those at the margins
of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier you detect and report a fire, the safer it's going
to be for us,'' District Chief Walter Giard said. ``A fire in a
normal building doubles every minute, so in five minutes it's not
five times bigger but 25 times bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The other five firefighters killed in the conflagration were
Paul Brotherton, 41; Jeremiah Lucey, 38; Lieutenant Thomas Spencer,
42; James Lyons, 34; Joseph McGuirk, 38.
</P>
<P>
   Though upset at the news of the arrests, many firefighters said
ther job was not to pass judgment but to respond to calls for help
and try to save anybody who might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it you know firefighters are firefighters.
Many of us die because of our jobs, whether it's heart problems or
cancer,'' said Worcester Fire Inspector Victor George. ``We are out
there to save lives. No matter who it is _ good people, evil people
_ we still would've tried to save them.''
</P>
<P>
   Worcester Deputy Fire Chief Ralph Lombardi shared George's
sentiments: ``They probably just didn't realize what they were
doing,'' he said of the homeless couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no idea what was going to happen. We expect people to
be responsible of course. Evidentally, they didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi said there have been numerous fires in the back of the
warehouse, which is separated from the rest of the building by a
brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a fire there last year, where (the homeless) had set up
like a loft,'' Lombardi said. ``It was a pretty good fire going up.
But we put it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said homeless people who live there use candle light because
there is no electricity inside.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the neighborhood around the warehouse, known as
Grafton Hill, it was well known that squatters lived inside the
sprawling building. But city officials said they were unaware that
any homeless people were living inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have knowledge of homeless getting into the
building,'' said David Holden, the city building commissioner.
``There have been no complaints filed with this department of
homeless people living there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there had been a complaint earlier this year of the
building not being secured. An inspector was sent to the site, and
ordered the owner, Ding On ``Tony`` Kwan, to secure any openings.
Within 24 hours, as required by state law, Kwan secured it, Holden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was just one complaint involving the building's
security this year, Holden said there have been others in recent
years. He was unable to give specific dates because he gave his
records to the city manager, who is reviewing them. The city
manager, Thomas Hoover, did not return phone calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters continued to press their efforts to find their
five fallen comrades, the scope of the memorial continued to grow.
Amtrak is offerring firefighters who want to attend the solemn
event free transit aboard a special train departing New Haven early
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to address grieving firefighters and the
relatives of the six men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole nation is grieving over this, and I think it's
appropriate that our Commander-in-Chief be here,'' said
Representative James McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters are expected to flood Worcester. Busloads are
traveling from Cleveland and Toronto, said George Burke, spokesman
for the International Association of Fire Fighters. Others are
coming from California, Ireland and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of honoring the firefighters and teaching a lesson on
heroism, Worcester Mayor Raymond Mariano declared Thursday a ``Day
of Mourning.'' Schools will be closed and students will be required
to write an essay Friday on heroism and public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroes are not athletes who hit baseballs in front of
thousands of cheering fans,'' Mariano said. ``Heroes are ordinary
men and women who reach out every day to help their community.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, investigators found a regulator -- a device that
controls air pressure on breathing equipment used by firefighters.
Searchers had hoped the discovery would lead to a body, according
to Giard.
</P>
<P>
   The regulator was discovered in a 50-foot by 50-foot area in the
southeast corner of the building where investigators believe they
have the greatest chance of locating the five missing firefighters.

MERCER AND BILLUPS HOLD COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It was a few minutes after noon when Ron Mercer
and Chauncey Billups walked toward the hotel lobby. The two friends
eventually sat _ facing each other _ in identical armchairs and
talked themselves through the lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   You have seen conversations like this. One friend starts a story
and the other one finishes it. Or someone starts saying something
controversial and the other person laughs as if to say, ``I cannot
believe you said that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old men talked about Rick Pitino, their families and
friends, wealth, the best time to be traded, and false statements
made about them by the Celtics. Billups talked about how he wanted
to send a letter to Pitino's son, Richard, but ``I felt kind of
crazy writing a letter to the Pitino house.'' Mercer mentioned how
people around you change when you become a millionaire. ``Everybody
thinks you're a bankroll,'' he said. ``You get new friends. Instead
of asking you for $5 or $10 they ask you for a couple thousand.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as their conversation seemed to dart forward and
shuffle from side to side, it truly hovered above a singular
premise: Payback.
</P>
<P>
   Both were asked to leave Boston before they wanted to. They were
Pitino's first two No. 1 picks, the third and sixth picks in the
1997 draft. They wanted to finish their careers together as
Celtics, but they will be at the FleetCenter Wednesday night as
members of the Denver Nuggets, trying to defeat the team _ and
specifically the man, Pitino _ that traded them away.
</P>
<P>
   Billups, picked third, was traded 51 games into his rookie year
(he had 13 assists in his final game at the FleetCenter). The story
was that he didn't fit at point guard, a statement Pitino repeated
in this year's training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that,'' Billups said. ``For somebody who drafted
me third to say that? I don't buy it. Because one thing about Coach
Pitino is he does his homework. No one works harder. He had to
watch a lot of film on me and see what I could do before he drafted
me, so he knew what I could do. I don't like people to sugar-coat
things. Just be real. He never had a conversation with me saying I
couldn't play the point, I just heard it through the media. So I
don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer, picked sixth, was traded in August. The story was that
his demands were too high for the Celtics. It is a portrait that
still bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want the fans to know it wasn't about money,'' he said.
``That's my main thing. I could care less what anybody else has to
say. I think the Boston fans should understand that and know it's
coming from me and not anyone else in the organization. (The
Celtics) have to cover themselves when they do certain deals, you
know, to justify them. But I wanted to be in Boston. I wanted to
stay. I was going to be traded regardless of what I asked for and I
knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   The best the 6-foot-3-inch Billups and 6-7 Mercer can do now is
help their new team win its third consecutive road game on this
six-game trip. If they win, they can go two games above the
break-even mark and simultaneously push the Celtics a game below
it. That's all they have the power to do in their first games as
FleetCenter visitors. But all you have to do is listen to their
conversation to understand that they would revise history if they
could.
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``I definitely think we would have won in Boston with
the team we had. Pitino's teams are going to win anyway if guys
believe in the system. Give us some experience and we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``Oh, yeah. I think so. The last few years, it's been a
totally different team every year. It's hard for teams to win and
blend that way. With a nucleus of Antoine (Walker), Paul (Pierce),
me and (Billups) . . . Man, that team would be special.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``That's a nucleus, man. What's the oldest guy in that
group, 24?''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``23.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``And you're talking about guys who can defend.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``Everybody was young and hungry. It was fun learning
the system at that age. But then, you have new people coming in all
the time. That kind of breaks up the rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``Think about it. We went to Boston at Picks 3 and 6.
(Tony) Battie and (Danny) Fortson went to Denver at 5 and 10. Now
we're here and they're there. Why didn't they just do that on draft
day?''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``They've got three players from the Denver team that
won 11 games (11-71 in '97-98, two wins above the worst record in
league history).''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``Yeah, but that team smashed us right after the
All-Star break (in February 1998). Remember that? They pounded
us.''
</P>
<P>
   As the friends speak, it is obvious that they are far from the
naive rookies who were introduced to Celtics fans in June 1997.
They were told then that they were the team's backcourt of the
future and they believed it. They know better now.
</P>
<P>
   Nuggets coach Dan Issel loves the way Mercer _ the team's
leading scorer _ plays. He said he was surprised by Mercer's skills
as a defender because ``a lot of big-time scorers can't defend like
he does.'' Those are complimentary words, but Mercer is smart
enough to know that they don't guarantee a long stay in the
Rockies. Like Billups, Mercer is in the final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``My time in Boston taught me. It's a business. All I
can tell anybody (in Boston) is be ready for a trade. Nobody is
safe. Chances are if your name comes up in trade rumors and Coach
Pitino says that's not really a possibility, then it might be a
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``Remember how we used to be on the Internet at 2 a.m.?
We used to get in from a road trip and head to the Internet. We'd
hear trade rumors and say, `Man. We're going to Sacramento. We're
going to Miami.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``The thing about it was that at least we were going to
be together.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``That was the good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``It's crazy. My two years in Boston, my name was
mentioned in trade rumors all the time. I could never relax. It's
good to know you're going to be in a city for a couple years, not
just a couple months.
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``You gotta rent. You can't be buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``(Billups) had it worse than I did. I was traded in the
summer. I would rather be traded during the summer than during the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``If I could change it, I just wish the Celtics would
have been honest and said, `You know what? We want to go with a
veteran point guard who has been around the league. We want to win
now.' You know, honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``I don't have any bitterness about being traded. It's
just the whole process of being traded and things being said that
are not true. But I guess things like that happen when you are
gone. Everything is fine when you're there, but when you are gone
that's when things are said about you.''
</P>
<P>
   The friends continue to chat as people walk through the lobby.
Some of them stop and eavesdrop. This doesn't bother the friends.
They say they can't wait to see Paul Pierce, whom they consider one
of the top five comedians in the NBA. ``One of the funniest moments
came last year when he was talking crazy to Eric Williams,'' Mercer
said. ``He got a technical for it. We were playing Denver and Paul
was getting on Eric pretty good. It was funny.'' They can't wait to
see Walker, Dana Barros, and Walter McCarty. They can't wait to see
Mercer's favorite gym, the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``I don't know what it is. I just always feel
comfortable there.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``Yeah, the building is nice. First place I called
home. But it is always freezing in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``The game? I was like (Mercer) when I first got
traded. I followed the Celtics all the time. You follow them for a
while, but then it wears off. I'll be excited, but it's
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``I'm excited. I'm ready for it. I'm hungry to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Billups: ``You want to show them, `Y'all gave up on me? Well,
look at this.' I haven't played against Boston yet but I have
played against Toronto. I try to kill them every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer: ``I still talk to Antoine. That's my man. Nothing is
going to change that. But come (tonight), it's all business.''
</P>
<P>
   They begin to leave the lobby after their long talk. It is time
for lunch but Mercer, who had been battling a sinus infection,
wasn't sure whether he could have it. His mother checked in on him
to offer some motherly words about the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom called and told me that I may be sick now, but I better
get well for the Celtics game,'' he said. ``I don't have a
choice.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ School investigators on Tuesday charged that dozens
of teachers and two principals across New York City's public school
system had helped students cheat on the standardized reading and
mathematics tests that help determine how schools are ranked and
whether students move on to the next grade. The cheating incident
appears to be one of the largest in the recent history of American
public schools, the investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   At some schools, teachers and principals let students mark their
answers on scrap or notebook paper then told the them which answers
to correct when they filled in the bubbles in the official test
booklets, the investigators said. At others, they directed students
to erase incorrect answers, or even changed the answers themselves.
The investigators said that in a particularly egregious case,
Evelyn Hey, the principal of Public School 234 in the Bronx, had
used all three methods to improve the test scores of third graders.
</P>
<P>
   Students' performance on the tests improved remarkably at many
of the schools, and two were even removed from a statewide list of
failing schools, said Edward Stancik, the special investigator for
New York City schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their purpose was simply to improve their own reputations and
further their own careers by creating the illusion that they were
doing a good job,'' Stancik said Tuesday after releasing a report
that laid out the evidence against the teachers and principals.
``The Board of Education has failed to do an effective job in
uncovering or punishing cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges of widespread cheating between 1995 and this year _
against 32 elementary and middle schools, 43 teachers, two
principals and two paraprofessionals _ come at a time when
educators are under unprecedented pressure to improve student
performance nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The pressure has been particularly intense in New York City,
where many students are performing below grade level. Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew removed five district superintendents last
summer, largely on the basis of their failure to improve student
performance on state and citywide tests. And in new annual
evaluations that will determine whether they can keep their jobs,
school principals will be partly judged on student test scores.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two school districts in Brooklyn are experimenting
with a merit pay program that gives financial rewards to teachers
and principals in schools where test scores improve, and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani has expressed interest in expanding the program
despite warnings that it might encourage cheating.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The investigators did not criticize the increased emphasis on
test scores Tuesday, saying the Board of Education simply needs
more aggressive strategies for preventing cheating and weeding out
teachers who engage in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let the cheaters completely alter our education
policies,'' Stancik said. ``The way to deal with cheaters is to
single them out and punish them.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests of ``easily over 1,000 students were tainted'' by the
actions of teachers or principals, Stancik said. He added that
investigators had not attempted to track whether any students had
been improperly promoted or held back as a result of the tainted
tests.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Tuesday, afternoon, Crew said the
allegations were disturbing, but added that he did not believe such
cheating was rampant. He said he felt ``very bad for the children
involved,'' and lamented that the charges would ``unfortunately
give the entire school system a black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said he had introduced precautions to discourage cheating,
including a requirement that schools keep test booklets under lock
and key from the time they arrive in schools to the time the tests
are administered.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have 1,100 schools in New York City, and there are
always going to be people who find it necessary in one form or
another to find a way of being able to try to gain an advantage by
virtue of doing something like this,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The suspected educators will be reassigned to duty at their
district offices while Board of Education officials study the
evidence and determine whether they should be fired, said Karen
Crowe, a spokeswoman for Crew. In his report, Stancik recommended
that at least 12 of the 47 educators charged with cheating lose
their jobs immediately. In addition to the 47, four principals and
an assistant principal were cited by investigators not for cheating
but for mishandling complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments to reporters Tuesday, Crew alluded to his thorny
relationship with Stancik. In 1997, Crew even called upon Stancik
to resign, saying that his reports on corruption in the school
system tended to be exaggerated and that many unfairly damaged the
system's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Stancik said his office began the cheating investigation in July
1998, after teachers at two schools in District 9 in the Bronx came
forward to reveal a history of cheating in their schools. Stancik
began by investigating those schools, and eventually expanded the
investigation to include schools in all five boroughs, many of
which his office or the Board of Education had received tips about.
The investigators also singled out schools that had reported rapid
and steep improvements in student performance, Stancik said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators interviewed teachers and administrators, but
most of their witnesses were elementary and middle school students,
who described several methods teachers had used to manipulate their
test scores. Stancik said that for the students, the cheating had
the effect of ``an emotional roller coaster that occurs when the
tests go way up and then come way back down.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave the example of a fourth-grade girl whose reading score
increased from the 12th percentile _ meaning she outperformed only
12 percent of a nationwide sample of students _ to the 81st
percentile when her teacher gave her clues or answers. But the
girl's score plummeted back to the 19th percentile the following
year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Crew and state Education Commissioner Richard Mills said Tuesday
that it was too early to know if the students or the schools
involved would face any academic consequences. But Stancik said the
evidence his office had unearthed should not be used to make
assumptions about the test scores of students systemwide.
</P>
<P>
   Stancik released the names of all the teachers and principals
accused of involvement in the cheating, but many did not return
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Virgeous Bridgett, a teacher at Community Elementary School 4 in
the Bronx, said that she had never used any of the cheating
techniques described in the report. ``I'm really shocked that the
children would say these things,'' said Ms. Bridgett, who has
taught at the school since 1988. ``This definitely is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Hay, the principal at PS 234, said only, ``It's all based
on hearsay; I'm not at liberty to talk about it.'' The report
accused Ms. Hay of directing third graders to write their answers
on separate pieces of paper, then walking around the room and
telling the children, ``Do that one over,'' until all the answers
were correct. Only then did Ms. Hay tell students to write their
responses on the official answer sheets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a teacher at PS 31 on Staten Island pointed to
wrong answers on a 1998 math test taken by third graders, then told
students to ``try to get the answers right before putting them on
the grid paper,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Stancik said that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Crew, but
he said the Board of Education's Office of Investigative Services
had repeatedly failed to root out cheating. He also said officials
in that office had impeded his investigation by claiming to have
misplaced information about some of the implicated schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer should anyone assume that even if the cheating is
uncovered, it will be buried and just go away,'' Stancik said.

DECISION NEARS ON FATE OF EX-LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN and DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal authorities have intensified their
deliberations about whether to prosecute a Los Alamos nuclear
weapons scientist on charges of mishandling highly classified
atomic data, government officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether to charge the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, is
expected within days, the officials said, after a crucial meeting
held Saturday at the White House attended by the administration's
top security, law enforcement and energy officials.
</P>
<P>
   The participants concluded after a lengthy intelligence review
that should Attorney General Janet Reno decide to prosecute, the
secrets that would likely be divulged at a criminal trial would not
irreparably damage the country's national security.
</P>
<P>
   Among those present in addition to Reno were Sandy Berger,
President Clinton's national security adviser; Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson; FBI Director Louis Freeh; CIA Director George
Tenet, and John Kelly, the top federal prosecutor in Albuquerque,
N.M., who has jurisdiction over the case.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and Kelly have recommended going ahead
with a case against Lee, said the officials, who asked not to be
identified. Richardson, who supports bringing a prosecution,
indicated that he is prepared to exercise his statutory authority
to declassify atomic secrets likely to be needed as evidence in the
trial, the officials said. But they added that it is Reno who must
decide whether to seek an indictment and she has not given
prosecutors final approval.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, his lawyers and his supporters have repeatedly said that he
has done nothing wrong and that no one has ever been criminally
charged for similar conduct, for example, transferring classified
information into a nonclassified computer. Mark Holscher, Lee's
attorney in Los Angeles, did not return telephone calls on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Holscher and Lee's other supporters have said that
Lee is a loyal American who has been unfairly singled out for
investigation because of his Chinese ancestry. They say that Lee is
being made a scapegoat by law enforcement and energy officials who
have been under fire by Republicans in Congress for security lapses
at the country's weapons laboratories. In a television interview in
August, Lee also said he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The highly unusual White House meeting reflects the acute
political sensitivities and high stakes involved in a case that has
become a battleground between the administration and Republican
critics who have said that Chinese intelligence had used scientists
to steal information from the weapons labs that was used to vastly
accelerate the pace of Beijing's nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, if he is charged, Lee will not be accused of
espionage, the officials said, which would require prosecutors to
show that information was not only stolen but passed to a foreign
power. Prosecutors are now weighing whether to charge Lee with a
lesser crime of mishandling and failing to adequately safeguard
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   The recent surge of activity in the case comes just before the
expiration of the term of a federal grand jury in Albuquerque that
has been hearing evidence in the case. The grand jurors were to be
dismissed this month, but their terms have been extended until
early January.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who worked in the nuclear weapons design area of Los
Alamos, was fired from his job in March for security violations. By
that time, he had been under investigation for nearly three years
in connection with the government's inquiry into the apparent theft
of U.S. nuclear secrets by China. U.S. investigators believe that
design information related to the most advanced nuclear warhead in
the nation's arsenal, the W-88, was obtained by China, in part
through espionage. The W-88 warhead was designed at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee was fired, investigators found evidence that he had
transferred vast amounts of secret nuclear data from the classified
system at Los Alamos into an unclassified system. In a televised
interview, Lee acknowledged that he transferred the data, but said
he did so to protect the material from being lost in computer
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation into Lee became public, a furious debate
has erupted over whether the inquiry was properly handled by the
Energy Department and the FBI. Subsequently, FBI officials said
that the initial inquiry into the evidence of Chinese atomic
espionage was flawed, and other current and former government
officials argued that investigators had focused prematurely on Lee
without first determining how widely accessible the information on
the W-88 warhead had been at the time officials concluded the
Chinese obtained it. Asian-American groups rallied to Lee's cause,
saying he was the victim of racial stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Reno and Freeh ordered federal agents to broaden
their investigation into the evidence of China's theft of W-88
secrets, moving beyond Los Alamos to look at other labs and defense
contractors that may have had access to the data.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even as that broader inquiry into evidence of Chinese
espionage is continuing, the government has been moving forward in
its investigation of Lee over allegations of unauthorized computer
transfers of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the unauthorized transfers of nuclear data into
an unclassified computer system at Los Alamos, government
investigators now believe that Lee also copied the nuclear secrets
onto computer tapes and took those tapes out of the lab, officials
said. The FBI cannot account for those missing computer tapes,
officials said. Officials have no evidence that the tapes have been
handed over to any other unauthorized individuals, however.
</P>
<P>
   The recent discovery of the missing computer tapes appears to
have convinced government officials that the evidence against Lee
may be more serious than initially believed. Stephen Younger,
associate laboratory director for nuclear weapons, who oversees the
division where Lee worked, has completed a highly classified
analysis of Lee's computer activities that shows that the potential
damage to national security could be extensive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If he is charged in the computer downloading case, Lee's
attorneys appear likely to respond by saying that he is the victim
of selective prosecution for relatively common practices. Former
CIA Director John Deutch, for example, who was investigated by the
CIA's inspector general for improperly handling classified
information on his computer, had his security clearance stripped
this year, but was not charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Alamos officials have said that they disagree with Lee's
assertions that his computer activities were routine.
</P>
<P>
   John Browne, the director of Los Alamos, said in an interview in
August that ``We have no evidence that anyone has ever done
anything like this before at Los Alamos, and we have looked. I have
no doubt that he violated Los Alamos security regulations, and I
have no doubt that he deserved to be terminated. We have fired
people for much less.''

MCCAIN CALLS FOR OVERHAUL OF NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUSH-DEBATES) 
(mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain called Tuesday for the United States to adjust
its national security policy to the post-Cold War era by rebuilding
its military to meet the new threats posed by rogue states,
terrorists and ethnic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech setting out his military policy, the Arizona
senator, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination,
outlined steps that he said were necessary to meet the security
challenges of the new millennium. His proposals ranged from a pay
increase for the military to deployment of a national missile
defense system to elimination of outmoded weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, my friends, we must face a harsh and compelling
reality,'' McCain said, according to an advance text of a speech he
was to deliver Tuesday night at the USS Intrepid Sea-Air-Space
Museum in Manhattan. ``In strategy, personnel and procurement _ the
total package that defines America's ability to defend itself _ the
United States does not have the modern force and defense posture we
must have to meet the threats to America's interests and values in
the 21st century.'' As a young naval aviator, McCain served on the
USS Intrepid.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp criticism of the Clinton administration's military
policy, McCain also said: ``It's time to end the disingenuous
practice of stating that we have a two-war strategy when we are
paying for only a one-war military. Either we must change our
strategy _ and accept the risks _ or we must properly fund and
structure our military.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for five and a half
years and served in the Navy for 22 years, set out proposals
intended to increase military morale and to reshape the nation's
armed forces for challenges that he said required lighter, more
flexible special forces instead of a conventional military geared
toward war in Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The senator called for a 3 percent-a-year pay increase for
military personnel across three years beginning in the 2001 fiscal
year and the elimination of federal taxes on military personnel
based overseas. Aides said the cost of the raise would be $4.3
billion over three years, while the tax proposal would cost $800
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain said he could identify ways to save $20
billion in Pentagon spending through steps like eliminating pork
barrel spending, closing unneeded bases, privatizing some support
and maintenance functions and eliminating ``Buy America''
restrictions. In New Hampshire, where he previewed some of his
remarks before a Rotary Club, McCain also listed the C-130
aircraft, the B-2 bomber and the Seawolf submarine as examples of
weapons systems that were no longer necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's aides said savings across all these areas would
come close to offsetting McCain's military spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The address on national security policy was the first of a
number of speeches McCain plans over the next few weeks on health
care, the environment and Social Security. Polls show that the
senator is running neck and neck with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
in the first primary state of New Hampshire, and he said he thought
it was time for him to go beyond introducing himself to the voters
and to make his policy prescriptions more specific.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has been using his gripping personal story and his
expertise in foreign policy to set himself apart from Bush. But his
military policy was not strikingly different from Bush's own call
in September for the nation to adapt to new security challenges in
the aftermath of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, pulling together themes he has sounded over the past
year, said the threats to the nation's strategic interests had
evolved since the Cold War, although he still cited as potential
threats the political and economic chaos in Russia and the growing
military and economic might of China.
</P>
<P>
   He said America faced national security challenges from
nationalist and ethnic conflicts, from the possibility of attacks
on such vital links as computer grids, from the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction in rogue states and from terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   By the coming decade, he said, the United States could face ``a
fundamentally new strategic situation: a rogue state such as Iraq
or North Korea, with the ability in time of crisis to use nuclear
blackmail against an American president.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for a policy of ``rogue state rollback,'' not simply
to contain such regimes but to drive them from power by helping
opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called a ballistic missile system an ``indispensable
defense'' against rogue states. He said that as president he would
try to negotiate an agreement with Russia to alter the 1972 ABM
treaty with the Soviet Union to allow such a missile defense
shield. But if Russia would not agree, he flatly said, ``I will
withdraw from a treaty that has become a relic of the Cold War if
it cannot be made relevant to our national security needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made a similar pledge to break out of the treaty if
Russia does not agree to make changes. And the Clinton
administration itself, though in softer terms than either of the
Republicans, has also started to raise the possibility of breaking
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the Pentagon needed to reassess the goals and
mission of each of the nation's military services for a time when
the nation's forces needed to be smaller, more automated and easier
to deploy. ``Re-evaluating readiness will prove an utter waste of
time if it is intended only to hide a lack of political will to
provide a superpower defense for a superpower's commitments,'' he
said. ``We should never ask how much defense we can afford, my
friends. We must honestly ask how much defense we need and have the
courage to find the money to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaming both President Clinton and the Republican-controlled
Congress, McCain issued a scathing critique of current military
readiness. He said that during the war in Kosovo last spring, the
Army was ``unable to deploy its premier Apache helicopter forces in
time to play a vital role.'' He noted that the Air Force's
inventory of air-launched cruise missiles fell to 70 from the 1,000
level the Pentagon says it needs to handle two major-theater wars.
</P>
<P>
   And he said reductions in the United States' carrier fleet
``could have resulted in a calamity in the Pacific'' earlier this
year when deployments for Kosovo and the Persian Gulf left ``no
carrier battle groups in East Asia's waters, where events in the
Strait of Taiwan and on the Korean Peninsula could have become
world-threatening crises.''

 &HT;    Company, state say family must leave
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Fla. _ Decades before Disney made Florida safe for
cartoon-based tourism, Tom Gaskins Sr. built the quirkiest of
roadside attractions from the boiled and peeled knees of cypress
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The late craftsman's creations were gnarled, enigmatic and
otherworldly, covered with Elephant Man-like lumps or shimmering
like satin. Transformed, the knobby growths resembled almost
anything imaginable: polar bears and poodles, Adolf Hitler and
Groucho Marx, Spanish castles and a lady hippopotamus wearing a
Carmen Miranda hat _ even, to one classically minded connoisseur,
the Trojan priest Laocoon and his sons being strangled by serpents.
</P>
<P>
   Now a $46 million land deal is threatening to strangle Gaskins'
collection of arboreal artifacts, encased behind streaked glass in
a squat museum far removed from Florida's theme park mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, by the agricultural giant Lykes Bros., gave the state
nearly 60,000 acres of land and development rights along Fisheating
Creek west of Lake Okeechobee. That included ownership of the
15-acre homestead where the Gaskins family has lived and worked
since 1936.
</P>
<P>
   The state says Gaskins' heirs must leave the land by April. And
if that happens, son Tom Gaskins Jr. says, he'll probably have to
close the family-run Cypress Knee Museum just across U.S. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaskins family holds a deed to the 2 acres where the museum
sits. But Lykes owns the land where they live, by all accounts
under a vaguely worded gentlemen's agreement 63 years ago between
the elder Gaskins and the company.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a handful of houses that the Gaskinses built by hand
from cypress shingles and palm logs, the homesite includes a
workshop where tourists can buy the family's popular line of
handcrafted turkey calls. It also features a narrow wooden catwalk
that lets visitors view the protruding cypress knees in their
natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gaskins Jr. is fighting to stay, and supporters hope he can
make a deal with Lykes and the state. State and company officials
offer little hope, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make any fuss or wrangle with anybody,'' said
Gaskins Jr., 58, who has crafted many of the cypress knees himself
and lives on the homestead with his wife, Billie Jo, and their two
sons and a daughter-in-law. ``I just want to be a little cypress
museum curator and a real good turkey call maker and live and let
live.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he can't help feeling discouraged about the
pressures facing the museum, which also has been buffeted by
disrepair, dwindling tourism, run-ins with state transportation
officials and some attempted burglaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I've got sharks and jackals trying to dismantle my
father's life work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens in such bureaucratic impasses, the people in
charge say their hands are tied.
</P>
<P>
   Lykes corporate counsel Beth Waters said the state is insisting
that the company remove Gaskins from the homesite to remove any
questions about title to the land. ``We really don't have any
choice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the state, said Eva Armstrong, director of state
lands for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. She
said the state bought the land with money from its Preservation
2000 program, which requires the property to be used for
conservation _ not private homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mean the man ill will at all,'' she said. She added
that if Gaskins thinks he has some legal claim to the land, ``His
dispute is with Lykes.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the state is giving Gaskins a break by allowing
him until April to make arrangements to leave, even though the sale
closed last week. He also can take whatever property he's entitled
to _ though that might not include the houses he and his father
built.
</P>
<P>
   Waters said she hopes Gaskins won't close the museum, especially
since Fisheating Creek will now feature a state wildlife area
expected to draw tourists. ``I would think the museum would only
benefit from this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gaskins said he's afraid of what might happen to the museum
if he's not around full-time to keep an eye on it. He said he's
already caught a Miami physician in the middle of carting away
cypress knees, and once he scared away intruders breaking into a
display case.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskins owns 20 secluded acres a mile away, but he said he'd
rather trade that land to Lykes than move there. Much about the
case remains in dispute, including whether Lykes has ever formally
told Gaskins he must leave. (Waters said the company sent him a
certified letter last month. He denies receiving it.)
</P>
<P>
   Both Gaskins and Lykes agree that his father had no fancy
contract when he moved onto the company's land in the midst of the
Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskins said Lykes told his father, ``Come down here and build
all you want to.'' He said Lykes also encouraged his dad to cut the
cypress knees to the ground to clear grazing space for the
company's cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, offering a slightly different account, said the elder
Gaskins agreed to pay the company part of his earnings. Lykes
hasn't gotten a check for a while but has allowed the family to
stay, Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gaskins Sr. used the land to create an art form and an
eccentric slice of Old Florida as he wandered the swamp barefoot
harvesting the knobby knees that protrude up from the cypress
trees' roots.
</P>
<P>
   He'd look for interesting-shaped specimens, harvest them, steam
or boil them like potatoes and peel away the bark, sometimes using
dental tools. Sometimes, as an experiment, he would encourage the
knees' growth into odd shapes by scarring them or inserting
arrowheads and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Creativity runs in the Gaskins family. Tom Gaskin Sr.'s father
invented a roach trap that he sold all over the world, and his
grandfather invented a type of railroad car coupler.
</P>
<P>
   The knees landed Tom Gaskins Sr. on The Tonight Show during the
Johnny Carson years. But later he succumbed to Alzheimer's disease
before dying last year, and time has been unkind to his collection.
In 1992, Tom Gaskins Jr. had to take down the
cypress-and-plywood-advertisements that used to line 25 miles of
U.S. 27. Now they mostly cluster above the museum, somewhat
resembling the stick figures in the movieThe Blair Witch Project,
offering come-hithers to tourists who have already arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``HI FOLKS,'' says one. ``LOVELY DAY ISN'T IT,''
</P>
<P>
   says another. Yet another proclaims: ``FLORIDA HERITAGE AWARD IN
88,'' with one ``8'' drooping.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s to 1980s, the museum took in 100 to 175 visitors
each day during the winter tourist season. These days, ``we're
lucky to have a dozen people come through,'' Tom Gaskins Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonder the place has survived,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if it doesn't, neither would his lifelong dreams and a piece
of Florida history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have basically sacrificed my whole dang life,'' he said.
``My whole business is here. If somebody kills this place, they've
killed me.''

 RUNNING A NETWORK LIKE A '30s FILM STUDIO  (af) 
 Margy Rochlin's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
Albert Brooks.  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a rival decided to take a few shots at the WB network in a
recent series of trade ads, at least one WB executive's response
was shock. Not at the attack, but at the package that it came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it almost looks like a Crazy Eddie ad,'' said Bob
Bibb, who is co-president of marketing at WB. ``There's no element
that states who they are.'' Then Bibb conducted his version of an
impromptu blind taste test. ``Close your eyes,'' he instructed.
What, he asked, do you think of when you hear that other network's
name? ``Now what images come to mind when you hear `WB'?''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was a loaded question. Bibb knows that ``UPN''
conjures up, well, the letters U, P and N. Whereas, with ``WB,''
pictures and sounds flood in: camera-friendly, soulful-eyed young
stars, knowingly witty dialogue, lilting sulk-pop songs that
underscore story lines involving teen-size traumas.
</P>
<P>
   That you might also picture their embarrassing logo _ a cartoon
frog _ seems only to support the network's touching defense of its
corporate mascot, which is that although it has drawn ridicule, at
least it attracts attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bibb would probably prefer not to play his WB word association
game with some television columnists, though. Especially the
crankier ones who hear the netlet's name and can only think ``evil
trendsetter.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years running, WB has been the favored child of
Madison Avenue ad buyers, media types and teen-age-girl America. It
was only a matter of time before an onslaught of youth-oriented
series from every other broadcast network would hit the airwaves,
hoping to duplicate WB's success.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next reflects a television fact of life: highly
rated shows spawn a slew of pasty imitations, which ultimately
tank. The first casualty was Fox's ``Manchester Prep,'' which was
pulled before the broadcast of a single snide installment. The most
recent is ABC's ``Wasteland.'' Only 3 of 13 completed episodes of
this singularly uncaptivating Gen X evening soap were shown.
</P>
<P>
   This news, along with each notice of a youth-show expulsion, has
been greeted with a joyful cry from mortgage-holding,
property-tax-paying pundits who seem to be under the impression
that every cancellation is a victory for 40-somethings everywhere,
that maturity has bravely beaten back the hormonal tide of
adolescent viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But what if this season isn't about the waning of a trend but
about the entrenching of a network that runs itself as if it were a
self-contained television theme park? Over at WB, a trio of
freshman shows are doing well: ``Popular,'' ``Roswell'' and
``Angel,'' the last an offshoot of WB's flagship, ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.'' Of course, none of the new shows have gone above
No. 107 in the ratings, but by WB standards they're hits.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three has growing buzz and critical support. Each is
harmonious in tone with the returning WB standard-bearers:
``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Felicity,'' ``Charmed'' and ``Buffy.'' Each
is set in the present day in one of three WB preferred locations:
high school, college or flunky-job-early-stage adulthood. Each lets
an ensemble of three to six characters wrestle with rotating stock
problems: best friend betrayals, crushes from afar, blossoming
romantic feelings, dwindling romantic feelings, whether or not to
go all the way and parents who just can't seem to grasp the genuine
breadth and gravity of their kids' mini-tempests.
</P>
<P>
   (In the case of ``Roswell'' and ``Angel,'' these predicaments
can be presented as both real and metaphorical. The former is about
three stranded-on-earth extraterrestrial teenagers, while the
latter involves an introspective vampire who hopes to offset
200-plus years of neck-biting barbarity by working as a do-gooder
for hire in Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   Complementing these traits is the contract player quality of the
various casts. The network achieved this by hiring from what Lewis
Goldstein, the other co-president of marketing, calls the WB
``stable of stars.'' By this, Goldstein means young, but perhaps
inexperienced, actors who've turned in a memorable guest
performance or been the third or fourth lead on another WB series,
who are then shuttled from show to show and, occasionally, if
ready, promoted out of the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea modeled after film studios in the 1930s, ``where
you'd see Frank Morgan in `The Wizard of Oz' and in the next movie
he'd be a Park Avenue sophisticate,'' said Bibb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think everybody is saying, `I want to make sense
of what I'm watching,''' he added. ``I find a great comfort in the
History Channel. When I turn it on, I know I'm probably going to
see something about Nazi Germany or the Pyramids, but at least I
know what I'm going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   For WB's comfort recipe, remove scratchy footage of Der Fuhrer
and substitute a love triangle, say, or brooding close-ups of an
actor whom viewers have seen before. The whole ``stable of stars''
concept still has a corny ring, but it ensures a consistent,
all-important familiarity, which is perhaps WB's shrewdest
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   For example, WB didn't have to introduce its target 12-to-34
female demographic to Jason Behr as Max, the sensitive-guy alien
lead on ``Roswell''; they'd already met him as a preening Don Juan
last season on ``Dawson's Creek.'' Before Sara Rue made the
transformation into the acceptance-hungry Carmen on ``Popular,''
she was a wheelchair-bound bully on ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for David Boreanaz, he was, of course, Buffy's taboo vampire
boyfriend on ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' before being transferred
over to ``Angel.'' As spinoffs go, ``Angel'' appeared destined to
flop. What do you do with a hero who can function only after the
sun goes down? And what about Boreanaz's uncertain range and
reined-in line readings?
</P>
<P>
   Yet one reason ``Angel'' works is its double dose of WB-style
familiarity; the hilarious Charisma Carpenter, also shipped over
from ``Buffy,'' is a perfect complement to the deadpan Boreanaz.
And the pesky daylight problem? Judging from the frequency you see
sunshine pouring through the venetian blinds of Angel's office
window, the creators' solution is to hope you just don't notice.
</P>
<P>
   What does an ill-finessed franchise expander look like? Flip the
channel to Fox on Monday nights and check out ``Time of Your
Life.'' The premise is workable enough: Jennifer Love Hewitt takes
her super-chipper ``Party of Five'' waif, Sarah Reeves Marin, to
Manhattan. Here WB's familiarity mandate (is there a magazine cover
Ms. Hewitt hasn't been on?) has been employed, albeit with a twist:
if you feel as if you're already acquainted with the community of
personality types assembled around Ms. Hewitt, it's because they
were established last year on WB's New York girl show,
``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, lack of originality on ``Time of Your Life'' isn't the
show's worst fault. What hurts it most is that its upbeat air of
innocence and personal discovery seems to clash with the cynical
mood of its gleefully ribald follow-up, ``Ally McBeal.'' Shouldn't
it be linked on the weekly schedule to its parent series, ``Party
of Five,'' or even the grandparent of modern youth shows, ``Beverly
Hills 90210''?
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he'd do, WB's chief executive officer, Jamie
Kellner, balked. ``I don't comment on Fox's programming,'' said
Kellner, who was president and chief operating officer at Fox
before joining WB in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner, however, has WB carefully considering the pairing of
new shows with returning ones, forming seamless two-hour
programming blocks this season. It seems logical to roll out
``Buffy,'' then ``Angel.'' Even more cagily, the snipefest
``Popular'' is matched with ``Charmed,'' starring the snipe-doyenne
Shannen Doherty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year our flow is exceptionally strong,'' Kellner agreed.
In fact, a recent poll revealed that of the 20 television shows
most popular with teen-age girls, 10 are on WB.
</P>
<P>
   ``But last year we made horrendous mistakes,'' he said. ``That
really shook us up back into the rules of scheduling in a
multichannel universe, which is flow, flow, flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that WB is blunderproof. Devoting most of its meager
promotion budget to ``Roswell,'' the network ignored this season's
real breakway hit, ``Popular,'' which teenagers are now watching
more than ``Friends.'' Sitcom success still eludes them. And though
WB boasts about being the network that gives imperfect shows time
to fix themselves, its patch job on its hourlong drama ``Hyperion
Bay'' was adding to the cast Carmen Electra?
</P>
<P>
   And is there such a thing as television jail for whoever let
Keri Russell's blond locks go? Ever since the shearing of Ms.
Russell's bountiful My Little Pony tresses, ``Felicity's'' ratings
have dipped.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Kellner doesn't seem to think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should have never cut Keri's hair,'' Kellner said.
``The audience is clearly not happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he offered a final WB bylaw: ``Never fight the audience.
You'll lose every time.''

COMMENTARY: HOMES FOR THE HOLIDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Everybody agrees that something historically
momentous has occurred in the White House. But it is not that the
first lady is seeking political office on her own. It is that the
first lady is moving out of the White House while her husband is
still occupying it.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is packing her bags for New York and decorating the
Christmas tree in Washington. As usual, a Clinton is in two places
at one time. But the magnitude of this dissonance is staggering.
Even as she ornaments the White House for the holidays, so as to
present it to the country as a model setting for a warm family
Christmas, she is taking her Oriental carpet and her easy chair and
leaving the house. A carpetbagger, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons continue to break creative new ground in family
dysfunction. Will they live together in Chappaqua? Why did she
refer to her New York address as ``my house''? Is something more
cataclysmic than a commuter arrangement in the offing?
</P>
<P>
   And what else, precisely, is she packing? If she roots around in
that closet of Arkansas tchotchkes, maybe she'll find the complete
set of those Rose Law Firm billing records.
</P>
<P>
   All their adult lives, the Clintons have been moochers _ excuse
me, public servants _ who have lived in public housing and borrowed
private housing for vacations. They are rootless people preaching
to the nation about the need for roots. But what objects do they
own and even cherish? More to the point, aside from a few wonky
volumes, Judy Collins CD's, Scrabble and Boggle, what will the
dissociating couple fight over? Not the nuclear codes, hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Since they have consumed the services of so many lawyers, I want
to spare them the services of Raoul Felder. And so I offer, in a
fine holiday spirit, an equitable his-and-hers separation agreement
for what stays in this White House and what goes to that white
house.

 &HT;    Action on tobacco plan unlikely this year
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ It's a near certainty that Gov. Bob Taft will
have to wait until next year for the legislature to send him a
final plan for spending the $10.1 billion Ohio is expected to
receive in the national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg, said Tuesday that
the House will vote on its tobacco plan Thursday, probably in the
afternoon. By that time, senators are expected to have finished up
their work for the year and gone home.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said that if, as expected, the House version differs
from the one approved Nov. 9 by the Senate, a conference committee
probably would be formed to settle the differences. The conference
committee could report back to the legislature early next year,
Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Milburn, Taft's spokesman, said that the governor hoped to
have the plan approved by the end of the year because next year's
schedule already is loaded with issues such as the capital
improvements budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Taft) wants to try to get this done by the end of the
year. If that's not something that is going to be possible for them
(legislators), he would like to get done as quickly as possible . .
. He (Taft) can understand that there is only so much time,'' Scott
Milburn, Taft's spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Milburn said Taft is very pleased that the House appears to be
leaning toward the 26-year spending plan he endorses. The Senate,
by a 17-16 vote on Nov. 9, approved a 13-year plan for spending
about $5 billion of the settlement. That means future legislatures
will have the chance to plan for spending the remainder of the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the tobacco settlement is an integral part of Taft's
12-year plan to spend $10.2 billion in state money on school
buildings. He has cited the plan in the brief he filed with the
Ohio Supreme Court, asking it to reverse a lower court decision
that the state's school funding system is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson and Finance Committee Chairman Robert Corbin,
R-Washington Twp., said that they believe there is enough support
in Corbin's committee for it to approve a 26-year plan today and
send it to the House floor Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the speaker took the extraordinary step of appointing
herself and Speaker Pro Tempore Randall Gardner, R-Bowling Green,
to fill two Finance Committee vacancies to vote on the tobacco
bill. She and Gardner are familiar with the issue, Davidson said.
She also suggested that they provide added support for the 26-year
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said that she does not believe that carrying over the
tobacco issue until next year will cause the legislature to start
over.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Scott Nein, R-Middletown, who voted against the bill in the
Senate , said that ``the longer this thing sits around it's great.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be a lot more discussion, a lot more discussion
by all members of the legislature . . . I hope they go back to
square one,'' said Nein, who favors returning the money to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the Republican-controlled Finance Committee turned
back a Democratic proposal to spend more than Taft wants to on
smoking prevention programs, with the extra money coming from funds
Taft wants to use for school buildings and technology. Taft's plan
calls for spending more than half the $10.1 billion on school
construction and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also allocates money for health programs, law
enforcement, biomedical research and help for tobacco-farming
areas.

   BC-MEXICO-GRAVES-NYT (moved on Friday, Dec. 3)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, Dec. 3,
about the search by Mexican and American law enforcement agencies
for bodies believed to be buried at a drug trafficker's farm near
Ciudad Juarez referred incorrectly to the arrival of the Mexican
attorney general, Jorge Madrazo, and the director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, at the farm. According to a
letter from the F.B.I.'s office of public and congressional
affairs, they arrived by car, not in the two helicopters that
landed at the farm at the same time.

   GERMANY: PARTY RE-ELECTS SCHROEDER
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder tightened his control over his
fractious Social Democratic Party, easily winning re-election as
chairman. Left-wing members have resisted his plans to slow the
rise in pension payments and reduce government spending about $16
billion a year. But Schroeder's popularity got a lift when he
backed the bailout of a major construction company and proposed
higher inheritance taxes, and delegates seemed more interested in
unity.

   GERMANY: EMPLOYERS OF FORCED LABOR

<P>
   The American Jewish Committee listed 255 companies, including
many new names, that reportedly used forced labor during the Nazi

   GREECE: TURKEY THREATENED WITH VETO
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Greece would veto
Turkey's membership in the European Union if Turkey failed to
accept Greek demands in disputes over Cyprus and Aegean oil.
Members meet this week in Helsinki, Finland, to review enlargement
of the bloc. A Greek veto could end the detente that developed when
the countries aided each other after serious earthquakes this year.

<P>
   Averting a potential confrontation with Muslim leaders, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak rejected demands that he rescind his
authorization of new doorways to an underground mosque at Haram
al-Sharif. The complex includes the Dome of the Rock, a mosque
sacred to Muslims, and the Western Wall, venerated by Jews.
Orthodox Jews and rightist politicians said the project could
damage unexcavated remains of an ancient Jewish temple. The new
doorways will provide emergency exits for the crowds during
Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, which begins Thursday.

MAJOR CONTRACTS CANCELED WITH EUROPE'S LARGEST INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Mass., Okla., Mich., Ill., N.Y., Texas)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This fall, large corporations were expected to begin using a new
national center to process donations that their workers made to
United Way through payroll deduction, phasing out the need to cope
with the varying practices of the 1,300 local United Ways.
</P>
<P>
   But in its first test, the system, built by the American arm of
Cap Gemini Group, Europe's largest information technology company,
was unable to process gifts from employees of the Williams Co., the
Oklahoma pipeline and communications concern. United Way of America
then retained Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the consulting firm, which found
400 serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, without any public announcement, Betty Beene,
president of United Way of America, terminated Cap Gemini's
contract and scrapped the project, which cost $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another large nonprofit group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
canceled its $75 million contract with Cap Gemini on Aug. 31,
saying that the company ``consistently and systematically has been
unable to deliver what the contract required.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an antiquated computer information system built by Rube
Goldberg,'' said Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the chamber.
``Unfortunately, we hired Rube Goldberg's nephew to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of Cap Gemini America, D. Michael Meyer, was too
busy to be interviewed, said his spokeswoman, Mary Ellen Horn. She
would not acknowledge that the company had a contract with United
Way of America but did say that the company ``met all the
contractual requirements'' under its contract with the chamber. Cap
Gemini and the chamber are suing each other in federal district
court in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Cap Gemini has several other troubled projects, according to
court records and interviews with executives who have done business
with the company.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company was hired for 400 million francs, or $62
million, to develop research and tracking software for the
Bibliotheque Nationale de France, but the software did not work,
according to reports in Paris newspapers. Both the library
administration and the union representing the library workers told
reporters that the work by Cap Gemini was the main issue in a
strike by library workers. The French government has since removed
Cap Gemini from the project.
</P>
<P>
   Cap Gemini America has numerous contract disputes in the courts,
records show. One client, International Micro Systems of
Carrollton, Texas, hired Cap Gemini to build a custom software
system but sued in February when it abandoned the project. ``They
felt the project was too small to make money, so they just stopped
working on it even though we had a contract,'' said the company's
owner, Sid Saber. The case has been settled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saber said that a steady turnover of Cap Gemini employees
plagued his project. United Way of America and the Chamber of
Commerce reported similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Mrs. Beene confirmed to a reporter that she had
terminated the Cap Gemini project, and hours after Cap Gemini was
asked to comment on the contract termination, a Cap Gemini lawyer
called United Way of America. Mrs. Beene said the Cap Gemini lawyer
complained that the charity should have kept the matter
confidential and threatened litigation, which she said she wanted
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horn, the Cap Gemini spokeswoman, said the company would
have no comment on the lawyer's call. She also declined to comment
on other issues, referring a reporter to a Cap Gemini official in
Paris, who did not respond to two requests left in her voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   No donor money was lost, but the collapse of the United Way of
America project has thrown into disarray plans to make payroll
giving more efficient and attractive to companies with nationwide
operations.
</P>
<P>
   It has also renewed a struggle between United Way of America and
four large regional United Ways _ Boston, Chicago, New York
Tri-State and San Francisco _ which operate pledge processing
centers. The regional centers now want to expand and take over this
business, which would increase their power and generate fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead,'' Virgil Carr, president of the Detroit United Way,
said of the goal of a national center. Ms. Beene said she was not
sure what would happen next.

   (NYT2) ZNAMENSKOYE, Russia -- Dec. 7, 1999 -- CHECHNYA-RUSSIA-2
-- A group of women with goods purchased in a nearby market wait by
the side of a road near a Russian army checkpoint on Tuesday near
Grozny, the Chechen capital. The Russian military dropped thousands
of leaflets over Grozny on Monday, warning residents of the
besieged city to get out by Saturday or risk death. (James Hill/The

LESSONS FROM A WAGNERIAN VEGAS

   LAS VEGAS _ What news on the Rialto?
</P>
<P>
   Since spring, they've finished construction on the bridge and
filled the Grand Canal; a few blocks down, a new Paris has its
Opera, Eiffel Tower and Hotel de Ville; and ``O'' has spoiled me
for ``The Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Greetings from Las Vegas, self-styled Entertainment Capital of
the World, where I have lately landed to contemplate new frontiers
for opera: opera, for the purposes of this discussion, standing for
something greater than itself. Somewhat to the surprise of
commentators unattuned to the cyclical rhythms of cultural history,
an art form that not so long ago was being written off as a
moribund anachronism is experiencing something like a renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Though critics complain of a repertory in stagnation, every
season brings new titles anticipated with genuine excitement, and
archaeological work in areas long abandoned (Handel, the French
Baroque, early Mozart, bel canto) has expanded our sights quite a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the ascendancy of the stage director,
understood as the visionary in charge of the entire look, feel and
meaning of a production, has transformed opera into the paradigm of
theater itself. If opera has proved remarkably hospitable to
dabblers from the worlds of spoken drama, dance and all manner of
visual art, the reason is that everyone wants a piece of the
operatic action. All theater, it now seems, aspires to the
condition of opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prima la musica, poi le parole,'' or vice versa? What comes
first? The words or the music? In the contemporary climate, the
terms of that hoary debate seem oddly off the mark. On the list of
what makes opera the glorious folly it is, spectacle now vies for
supremacy with those two. Words are nothing in Las Vegas shows, and
the music is at best atmosphere. But the point of this pilgrimage
is spectacle, and spectacle is a commodity Las Vegas has always
cultivated in spades.
</P>
<P>
   Learning of my destination, some true believers in opera as our
grandparents knew it were openly contemptuous. ``Better you than
me,'' sniffed one, summing up the general attitude and suppressing
a yawn at the thought of the predictable fare awaiting him on his
usual circuit of lyric temples. Well, he had made his bed. My own
hope was to be jolted awake, my hunch being that opera could do
worse than to steal a page or two from the new Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The new Vegas! In old-time show-biz algebra, of course,
spectacle plus Las Vegas equaled girls, girls, girls: flamingos of
the floor show asparkle in beads and sequins. Then came the boys
from Germany, bearing big white cats and magic tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest extravaganzas are of a different order: pageants so
rich and strange that they refresh our concept of what operatic
stagecraft might be, potentially as influential as the ceremonies
of Robert Wilson once upon a time (but a lot more fun).
</P>
<P>
   The older shows are still eye-catching in their way, and an
opera director might have occasion to lift a page from them now and
then. In the interminable Captain Marvel fantasy that is Siegfried
and Roy's long-running show at the Mirage, a golden army rattles in
lock step, each knight hooked up to four empty suits of armor.
Elsewhere, Siegfried meanders among flower-petal maidens like a
senior Parsifal, encountering his Klingsor in the form of Roy, who
levitates in a ring of fire. The fearless pair also encounters a
dragon, Fafner to a heavy-metal T. The package has made a fortune.
(The figure one hears is half a billion dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   But the mind's eye of an opera fan adrift in Las Vegas can
project opera just about anywhere, free of charge. The exterior of
the new Venetian is ready-made for an alfresco ``Gioconda'' (all we
need is the girl). In the maze of Caesar's Palace, a Peter Sellars
``Clemenza di Tito'' is waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Idomeneo,'' cruise down to Mandalay Bay, with its man-made
seashore and its six-foot breakers. Glazed eyes in stony faces keep
from sight any demons clawing at the heart, yet the card tables at
the casinos evoke ``The Queen of Spades.'' The wheel of fortune
whirls as in ``The Gambler,'' though without the narcotic hum we
hear in Prokofiev.
</P>
<P>
   I came to Las Vegas for the waters. ``O,'' Cirque du Soleil's
site-specific aquatic spectacular, its title punning on the French
for that most seductive element of the four, occupies a
custom-built theater at Bellagio: a theater unsurpassed in boldness
by the Bayreuth Festspielhaus itself.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '90s, a string of touring shows established Cirque
du Soleil as the brand name for a New Age art of the circus. That
its aesthetic might also point new directions for opera might have
seemed far-fetched. Now that a show and its showcase have been
conceived in a single imaginative act, the kinship to the
integrative ideal of opera is plain to see.
</P>
<P>
   Misreading the literature, I understood ``O'' to take place
entirely underwater, behind one wall of a tank specially
microperforated so as not to fog up, with unseen respirators and
frogmen in place to supply the performers with air.
</P>
<P>
   The frogmen and respirators are there, beneath the surface of a
pool 100 feet across. But that surface, rather than the usual stage
floor, is what is seen from the house, and what is perforated is
sectional platforms that rise and drop undetectably under the
water. For dives from the 60-foot tower, the relevant sections sink
to their maximum depth of 25 feet. At other times, the whole
platform rises clear to stage level, and the cast seems to be
skipping on water, until the floor dries and is, temporarily, just
a floor.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the show, 16 pairs of feet sprout straight out
of the pool and start dancing upside down. Later, a kaleidoscopic
bevy of damsels clamber and balance into pyramid formation on a
floating raft, observed by four beach boys who, between plunges,
grace the pool's edge like so many Nijinsky fauns.
</P>
<P>
   Water is the sovereign element here, no question, but the others
count as well. At ground level, earth, an eerie procession files
by, led by the sharp-beaked demon that the Klytemnestra of
``Elektra'' saw in the watches of the night. In the air, gymnastic
phantoms man the ghost of a ship tossing through a tempest fit for
``The Flying Dutchman.'' Most soul-shaking of all are the fires.

 LAS VEGAS: the fires.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture this: Over here, a juggler bounds in, tumbling and
flying around the ball of fire he swings on a chain. Over there, a
hobo settles into his chair, reading his newspaper, unruffled as
flame starts to lick at the toe of his shoe, unruffled as it
spreads, enveloping the chair, his coat, his hat, his paper. At
length he rises, unperturbed, and calmly makes to leave. Ah, but
hasn't he forgotten something? Sure enough: the chair. Slowly he
turns, collects his property and turns again to vanish, slowly,
into the wings. What Tamino has ever done the like?
</P>
<P>
   The curtain is up. In the theater's ample wings, trailing
seaweed hair, masked nymphs limber up, as loose-limbed mermen hose
off and serene riders mount their airborne steeds. Flashlight in
hand, the technical director, Phil Jordan, ex of the Boston Ballet,
is conducting a private backstage tour. From the catwalk, we have
seen the curtain rip like the veil of the temple, then whisk out of
sight. Below stage level, behind plate glass as in an aquarium, we
have watched the clockwork choreography of the frogmen, all in
black, always in the right place at the right time with air.
</P>
<P>
   For the wet and scantily clad, the temperature is comfortable. A
civilian in their midst is finding the air a shade tropical. But
who cares? Before my eyes, in flesh and blood, are the
Rhinemaidens, the Dutchman's phantoms, the Men in Armor for ``The
Magic Flute'' of my dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to juggle on the street,'' explains Ray Wold, the
blazing hobo, his fires now out. ``People walked right by. I said
to myself: `I've got to make them stop. I'll set myself on fire.'''
As modest and affable a fellow as you could hope to meet, Wold
wears flame-resistant Kevlar from the crown of his bowler to the
tips of his shoes, but nothing to shield his face. This act is his
very own ``Nessun dorma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystere,'' Cirque du Soleil's first Las Vegas creation, is
still running strong in a custom-built theater of its own at
Treasure Island. In the fashion of so much contemporary theater, it
is ``nonlinear,'' but a series of images showing the transformation
of grub to butterfly sustains a clear arc of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes obviously, sometimes elliptically, the acts and
imagery develop a pervasive theme of growth and transformation. A
design motif of bulging oval bellies, like pregnancies affecting
the male as well as the female may please viewers with a stronger
taste than mine for the grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   But there are sequences that would shine in any setting: the
crystal-clear, stop-and-go group acrobatics on the ring of
vertical, ``Chinese'' poles, or the thunderous ritual pounding of
the Japanese drum, suspended in midair. Most wondrous of all _ and
in a metaphoric sense, the most musical _ are Marco and Paulo
Lorador, brothers from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Their slow-motion hand-balancing routine (a dream of flight so
intimate that it feels almost too private to watch), unfolds like
the dialogue for violin and cello in the White Swan adagio of
Tchaikovsky's ``Swan Lake,'' which, as it happens, the composer
recycled from the love duet of his abandoned opera ``Undine.''
</P>
<P>
   Of perhaps more concrete interest to the visiting opera
impresario, ``Mystere'' features bungee aerialists, whose volleys
would adorn any number of operas of the exotic and supernatural,
from Monteverdi, Cavalli, Lully, Rameau, Handel, Haydn and Gluck
through Meyerbeer and Verdi to the fables of Rimsky-Korsakov,
Prokofiev's ``Love of Three Oranges'' and Henze's neglected ``Konig
Hirsch.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the latest ``Ring des Nibelungen'' at the Lyric Opera
of Chicago used lip-synching bungee Rhine-maidens, who got their
moves from Debra Brown, Cirque du Soleil's resident choreographer.
(``Die Walkure'' had silent doubles, too: spear-brandishing
Valkyries who bounded and somersaulted through the air from hidden
trampolines.) Ms. Brown has also worked on the premiere productions
of operas at the Metropolitan (``The Ghosts of Versailles'') and
the Canadian Opera Company (``The Golden Ass''), experiences she
treasures. Still, she wonders how far the unfamiliar medium will
allow her to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself in opera because of work I've done in circus,''
she says. ``But coming from circus, where there's no fourth wall,
I'd like to bring the action closer to the public, and I'm not sure
that's appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera is the most prestigious of the arts. Circus is born on
the streets. That affects how they're delivered, the relationships
inside the creation. There's a whole different rhythm at the heart
of it all. Circus has no unions. People work for hours on end.
Their skills are honed on the street. They develop an exceptional
sense of timing. If they didn't grab your attention, they would
die. Their art is what puts food on their table.''
</P>
<P>
   But the differences may not be so profound after all. Opera,
however lofty it grows, has roots in popular entertainment, too,
and a singer has to grab your attention no less than a juggler.
Cirque du Soleil, as it has evolved, is no closer to the street
(and no farther) than La Scala. The question is, can the Cirque
aesthetic, fusing material of humble origin into a process akin to
opera at its most lavish, ever contribute more to opera than
fetching accents?
</P>
<P>
   A simplistic answer is no. Cirque du Soleil's shows develop as
self-standing artistic creations, generated through the synergy of
its director, Franco Dragone, and his production team, on one hand,
and the specific talents of the available performers, on the other.
The usual business of an opera house, in contrast, is to stage the
sort of pre-existing work we like these days to call a ``text.''
</P>
<P>
   Now factor in the economics. The theater at Bellagio was built _
with a proscenium stage and theater-style seating in place of the
cramped cocktail tables and banquettes of Vegas tradition _ at a
cost of $70 million; producing ``O'' came to another $22 million:
figures to strike terror in any impresario's heart. And running
costs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Still to be determined,'' answers Pavel Brun, an alumnus of
the Russian Theater Academy with credentials in pantomime,
choreography, Soviet jazz-rock and the aerial high bar, and the
artistic director of Cirque du Soleil's two Vegas shows.

 LAS VEGAS: Vegas shows.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's no prior experience in theater history for a
long-running aquatic show,'' Brun explains. ``We can get comparison
figures from related areas like bridge construction, cruise ships,
military operations.'' He warns against focusing on the green
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a black-and-white show with sawdust, and it might
impress you just as much as this one,'' he declares. ``I'm very far
from believing that a humongous budget can surmount artistic
problems. Our touring show `Quidam' cost only $2 million Canadian,
which would be about $1.5 million American. That's nothing,
moneywise, but it had so many things to say.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, in any case, the bottom line for ``O'' remains
elusive. Fortunately, Steve Wynn, the chairman of Mirage Resorts,
has deep pockets. His was the entrepreneurial panache that
initiated the Cirque du Soleil shows as exclusive and, he hopes,
permanent Vegas fixtures. As for the income stream, tickets to
``Mystere,'' in a 1,500-seat theater, go for $70 a pop; for ``O,''
with 1,800 seats, the prices are $90 and $100.
</P>
<P>
   Each show does 476 performances a year, and most sell out. Thus,
box-office receipts from ``O'' must total some $80 million a year,
and Wynn's license to print money should be coming through any day
now.
</P>
<P>
   Again I ask, would a production anything like ``O'' be possible
in an opera house? Maybe the answer will be less simplistic this
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask if it would be possible to apply Cirque's style,
techniques and technology in the opera house,'' Brun shoots back.
``Definitely. I can't wait to see it happen. Are there plans? I
wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Brun reminds me that Cirque du Soleil is, after all, still in
the business of putting on a circus. The elements it integrates are
the ones that have been filling tents big and small for centuries.
What is different is the framework _ and the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern opera and the modern circus have the same problem,'' he
says. ``Ballet, too. Technique becomes the star of the show, the
target of performance. That's wrong. Technique should be a
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see wonderful singers, but their technique is overwhelming.
We don't see a character, because the whole concentration is on the
voice. It's the same with a trick at the circus. The ringmaster
comes in and announces, `Now we'll show you the quadruple
somersault.' So what? For that I can go to the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the most valuable lesson Cirque du Soleil might teach
the opera crowd? ``That production means much more than nice
costumes, a nice set, a nice budget,'' Brun answers. ``The job of
the director is to develop a vocabulary that goes for everybody,
from the diva down to the last chorus girl. It can't be done
quickly. The job is to create superior individuals. If the 15th
girl on the right is picking her nose, she's the one you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Could the Cirque team make this happen in an opera house? Could
an opera house do the job on its own?
</P>
<P>
   ``Without me, they can do nothing,'' Brun says, like other
ex-Soviets keeping a straight face when striking the peremptory
note.
</P>
<P>
   But he exaggerates. Over the centuries, excellence in operatic
production has broken forth from time to time. Even today, it is
not unknown. Living witnesses can testify to the power _ total, on
the right occasions _ of Wieland Wagner, Giorgio Strehler,
Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, John Dexter (especially in collaboration with
David Hockney), Gotz Friedrich, Harry Kupfer, Peter Sellars,
Herbert Wernicke, Liliana Cavani, Luc Bondy, Nicholas Hytner,
Dieter Dorn, Graham Vick.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lord Elgin in Athens or Napoleon in Egypt, an opera
producer on the loose in Nevada may catch the itch to plunder. Take
all you can afford that will serve your purposes, say I. But most
of all, look past the surface. Take fire, not window dressing. Let
vision guide you. Shun hollow effect. Return to first principles.
The gauntlet is down. Las Vegas has raised the bar.

TEACHERS RECALL HOW SCHOOL SCORES WERE RAISED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-TEACHERS-CHEATING) 
(bl) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year after he arrived at Community Elementary
School 90, mathematics teacher Jon Nichols was approached by
principal Richard Wallin with what seemed at first an unusual pep
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken into the office at the beginning of the school
year and told that the students were expected to do well _ no
matter what it takes,'' Nichols recalled Tuesday at the school in
the Concourse section of the Bronx. ``At the time, I didn't know
what that meant exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned soon enough. It meant cheating, and Nichols and other
teachers were provided with detailed instruction, down to
palm-sized crib notes to check against students' answer sheets as
they took city and state examinations, according to accounts from
Nichols, other teachers and Edward Stancik, the special
investigator for New York City schools. Stancik released a report
Tuesday asserting widespread cheating on city and state exams over
the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   The report identified 32 schools, but cited Community Elementary
Schools 88 and 90 in District 9 in the Bronx and Public School 234
in District 12 in the Bronx as particularly egregious cases. The
investigation began with Community School 90 after a teacher,
Stacey Moskowitz, contacted Stancik's office and a television news
reporter about the practices. Nichols and others then came forward.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, 33, who investigators confirmed had participated in the
case, described how an administrator approached him before city
reading and math exams in April 1994. ``Keep this handy, he said,
and he gave me a piece of paper,'' Nichols recalled. ``It was a
2-by-3 sheet with a list of numbers and letters on it. It was the
answers to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the numbers had asterisks next to them,'' Nichols
continued. ``These were the hard questions, and I was told not to
help with those. The kids were expected to get them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid test scorers' scrutiny, he and other teachers had
students write their answers on a blank loose-leaf paper and then,
with the guidance of teachers, fill in the circles on the
``bubble'' answer sheet corresponding to the correct answers.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, who began teaching at the school in 1993, and Mrs.
Moskowitz, who started in 1990, said they went along with such
practices because, as young teachers eager to establish themselves,
they felt pressure from Wallin.
</P>
<P>
   Wallin was transferred from the school in February 1998 to the
Community School District 9 offices because of an unrelated,
unspecified disciplinary matter, according to the report. He could
not be reached there for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The third-grade reading scores on the state exam at the school
dropped to 39.9 percent reading at minimum state level in 1998,
after Wallin had left, from 66.7 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do the right thing, fit in,'' Mrs. Moskowitz said
in a telephone interview, adding that she had not observed cheating
since the new principal, Beverly Ellis, came after Wallin and other
administrators left. ``You want your principal to like you. They
wield a lot of power over you professionally. It is a lot easier
for them to say things about you than you about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moskowitz, a third-grade reading teacher, said her
conscience got to her as she looked at her own children, now 5 and
6, and realized that a teacher doing the same thing to them could
jeopardize their education by allowing them to move on without
mastering the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I look at my own children?'' Mrs. Moskowitz said she
remembered feeling shortly before she contacted the Board of
Education's internal investigation office in November 1997.
Frustrated with a lack of response, she took her concerns to a
WCBS-TV reporter, Marcia Kramer, in June of the next year and
contacted Stancik's office.

 Richard B. Woodward is editor-at-large for ``DoubleTake,'' a
literary and photographic magazine.  
 By RICHARD B. WOODWARD 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daido Moriyama, 61, was everywhere in New York this
fall. The subject of exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
Japan Society and the Laurence Miller Gallery; of a handsome
catalog on his life and work (from the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art), and of essays in prominent art magazines, he has
enjoyed a scholarly star treatment unprecedented for a Japanese
photographer in this country. The reviews were mainly raves.
</P>
<P>
   Given Moriyama's acknowledged debts to American artists,
especially to William Klein's confrontational camera and Andy
Warhol's acrid, Pop sensibility, this belated recognition is as
instructive as it is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Against the background of photography seen in New York galleries
and museums these days, his work can look simultaneously at home
and estranged. His indifference to certain technical niceties
places him squarely in the sector of the art world that has always
distrusted perfect prints. His are often over- or underexposed,
blurred or scratched, as if stored in piles under a bed.
</P>
<P>
   His means of making pictures, however, as well as his prowling,
scavenger eye put him at odds with the controlled, intimate mood
that has dominated photographic practice for the last decade. He
shoots black and white, mainly with a hand-held camera, and until
recently made small-scale prints.
</P>
<P>
   An impersonal artist who finds his gritty matter in the world at
large, he has stalked the Japanese for more than three decades and
photographed this most homogeneous of nations as if it were
populated entirely by outcasts and freaks. He is at heart a street
photographer, and as an active proponent of this once-vital style _
one that is now all but invisible in New York galleries _ he can
appear to be an alien twice over.
</P>
<P>
   Popping up now from the other side of the globe, he looks like
something of a relic, and his career is cause to reflect on the
strange fate of the street-documentary style over the last 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, when Moriyama was first featured in New York, in a
group show on ``New Japanese Photography'' at the Museum of Modern
Art, he did not seem so out of place. His links to older Japanese
figures like Shomei Tomatsu, and his breaks from them, were made
clear, and his jaundiced vision of the city as a 24-hour comic
nightmare, akin to Weegee's and Klein's, locked him into the
American zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   These were the years when Garry Winogrand, Lee Friedlander and
their allies were remaking the photographic image into a more
fractured and tenuous but still coherent thing. Robert Frank's
``The Americans'' was the Bible _ proof, said Winogrand, ``you
could photograph anywhere.'' There was a hunger to devour the world
and a faith that this could best be done with a hand-held Leica and
a wide-angle lens.
</P>
<P>
   The anarchic joy that pulsed from Winogrand's raucous images of
New York in the '60s and '70s persuaded a generation to stand at
Fifty-Seventh Street and Fifth Avenue, where it seemed everything
worth photographing was passing by or soon would be.
</P>
<P>
   Today it's not only faith in this quixotic illusion that now
seems dead. New York's street life ceased to hold the attention of
young photographers well over 10 years ago; indeed, the appetite to
hunt for pictures on the streets anywhere _ or in the wider world
beyond the studio or the home _ has sharply declined.
</P>
<P>
   The inward-looking tendency of art photography in the late '80s,
summed up well by the Museum of Modern Art's 1991 group exhibition
``The Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort,'' is even more
pronounced today. Artists have portrayed their friends, families
and themselves with abandon throughout the '90s. Just as the memoir
has challenged the novel as the narrative of choice for young
writers, so have the hermetic documentary and self-dramatics
supplanted more expansive forms of address in photography.
</P>
<P>
   The latest photography that emerges from art schools and that
finds a place in galleries and museums is predominantly
studio-based, theatrical in orientation and shot in color with
large-format cameras. If Frank, Winogrand and Friedlander were
guiding lights for their peers a quarter-century ago, their
counterparts today would be Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin and Sally
Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street is almost totally absent in the new work that comes
in here and that I see in galleries,'' said Jeff Rosenheim,
assistant curator in the department of photographs at the
Metropolitan Museum. ``The studio is all-powerful. It's all about
the self.''
</P>
<P>
   The many reasons for this change of voice, from public to
private, range from the ubiquity of television, which has assumed
the former role of photography as eyewitness, to the economic
imperative of making big prints for cavernous gallery rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People bring me documentary street work all the time,'' said
the Los Angeles photography dealer Paul Kopeikin. ``I don't think
it has completely died out. But no one is buying it, so I can't
really show it.''
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of postmodern ideology, which undercuts the neutral
ground of the observer, is also responsible. ``Political
correctness has killed off documentary in general,'' said Sandra
Phillips, senior curator at San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art.
``There's an inhibition now about photographing strangers
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Passersby are also far less willing than they once were to be
passive vehicles for a someone else's vision of them: photographers
who work in the street face suspicion or hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Many artists, including Tina Barney, Jeff Wall and Philip-Lorca
diCorcia, have fuzzed the line between a documentary photograph and
a tableau as one way to drive a stake through the heart of idealist
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Documentary itself is an empty notion for a lot of artists,''
said Anne Tucker, curator of photography at Houston's Museum of
Fine Arts. ``Photographing a guy being mugged, or photographing a
guy being mugged on television or staging a guy being mugged are
now the same. Distinctions between what is reality and what is
media have become so blurred they're meaningless for the purposes
of many photographers. Everything is open to question, including
what's `out there.'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The in-your-face style practiced by Moriyama and his American
and European counterparts during the '60s and '70s also tended to
exclude women.
</P>
<P>
   Lisette Model and Diane Arbus worked for long periods as
flaneurs, but Helen Levitt is perhaps the only American woman to
have spent a lifetime photographing in the streets. ``It's an
aggressive act pointing a camera in someone's face,'' said Ms.
Phillips, who noted that Winogrand and his crew of male friends
called themselves ``the pack''
</P>
<P>
   The one arena where the macho street aesthetic seems to have
survived, and perhaps thrived, is in war photography. ``Gilles
Peress is a prime example of someone who has taken the techniques
of street photography and applied them to world events,'' says
Colin Westerbeck, co-author of ``Bystander: A History of Street
Photography'' and associate curator of photography at the Art
Institute of Chicago. ``War and everyday life have merged in
countries like Iran, Nicaragua, Bosnia and Kosovo.'' Everywhere he
looks Peress seems to come upon the kind of sad, loony, surreal
juxtapositions that Cartier-Bresson found in Mexico and Winogrand
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are other defenders of the faith as well. Friedlander, Tod
Papageorge and Leo Rubenfien are still clicking away on city
streets around the globe. Thomas Roma and Sylvia Plachy still
patrol Brooklyn and Manhattan. Mitch Epstein's show of huge color
prints this fall at Brent Sikkema in Chelsea even featured one of a
woman lighting a cigarette for a stranger along Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my way of making a Winogrand picture,'' says Epstein.
But the death early this year of the Indian photographer Ragubhir
Singh further diminished the ranks of first-rate artists who find
material simply by walking or driving around.
</P>
<P>
   The large-format camera, the tool of choice for many young,
ambitious photographers, thwarts spontaneity and offhand
observations. The German artist Thomas Struth, who often blurs the
action in his pictures, is nonetheless in the business of producing
monumental prints with the richness of old-master paintings. The
streets in his book called ``Streets'' were eerily empty. The
excitement of discovering things on the fly is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Even diCorcia's celebrated photographs of people on sidewalks
are composed with stage-set lighting. The pictures seem to
illustrate the point that Tokyo and New York and Berlin are now one
place; they're less about detecting some hidden vitality that would
be unknown without his photographs. It's as if he knew what he
wanted to say before he made the picture.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade of globalization and cyberspace, when people
interact more with their computer screens than with each other on
street corners, it makes sense that photographers find private
musings and fantasies more relevant than a crowd of shoppers at
Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   As the photographer Joel Sternfeld complains, ``It's also much
harder to make interesting pictures in a mall culture, in a
McDonald's or a Starbuck's.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of street life, along with the more widespread
dismissal of documentary practice from art school curriculums,
however, feels like an impoverishment of our visual history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students don't realize that in 5 to 10 years the world is
going to change again,'' Sternfeld said. ``What is omnipresent now
may be rare in the future, and a clear, sharp picture of the
present is going to be intrinsically interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple and, in some ways, unglamorous act of photographing
people and events, unarmed by art theory, has lost its value in the
art market and in schools. The photographer Justin Kimball, who has
taught at the Rhode Island School of Design, said: ``It's hard to
convince students to go out into the world anymore. They all want
to just stay in their rooms and photograph their stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Moriyama's pictures, however occult or halting in articulation,
point outward at the world, as if he were groping to explain his
native country to himself after postwar assaults by the West. In a
shrewd essay on Moriyama in the October issue of Art in America,
Rubenfien observed: ``His Japan has fully absorbed the American
virus into its own chemistry, and while a Japanese might hate this
condition, there is no possibility of reversing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling doomed, even disgusted, by what he sees happening around
him _ in stores and backyards, on highways and in karaoke bars _ he
has tried not to withdraw and to remain engaged with his culture,
fashioning his own code of distress signals about his permanent
alienation.
</P>
<P>
   His career and life demonstrate a rare kind of bravery. One
might say that Moriyama is a documentary photographer in spite of
himself.

THESE LITTLE GUYS ARE BIG HEROES IN DEMANDING SPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My ultimate sports heroes are the jock kingdom's bravest, yet
they wear colorful silk shirts to work, don't outweigh a fashion
model, and stand about as tall as a bar stool.
</P>
<P>
   In the pursuit of their craft, they might have more
second-guessers within 90 seconds than Troy Aikman does in an
entire football season.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association lists their profession as this
country's most dangerous. There are more deaths and serious
injuries in this line of work than coal mining, hanging steel on
skyscrapers or coaching the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Guaranteed contracts are nonexistent. You win or you don't eat,
but even when you do eat, it amounts to birdseed. At a mere 125
pounds, you'd be considered fat, lazy, out of shape and definitely
out of work.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, pound-for-pound you must be physically
stronger than any football player, hockey player or weight lifter.
Powerful hands, arms and legs are an absolute necessity. This must
be achieved on a constant diet of lettuce and cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   It is a business where you can become famous and, in limited
cases, almost a household name in sports. But the overall respect
factor when compared to other jock stars is not even remotely
close.
</P>
<P>
   This is an injustice, but so it goes in the world of
thoroughbred race riding.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys are my ultimate heroes, even when I cuss 'em like crazy
over some $20 win ticket that went uncashed because a preferred
steed didn't hit the wire first. No matter the athletic skill,
instinct, muscle and bravery, the jockey is always at the mercy of
a 1,200-pound animal who is running 35 mph with a mind of his own.
Over a measly $20, I sometimes forget that part about the horse.
</P>
<P>
   But on other days, there's also the perfect ride, when the
jockey got more out of his animal than you thought the horse had.
Particularly if you own part of that horse with a group of buddies,
and the date was Jan. 16, 1997, and the place was famous Santa
Anita Park in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Zika was our horse, and he would never amount to much, but late
that afternoon nearly three years ago, we were prouder of the Z-man
than the owners of Secretariat. In a maiden claiming race for
$40,000, he won like a champion, but what really mattered was he
was ridden by a champion.
</P>
<P>
   The win picture on the wall at home is autographed by Laffit
Pincay Jr.
</P>
<P>
   If the racing gods are with him, and there are no crippling
crashes, this week Pincay will become the all-time leading rider of
thoroughbreds. Entering Wednesday's racing card at Hollywood Park,
Laffit needs three wins to break Bill Shoemaker's record of 8,833.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no sports world countdown for the soon-to-be
53-year-old Pincay _ horse racing doesn't get that kind of media
play. But in reality, this record is more impressive than Aaron,
than Gretzky, than Rose. Just the injury factor and the strict
weight restrictions alone say it's impossible to have stayed at the
top of your game for Pincay's 36 years of climbing aboard winning
horses.
</P>
<P>
   And for ol' Zika to have been one of his 8,834, it just proves
Pincay is part miracle worker.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to define an entire career with one ride, that
also has a local angle. It was last June at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie (Texas) in the National Jockey Championship.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of Lone Star's most popular events with the fans,
who see the nation's leading riders converge on Grand Prairie. But
they are here for charity to benefit injured riders, and the big
names lose money by leaving mounts at such tracks as Hollywood,
Churchill and Belmont to ride at Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, some riders treat it as an exhibition. Others,
however, don't. For instance, Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   On a claiming race on the grass, Alex Solis, a Southern
California-based rider, had his horse veer sharply out of the gate,
hitting another horse, and then Solis tumbled to the ground,
thankfully uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   But that left a loose horse on the track, which is dangerous to
the other riders. One famous West Coast jockey immediately took his
mount to the outside and jogged him for the rest of the race,
staying well clear of the riderless horse.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, however, was atop Gold Nugget, owned by two of the
nicest people in Texas racing, Sue and Leland Cook of Corsicana.
</P>
<P>
   On the turn for home, Gold Nugget was full of run. But as he
charged down the stretch, the loose horse was between Pincay and
the rail. There was only a small opening and no one knew what the
riderless horse would do. One wrong move and Pincay's next ride
could have been in an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   But Laffit never hesitated. He took the rail route, a totally
fearless decision that told you everything you ever needed to know
about the guts of Laffit Pincay, native son of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Nugget won the race. Pincay won even more admiration as a
true champion. And this week, the numbers will make it official. nn

 Yahoo Stock Up 24%, Joins S&AMP;P Today  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A lot of people own Yahoo shares. A lot of people made a lot of
money yesterday.
<P>
   Yahoo's stock soared $67.19, or 24 percent, to close at a record
$348 prior to its debut today in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   It is up no less than 52 percent since its inclusion on the S&AMP;P
was announced a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   While much of yesterday's surge is attributable to index fund
managers doing some last-minute shopping _ when an index changes,
corresponding mutual funds have to buy or sell stocks to match the
index _ analysts say Yahoo's hefty gain indicates another force at
work: day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's an artificial demand for a stock, you get
wild swings above and beyond the intended selling because people
are piling on,'' said Scott Reamer, an analyst with SG Cowen
Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By his thinking, once the institutional big boys took an
interest in Yahoo, the day traders saw the stock pick up momentum
and jumped aboard for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   They jumped off after the market's close. In after-hours
trading, Yahoo gave back $11.75, to $336.25.
</P>
<P>
   Geri Hom, senior portfolio manager at San Francisco's Charles
Schwab, said a stock will typically rise between 5 percent and 15
percent after its inclusion in the S&AMP;P 500 is announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The S&AMP;P effect gives it some oomph,'' she observed. ``But it's
a volatile stock that moves a lot already. It's the nature of
Internet stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's Yahoo certainly has covered some ground this year.
In fact, the company's share price has more than doubled since
January, giving the portal a market capitalization of $91.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, real-world media giant Time Warner has a market
value of $82 billion, and Disney weighs in at just $56.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly a happy stock,'' said Jeff Goverman, research
director at Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore. ``No one's
lost any money on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is only the second Internet company to be added to the S&AMP;P
500. The other is America Online, which also has more than doubled
in value this year. Both are among the most widely held Internet
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   They're both also the most widely recognized Internet brands on
the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In Yahoo's case, the portal ranks as the single-most-popular
U.S. Web site, according to Media Metrix. It also holds the top
spot in Britain and Japan, and is the second-most-popular site in
France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that Yahoo is just at the beginning of
building a global media brand,'' said Carolyn Luther Trabuco, an
analyst at First Union Securities in New York. ``Yahoo has
demonstrated an ability to manage its growth.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Yahoo is no longer a darling of just the day traders
and retail investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutional investors are waking up to the fact that they
have to join the party,'' Trabuco said. ``Yahoo is demonstrating
itself as being a premier media name.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, she also believes the stock still has plenty of
upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth quarter is looking like a record for media
companies, and for Internet companies in particular,'' Trabuco
said. ``I like Yahoo because it's the dominant Internet company.''

 Schwab Changes Strategy, Will Charge for Advice  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
With competition among online brokers reaching unprecedented
heights, Charles Schwab Corp. plans to increase the custom-tailored
advice it offers retail investors, taking it further than ever from
its discount broker roots.
<P>
   And, in a radical departure for the San Francisco firm, it will
start charging a fee for some forms of investment advice, marking
the first time in its nearly three-decade history that Schwab has
asked customers to pay to speak with its representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab will roll out two fee-based advice programs. The first is
described as a portfolio checkup, in which a representative will
evaluate whether a customer's assets, including those held at other
firms, are in appropriate investments for their age group, economic
circumstances and financial goals.
</P>
<P>
   The second program will be preparation of a financial plan using
a prepackaged product provided by a third-party vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has been selectively testing the services for several
months and will begin offering them in all its 320 branches
nationwide sometime next year. It says it is still deciding how
much to charge and stresses that its representatives will continue
to offer less-detailed investment help for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at how to provide personalized service and
advice without grossly inflating our expense structure,'' said
Susanne Lyons, Schwab's chief of retail client services. ``We think
personalized advice is worth paying for.``
</P>
<P>
   The moves comes as traditional brokers, most notably Wall Street
behemoth Merrill Lynch, invade the low-priced Internet investing
space that Schwab dominates. Merrill this year has unveiled two
online brokerage options, including a $29.95-per-trade Internet
account targeted directly at Schwab's slice of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional firms specialize in offering clients specific
investment recommendations, including suggestions on which mutual
funds, stocks and bonds to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Schwab has stepped up the degree of customer
hand-holding it offers. Company representatives now will suggest
what kinds of assets clients should put their money into and refer
them to investment-selection tools, but stop short of specific
stock recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Given the new competition from traditional brokers, not to
mention the ever-broadening array of services offered by online
rivals such as E-Trade Group, analysts say Schwab has to give
investors more investment ideas to keep their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But, analysts say, customers might resist paying for something
they think they should get for free. Schwab must make it clear that
it is charging for new advice programs, not simply slapping fees on
services it used to do for free, analysts note.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can add value and service, customers may accept it,''
said Amar Mehta, an analyst with the brokerage CIBC World Markets.
``And, if you look at what Merrill charges for advice, it's still
likely to be higher that what Schwab charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's services aren't strictly comparable, but its basic
account offering investment advice charges an annual fee of 1
percent of assets with no commissions on stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab could also face objections from some of the 5,600
independent investment advisers it works with, who manage about 30
percent of the firm's customer assets.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has built relationships with outside advisers advisors &LR; 
 &LR; to manage the accounts of customers who aren't comfortable
handling their own investments. Some of those advisers may view
Schwab's new programs as substitutes for their own services. Schwab
says its programs are aimed at a different group of customers than
those who go to independent advisers.

 Venture Fund Aimed at Small Investors  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Draper Fisher Jurvetson, one of the Bay Area's well-known venture
capital firms, said yesterday that it is helping create a new &LR; 
 &LR; $500 million venture fund for the masses.
<P>
   ``Venture capital has historically only been available to
millionaires and large institutional investors,'' said founder Tim
Draper. ``We want to allow the small investor a chance to
participate in this important driver of the U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Draper Fisher Jurvetson of Redwood City has about $1 billion
invested in six funds and recently has been generating better than
100 percent annual returns for its institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The venture capital firm firm's  &LR; plans to invest $500 million
from its proposed fund in Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, though, has turned over to Internet startup firm
meVC.com the job of raising the money and other ``front end'' tasks
such as setting up the first national venture capital investment
management firm and winning approval from the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund is breaking new ground in the U.S. venture capital
industry, a $40 billion business that is usually reserved for a
select few. ``Typically, only institutions and high net worth
individuals with at least $200,000 in annual income or $1 million
net worth can invest,'' said meVC.com chief executive Any Singer.
</P>
<P>
   MeVC.com hopes to lower the financial bar. The minimum
investment in the new fund will be $5,000, and investors must have
either a net worth of at least $150,000 or $50,000 net worth plus
gross income of at least $50,000 a year. Investors also will be
restricted from investing more than 10 percent of their net worth.
</P>
<P>
   But don't send in your investment checks yet. Although meVC.com
has filed a registration statement with the SEC for its first
venture capital mutual fund, the review and approval process could
take several months.
</P>
<P>
   Like other venture capital funds, the fees will be substantial _
2.5 percent of capital contributions and 20 percent of any profits.
</P>
<P>
   Singer, a former investment banker with Robertson Stephens, set
up meVC.com six months ago. The first $800,000 investments in the
company came from individuals, including former BankAmerica Chief
Executive Officer Richard Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Draper Fisher Jurvetson also has invested $4.5 million in
meVC.com, which has hired financial industry experts from such
companies as GT Global, Montgomery Securities and Charles Schwab.

 Macromedia Signs Up `South Park' Duo  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The raucous duo behind the ``South Park'' cartoon and movie will
bring their unique and sometimes controversial humor to an original
animated series for Macromedia's entertainment Web site.
<P>
   The San Francisco software company will announce today that Trey
Parker and Matt Stone have signed a multiyear deal to create 39,
two- to five-minute episodes of an as-yet unnamed series for
Shockwave.com. The online cartoon will debut early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but
representatives of Parker and Stone said they have received
``significant'' equity in Shockwave.com and will maintain creative
control of the animations.
</P>
<P>
   The series will feature original characters, not Web versions of
Cartman, Chef or the other crude, sometimes foul-mouthed stars of
the Comedy Central show and ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut''
movie that have made the two Generation Xers famous.
</P>
<P>
   Other details, such as the animation style or the type of
characters, weren't available.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia chief executive Robert Burgess said the series will
bridge the gap between the Internet's burgeoning entertainment
industry and the 18-to-34-year-old Web surfers hungry for such
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, virtually everything on the Web has been created
for some other purpose. ... TV, video games, and then people used
the Web as another way to market it,'' he said. ``This is the other
way around. (These are) the first big stars that are creating
original properties for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Best known for its graphics development software and Shockwave
plug-in, which lets Internet users play clips of video, games,
music and other forms of media, Macromedia spun off Shockwave.com
this summer to separate the entertainment-oriented site from its
traditional business.
</P>
<P>
   Shockwave.com offers visitors access to games, music, cartoons
and searches, as well as links to sites like Comedy Central
(comedycentral.com).
</P>
<P>
   In the months since its debut, the company has focused on
landing deals with high-profile content creators for the site. Last
month Shockwave.com signed an agreement with Spiderman creator Stan
Lee to develop a comic, or Webisode, for the site.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, Macromedia will announce a deal with San
Francisco's animation firm Mondo Media.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts appear to have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   According to Media Metrix, a New York firm that tracks Web
traffic, Shockwave.com received 2.35 million unique visitors in
October, up from 1.75 million in September.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the success of the shorts, the new Parker-Stone
creation may jump to television or film, Burgess said. Under the
deal, Parker and Stone will have lead distribution rights for any
non-Internet media.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that perk, Parker and Stone were attracted to
Shockwave.com's considerable backing, said Kevin Morris, a Los
Angeles attorney for the pair. Last year, Macromedia had $150
million in revenues. Last week, venture capital fund Sequoia
Capital and Internet entrepreneur Jim Clark invested $44 million
investment in the Shockwave.com unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size and weight of Macromedia and the strength of their
business plan was very appealing to Matt and Trey,'' Morris said.
``(Shockwave.com) wasn't just a startup site looking for sticky
content.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, ranked No. 32 in Media Metrix's
news/information/entertainment category, relies mainly on
advertising _ about $3 million a quarter, according to Burgess. But
it will expand its revenue streams to include subscriptions and
pay-per-view as it ramps up more entertainment features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the site now to the next generation,'' Burgess
said. ``We're moving very rapidly into original content that's
designed for the Web and with Web sensibilities in mind.''

 Bluetooth Trial Shows Power To Link Items  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bluetooth, a short-range radio technology designed to link cell
phone, notebook computers and other mobile devices without wires,
moved a step closer to reality yesterday when Intel demonstrated it
running in a pair of portable PCs.
<P>
   Intel said it will begin marketing its Bluetooth hardware and
software to notebook manufacturers next year, in time for products
to ship around the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
   By then, some mobile phones are also expected to be
Bluetooth-capable, and one of the first applications of the
technology will likely be to create a link between such notebooks
and phones, enabling users to send e-mail and even surf the Web
without cables or wires.
</P>
<P>
   Another early use for the technology, which phonemaker Ericsson
demonstrated at last month's Comdex computer trade show, will be in
wireless headsets. Eventually it's expected to be used for data
exchange among a wide variety of mobile devices, including digital
cameras and personal organizers, as well as stationary PCs and
printers and even cars.
</P>
<P>
   Cahners In-Stat, a market research group, predicts that by 2005,
there will be more than 670 million Bluetooth-enabled devices
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was announced in May 1998, Bluetooth has garnered broad
support in the computer and communications industries. More than
1,300 companies have joined the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, a
trade organization of companies planning products based on the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Microsoft, 3Com, Lucent and Motorola joined the
group's leadership committee, alongside its five founding
companies, Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba. Microsoft had
previously been cool to the technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel demonstration, before a conference of Bluetooth
developers in Los Angeles, showed two prototype notebooks
synchronizing data wirelessly. The company's mobile products group
developed the radio module, which is mounted on a circuit board
measuring only about 1.25 by .75 inches, and software to use it
with Windows 98 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it has no plans to develop Bluetooth for
Windows CE, Microsoft's stripped-down operating system for
handhelds, which is usually run on non-Intel processors. Other
companies, however, are expected to deliver Bluetooth for a variety
of other operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Bluetooth will initially cost notebook manufacturers
about $30, including hardware, software and support, an Intel
spokeswoman estimated. Over the next couple of years, that figure
should decline to around $10.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth uses unlicensed radio frequencies in the 2.4-gigahertz
band. It's designed to carry 1 megabit of data per second, making
it almost 20 times faster than a 56K modem, but its range is
limited to 10 meters.

GROW A BUSINESS/PETER SINTON 
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   How to Reinvigorate a Stagnant Business 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Q: I've successfully started my own business and have run it
profitably now for nearly two years. Although I'm working really
hard, growth seems to have stalled. How do I get my business
growing again?
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: If money is no object, which is a long shot, buy up your
competitors and throw money into marketing. More likely, capital is
scarce and you will have to be creative.
</P>
<P>
   There are no magic formulas, according to business consultant
and certified public accountant Howard Thomas of the Thomas
Consulting Group in Los Gatos. But he offers five tips to
entrepreneurs who hit the wall:
</P>
<P>
   _Start by looking inward to rekindle the characteristics that
got you this far. Find a way to renew your passion for the
business.
</P>
<P>
   _Do some strategic soul-searching to find ways to get the
business back on a growth path. Start by putting yourself in the
place of the customer. Review each place a customer comes in
contact with your business and objectively evaluate the customer's
experience. Be brutally honest in assessing how relevant your
products or services are. You might want to hire someone to conduct
focus groups or a customer survey to get both quantitative and
qualitative feedback.
</P>
<P>
   _Take a look at your business model to see if it is still
relevant. How do you make money now? Can you generate revenue some
other way in the future? Can you create new revenue streams? Are
there hidden businesses in your business? Be creative.
</P>
<P>
   _Read magazines about your business, go to trade shows, visit
your competitor's locations and see what's going on. Buy some
market research. Talk with your friends, colleagues, financial
partners and, above all, current and former customers, to find out
if your products or services are still tops.
</P>
<P>
   _Finally, take action. Create a next-phase plan with specific
goals for growth and sell it to those who are interested in your
business _ your customers, employees, partners and suppliers. Have
a time line and make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Thomas suggests hiring a consultant. But then,
that's how he makes his business grow.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
New SBA Resources
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's main Web site for business information
has been substantially rearranged and upgraded to provide more
electronic services at higher speed. If you haven't checked it out
already, you might want to click on the U.S. Small Business
Administration's U.S. Business Advisor site (www.business.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1953, the SBA provides financial, technical and
management assistance to help Americans start, run and grow their
businesses. The revamped Web site offers connections to most every
government agency, from the Administration on Aging to the White
House, plus links to subjects such as taxes, laws and regulations,
international trade, workplace issues and Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Among other services, the new Web site can be used to:
</P>
<P>
   _Access electronic commerce services, from loan information to
trademark registration, export licenses, payroll benefits and tax
filing.
</P>
<P>
   _Find equity capital, contracting opportunities, trade leads and
research grants.
</P>
<P>
   _Create a tailored Web page to support international trade
activities.
</P>
<P>
   _Seek and receive e-mail advice and counseling.
</P>
<P>

 _ SF CHRON  
 Incubators Provide Day Care for Net Startups  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Venture Frogs is not your typical venture or angel capital firm.
<P>
   To stay close to their tadpole clients, co-founders Tony Hsieh,
25, and Alfred Lin, 26, located their business incubator in the
same building where they live. They are even putting in a
restaurant so their adopted offspring can concentrate on building
their products and market share rather than foraging for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is to get everyone to work all the time and never
leave the building,'' said Hsieh, only half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Frogs is renovating 10,000 square feet of space in the
Marquee Historical Building at 1000 Van Ness Ave. in San Francisco
to create a nursery for up to 15 Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, soon after Hsieh and Lin sold LinkExchange, their
previous company, to Microsoft, they bought lofts in the building,
which is also home to an AMC Theater complex. The two, who are
investing $27 million of their own and other investors' money in
more dot-com companies, now live upstairs from their offices beside
the old Cadillac showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Frogs is not alone in jumping into the startup breeding
business.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Business Incubation Association in
Athens, Ohio, identified nearly 600 incubators in North America
that created about 19,000 companies and 245,000 jobs. More than
half were nonprofit organizations designed to create jobs and spur
economic development. Nearly a third were affiliated with colleges
and universities and designed to turn research into real products
and services. Only about 10 percent were run by investment groups
like Venture Frogs for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the backers set up incubators to do good
or do well, their practices are similar. Fledgling companies need
coddling as well as cash in order to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   It has been widely reported that as many as 80 percent of new
businesses fail within the first five years. By contrast, a study
by the Small Business Administration, Coopers and Lybrand and the
National Business Incubation Association suggests that companies
starting out in incubators have a 65 to 80 percent chance of
surviving beyond the five-year milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Incubators typically offer offices equipped with computers,
Internet connections, phones, conference rooms, copiers and fax
equipment. They also often provide access to legal and financial
advice, engineering and human resources consultants and plenty of
hand holding from those who have already been successful developing
a business and marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows entrepreneurs to focus on growing their business
without having to worry about core necessities,'' said Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
   Hsieh and Lin began their business relationship at Harvard,
where Hsieh ran a pizza restaurant in his dormitory. His best
customer was Lin, who would buy two or three pizzas a day at
discount and then mark up each slice for sale to his housemates.
house mates.  &LR; From pizza arbitrage, Lin went on to get a master's
degree in statistics, become vice president of finance at
LinkExchange and then co-found Venture Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Hsieh and Lin planned to invest in dot-com companies
but not run a day care facility for them. They bought lofts in the
1000 Van Ness building because they liked the urban location and
proximity to the cinema. (They also got 100 free movie tickets each
when they bought their units.)
</P>
<P>
   It soon dawned on Hsieh and Lin how much time they and their
clients were wasting on the road. Another advantage of sharing the
same space is cross-pollination of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Venture Frogs has invested $20 million in
about a dozen companies in $300,000 to $3 million increments. One
venture that received $1 million and is sharing space with Venture
Frogs is Web Juice. Started by Eric Liu, another LinkExchange
veteran who also lives in the building, Web Juice provides
engineering consulting services to other Internet startups that
need help training their own employees and getting to market
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation service that
received $650,000 from Venture Frogs, already has 72 employees and
is too big for an incubator. But CEO Chuck Templeton, who has
experience in both the restaurant and semiconductor equipment
fields, said Venture Frogs has helped his company get set up at a
new location.
</P>
<P>
   For years, venture capital firms have lavished management
attention as well as dollars on their fledgling companies. They
recruit managers and technical help. They sit on their boards.
Their cell phones are on day and night. And some, like Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, have entrepreneurs-in-residence who can
take the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Incubators, though, go a few steps further and usually are
creations of proven entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, SEEQ and Chips &AMP; Technologies founder Gordon
Campbell started Techfarm in Mountain View six years ago. Knowledge
Adventure founder Bill Gross created Idealab in Pasadena three
years ago and was perhaps the first to focus on nurturing dot-com
companies. And Idealab has opened a branch in Sunnyvale, and now
Internet incubators are springing up like mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Women's Technology Center, which received its
initial investment from the Three Guineas Fund, a ``venture
philanthropy'' organization started a year ago by former Cisco
Systems marketing executive Catherine Muther.
</P>
<P>
   This 22,000-square-foot nonprofit incubator in San Francisco's
South of Market neighborhood has room for up to 30 female-owned
software, multimedia, Internet and e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to support from Muter's Three Guineas Fund, Women's
Technology Cluster has gained the financial support of the city of
San Francisco and various corporations and foundations. Some of the
early tenants include MsMoney.com, a financial services Internet
portal for female investors; LifeGuides, which offers guidance,
college prep and career planning services for teenagers; and Latino
Link, an Hispanic-focused a Latino-focused  &LR; news site.
</P>
<P>
   In Palo Alto, four veterans of USWeb/CKS started another
Internet incubator last June called Intend Change with backing from
Japan's Softbank Technology Venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital is important but in our view it is only one-third of
the process,'' said co-founder Toby Corey. ``The other two-thirds
is `venture construction' _ providing the strategic,
administrative, marketing, recruiting and other resources to
accelerate the process of getting to market.''
</P>
<P>
   Intend Change expects to raise as much as $200 million on top of
the $100 million it already has. So far, it has invested in four
companies, including InveSmart.com, a retirement financial services
company, and Electron Economy, a service to manage e-commerce from
customer purchase to product delivery.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, another Internet hatchery is expected to be announced
by ex-Adauction executives David Wamsley and Neil Cohen. Their San
Francisco incubator is code-named Net2Future.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies from Intel to Panasonic and government agencies
such as the Korean Ministry of Information and Scottish trade
mission also have set up local incubators or opened their labs to
outside innovators. Like other investors, they are interested in
tracking hot ideas and entrepreneurs and striking partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   A number of nonprofit incubators like Renaissance
Entrepreneurship Center in San Francisco, Center for
Entrepreneurial Development in San Jose and Oakland Small Business
Growth Center focus on helping women and minority entrepreneurs
launch inner-city enterprises. Unlike most for-profit incubators,
high tech is not a required component.
</P>
<P>
   Another major difference is that most nonprofit incubators are
happy to publicize their efforts to help entrepreneurs start
companies and create jobs. By contrast, most for-profit incubators
have been private about their activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generally been invitation-only,'' explained Tyler Orion,
executive director of the Pacific Incubator Network and a San Diego
incubator development consultant. ``They don't want 100 business
plans from people who are patently unqualified.''

IMF WANTS REFORM LAWS IN RUSSIA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund explained on
Tuesday that it was continuing to delay a $640-million loan payment
to Russia, because Moscow had failed to meet the necessary economic
benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The managing director of the fund, Michel Camdessus, cited five
reform goals the Russians had not met, including the parliament's
failure to adopt certain bankruptcy laws or to increase the rate of
cash collection for electricity, heating, natural gas and
rail-freight services.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials said although the delay
was justified on economic grounds, efforts to protest Moscow's
campaign against Chechnya loomed over the loan process. The
administration felt increasing pressure to come forward with more
direct condemnation of Moscow. European foreign ministers said on
Monday that they would seek ways to block loans from international
financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been steadfast in public that it would
not support curbing economic aid, insisting that such action would
weaken Russia and that such a move was not in the interests of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have also expressed concerns about
politicizing loans from the International Monetary Fund and using
them to express concern about actions in Chechnya. But as Russia
flaunted Western advice to halt its military submission of
Chechnya, there were growing divisions in the administration and
the International Monetary Fund on whether to use a multilateral
loan for political reasons, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration position on the loan right now is that it
is not related to Chechnya,'' the official said, and that Russia
``has failed to meet the conditions. Any other considerations are
moot until they meet the conditions.''

A SEASON OF GIVING FOR SUKIE'S FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif, Md., Minn., the Bahamas, Mexico)   (For release Tuesday, Dec. 14)  
(DW) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sukie Miller doesn't have immediate family except for her cat,
Harry. ``It never occurred to me that someone would give me a
kidney,'' she said. But she does have a large extended family and
after learning that Sukie's kidneys were failing so bad she'd soon
need a transplant, a friend sent a letter out to more than 250
other Sukie friends around the world asking them to donate.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen friends, type O blood compatible, offered. One former
boyfriend wrote, ``I'm type O. I have two kidneys. You can have
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But these things are tricky. People don't automatically qualify
and even those who are willing change their minds. A close friend
agreed and even passed a battery of tests that showed her to be a
match but in the end her family was against it. She has four kids
and they didn't want her risking elective surgery. Another wanted
to donate but was eliminated because she has high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Others were willing but not as healthy as they thought. One
potential donor confided to Sukie that lately he'd been going to
the bathroom a lot and was always thirsty. Sukie suggested it
sounded like diabetes and it was. Another went through the medical
screening to be a donor and doctors discovered early evidence of
leukemia. Still, her friends pushed on and early last month Sukie
had two strong prospects. But then one changed his mind and the
other started to waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sukie, who wants to have a transplant without going
on dialysis first, says ``We're in a bit of a chase. My doctor
thinks I'll make it, but he says I'm living on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, out of the blue, a second cousin, from Bethesda,
Md., called and said, ``I'm an O.'' Now, Cynthia Goldner, an
artist, a creative redhead like Sukie, looks to be a better match
than anyone. The friends are ecstatic. One wants to send Cynthia to
Esalen for a week to thank her. Another promises New York theater
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all counting on Cynthia,'' says Sukie. If she gets the
all-clear the two will go to Los Angeles in January for doctors to
remove one of Cynthia's kidneys and transplant it into Sukie. But
Sukie says, ``I don't want to count my kidneys until they are
transplanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia says, ``I just told her we're not doing this on New
Year's. I don't want to be hooked up to an IV on Y2K.'' In answer
to why she decided to be a donor, Cynthia says, ``Here's an
opportunity to enhance the quality of someone's life. I'm honored
and grateful to be healthy enough to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a strange odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sukie Miller is an author, psychotherapist and lecturer, a
New Yorker moved to California but still a New Yorker in style and
humor. ``Kidneys? Who thinks of kidneys?''
</P>
<P>
   A professional interest of late is how different cultures view
death and what happens after people die. Sukie's house in Penngrove
is decorated with folk art from Mexican Day of the Dead
celebrations and carved wooden angels. Her second book on the very
tough subject of children dying, (``Finding Hope When a Child
Dies,'' with Doris Ober) came out this year and it was in preparing
for a round of public readings that she discovered her kidneys were
going.
</P>
<P>
   In New York for an interview for a Bill Moyers show on dying,
she went to see a diet doctor. ``Makes sense. You have a book
coming out, you decide to go on a diet.'' It was that doctor who
found out that her kidneys were in trouble. This was not a total
surprise. Twenty years before she'd learned there was an excess of
protein in her urine, but that doctor said it probably wasn't
anything to worry about. ``He told me that my kidneys would outlive
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But something changed in the meantime and now at age 58 her
kidneys are in a dive. Her California doctor found that her kidneys
were operating at 23 percent and told her in March that she had
maybe two years before she'd need to go on dialysis and be put on a
transplant waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Back then she decided to keep it to herself. ``I thought between
now and two years I'll figure something out.'' Still, she went home
and cried and took stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself that I was never going to feel as well as I
did right then, so what did I want to do for myself.'' She decided
on three things: to revisit the Bahamas, walk around New York City
by herself and introduce a Brazilian friend to New York.
</P>
<P>
   She got her wishes, all flukes. She was invited to go to Nassau
to lecture at a yoga retreat. A TV show flew her to New York for an
interview which gave her time to wander the city on a spring day.
Her Brazilian friend called and suggested they meet in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also decided that I'd had a wonderful life and if this was
it, this was it. You know I write about this stuff and it's nice to
find out when I was up against it, feeling my death as a very real
possibility, I wasn't scared. I have hope that there is more and
that hope has made death OK although not desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-year window, however, started to close this summer when
her kidneys dropped to 16 percent function and considering a
transplant became critical. That's when her friend took over and
sent out the ``Dear Sukie's Friend'' letters. One woman Sukie knew
as a VISTA volunteer offered but didn't qualify. A man she met in
Minneapolis while speaking at his organization's conference also
offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I was kind of popular,'' says Sukie, ``But I am
blown away by the amount of love from people.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York friend connected Sukie with a New Jersey woman who's
had a kidney transplant. Sukie calls her ``my kidney buddy'' and
they talk regularly. Another friend developed a group e-mail for
Sukie updates. If all works out, several of Sukie's friends will
begin the millennium as her transplant team.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sign-up sheet of people willing to go to Los Angeles
to help with her recovery there and when she returns home _ people
who already consider second cousin Cynthia family.

ENERGY DEPT. TO CUT STANDARD FOR WORKERS' EXPOSURE TO BERYLLIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The standard set by government nuclear bomb makers
50 years ago for exposure to beryllium, a metal once used almost
exclusively in nuclear weapons but now common in golf clubs and
cars, has made scores of workers sick with a chronic lung disease,
and the Energy Department on Wednesday will announce a rule sharply
cutting the exposure for workers in its plants.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new standard will apply only to government plants,
workers in civilian factories will still fall under the old, higher
level. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration alerted
workers in September that its current standard, borrowed from the
nuclear weapons industry in 1971, ``now appears to be too high to
prevent chronic beryllium disease,'' an auto-immune disorder
resulting from inhaling particles of the metal. But the agency has
not changed its standard. The action by the Energy Department puts
it in the unusual role of being stricter than its civilian
counterparts in health and safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said, ``We know some of our
workers are getting sick from beryllium, and we now have in place
the toughest and most comprehensive protections in the world to
prevent future cases of this terrible disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Beryllium has found a variety of specialty uses in electronics
and other fields, because it is light, stiff and transparent to
X-rays, and conducts heat well. It is not a hazard to users of
products like golf clubs, said Dr. Milton Rossman, a pulmonary
specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, unless the golfer
decides ``to sand them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Beryllium is a unique case in the annals of nuclear weapons
manufacture because it is the only substance that the government
has acknowledged caused injury and death at levels allowed under
its regulations. The Energy Department has used little beryllium
recently because it has built only a few nuclear weapons, but the
decontamination of old bomb plants is expected to increase the
potential for beryllium exposure.
</P>
<P>
   C. Rick Jones, director of the Office of Worker Protection
Programs and Hazards Management in the department, said, ``There is
a whole new work force that potentially is going to be exposed
during this cleanup activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Michaels, the assistant secretary for environmental
safety and health, said, ``We think this is a long way toward
eliminating chronic beryllium disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But among people susceptible to chronic beryllium disease,
Michaels and other experts said, even brief exposures to small
quantities may be sufficient to cause the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The disease can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers,
night sweats and other symptoms, and can be debilitating or fatal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The old standard, set by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1949,
was adopted in 1971 by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration for civilian plants, but among weapons workers has
caused at least 146 people to develop a disease, according to the
Energy Department. Hundreds more show a condition that is likely to
progress into the disease, according to the new regulation, which
will be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. The Clinton
administration recently proposed legislation that would compensate
people who worked for companies that supplied the government with
beryllium.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule requires worker protection measures, like
respirators, at 0.2 of a microgram per cubic meter of air, while
the 50-year-old standard set worker exposure levels at 10 times as
much.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule is unusual because it states explicitly that the
government simply does not know what level, if any, is safe. The
strategy to minimize exposure mimics the regulatory scheme for
radiation, in which the government sets ceilings but also demands
that exposures be kept as low as reasonably achievable.
</P>
<P>
   Even the old standard limited exposures to small quantities. In
its warning, OSHA pointed out that two micrograms per cubic meter
was equivalent to ``a marble-sized piece of material that is
pulverized and dispersed'' into an area 1 mile by 1 mile by 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At the major American maker of beryllium, Brush Wellman Inc., of
Cleveland, Marc Kolanz, the director of environmental health and
safety, said action levels should be set specific to each place
where beryllium was used, because in a laboratory, for example, the
0.2 microgram level was probably too high. He said his company
already tried to minimize exposures even below the standard.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Robert Rubin, the former treasury secretary and
one of the architects of the current economic expansion, vouching
for his fiscal wisdom and discipline, Vice President Al Gore
continued Tuesday to lash out at his opponents as fiscally
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the budget proposals of former Sen. Bill Bradley, his
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the leading Republican, would take ``unnecessary
risks with our prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if the economy ain't broke, then let's make
sure that we build on the strength that we have,'' Gore said.
``Their theme is, if the economy ain't broke, let's break it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Gore attacked Bradley's fitness to oversee the economy,
Bradley released statements by two prominent economists who vouched
for him.
</P>
<P>
   The two, Paul Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, and Henry Kaufman, president the financial consulting firm
of Henry Kaufman &AMP; Co., praised Bradley for understanding the
economy, being fiscally prudent and playing a central role in
passing the 1986 Tax Reform Act.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman also said that Bradley was more honest than Gore in
laying out the cost of his proposals and for refusing to take a
pledge against raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets rely on trust and truth,'' Kaufman said. ``Bill
Bradley has told the truth about the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was speaking in an auditorium at New York University Law
School to 400 students. The event provided a platform for Rubin,
the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and now an executive
at Citigroup Inc., to endorse Gore and for that endorsement to
resound on Wall Street, where Bradley and Bush both enjoy
substantial support.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has held open meetings in living rooms and school
gymnasiums in New Hampshire that have been casual and personable.
Tuesday's, his first such forum in New York, was far more formal,
with Gore standing in a suit on a stage with elected officials like
Carl McCall, the state comptroller, and university officials. His
speech focused on the economy, and the questions covered a range of
domestic issues, from gun control (which he favors) to the
legalization of marijuana (which he opposes).
</P>
<P>
   Rubin portrayed Gore as a full partner with President Clinton in
bringing the nation out of its morass of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you,'' Rubin said, ``after sitting with the vice
president in the White House, the Oval Office and the Cabinet room
over six-and-a-half years, that he was consistently sound,
sensible, practical and willing to fight politically difficult
issues with respect to the broad array of economic matters before
this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   With this stamp of approval, Gore resumed his relentless assault
against his opponents' economic proposals, with a particularly
harsh assessment of Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Bradley's budget proposal was ``hastily
constructed'' and would spend the entire surplus. As recently as
Monday, Bradley, citing the uncertainties of the future, refused to
rule out ever raising taxes to pay for his plan to make health
insurance available to most Americans. But he said he was not
proposing a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seized on this Tuesday and characterized Bradley as
admitting that he may have to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bradley would spend the surplus ``mostly to provide
subsidies for health coverage to people who already have health
coverage, many of them in high income brackets,'' adding, ``That's
why he's admitted he may have to raise taxes to pay for his plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore went on to say of Bradley, ``To propose a possible tax
increase, not because of some contingency related to unknowns in
the economy but because of an inability to cover a huge gaping hole
in a campaign promise that can't be covered in any other way _ that
is unresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, said that Gore has ruled out
raising taxes except for some unforeseen disaster. Gore's 1993
tie-breaking vote in the Senate on the budget, however, included
the largest tax increase up to that time in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley has pointed out that in 1992, Clinton refused to
pledge not to raise taxes, saying such a pledge would be
irresponsible. Bradley says that he and Gore have essentially the
same view but that Gore is grossly distorting his.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign announced endorsements from three Democratic
members of the House of Representatives: George Miller and Fortney
Stark of California, and Jim McDermott of Washington. Stark and
McDermott are both considered experts on health care, while Miller
worked closely with Bradley on California water issues in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The new endorsements double the number of House members who have
come out in support of Bradley. He has also been endorsed by three
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collapse of affordable health insurance for middle- and
lower-income Americans is the problem of the decade, and Bill
Bradley has shown more vision and courage in addressing this key
issue,'' Stark said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also released new television commercials in New
Hampshire and Iowa on Tuesday touting his plan to make health
insurance available to almost all Americans. The 30-second spots
are drawn from actual town hall meetings Bradley held in the two
states, and feature the former senator describing the broad
outlines to groups of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health plan has been fiercely attacked by Gore as too
expensive and incapable of providing adequate coverage to
low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Bradley campaign released a statement accusing Gore
of making false statements about Bradley's health care plan and his
position on school vouchers. The news release also asserted that
Gore has exaggerated or obfuscated his own record during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Bradley campaign asserted that while Gore
recently claimed to have long supported the death penalty, he
repeatedly voted against it in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign also criticized Gore for having taken
credit in a Time Magazine article for being an author of the Earned
Income Tax Credit, which helps low-income workers. The credit,
according to the Bradley campaign, was created in 1975, a year
before Gore was elected to Congress.

SEVERAL COMPANIES MAKE DECEMBER THE TIME OF YEAR TO CHANGE THEIR
AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Typically, as the year draws to a close, the pace of agency
changes among advertisers accelerates. This month is proving no
different as several marketers make shifts involving their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard consolidated the creative account for its
electronic services units, with billings estimated at $60 million,
at Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners in San Francisco, part of the
Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco office of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, part of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi PLC, had previously handled those duties. Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
continues to handle other Hewlett-Packard assignments that include
creative tasks for products, worldwide media buying and
international media planning.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Fox, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto,
Calif., confirmed a report this week in the trade publication
Adweek about the additional assignment for Goodby, Silverstein. The
agency already handles the Hewlett-Packard corporate branding
account, with spending estimated at $200 million during the next
year, as well as domestic media planning duties.
</P>
<P>
   The change reflects the company's desire to centralize at one
agency the creative accounts for overall branding, digital imaging
and e-services, Ms. Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   CKE Restaurants in Anaheim, Calif., expanded its relation with
Johnson/Ukropina Creative Marketing in Irvine, Calif., by awarding
the agency the creative account for its Hardee's fast-food chain.
Billings were estimated at $50 million to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came less than two weeks after Hardee's parted ways
with its agency of 13 months, the Leap Partnership in Chicago,
owned by Leapnet Inc. Johnson/Ukropina has handled the
merchandising account for Carl's Jr., another fast-food chain owned
by CKE, for six years and recently worked with Hardee's on a
merchandising project.
</P>
<P>
   Quotesmith.com, an online insurance price comparison service,
awarded its account, which had been done in-house, to the Chicago
office of BBDO Worldwide, part of Omnicom. Billings were estimated
at $100 million for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Hemsworth II, who is the senior vice president for
marketing at Quotesmith.com in Darien, Ill., part of the Quotesmith
Corp., said the decision followed a review narrowed to BBDO and
several agencies he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   The Principal Financial Group, which offers products and
services like insurance and mortgage banking, awarded its account
to Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney in Chicago, part of Publicis SA. Billings
were estimated at $25 million to $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a six-month review that had been
narrowed to Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney and two other agencies: Jordan
McGrath Case &AMP; Partners/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro
RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, and the Chicago office of
Ammirati Puris Lintas, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Brown Marketing Communications in Chicago, which had handled the
account for 25 years, was invited to participate but declined, said
Dave Wozniak, advertising director at Principal Financial in Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Winstar Communications in New York placed its account in review
after three years at Trone Advertising in Greensboro, N.C. Billings
were estimated at $15 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Sando, a spokesman for Winstar, a telecommunications
company, confirmed a report of the review in the fax edition of
Advertising Age. Trone was invited to participate but declined, he
said, adding that a decision is expected early next year. The
review is being handled by Pile &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil in Irving, Texas, the oil giant formed with the
recent acquisition of Mobil by Exxon, named the DDB Worldwide
Communications Group in New York _ the unit of Omnicom that is the
longtime Mobil agency _ to create a multimedia campaign to promote
the formation of the merged company. Spending through the end of
January was estimated at $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is being scrutinized by Madison Avenue because of
speculation that Exxon Mobil might rearrange its agency roster with
the completion of the merger. The longtime Exxon agency is
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson
World Group in New York, a unit of Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   And Garden Ridge in Houston, a home decorating retailer, named
the Dallas office of Publicis to handle its account, which had been
at Fogarty Klein &AMP; Partners in Houston. Billings were estimated at
$10 million to $15 million. A Publicis sibling, Publicis Technology
in San Francisco, will handle online marketing and the Garden Ridge
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty Klein will continue handling public relations for Garden
Ridge. The agency is being bought back by senior management from
its parent, Lois/USA, as part of the recent filing for federal
bankruptcy protection by Lois/USA.

`SOUTH PARK' CREATORS PLAN CARTOON SERIES FOR THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the latest examples of how Hollywood is trying
to turn the Internet into an entertainment venue, the creators of
the television show ``South Park'' said they had agreed to make a
series of 39 short cartoons for the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoons, which will be different from South Park, will be
distributed starting next March on Shockwave.com, an entertainment
Web site run by Macromedia Inc., a software company. Trey Parker
and Matt Stone, the creators of ``South Park,'' will receive equity
of less than 10 percent in Shockwave.com, which is being run as a
separate subsidiary of Macromedia and is expected to eventually
issue its own shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the entertainment and computer industries, from
Steven Spielberg to unknown animators and directors, are
distributing or planning to distribute cartoons, television
programs and movies through the Internet. Still, it is unclear how
successful this will be as a business.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said he and his partner were attracted to the Web by the
freedom it offered to go beyond the language and content
restrictions of television. ``We're definitely excited to push
those limits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Parker had turned down offers to do Web programs
in the past because the Internet technology was so crude. ``It's
really just now the technology made it possible to do cool stuff on
the Web, especially in animation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the Web-based entertainment is derived from
television, movies or comic books, Parker and Stone will create new
characters and a new series that will be seen first on the
Internet. If a creation succeeds on the Web, it might then be sold
or distributed to TV networks or movie studios, having already
built up an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can deliver from the get-go are millions of viewers,''
said Mike Simpson, executive vice president of the William Morris
Agency, which represented Stone and Parker. This could become a
much less expensive and risky way to develop new shows than making
full-length pilots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone will retain the copyrights to their work,
although Shockwave.com will share in revenues even from television
programs or movies based on the Internet characters, according to
Rob Burgess, chairman and chief executive of Macromedia, which is
based in San Francisco. ``We think it's a watershed deal with
Hollywood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The animations will be two to five minutes long and will be
viewable using Macromedia's Flash software, which the company says
is already on 200 million computers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the barriers to entertainment on the Web is the poor
video image quality and long transmission times. But that is not as
big a problem for animation because software like Flash allows
cartoons with near television quality to be transmitted reasonably
fast. Image quality is even less of a factor for the crude type of
animation in ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Shockwave.com last week received investments totaling $44
million from Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm that backed
such companies as Cisco Systems and Yahoo, and from Jim Clark, the
entrepreneur who started Silicon Graphics and Netscape
Communications.

IMF WANTS REFORM LAWS IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>

 (HLW)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund explained on
Tuesday that it was continuing to delay a $640-million loan payment
to Russia, because Moscow had failed to meet the necessary economic
benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The managing director of the fund, Michel Camdessus, cited five
reform goals the Russians had not met, including the parliament's
failure to adopt certain bankruptcy laws or to increase the rate of
cash collection for electricity, heating, natural gas and
rail-freight services.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials said although the delay
was justified on economic grounds, efforts to protest Moscow's
campaign against Chechnya loomed over the loan process. The
administration felt increasing pressure to come forward with more
direct condemnation of Moscow. European foreign ministers said on
Monday that they would seek ways to block loans from international
financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been steadfast in public that it would
not support curbing economic aid, insisting that such action would
weaken Russia and that such a move was not in the interests of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have also expressed concerns about
politicizing loans from the International Monetary Fund and using
them to express concern about actions in Chechnya. But as Russia
flaunted Western advice to halt its military submission of
Chechnya, there were growing divisions in the administration and
the International Monetary Fund on whether to use a multilateral
loan for political reasons, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration position on the loan right now is that it
is not related to Chechnya,'' the official said, and that Russia
``has failed to meet the conditions. Any other considerations are
moot until they meet the conditions.''

EDITORIAL: MOVING FAST ON PATIENT SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 8:
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine reported last week that between about
50,000 and 100,000 patients die in hospitals each year because of
medical mistakes. President Clinton responded yesterday by
embracing the report and ordering his administration to take
immediate action. For Washington, that is a remarkably rapid
turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   The institute estimated that perhaps 3 percent of hospital
patients suffered injuries from treatment. About half are
preventable. The problem, the report said, is not individual
carelessness as much as faulty systems that fail to catch mistakes
_ such as administering the wrong dose of drugs _ before they
injure patients.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton instructed a task force to report within 60 days on
steps to improve patient safety. He directed federal agencies to
come up with remedies in time for his next budget address. By
presidential order, he instructed the agency that oversees health
plans for federal employees to require that those plans develop
systems for cutting down errors. It is expected that improvements
in plans that cover nine million federal employees and their
families will spread to other patients.
</P>
<P>
   The institute report itself contains useful suggestions. It
calls for a federal center for patient safety to distribute
information about preventing errors, as well as mandatory reporting
of serious injuries and voluntary confidential reporting of less
serious errors. Confidentiality, it argued, is needed to discourage
doctors from hiding mistakes to save themselves professional or
financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts announced that
he would introduce a bill that would put the institute's proposals
into effect and require hospitals to adopt error-preventing systems
or else risk losing Medicare and Medicaid patients. That would
cover most hospitals in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's frightening statistics were known to health
experts long before last week. Yet no one has figured out how to
get hospitals and physicians to do better. Employers say they
cannot make intelligent choices among health plans because data on
the quality of these plans are unreliable. The health plans say
they cannot undertake the huge cost of producing reliable data
because employers do not act on them.
</P>
<P>
   Even adopting the institute's recommendations in full will not
completely solve this chicken-and-egg problem. But the proposals
should produce better information and at the same time protect
patients.

PUSH FOR CORPORATE TAX CHANGES APPEARS TO FALTER IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A Japanese government commitment to change corporate
taxation in ways that would encourage companies to become more
efficient and competitive appears to be faltering.
</P>
<P>
   Nobuaki Usui, the administrative vice minister at the Ministry
of Finance, suggested Monday that it would be difficult to meet the
April 2001 deadline set by the ruling party's tax committee for
taxing corporate operations on what is known as a consolidated
basis, rather than the current system of taxing affiliates and
subsidiaries independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is talk that taxation on a consolidated basis is
impossible,'' Usui told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Any delay would likely disappoint investors, since consolidated
taxation was supposed to help ease the restructuring of Japanese
corporations. ``It's a setback in terms of restructuring because if
Japan did have consolidated taxation, more companies would adopt a
holding company structure, which would promote restructuring,''
said Kathy Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman, Sachs in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A holding company structure would allow companies to draw
greater distinctions between their divisions, better illuminating
profit centers and money losers, and establish different pay
practices for different businesses. Japanese companies have
hesitated to adopt the structure because it has inherent
disadvantages under the current tax code.
</P>
<P>
   That was to change April 1, 2001. But the Tax Bureau is hinting
more strongly that it is having problems implementing the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's stated reason is that it is having difficulty
deciding on the criteria for companies to pay consolidated taxes.
Must its subsidiaries be wholly owned? Should affiliates in which a
company has a simple majority be included? What about those units
in which a company holds a minority stake but is nonetheless
effectively in control?
</P>
<P>
   ``Consolidation involves big changes in basic tax philosophy,
and the Tax Bureau feels there is a need to discuss a broad range
of issues,'' the Finance Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has already established guidelines for
consolidated accounting, which must begin this April, that
suggested it had already resolved many of the issues it is now
revisiting.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, one question that remains is how the government can
justify forcing companies to adopt consolidated accounting, which
makes them take responsibility for a number of formerly
off-balance-sheet liabilities like pension fund shortfalls and
shared debts, if it does not use the new accounting for tax
purposes. Would companies need to keep two separate sets of books,
one for investors and one for the tax collector?
</P>
<P>
   Tax consolidation, which would give Japanese corporations a
collective tax break of between 1 trillion and 2 trillion yen, or
between $9.7 billion and $19.4 billion, was supposed to help
companies offset the pain of consolidated accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Bureau contends that tax consolidation and accounting
consolidation are separate matters. For example, some overseas
subsidiaries that are included in a company's consolidated
accounting may not be consolidated for tax purposes, a Finance
Ministry spokesman said. A far bigger but less acknowledged problem
for the government is the steep drop in tax revenue over the past
two years, which could be worsened by consolidated taxation.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Finance has already estimated that consolidated
taxation will produce a 1 trillion yen to 2 trillion yen shortfall
in tax revenue.

AIR CANADA EXTENDS DEADLINE FOR BUYING CANADIAN AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TORONTO _ Air Canada extended its offer Tuesday night to
purchase its struggling rival, Canadian Airlines International,
until Dec. 23 to give itself more time to negotiate with the AMR
Corp., the parent of American Airlines, the largest shareholder in
Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The $92 million (Canadian) offer by Air Canada, or $63 million
(United States) for Canadian Airlines had been scheduled to expire
at 5 p.m. Tuesday. A combination of the two carriers would leave
Canada with one coast-to-coast carrier.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Donald J. Carty, the chairman of AMR, said
``substantial progress'' had been made in working toward a deal
with Air Canada. Spokesmen for Air Canada sounded similarly
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada of Montreal, the country' biggest airline, had said
it would extend the bid only if its talks with AMR indicated that a
settlement of their differences seemed likely. Its offer requires
that just over 50 percent of Canadian Airlines shares be tendered.
But AMR, which owns 25 percent of Canadian Airlines, has said that
it wants compensation of $1 billion (Canadian), or $680 million, if
the deal with Air Canada means that Canadian Airlines will break
its commercial agreements with American, including withdrawal from
the Oneworld alliance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, AMR wants Canadian Airlines to be
rescued, and Air Canada seems to be the only viable candidate.
Without help, Canadian Airlines will run out of operating cash by
the middle of next year. If that happens, AMR's huge investment in
the ailing Canadian company will be substantially lost.
</P>
<P>
   Although the directors of Canadian Airlines had advised
shareholders to offer their shares to Air Canada on Saturday, AMR
has been bargaining from its own position of strength for several
weeks. Air Canada will make concessions, people close to the
negotiations said, but its president and chief executive, Robert
Milton, has described the $680 million compensation demand as
``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   AMR has invested almost $250 million (Canadian), or $170
million, in Canadian Airlines and was given a controlling vote on
all important corporate decisions.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines also draws an estimated $204 million a year in
passenger traffic through its affiliation with Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Control of Canada's air industry erupted into a struggle in
August when the Ottawa government lifted competition restrictions
to permit merger talks between Air Canada and Canadian Airlines.
The Calgary-based Canadian had been losing money for years and Air
Canada, while healthier, had been unable to match the returns of
airlines in the United States because of stiff domestic
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Onex Corp., a Toronto-based leveraged-buyout specialist put
together a bid to buy both airlines, but backed out early in
November after a Quebec court ruled that its offer was illegal.
National legislation prevents any one shareholding of more than 10
percent of Air Canada.

CHANCE OF A LIFETIME FOR A NURSE LED TO A RICH BANKER'S DEATH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, N.Y.)   By JANE GROSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORMVILLE, N.Y. _ There are signs that Ted Maher had a yen for
the finer things in life, even here on a dirt road in this Dutchess
County hamlet. The house that Maher had built, for his wife and
three children, was grand by local standards, a sprawling Cape Cod
with stone pillars out front and a gargoyle guarding the main
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Maher, a 41-year-old nurse who the authorities say has confessed
to setting the fire that killed the banking magnate Edmond J. Safra
in his Monte Carlo penthouse on Friday, also owned two acres of
nearby woodland, spliced by a rushing creek, where he had been
clearing a hillside to build another house, which would be worth
more than $200,000 in the booming market here.
</P>
<P>
   But Maher called a sudden halt to the project several months
ago, with the fence posts fresh in the ground and plans for a
bridge to span the creek. He had stumbled on an opportunity too
good to pass up, he told neighbors here: Safra, who was suffering
from Parkinson's disease, had asked him to join his medical team,
with a $600-a-day salary and a lifestyle more opulent than any he
had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The offer had come, Maher excitedly told neighbors near the
building site, as the result of a chance good deed at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan, where he had
worked for nine years in the neonatal intensive care unit. In the
maternity ward one day, Maher said he had found an expensive
camera. He located its owner, an associate of Safra's, who
reciprocated with a job recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity he couldn't
afford to pass up,'' said a young woman who lives across from the
building site with her husband and infant son. She spoke on the
condition of anonymity, out of respect for Maher's family, who have
refused to comment on the events of recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The woman added that she had met Maher only a few times and did
not claim to know him well. But she had been impressed by his
friendliness, his relationship with his three towheaded sons _ a
10-year-old from a previous marriage and two toddlers _ and his
interest in her child.
</P>
<P>
   Maher went to work for Safra five months ago as part of a staff
of more than a half-dozen nurses and several doctors who cared for
him in palatial homes around the world. According to Monaco's chief
prosecutor, Daniel Serdet, Maher set a fire on Friday in a
wastebasket at Safra's Monte Carlo penthouse, slashed himself with
his own switchblade, then called the police, saying that the
apartment was under attack by two hooded men with knives.
</P>
<P>
   The fire killed Safra and another nurse, who had taken refuge in
a bathroom and were overcome by smoke. In his confession, the
prosecutor said, Maher described a rivalry with another member of
the medical staff. He created the emergency, Serdet said, in the
hope of emerging as the hero who had saved his employer's life.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said Maher will be charged with arson without
intent to kill, which could bring a life sentence, but he will
first be examined by psychiatrists to see if he is competent to
stand trial. Serdet described Maher as psychologically fragile and
under the influence of sedatives at the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment would surprise workers at
Columbia-Presbyterian's children's hospital, where Maher was a
respected nurse in one of the most high-pressure settings in
medicine, caring for seriously ill newborns and trying to soothe
distressed parents. A nurse with Maher's credentials _ he is a 1989
graduate of Dutchess Community College, earned his license in 1990
and has no record of disciplinary action _ would earn roughly
$60,000 a year, a union spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Raymond I. Stark, a neonatologist at the hospital and a
professor of pediatrics at Columbia University College of
Physicians and Surgeons, was unambiguous in his praise of Maher's
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cared deeply for the kids he took care of,'' Stark said.
``In a setting with a lot of tension and a lot of anxiety, he was a
bright light and a wonderful man. He had some very special moments
with the parents that are well known to him and them, so private I
would not share them with a newspaper. This is inconceivable to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But others who have crossed Maher's path found him difficult and
abrasive. A landlord in Auburn, Me., where Maher was born and
returned for a spell in 1991, described him as a man who easily
``flew off the handle.'' The landlord, Colby Dill, who rented a
two-bedroom apartment to the Maher family, said his tenant had a
``mean streak'' and was verbally threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were glad when he left,'' Dill said. ``All I can tell you
is he wasn't a person you wanted to be around too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher also had arguments with his neighbor across the street
here in Stormville, Leonard Lavelle, a retired carpenter. Their
squabbles led to complaints and cross-complaints to the East
Fishkill Police Department, according to its chief, Brian Nichols,
who said the bickering began with a dispute about a property line
and escalated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The police declined to give details of the incidents, but a
person with knowledge of the disputes said that in one
confrontation Maher shoved Lavelle to the ground and knocked off
his glasses after an argument about the nurse's driving a tractor
on the one-lane dirt road.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of his 70-mile commute to New York City and his
demanding job, Maher is not well known in this hamlet, where
developments are springing up amid tumbledown barns, decrepit
houses and a rural landscape of rolling hills and small lakes. His
29-year-old wife, Heidi, a former per diem nurse at Columbia, is a
regular at a nearby video store, where Maher, employees say, was
only an occasional and curt customer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Maher, who was raised in Stormville and is the daughter of
a real estate broker, is recalled as telling the clerk at the video
store that it had been a quiet Thanksgiving without her husband and
that she looked forward to his return.
</P>
<P>
   After the authorities in Monaco announced Monday that Maher had
confessed to setting the fatal fire, his wife and children took
refuge with her parents, Joan and Werner Wustrau, who live nearby
in a stone house high on a hill next to the Green Haven
Correctional Facility. Mrs. Wustrau declined to talk to a reporter
Tuesday.

<P>
   Former Nebraska football coach Tom Osborne will not be the
University of Houston's next coach.
</P>
<P>
   A radio station in Nebraska reported that Osborne was headed to
UH and would receive a financial package worth $1 million a year,
but Cougars athletic director Chet Gladchuk shot down the report
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Osborne is not going to be the next football coach at this
university and never was going to be the next football coach,''
Gladchuk said. ``There is no truth to that report, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, 62, was 255-49-3 in 25 seasons with Nebraska and won
national championships in 1994, 1995 and 1997. Osborne remains
active at Nebraska with teaching, alumni affairs and fund-raising.
He recently appraised the UH program for Gladchuk during a visit to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have the insight and input of the coach who
created the benchmark for excellence in our profession,'' Gladchuk
said of Osborne's role. ``I wanted to be able to rely on his
appraisal so that I could share that with interested candidates for
this position at the proper time.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state hiring policies, Friday is the earliest the Cougars
can announce a successor to Kim Helton, their coach for the past
seven seasons who was dismissed Nov. 21 with two years remaining on
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very careful and calculated process, and I have
guaranteed the utmost confidence to all who have showed any
interest in the position,'' Gladchuk said. ``I am responsible to
all of them to live up to that commitment of privacy. I have
promised whoever has showed interest that to the utmost of my
ability, I will live up to that. I won't jeopardize any chance of
this university to hire the best possible coach, and I will not
address any reports or rumors of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the best thing I can say is that I promise we will have a
new coach by the season opener and everyone should relax and go
Christmas shopping. We will complete our process as soon as
possible.''

FOR FIRST TIME, MRS. CLINTON DIRECTLY CHALLENGES GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c. 1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton issued her first direct policy
challenge against her likely Senate race opponent Tuesday, calling
on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to express a position on a bill that
would increase the number of people eligible for benefits under the
Family and Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging off the challenge, Giuliani responded by saying that
he generally agreed with Mrs. Clinton's position and would likely
support an expansion of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Until late last month, when she announced her intention to run
for the United States Senate in New York, Mrs. Clinton had been
careful not to refer to Giuliani, her likely Republican opponent,
by name or title. And even in her announcement she mentioned his
name only briefly, declining to draw contrasts between herself and
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But in a shift in strategy that suggests many more policy
challenges to come, Mrs. Clinton pointedly singled out Giuliani by
name and title, first at a breakfast fund-raiser in Midtown
Manhattan and again in an appearance on the trading floor of an
investment bank at the World Financial Center, demanding that he
tell New York voters where he stands on expanding the family leave
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to run for the Senate on the issues that I think
are important to the country,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ``and I am going
to be telling New Yorkers where I stand on those issues, and I
would hope that the mayor would also tell New Yorkers where he
stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton first challenged the mayor on the issue Tuesday in
a speech to about 1,000 people at a breakfast fund-raiser for her
Senate campaign at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Midtown. The event was
sponsored by a group of women who support Mrs. Clinton. She
followed up on those remarks during a visit to the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the many issues that I think are important is the one I
mentioned this morning about family and medical leave and expanding
it,'' she said. ``I am firmly in favor of it, I would champion it
in the Senate, and I think the mayor needs to tell us where he
stands on that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I think we need to start talking about the issues
that will be before the Senate in the year 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The family leave act was the very first bill signed into law by
President Clinton and provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, job
protection and continued health insurance coverage to American
workers who need to care for a newborn or adopted child or to tend
to a sick relative.
</P>
<P>
   The law only applies to workers at businesses with 50 or more
employees, but in his State of the Union address this year, Clinton
urged Congress to expand the law to include employees of small
businesses. The Clinton administration proposal would apply to
workers at business with 25 or more employees, a move that would
make about 10 million more people eligible for the benefits.
Congressional Republicans, including the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, have so far opposed the extension.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, at his daily news conference at City Hall, said
that he, too, would likely support the expansion. But he said he
was not familiar with the specific proposal now before Congress and
would need to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family leave act was an advance,'' he said. ``I
think it's something that's good.'' He added, ``I would have to
look at the specific proposal, but it's something that I would be
open to expanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he might support the expansion despite the
opposition of the Republican leadership in Congress. ``Oh, you
negotiate all these things,'' he said. ``That's how the Senate
operates.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added that he might be better positioned than Mrs.
Clinton to accomplish the expansion. ``I would think, actually, a
Republican would have a better chance of getting that done,'' he
said, ``than a Democrat could do in a Republican-controlled
Senate.''

U.S. PLANS SUIT AGAIN GUN MAKERS ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC HOUSING
RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs grafs 3 and 4 for elaboration on suit; replaces 6th
graf with 5 new grafs on gun industry reaction; story is now 2
takes)

 By DAVID STOUT with RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move to force the firearms industry to adopt
safer ways of doing business, the federal government said Tuesday
that it was preparing a lawsuit against gun makers on behalf of the
3 million people who live in public housing projects, where
shootings have taken a heavy toll for years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development have been laying the groundwork for the suit in recent
months in hopes that the threat of federal action would intensify
pressure on the gun industry to change how it makes and sells
weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has decided to throw its weight
behind suits filed by more than two dozen cities against gun
companies in hopes that a far-reaching settlement might be achieved
once and for all, saving lives and enabling conscientious gun
makers and dealers to do business, said Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo and Bruce Reed, President Clinton's domestic-policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The suit would accuse the arms industry of marketing and selling
weapons irresponsibly so that they often fall into the hands of
criminals and of failing to make firearms as safe as possible. But
Cuomo said the federal goal is a settlement, not a drawn-out
lawsuit. ``If all parties act in good faith, we'll stay at the
negotiating table,'' he said. ``If not, we are prepared to
litigate. We feel we're in a strong position.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cuomo said that if no settlement was reached, the
government's suit would be filed in Federal District Court.
Technically, the suit would be lodged by the nation's 3,200
public-housing authorities. They have an enormous stake in the
issue, Cuomo said, because of violence in the projects, where the
government spends $1 billion a year on security, but where many
children are so afraid of stray bullets that they sleep in
bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Two representatives of the firearms industry said tonight that
the threat of a federal suit would not improve prospects for a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction is one of frustration and surprise,'' said
Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, who said his group had been meeting with the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on ways to make weapons safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be working with one arm of the federal government and then
have another arm of the federal government say they're going to sue
you is very frustrating,'' Delfay said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jannuzzo, general counsel for the Glock gun company, said
better enforcement of gun laws would do more good than more
lawsuits. Jannuzzo is a former prosecutor in Monmouth County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Delfay's group has been conferring with New York State Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer on a gun-industry code of conduct in the hope
of heading off a lawsuit that Spitzer has threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Tuesday night that he welcomed the federal
intervention. ``This is a tremendous boost to the effort,'' he
said, ``and should lead to substantial additional pressure being
put on the industry.'' Spitzer compared the threat of his lawsuit
to a dagger. ``The feds' is a meat ax,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that more than 500 murders are committed in a typical
year among the 100 largest housing projects, with 70 percent of
those involving firearms. These statistics, as well as accidental
shootings involving children who find hidden guns, give the housing
authorities strong legal standing to sue, Reed asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that the federal government, like the cities that have
already sued the firearms industry, seeks curbs on advertising;
compulsory child-safety locks on handguns and, perhaps most
important, stricter rules on sales and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``One percent of the gun dealers sell 50 percent of the guns
that turn up in crimes,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the HUD said he had talked to Spitzer; Connecticut
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who has also been involved in
the campaign against the firearms industry, and to most of the
mayors of cities that have sued gun makers. ``Unanimously, they
were enthusiastic about our coming in,'' said the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo and Reed said that their goal is a ``global settlement''
with the gun interests, not unlike that which was reached with the
tobacco industry. And like the tobacco settlement, a general
settlement with the firearms industry would not necessarily
preclude smaller settlements involving particular companies and
cities, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said HUD lawyers have been conferring with their
counterparts in the White House, the Justice Department and the
Treasury Department, whose Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
regulates segments of the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Any wide-ranging settlement _ or lawsuit, if an agreement cannot
be reached _ would almost inevitably involve such familiar names as
Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., Smith &AMP; Wesson, Colt's Manufacturing, Beretta,
Glock and Mossberg &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies have been in discussions with Spitzer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a situation not unlike the tobacco negotiations, two big gun
makers were said last summer to be negotiating with Spitzer. That
might have broken the solidarity of the gun interests _ much as
cigarette manufacturers disagreed on their strategy _ but the gun
companies have since closed ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Any federal settlement talks probably would cover limits on how
many guns could be bought at one time; better record-keeping, an
independent monito to see that safety regulations are enfortced,
and better protection for children.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You have safety caps on aspirin bottles, but not on guns?''
Cuomo said. ``Where's the logic?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the measures that federal officials would seek are
already laws in some states. In recent years, Congress has wrestled
often with gun-control issues, especially after a particularly
gruesome mass killing. Some federal measures have been made into
law, others talked about more or less seriously over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The cities that have sued gun makers include Boston, Newark,
Atlanta, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Cleveland, St. Louis and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As with the tobacco industry, there is an uneven history of
litigation involving gun interests. Often, the firearms makers and
dealers have won, but not always.
</P>
<P>
   New York is not among the two dozen cities that have sued. But
last February, a federal Court jury in Brooklyn found 15 of 25
firearms makers named as defendants negligent in case involving
illegally obtained handguns. The private plaintiffs argued that the
companies fostered illegal trafficking because of their marketing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago also filed a suit last year, accusing 12 suburban stores
and several gun makers and wholesalers of creating a public
nuisance by selling guns to people who took them into the city and
committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, a state judge in Cincinnati threw out the city's
suit against firearms makers, declaring that the city was wrongly
asking a court to change how guns are made and sold _ something on
a legislature could do.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, an Illinois state judge ruled just last week
that a suit brought by families of three Chicagoans killed by
handguns could proceed. The survivors accuse the gun industry of
knowingly creating an underground market in handguns.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Following are remarks about defense policy prepared
by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination, for delivery here Tuesday night aboard the
aircraft Intrepid:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken before about the unique `unipolar moment' in
world affairs for the United States and the necessity to extend
this period of American pre-eminence for as long as we possibly
can. In a remarkably changed world, and on the eve of the next
American century, our core strategic interests, like our founding
ideals, remain constant: protecting our homeland and hemisphere
from external threats; preventing the domination of Europe by a
single power; strengthening our alliances; securing access to
energy resources; and sustaining stability in the Pacific Rim. With
the end of the Cold War, the threats to our strategic interests
have evolved or, at least, their ranking as priority threats has
been reordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the potential threats posed by continued
political and economic chaos in Russia, and China's growing
economic and military strength, there are other immediate threats
to our national security that the next administration must face.
Recently, I described these four threats in detail.

   ``First, violent expressions of nationalist and ethnic
rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to
rogue states and potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, information warfare such as an attack on our private
sector's computer grids that cause critical failures in vital
services that we take for granted. If we do not more effectively
guard our communications, including the Internet _ our powerful
economic engine _ utilities, transportation, financial systems and
other essential services, tiny fiber optic threads might carry

   ``Fourth, and directly connected to cyberwarfare and
proliferation, terrorism.

<P>
   ``There is a common identity to many of these threats. It should
surprise no one that the most viciously anti-democratic regimes,
the rogue states, are the chief proliferators; the major exporters
of terrorism; the main instigators of regional and ethnic
conflicts. From the Persian Gulf to the Korean Peninsula to the
Balkans, rogue states are the main threat to peace and freedom, and
they require a strong, comprehensive policy response, a policy of
`rogue state rollback.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We must use both public and private diplomacy, targeted
economic measures and military assistance to aid forces seeking
freedom from rogue regimes. ``But we must be prepared to back up
these measures with American military force when the continued
existence of such rogue states threatens America's interests and
values. And, most importantly, state sponsors of terrorism must
know not the specifics of our response, but the certainty that it
will be swift and sure.''

NEW PRESSURE ON GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Dec. 8: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration Tuesday threatened a lawsuit against
gun manufacturers on behalf of the three million people who live in
public housing projects long plagued by gun violence. The threat
followed last week's ruling by an Illinois state judge that an
innovative private lawsuit against gun manufacturers could proceed,
despite heavy industry pressure to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these actions provided a positive counterpoint
to yet another school shooting episode, this one in Gibson, Okla.,
where a seventh grader wounded four schoolmates on Monday. The
attack, in which no one was killed, reaffirmed the grim fact that
there are too many weapons floating around American society _ one
for nearly every man, woman and child _ and that these weapons are
all too accessible to the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   There was hope last spring that Congress would react to the
massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado by approving measures
aimed at keeping weapons out of the wrong hands. But Republican
leaders, unwilling to buck the National Rifle Association and its
sizable political donations, made sure that Congress adjourned
without doing anything on gun control _ creating a big issue for
debate in the presidential and congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is now reason to believe that pending public and
private litigation against the gun industry may succeed in wresting
from gun makers at least some of the reforms that Congress has
refused to entertain, much less pass. The central argument in the
Illinois suit is that the firearms industry has created a public
nuisance by negligently distributing its products. That argument
makes it similar to cases brought by Chicago and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ruling is not a binding precedent in any other suit.
But according to David Kairys, a Temple University Law School
professor, this and other recent rulings signify that the courts
are not going to follow Congress' lead in exempting the gun
industry from the rules of civil responsibility that apply to other
consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Thus pressure is growing on gun makers to negotiate a settlement
that includes steps like personalizing guns so only their rightful
owner can fire them, reforming gun distribution practices and
barring handgun sales at gun shows and on the Internet. That is a
prospect that Americans anxious to prevent more school shootings
can only applaud.

<P>
   Robert A. Swanson, who co-founded Genentech Inc. and is
considered the father of the biotechnology industry, died Monday at
his home in Hillsborough, Calif. after a yearlong battle with brain
cancer. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson was a 29-year-old venture capitalist in 1976 when he
started Genentech, the first company formed to exploit the then new
technology of genetic engineering. Now, there are more than 1,000
biotechnology companies in the United States alone, but Genentech
has remained one of the two or three most successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people started companies,'' said David Botstein,
chairman of the genetics department at Stanford University and a
former vice president of Genentech. ``Not so many invented
industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson served as Genentech's chief executive from its founding
until 1990, then served as the company's chairman until the end of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech scored many firsts in the biotechnology industry. In
1977, it produced the first human protein by splicing a gene into
bacteria. It created the first drug produced by genetic
engineering, human insulin, which it licensed to Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.
for treatment of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first biotechnology company to sell its own
drug, human growth hormone, for treatment of children whose own
bodies do not produce enough of the hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Another big drug developed by Genentech was tissue plasminogen
activator, or TPA, which helps restore blood flow after heart
attacks and is credited with saving countless lives.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech was also the first biotechnology company to sell
shares to the public, in 1980. The stock soared after trading
started, similar to the way Internet stocks do today.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Swanson grew up in Florida, the son of an Eastern Air
Lines employee, and earned degrees in chemistry and management from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined Citicorp
Venture Capital in New York and was transferred to San Francisco.
He then joined the venture capital firm now known as Kleiner,
Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers.
</P>
<P>
   Gene-splicing technology, which allows genes to be transferred
from one organism to another, had been developed in the early 1970s
by Dr. Herbert W. Boyer of the University of California at San
Francisco and Stanley Cohen of Stanford. But there were doubts in
the academic and financial communities and in the drug industry
whether the technology could be used commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson persuaded Boyer to meet with him for 10 minutes. So
taken was Boyer by the young man's vision and enthusiasm that the
meeting stretched to three hours at a local pub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes this brash young entrepreneur filled with
enthusiasm and ideas and ready to go,'' Boyer recalled. ``I
recognized right away that he had the drive and the
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men started Genentech in April 1976, and it is widely
considered the first biotechnology company. Another biotechnology
company, the Cetus Corp., was formed five years earlier, but its
focus was not initially on gene-splicing, which is known more
formally as recombinant DNA technology.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson built a strong scientific team by recruiting from
universities. Scientists could publish their work, something most
big drug companies were reluctant to allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He legitimized the idea that these academics could be
participants in a company without compromising their standards,''
said George Rathmann, who co-founded Amgen Inc., another leading
biotechnology company, and is now chairman of the Icos Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech, based in South San Francisco, fostered an informal
atmosphere, with Friday afternoon themed parties known as ho-hos.
On the Hawaiian theme days, Swanson would attend wearing a grass
skirt and dance the hula.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Swanson was extremely hard driving and demanding. ``If
you told him that doing something violated a law of physics, he'd
tell you the law must be wrong and you'd almost believe it,'' said
Arthur D. Levinson, the current chairman and chief executive of
Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   The company's aggressive attitude, particularly in marketing its
drugs, sometimes generated controversy. Hospitals complained about
pressure on them to buy TPA when a similar heart attack drug was
available from another company at a far lower price. And in April,
Genentech agreed to pay $50 million to settle federal criminal
charges that it had marketed human growth hormone for unapproved
uses from 1985 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Genentech agreed to pay $200 million to the
University of California at San Francisco to settle a patent
infringement lawsuit stemming from the development of human growth
hormone in the company's early days. One former company scientist
testified at the trial that he had stolen material from the
university, though Genentech denied it had used the material in
developing its drug.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Genentech agreed to sell 60 percent of its stock to
Roche Holding Ltd., the Swiss drug giant, for $2.1 billion. This
year, Roche bought the rest of Genentech it did not own but then
sold shares to the public again.
</P>
<P>
   Since retiring from Genentech's board in 1996, Swanson has
invested in start-up companies on his own. He was chairman of
Tularik Inc., a biotechnology company planning to sell stock to the
public for the first time this week. William J. Rieflin, Tularik's
general counsel, said it is not yet clear whether the public
offering would be postponed because of Swanson's death.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson was involved in numerous civic and academic activities,
serving on various advisory councils at MIT, and as a trustee of
the San Francisco Ballet and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But friends said he was a private person who took pride in
coaching the soccer teams of his two daughters, Katie, 16, and
Erica, 11. They and his wife, Judy Church Swanson, survive him, as
does his mother, Arline Swanson of Foster City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that after the diagnosis of a brain tumor a little
more than a year ago, Swanson was very aggressive in seeking
treatment. But the type of tumor he had is almost always fatal,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ironies here is he devoted so much of his life to
applying this technology to generate medical breakthroughs, drugs
that saved countless lives,'' Levinson said. ``But unfortunately,
his wasn't one of them.''

JUDGE SIDES WITH BILLIONAIRE ON CHILD SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By JAMES BARRON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another chapter in the long-running case of
Anonymous vs. Anonymous _ the not-so-anonymous child-support case
involving the billionaire financier Ronald Perelman and his former
wife, Patricia Duff _ a judge ruled on Tuesday that Perelman would
have to pay $12,825 a month to raise their 4-year-old daughter,
Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   To put that figure in perspective, it is $825 a month more than
Perelman had been paying, but $119,175 a month less than Ms. Duff
had asked for.
</P>
<P>
   In a 22-page decision laced with words like ``absurd'' and
``rubbish,'' the judge, Franklin R. Weissberg of State Supreme
Court in Manhattan, rejected Ms. Duff's demands for as much as
$132,000 a month in child support.
</P>
<P>
   Before announcing the $12,825 figure, Weissberg said he hoped
that Ms. Duff and Perelman could teach Caleigh ``to value people
for who they are, not what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother's argument assumes that only material things matter
in the life of a child, and that if Caleigh is denied any
imaginable luxury, she will be emotionally damaged,'' the judge
wrote. ``It does not require a degree in psychiatry to know that
this assumption is rubbish. There are far more important things in
the life of a young child than private jets, yachts, obsequious
staffs and pandering guests. The reality is that Caleigh will never
suffer a shortage of material comforts.''
</P>
<P>
   After initially refusing to comment on the decision, Ms. Duff
said later: ``This has never been about money. It's just, you know,
that I want what's best for my child.''
</P>
<P>
   A Perelman spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein, would say only,
``Justice Weissberg's decision speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff's many lawyers _ she has had more than 20 since the
case began _ have argued that she cannot afford the same expenses
for Caleigh that Perelman paid while he and Ms. Duff were married.
</P>
<P>
   Weissberg found that Perelman does makes more than Ms. Duff _
Perelman's income ranges from $40 million to $60 million a year,
the judge said, while Ms. Duff's is about $2.4 million a year. (The
judge said Perelman's net worth varied from $5 billion to $9
billion and that Ms. Duff's net worth is ``approximately $24
million.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said that ``in every significant aspect of her
life, Caleigh now enjoys the same opportunities and high standard
of living as she would have if the marriage had not dissolved.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Duff's argument that the couple's financial
differences would affect Caleigh's ``self-image and psychological
well-being,'' the judge said: ``There is not a shred of evidence in
the record to support these conclusions. What little there is, is
to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that Perelman had been paying $12,000 a month in
child support, but that Perelman had argued that Ms. Duff was
spending no more than $5,000 a month on Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Weissberg said Ms. Duff had never submitted her expense records
to the court. ``Her failure to do so was obviously deliberate,''
the judge said, ``and creates a very strong inference that she did
not do so because she cannot credibly challenge the father's
contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff, who lives in a $30,000-a-month apartment in the
Waldorf Towers, had argued that Caleigh would be hurt emotionally
if she realized that she was living on less than her half-sister
Samantha. Samantha is Perelman's 8-year-old daughter from his
earlier marriage to Claudia Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Ms. Duff said that she needed $4,400 a day for the
next 14 years, or $132,000 a month, for child support. That was
substantially higher than the $87,000 a month she requested in a
June 1998 affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff's lawyer, Richard D. Emery, would not discuss the
decision. Rita Warner, who represented Ms. Duff until she was
disqualified by the court, called the figure ``much too low'' and
added, ``Husbands with far less income and assets pay far more.''

 &HT;    Daft's son says dad wanted to see world
 &HT;    (EDS: USE THIS VERSION _ previous version KILLED by Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next boss of the world's biggest soft drink
company didn't join the corporation 30 years ago to sell more
Coca-Colas.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Daft, who grew up in a small coal-mining city in
Australia, just wanted to see the world, says his 21-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad had always wanted a chance to travel overseas,'' says
Nicholas Daft, a senior majoring in Asian studies at a college in
the Northeast. ``I don't think he had ever traveled out of
Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick's father phoned him at his dorm room Saturday morning to
say it looked like he would be getting a new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh really?'
</P>
<P>
   ```Yes. Mr. Ivester is retiring, and he asked me to be
chairman.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was very emotional,'' Nick said. ``It was something
that my dad had not expected at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think was how proud I was of my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coca-Cola board held a special meeting the next day to vote
on the changes, and on Monday, the company announced Ivester's
planned retirement and Daft's selection as his eventual
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't working at Coke with the desire to be chairman,''
Nick said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the son's descriptions of his 56-year-old father,
Coca-Cola's next leader appears to be unlike Ivester, a former
company accountant who often works seven days a week and publicly
shows few interests outside of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nick says his father works hard during the week, ``but for him,
weekends are times for him to enjoy himself.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been easy lately. As head of Coca-Cola's Middle and
Far East Group, Daft has spent the last two years trying to undo
the company's troubles in nations where economies have been on the
slide. He travels two or three weeks a month and endures three or
four days of jet lag each time he returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has traveled more in the last couple of years than he ever
has,'' Nick said. ``My mother (Delphine) has traveled with him and
that has made it a lot easier for my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   In a management restructuring in October, Ivester gave Daft
additional responsibilities to head operations in Africa and at the
new Schweppes Beverage Division. This week Daft was promoted to
president and chief operating officer, and the board indicated he
will become chairman and chief executive officer in April.
</P>
<P>
   Nick said his father likes to joke around, but one thing
particulary irks him: People giving up when faced with difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done that a couple times. My dad is a big believer in
just sticking with something.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Daft fly-fishes with a passion: in Utah, in the
Northeast near his son's college and in Switzerland, where the
family owns a chalet and has often spent summers and Christmas
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 42, Douglas Daft began taking ski lessons so that he
could join his children, Nick and Alexandra, on the slopes.
Alexandra, now 26, is married and works at a department store in
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The family remains close, according to the son.
</P>
<P>
   Daft and his wife see their children regularly. They have
visited their son at college six times just since September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time for me to have a good meal out of the dining
hall,'' Nick said. But they don't go to college bars. ``My dad is
usually asleep by 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick describes his father's upbringing in New South Wales as
middle class. Douglas Daft's parents owned a shoe store near the
city of Cessnock about two hours north of Sydney in eastern
Australia. It's a community where the dominant coal mining industry
has been on the wane for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked hard'' is the message Nick has gotten about his
grandparents. But it wasn't all sweat. Douglas Daft played piano
and, along with a friend, would trot out show tunes at a local
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt he would do well in life,'' said Daft's
80-year-old mother, Bessie, who still lives in Australia, ``because
of the way he went from better to better.'' Daft also called his
``mum'' about the good news. She told the Australian press she
``went wobbly at the knees'' after learning of the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Daft encourages his son to do well at school, ``but he said
sometimes he himself didn't do quite as much work as he should have
done'' in college. After college, the elder Daft got a job as a
math and science teacher at a high school in Sydney. It was there
that he met Delphine, a French teacher, whom he would later marry.
</P>
<P>
   Daft joined Coca-Cola as a planner in Sydney, but it led to a
life on the road for him and his family. Nick was born in Hong
Kong, his sister in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The family later moved to Japan, then to Atlanta, when Daft got
a promotion eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the travel and the many countries, Nick said his
father repeated a basic motto: ``Be kind with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to business, his father was proudest of his success
in building up Coca-Cola's sales in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is just a hard worker who has confidence in what he is
doing,'' Nick said. ``But he will listen to other people's
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Daft has most often sought counsel from retired
Coca-Cola President Donald Keogh and Steve Weiss, a longtime friend
and consultant to Coca-Cola who came to Atlanta around the same
time as Daft and his family.
</P>
<P>
   As for his father's new job, Nick said, ``I think my dad just
wants to restore the confidence in Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that it really is a great product, that it serves
a great purpose.''

   PHOENIX - As midnight nears in Arizona on New Year's Eve, FAA
chief Jane Garvey will fly over the Four Corners region in
virtually empty skies.
</P>
<P>
   Her flight, aimed at reassuring travelers that Y2K glitches
won't cause planes to fall out of the sky, will have little
commercial air traffic to contend with as airlines scale back their
flight schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Paul Takemoto said the
agency doesn't expect anything more alarming on the flight than a
popping cork from Champagne smuggled aboard by reporters cover ing
Garvey's trip.
</P>
<P>
   Still, flights will be scarce as the new millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   That's because airlines are scaling back their schedules by 20
to 30 percent over New Year's. But U.S. carriers insist it's not
because of Y2K-related fears of flying. Instead, the abbreviated
flight schedules reflect a normal dropoff in demand over the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Patterns for air travel this year are fairly typical of previous
New Years when the holiday fell on the week end, according to
Southwest Air lines spokeswoman Melanie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Southwest, which has a heavy presence in Phoenix,
is reducing its schedule 27 percent on New Year's Eve and about 35
per cent on Jan. 1, including a 10-hour shutdown, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline will park its planes at 10 p.m. Dec. 31 and resume
flying at 8 a.m. on Jan. 1, affecting about 167 flights, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West, the dominant carrier in Phoenix, is
reducing its schedule by as much as 30 percent, according to Bill
McGlashen, president of America West's flight attendants union.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials did not return repeated phone calls about
the airline's holiday flight schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-based Mesa Air Group, which operates America West Ex
press and U.S. Airways Express, will shut down from about 10 p.m.
Dec. 31 to 8 a.m. Jan. 1, according to Ron Brady, director of
planning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reduced demand, according to airline industry offi
cials, is due to companies requiring employees to work or be close
to their offices to cope with any Y2K issues that crop up. Another
factor is the perceived price gouging for millennium celebrations
and hotels requiring minimum four-day stays over the holiday
weekend, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody seems overly con cerned about'' Y2K-related flight
problems, said Ken Van Epps, owner of Moon Valley Travel in
Phoenix. ``I've heard more com plaints about what it costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in traveling over New Year's has been steadily
increasing, said spokeswoman Sophie Bethune of the Air Transport
Association, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Just under half those polled in June 1998 expected major
problems with air travel over the millennium. That declined to 19
percent in September, Bethune said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's more of a millen nium issue than Y2K fears.''
she said of reduced demand. ``People want to be down on the ground
with their families or seeing the new year in with a bang.''
</P>
<P>
   To allay remaining Y2K fears, the aviation agency's Garvey is
sched uled to fly on American Airlines from Washington, D.C., to
Dallas on New Year's Eve and then on to San Francisco, arriving
just after mid night local time.
</P>
<P>
   She will leave Washington's Reagan National Airport at 5:10 p.m.
EST and will be in the air at the critical time for airline and air
traffic control computers. Those systems run on Greenwich Mean
Time. Midnight Greenwich Mean Time is 5 p.m. Arizona time.
</P>
<P>
   Her flight could take her over northern Arizona or southern
Utah, depending on the weather, at about midnight Arizona time,
according to John Hotard of American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation agency spokesman Take moto, who will be on the flight,
ridiculed the doom and gloom scenarios for air travel, saying he
has absolutely no safety concerns. He expects to be celebrating New
Year's in San Francisco with his 103-year-old grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all scratching our heads over the prediction of planes
falling out of the sky and half the nation's air fleet grounded,''
he said. The dire warning ``assumed a life of its own and somehow
obtained a currency that's not based in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said last month that there are no Y2K problems that
should keep any of the major U.S. airlines from complying with
safety standards on Jan. 1, though there have been concerns about
some international travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very sure our opera tions will be safe,'' Jones said
about Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   United, Delta, American and other carriers have said they are
cutting back their schedules, primar ily because of reduced demand.
</P>
<P>
   American is cutting its schedule 20 percent on Dec. 31, up from
about 10 percent last year, and will fly 95 percent of its flights
on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   United spokeswoman Kristina Price said the nation's largest
carrier is reducing its daily schedule of nearly 2,400 flights by
22 percent on Dec. 31 and 12 percent on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines said it has canceled 10 international and
about 400 of its domestic flights for Dec. 31-Jan. 1 because of
lower demand. spokeswoman Kathy Peach said. &QL;

<P>
   The young man on the elevator was unhappy and vocal about it.
This was at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh last week after the
Penguins lost by 5-2 to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barrasso really stunk tonight,'' the man said, referring to
Tom Barrasso, the Penguin goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he recognized a fellow passenger: the Hall of Famer
Mario Lemieux, the best player in Penguins history, a personal
friend of Barrasso's and now the principal owner of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry!'' the fan said, but Lemieux remained gracious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're entitled,'' he told the fan.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Lemieux elaborated. ``They pay their money, they
have their opinions,'' he said. ``I respect that.'' And Lemieux
does not want to alienate any paying customers from a team with an
8-13-3-4 record before playing the Devils Tuesday night in the
Meadowlands. Only 11,485 attended last week's home game against the
Sharks in the 16,958-seat building nicknamed the Igloo.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pittsburgh's smallest crowd this season and a big hint of
how tough a job Lemieux assumed in September after a settlement in
Bankruptcy Court. Lemieux exchanged about $30 million owed to him
for control of the business. He recruited 10 other investors to put
up $50 million more, but he still seeks another $15 million. With
the help of judges and elected officials, Lemieux and his aides
renegotiated their arena lease and their local television contract.
Although Lemieux says the Penguins should break even this season,
it is widely believed that their future depends on a new arena to
replace the current one, which was built in 1961 and is the oldest
in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux has faced big challenges before. In a 12-year career
that produced 613 goals and 881 assists in 745 games, Lemieux
survived Hodgkin's disease and back surgeries along with the
slashes, hooks, holds and trips of legions of defenders. Now 34 and
in his third season of retirement, Lemieux is a rookie again,
viewing the Igloo and the franchise's fortunes from a big window of
a business suite across Center Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a learning process,'' Lemieux said from behind
the desk in his lightly furnished corner office. On this day, from
this view, only bright, blue sky could be seen above the arena's
curved, white roof. ``I've adjusted pretty well,'' he said. ``It
was very important that I bring in some people who know how to run
a business and I can learn from these people.''
</P>
<P>
   He works in his office five days a week, except for Monday
afternoons, when he teaches his 3-year-old son to skate. He attends
most home games with his children and some of the road games alone.
He often visits the locker room. He meets once a week with the
three other members of his executive committee _ Craig Patrick, who
has been the general manager for 10 years; Tom Rooney, the chief
operating officer, who returned to the franchise at Lemieux's
urging; and Ken Sawyer, the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux seems to be the type of executive who is smart enough to
know what he doesn't know and to hire those who do. He never went
beyond the 10th grade and he spoke little English until he was
drafted by the Penguins in 1984. But Lemieux has shown a canny
intelligence both on and off the ice. His English flows with only a
slight accent of French from his native Montreal. He speaks in
complex, confident sentences, although he rarely volunteers more
thoughts or words than required. Talk, dark and handsome, Lemieux
can seem, in close quarters, both alert and aloof, projecting the
same tense energy in a business suit that he used to exude in his
hockey uniform. His personal charisma in the community could be
essential to the survival of the franchise and to the protection of
his own financial stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a bright young man and a quick study on
everything,'' Patrick said. ``He doesn't meddle. He doesn't call me
and say, `Craig, you should do this or that.' Or, `What the heck's
going on here?' But he likes me to talk to him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the financial dealings, Rooney said: ``Mario's instincts
are extremely good. He could have had additional revenue fairly
easily, but he is very selective about the company that he wants to
keep. He is by no means groveling.''
</P>
<P>
   The bookcases and shelves of Lemieux's office were almost bare.
Outside, the reception lobby seemed more like a shrine to Lemieux,
the walls filled with pictures. One showed him shaking hands at the
White House with President Bush after the Penguins won the first of
their two consecutive Stanley Cup championships in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of those teammates are still with Pittsburgh, but
many current Penguins played either with or against Lemieux in his
final season, 1996-97. Jaromir Jagr, a rookie in the first
championship season, has inherited the captain's C from Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, there is no difference,'' said Jagr, the NHL's most
valuable player last season, when asked how Lemieux has changed
since then. ``I don't look at him like an owner. I look at him like
a player and a friend I played with.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kevin Constantine, coaching Lemieux's Pittsburgh hockey team
is not like managing George Steinbrenner's New York baseball team.
``He's come in and been supportive and available, but pretty
removed from the day-to-day hockey operations,'' Constantine said
of Lemieux. ``I think he's concentrated more on the business
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Kovalev, the right wing, said of Lemieux: ``You see him
a lot. He comes into the locker room and brings his kids.
Everybody's happy to be back in Pittsburgh again because nobody
knew where we were going to end up. In the summertime, we were kind
of guessing where we were going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   That was because Roger Marino, the team's third owner of the
decade, had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Lemieux
rejected Marino's offer of a settlement for less than he was owed.
A move of the franchise was a possibility. So was folding the team
and selling the assets. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz
assigned another bankruptcy judge, M. Bruce McCullough, as a
mediator, and the creative solution to the bankruptcy was worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing came at a bad time for the league's image.
Bruce McNall, the former owner of the Los Angeles Kings and
chairman of the NHL board of governors, had just gone to prison for
financial fraud. John Spano's brief stint as owner of the Islanders
had ended in a bank and wire fraud indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux said he agreed with recently published figures that show
the franchise value as $100 million, 20th in a 28-team league, with
a debt of $23 million. ``Pretty low, compared to other teams,'' he
said of the debt. ``A lot of people thought we were crazy to get
involved with the team, but I was always optimistic we could make
the right deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, whose desk had many sheets of paper with numbers on
them, said his administration had reduced the ticket prices of many
seats but that the full-season subscriber base ``is up only by a
few hundred.''
</P>
<P>
   With a smile, Lemieux acknowledged that he had asked Michael
Jordan, a golfing buddy, ``five or six times'' to invest in the
Penguins and that Jordan, the former basketball star, had turned
him down. Speaking of his own investment, Lemieux said: ``I forgave
the company $7.5 million, I took $20 million in debt and put in $5
million of my own money on top of that. That's how much I believe
in this franchise. I've been involved with this franchise for 15
years. I believe in this city. The team has made some bad deals in
the past. We were able, through bankruptcy court, to rectify a lot
of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern for the franchise will be getting a new
arena. Rooney, a nephew of Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney
and first cousin of the current Steelers owner Dan Rooney, said
that with separate baseball and football stadiums being built for
the Pirates and Steelers, the Penguins' strategy would be to
patiently wait for a critical mass of momentum to merge with
positive feelings toward Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the new buildings open, there will be a crescendo of warm
and fuzzy feelings,'' Rooney predicted. ``What else do we need?
They'll look at our 40-year-old building and say, `How does that
present Pittsburgh for the next millennium?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest challenge is measuring Mario out in small parts,''
Rooney said. ``He's got an aura about him. When somebody adopts
Pittsburgh the way Mario has, it solidifies your own
self-confidence in your environment. In this town, he's a
quasi-biblical character. People just want to touch his cloak.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every year since John Lennon was shot to death on
Dec. 8, 1980, fans have held an all-night memorial in Central Park,
singing his lyrics of peace and freedom within earshot of the
Dakota, the West Side apartment building where Lennon lived.
</P>
<P>
   But organizers of the annual memorials, at a mosaic circle
bearing the title of one of Lennon's songs, ``Imagine,'' complain
that in recent years the city has broken up the vigils at 1 a.m.,
and that heavy police patrols have brought an intimidating presence
to an event honoring a musician who championed freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, organizers of the vigil have circulated
petitions and have held news conferences calling for a suspension
of the curfew. But city officials, citing safety concerns and a
``carnival atmosphere,'' remain adamant that the Lennon mourners
will have to pack up their flowers, candles and acoustic guitars
Wednesday night and leave Strawberry Fields promptly at 1.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas K. Leighton, a founder of the John Lennon Memorial
Committee, said the memorials had traditionally been late-night
events in historical deference to the night Lennon died, when
mourning fans began gathering outside the Dakota, at 72nd Street
and Central Park West, around 11 p.m., soon after they heard the
news that Lennon had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time-specific event,'' Leighton said. ``History doesn't
choose when things happen. It ends when people are finished
mourning and praying and reflecting on his memory. Can you imagine
an event honoring the memory of John Lennon that ends when the
police decide to break it up? I mean, this is a vigil, not a
party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy wouldn't suggest holding midnight Mass earlier on
Christmas Eve because it's a safer, would he?'' Leighton asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's press office referred requests for
comment to the Parks Department. Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern
said Leighton and the organizers of the petition driver were
seizing the anniversary of the death as an opportunity to cast
themselves as freedom crusaders and the mayor as an authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 1 to 6 a.m. curfew had curtailed ``the carnival
atmosphere, with drinking and pot smoking, that was common at the
customary all-nighters'' that developed out of earlier Lennon
vigils.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made this an occasion for bashing the mayor and an
excuse to drag in the ghost of John Lennon,'' Stern said. ``If they
wish to gather and sing until 1 a.m., fine, but to have a macabre
commemoration of an assassination as an all-night pot party is not
only disrespectful to the park, but an insult to John Lennon. I
think he'd rather have people commemorate his birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he too was a John Lennon fan. As a city councilman he
sponsored a law in 1981 creating Strawberry Fields, and in 1985 as
parks commissioner he helped with plans to build the memorial
mosaic. He said the critics were in a minority.
</P>
<P>
   Candido Bonilla, another organizer of the vigil, disputed
Stern's statements about safety. ``In 18 years we've never had one
incident,'' said Bonilla, 38, a jazz trumpet player. ``There used
to only be one or two cops there, but every year since Mayor
Giuliani took office, the police have stormed in and kicked
everyone out of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Police vehicles, Bonilla complained, now surround the vigil and
shine spotlights and headlights on the mourners.

WHEN CORPORATE WORLDS COLLIDE: EXXON'S DECISION ON BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long after the layoffs, corporate mergers often create another
type of employee fallout: unhappiness over policies that change
because the acquiring company has a much different way of doing
things than the acquired one.
</P>
<P>
   While conflicts of corporate culture are usually thought of as
something that occurs in the executive suite, they can have a more
down-to-earth effect, like how much a company contributes to
charities and civic groups, where it moves its headquarters and
what benefits it offers employees. For example, employees of
Warner-Lambert are anxiously watching to see who wins the battle
for their company: Pfizer Inc., which analysts say has the best
rank-and-file benefits in the pharmaceutical industry, or the
American Home Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the process of melding the different cultures that
are Exxon, the conservative, tight-lipped Texas oil company, and
Mobil, its more outgoing Virginia-based merger partner, began
creating a firestorm. Gay rights advocates publicized a move by
Exxon Mobil, the name of the new company, to revoke a Mobil policy
that provided health care coverage to the partners of newly hired
gay employees.
</P>
<P>
   The action goes against a trend of private and public employers
increasingly offering such ``domestic partner'' benefits, though
gay rights activists note that 85 percent of large United States
companies still do not offer such health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   They credit Lucio Noto, the former Mobil chairman and now Exxon
Mobil's vice chairman, for pushing Mobil to adopt what they
consider to have been gay-friendly policies. ``Mobil took the lead
in trying to be sensitive to employee needs,'' said David M. Smith,
communications director for the Human Rights Campaign, the gay
rights advocacy group in Washington that publicized the Exxon Mobil
policy on domestic partner benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, advocates note that earlier this year Exxon
shareholders voted down a proposal at the company's annual meeting
that would have forced the company to offer domestic partner
benefits. The proposal, which Exxon's board recommended be
defeated, failed by a 16-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   In the new company, former Exxon executives will have the lion's
share of the key jobs, including more than two-thirds of the board
seats and roughly three of every four senior officer positions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Cirigliano, a company spokesman, the decision
to revoke Mobil's domestic partner policy for new employees _ those
who are already covered will get to keep their benefits _ was made
by members of a human resources transition team and approved by a
management transition team.
</P>
<P>
   Cirigliano said none of those executives were available for
comment. Employees learned of the policy in meetings during the
last week, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cirigliano said that the same transition teams also decided to
provide several benefits more generous than what Mobil had offered,
including bigger pensions and 401(k) contributions for many
workers. And he challenged the idea that the two companies were all
that different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultures in so many ways are so much alike,'' he said,
including both companies' attitudes about wringing efficiencies
from the business and maximizing returns for shareholders. Both
companies, Cirigliano added, have always had ``very strong
commitments to the communities we're in.''

COMMITTEE BLOCKS RELEASE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON FEDERAL
JUDGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Days before an Internet news service was to put the
financial disclosure forms of all 1,600 federal judges on the World
Wide Web, the chairman of a special committee of judges has blocked
the release of the information and says the panel will review the
matter this week.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Redmond, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the
Courts, said that while the information had been generally
available to people who applied as individuals, several judges had
become concerned that a wholesale dissemination of it could
threaten their security.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, William J. Zloch, a federal trial judge in Florida
who is chairman of the Committee on Financial Disclosure for the
Judicial Conference, the governing body of the federal courts,
ordered last week that the release of the records to the Internet
service, APBnews.com, be barred.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Zloch put a hold on some three dozen other such
requests, from individuals and groups, and called a meeting for
Friday in Washington, where the committee, composed of 15 sitting
judges, will discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Like high-ranking officials in both the legislative and
executive branches, federal judges have been required by law since
1979 to report all family assets within broad ranges of estimated
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Redmond explained that until now, a request by an individual
for a judge's financial disclosure form led to the judge's being
notified before the information was released. A judge who
considered the applicant a possible security threat could have the
file edited to eliminate information that might be used to locate
him or his family.
</P>
<P>
   If the financial disclosure data was put on the Web, Ms. Redmond
said, those who see it could not be screened as they are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about the security of the procedures,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   All this seems overstated to Bob Port, a senior editor at
APBnews.com, whose site features criminal-law issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``On its face, the security concerns sound reasonable,'' Port
said. But in fact, he said, there is little information in the
forms that could be used to threaten a judge. The forms do not show
home addresses or telephone numbers, for instance, although among
the things that officials are obliged to disclose on them are the
general locations of assets like mountain or lake cottages that
produce income.
</P>
<P>
   Port also said the practice of notifying judges of the identity
of those seeking access to the forms only discouraged people like
litigants and lawyers, who, he said, have a legitimate need to see
them, to check for judges' conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Port and his colleagues at APBnews.com requested the disclosure
forms last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Port explained that publishing the forms seemed a helpful thing
to do as it would allow lawyers and litigants to look at the forms
``without being intimidated by the knowledge that the judge would
know they had requested it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, APBnews.com mailed a check for $2,516 to cover the
cost of copying 12,580 pages of documents.

   ``We had everything ready to put it into the system this week,''
Port said. ``We had equipment to scan the pages and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges' financial disclosure statements have, by law, been
available to the public in the same fashion as the forms for
cabinet officers, senior administration officials, members of
Congress and some of their senior aides.
</P>
<P>
   But judges generally consider themselves to be entitled to
greater privacy than those in the other branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a long history of being reluctant to give out
information,'' said Port. ``I understand that it's an invasion of
privacy, but unfortunately, they're in public service, they have a
job for life and this comes with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress amended the law to allow judges to withhold
information temporarily for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Redmond said the congressional action explicitly recognizes
the security dimensions when it comes to the disclosure of judges'
finances.

   George McGovern, the 1972 Demo cratic presidential candidate,
wrote a bum essay the other day that deserves attention. &QL; 
Not for the argument he makes _ a tortured defense of Lyndon John
son's presidency _ but for remind ing us of a vital attribute of
presidential leadership as we survey the current crop of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That attribute is the ability to admit mistakes and change
course, the kind of open-mindedness that LBJ's oversized ego didn't
allow.
</P>
<P>
   I always liked McGovern, a decent and thoughtful Midwesterner.
When Richard Nixon beat his brains out in the '72 election _
McGovern carried only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia _
I thought the better man lost.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern's views were too left for most Americans, but even if
you didn't buy his liberalism you could respect his principled
opposition to the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   He recognized then what most historians agree on today: The
costly war was a colossal mistake. He properly chastised both
Johnson and Nixon for their handling of it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, writing in Sunday's New York Times, McGovern praised LBJ's
domestic record and let him off the hook on Vietnam because he
didn't start it and because of doubts Johnson voiced on White House
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been up to Lyndon Johnson, we would not have gone
into Vietnam in the first place,'' McGovern wrote. ``It would be a
historic tragedy if his outstanding domestic record remained
forever obscured by his involvement in a war he did not begin and
did not know how to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern said he was motivated by a recent speech by economist
John Kenneth Galbraith, who lauded Johnson and lamented that the
Vietnam War has ``become the totally defining event of those
years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to McGovern, the White House tapes show that John son
had ``terrible doubts and re grets'' even while he was escalating
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with national-security ad viser McGeorge Bundy in May
1964, Johnson said, ``I don't think it's worth fighting for, and I
don't think that we can get out. It's just the biggest damn mess I
ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation the same day with Georgia Sen. Richard
Russell, LBJ talked about how he would feel if one man he knew, a
sergeant with six kids, was ordered to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what the hell are we going to get out of his doing it?''
Johnson said. ``It just makes the chills run up my back.''
</P>
<P>
   While such comments strike Mc Govern as evidence of Johnson's
humanity, they lead me to respect his presidency less. Sending thou
sands of Americans to die in a war he was convinced had to be
fought is one thing. Sending them into a war he didn't think worth
fighting is something else and morally indefen sible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me think worse of him that he had these serious
doubts and didn't act,'' said Ken Goldstein, assistant professor of
political sci ence at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's honorable to express doubts, but not to continue to
pursue a policy that you know in your heart is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to disengage, Johnson chose to rationalize his
decisions and demonize his critics. When members of his
administration tried to warn him that enlarging the war would be a
mistake, Johnson considered them disloyal and kept them out of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   LBJ's grandiose self-image didn't leave much room for reversing
policy decisions. He saw himself as a larger-than-life character, a
presi dent who accomplished things lesser leaders couldn't pull
off. His record for getting things done in Congress was
unparalleled. Winning in Viet nam would have been one more coonskin
to nail on the wall of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   As this year's presidential candi dates talk up their
credentials, voters would do well to remember LBJ, a large and
forceful man with many political strengths. Being big enough to
change his mind when it counted most wasn't one of them. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ira Johnson on Tuesday stood in the dingy ring at
Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn where her son, Stephan, had trained for
his last fight, a bout that led to his death on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She talked about her son's fascination with boxing, how she had
begged him to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephan once told me, `Stop asking me to quit boxing,''' Ira
Johnson said as the cacophony of the gym became a respectful hush.
``He said: `I have never been to jail. I never done drugs. So just
let me pursue my passion.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tearful memorial held by the family of Stephan Johnson,
the Brooklyn-born fighter who died of head injuries that he
received in a bout on Nov. 20 in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remained on Tuesday about Johnson's medical
condition when he stepped into the ring and whether boxing
officials in at least three states had erred in allowing him to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the questions, his family is not considering a lawsuit,
said Mercer Cook, an investment banker who has served as a
spokesman for the family.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the neurosurgeon who cared for Johnson, 31, for 15
days at the Atlantic City Medical Center has told the family that
there was no clear evidence of a previous injury to Johnson's brain
before he suffered the coma in his last bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not blaming anyone for what happened,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of fighters in sweats, some with their hands wrapped in
tape, some with faces bearing the scars of past bouts, stopped
their workouts for a few minutes on Tuesday to listen to Johnson's
mother and his fiancee talk about his love of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's fiancee, Bonnie Smith, said Johnson was a man ``rich
in goodness'' who had influenced many people through his devotion
to boxing and his teaching at the Equinox Health Club. She broke
into tears when she said the measure of a man's life was not the
number of years he lived, but the number of people he touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephan prepared for this last fight as if it was his first,''
Smith said. ``He never gave up his dream of being a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Paul Vaden, the boxer who knocked Johnson out in Atlantic
City, sent a message, saying Johnson ``was a champion who now
belongs to the sanctioning body of God.'' Vaden's manager, Elvis
Phillips, then gave Ira Johnson a ceremonial champion's belt from
the International Boxing Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a journeyman fighter who perennially had been one fight
away from becoming a contender, won the IBO's middleweight title
last year when he upset Sam Garr but had never received a belt.
Teary-eyed and surprised, his mother held the belt up.
</P>
<P>
   While the family tried to put the best face on Johnson's death,
some of the fighters muttered that Johnson should not have been
allowed to fight in Atlantic City. Several questioned whether the
state boxing commissions had been diligent in looking into
Johnson's medical history after he was knocked out in Toronto last
April.
</P>
<P>
   In that fight, against Fitz Vanderpool, Johnson dropped his
hands, staggered backward and lost consciousness after receiving
what appeared to be several light blows. He had to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have been allowed to fight,'' said Edwin Viruet,
a lightweight boxer. ``If he fainted over there, why did they
accept him over here?''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether he had an brain injury when he entered the
ring against Vaden, Johnson's death offered a look into the often
haphazard way boxing is regulated in the United States and Canada.
The Canadian authorities suspended Johnson for 60 days and required
him to undergo a CT scan, a brain-wave test and a series of
psychometric tests involving memory and motor skills.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who told friends he suffered dizziness after the
Toronto fight, had the scan done at Mount Sinai Hospital on April
16 and later sent the results to the Canadian authorities. The
Ontario athletic commissioner, Ken Hayaschi, said there were slight
abnormalities in the scan that warranted further tests and refused
to lift the suspension. Johnson was still suspended in Canada when
he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was normal, but it was borderline normal,'' Hayaschi said
of Johnson's test. ``I would never have let him fight again based
on that CAT scan alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson nevertheless managed to persuade boxing officials in
South Carolina, Georgia and New Jersey to let him fight on the
strength of the same scan.
</P>
<P>
   James Knight, a spokesman for the South Carolina State Athletic
Commission, said commissioners decided they were not bound by
Ontario's ruling. The state approved a fight on Aug. 7 against
Otilio Villareal, which Johnson won in 10 rounds. Georgia officials
also looked at the test and let him fight Calvin Moody on Oct. 2 in
Albany, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, an official at the State Athletic Control
Commission, Sylvester Cuyler, approved Johnson's application on the
basis of the April CT scan, an eye test, an electrocardiogram and
an HIV test, said a spokeswoman for the commission, Rhonda
Utley-Herring.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy on Monday showed Johnson had died of a ``closed head
injury and left subdural hematoma with multiple complications,''
Dr. Hydow Park, a medical examiner, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth about his medical condition, Johnson's
friends and relatives said the fighter had told them he was
confident after the tests at Mount Sinai that his health was good
enough to let him continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly felt comfortable,'' a friend, Charles Jamison,
said. ``It's obvious that more communication among jurisdictions
could have helped, but clearly, from our talking to Stephan, he
felt he was qualified to get into the ring.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cendant Corp., the big franchiser that operates Ramada Inn
hotels and Avis car rental agencies, agreed Tuesday to pay its
stockholders $2.8 billion to settle charges of widespread
accounting fraud that wiped out billions in the company's market
value. The settlement is by far the largest ever in a securities
class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders, led by the pension funds of New York state,
New York City and California, contended that CUC International, an
online and telephone shopping services company that combined with
HFS Inc. in 1997 to form Cendant, had greatly inflated earnings and
profits and that executives no longer with the company sold shares
before the irregularities were publicly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that engaged in egregious and fraudulent
practices,'' said H. Carl McCall, the New York state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Newark, N.J., and the Securities
and Exchange Commission are continuing criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cendant plunged to $19 from $35 on April 16, 1998, a
day after the company announced widespread accounting
irregularities at CUC, reducing the company's value by $14.4
billion. McCall said that the New York State Common Retirement
Fund, the New York City Pension Funds and the California Public
Employees' Retirement System lost a combined $89 million on that
day. .
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the pension funds, which held 11.7 million shares
when the fraud was disclosed, expected to recover 40 percent to 60
percent of their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant did not detail the accounting irregularities in April,
but the company reported in August 1998 that more than $640 million
in profits reported for the previous three years had been
fictional. The inflated profits, state officials said, helped to
drive up the share price of CUC and make it attractive to potential
merger partners. CUC executives, along with other shareholders,
benefited individually as the stock price rose.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than two weeks before the August announcement, the
former chairman and chief executive of CUC, Walter Forbes, and
eight former CUC directors resigned from the board. Forbes has
denied any knowledge of the accounting irregularities. Four other
senior CUC executives resigned after the disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $2.8 billion settlement, Cendant also agreed,
at the insistence of the pension funds, to several changes in its
corporate structure to create a more independent board and to
prevent executives from increasing stock option benefits without
the consent of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a unique class action waged by large plaintiffs and
not your typical class action by owners of 100 shares or so,'' said
John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in
corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These large pension funds,'' he said, ``were properly trying
in this action to not only recover financial losses but to realize
their priorities in corporate governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Silverman, the chief executive of Cendant, said the
settlement ``brings closure to this most unfortunate event.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who negotiated the settlement said they could not
discuss how much of the $2.8 billion they would receive because
U.S. District Judge William Walls had placed the terms of their
payment under seal until all litigation is complete. But James
Newman, an expert on class-action suits and the publisher of
Securities Class Action Alert, said it was likely they would
receive about 15 percent of the $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining portion of the settlement is to be distributed to
shareholders in proportion to their loses, said Leonard Barrack, a
partner in the Philadelphia law firm of Barrack, Rodos &AMP; Bacine,
which worked out the settlement with Cendant along with its
co-counsel, Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger &AMP; Grossmann in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders and Cendant are suing Ernst &AMP; Young, the company's
former accountant. The suits contend that the auditor certified
CUC's false financial statements. In its suit, Cendant accused
Ernst &AMP; Young of malpractice and breach of contract. As part of the
settlement, Cendant said it would pass on half of any monetary
awards in its case against the auditor to its shareholders. Ernst &AMP;
Young has said that Cendant's claims are without merit.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Parnell, a spokesman for Ernst &AMP; Young, said, ``Our
contention is that we suffered fraud in that both CUC management
and subsequently Cendant management provided to the firm financial
information they knew was false.'' He said Ernst &AMP; Young had
contersued Cendant and that it had been discussing a possible
settlement with the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.8 billion is nearly double the $1.5 billion that
Prudential Securities paid in 1994 to settle claims by investors,
many of them elderly, who lost money on high-risk limited
partnerships they could ill afford. But it was roughly 10 times
greater than the $270 million that American Continental Corp.
agreed to pay investors in its Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan unit in a
series of settlements in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlements are starting to be much larger,'' Newman said,
``because of the overheated stock market. The prices of shares are
so inflated that when bad news comes out billions of dollars are
lost and investors are finally getting a decent recoupment of their
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall and Alan Hevesi, the New York City comptroller, said the
state and city pension funds had no plans to sell their stock in
Cendant. ``The culture or philosophy of our pension fund management
is to invest for the long run, not for a quick hit,'' McCall said.
``If we can have an influence on the company for the long run,
that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pulled out now,'' he added, ``we would suffer some
losses because the stock is worth less than when we bought it.''
Aides to McCall said they could not immediately determine the
average cost of shares to the pension funds but that they
calculated their losses from the mid-30s price when the stock
plunged. Cendant closed at $18.375 Tuesday, up $1.1875 on news of
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cendant can again be valued based on the performance of our
businesses without the overhang of this litigation,'' Silverman
said. He said that the investigations by the U.S. attorney's office
and the SEC ``will not affect the company or its current officers
and directors.''
</P>
<P>
   The pension funds leading the suit reached an agreement with
Cendant that the majority of its board would be independent, that
the audit, nominating and compensation committees would be made up
of independent board members and that all directors would be
elected annually.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Bloom, a spokesman for Cendant, said that several changes
had already been made. Nine of the board's 14 members are
independent directors, he said, and independent directors make up
the entire membership of the audit and compensation committees. He
said a new nominating committee was being formed.
</P>
<P>
   He said Cendant planned to ask shareholders to approve one-year
terms for board members at the annual meeting next spring,
restoring a practice at HFS before the merger with CUC.
</P>
<P>
   The measure on stock options was designed to prevent a practice
known as ``repricing'' in which the exercise price of options is
lowered when a company's market value drops. ``Many times
management is responsible for a drop in the stock price, and they
shouldn't be compensated for that,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom said Cendant had put the stock option requirement into
effect immediately by executive order.

Found fortune? Couple picks $300,000 off street 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The blue bag lying in the middle of a busy thoroughfare
looked like a student's book tote.
</P>
<P>
   But its contents caused a Duncanville, Texas, woman to
hyperventilate.
</P>
<P>
   It contained nearly $300,000, a chrome 9 mm handgun and 18
rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   After retrieving the bag from traffic and inspecting its
contents, the woman and her husband immediately flagged down a
police officer. The officer summoned a supervisor to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did the smart thing by turning the money in,'' said
Dallas Deputy Police Chief Danny Garcia. ``If there is a strong
indication that found money is part of a criminal offense, a
citizen has an obligation to turn it in. The gun is a strong
indicator of a criminal offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrendering the cash was smart for another reason, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was part of a drug payment drop, the owner could have
seen them take it. That could create a danger for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The husband and wife were not identified by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The police report states only that the couple found the bag near
the Dallas suburb of Duncanville.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not been able to trace the origins of the money, but
Garcia said there have been no reports of large robberies in the
area. Therefore, he said, it may have been part of an aborted or
blundered drug transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the couple may yet get the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nobody else claims the money,'' Garcia said, ``they can
file a claim to it. Getting it that way will be safer than if they
had kept it in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't get the gun, though. A city ordinance requires that
it be destroyed.

STRUGGLING WARRIORS _ AND STARKS _ NEARLY SHOCK KNICKS _ AND
SPREWELL 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A percolating John Starks was ushered around his old
haunt by the applause from the thousands who still embrace the
boyish shooter with the bounce in his step. But the house was
divided in loyalties between the cherished past and the current
cool of Latrell Sprewell for only so long.
</P>
<P>
   By the surprisingly tight end of the game, the Madison Square
Garden folks were nervously coaxing their team to hold off the
inspired Golden State Warriors. They had seen the Knicks blow a
16-point, third-quarter lead to Denver on Sunday, and now an
11-point, fourth-quarter lead had melted to 2 points with 4.1
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Starks or Sprewell who settled things. It was the
reliable Larry Johnson. He hit two free throws with 2.9 seconds
left to secure the Knicks' 89-83 victory and boost their record to
11-9. Starks finished the game 3 for 12 with 7 points; Sprewell
ended 9 for 20 with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State Coach P.J. Carlesimo lingered at midcourt after the
game to shake the hands of some of the Knicks who passed him, but
Sprewell was not among them. Sprewell departed in a different
direction after a game that was not nearly the blowout he had been
counting on.
</P>
<P>
   Using second-chance points from Antawn Jamison and an extra
effort from another former Knick, Terry Cummings, the Warriors
(2-15) were within 85-82 with 37.4 seconds to play. Instead of
stopping the nonsense, Allan Houston shuffled his feet with the
ball and was called for traveling with 21.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Houston had a chance to redeem himself, though. He stripped the
ball from Chris Mills with 6 seconds left, but when he went to the
free-throw line with 5.4 seconds to play, Houston inexplicably
missed both shots, the second game in a row that he has come up
empty in a critical situation.
</P>
<P>
   With 5.1 seconds left, the Warriors still had a chance. Chris
Carr was immediately fouled on the inbound pass. With 4.1 seconds
left he hit the first free throw and intentionally missed the
second. But the rebound was grabbed by Thomas with 3.5 seconds
left, and the Golden State strategy had misfired.
</P>
<P>
   After starting out so well, Sprewell missed 10 of his last 12
shots and was of no help to the Knicks down the stretch. With
Houston also groping to find his rhythm, the Knicks had to rely on
the Warriors to miss on their chances. Mookie Blaylock did just
that, missing on a 3-point attempt to tie the score with 8 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   There was an undercurrent of anticipation before the game. Would
Sprewell shake the hand of the coach he assaulted two years ago?
No.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo made an attempt when the two met last month, but he
did not venture out to catch Sprewell's eye this time. It would
probably have been futile if he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit here and say 'm going to approach him,''
Sprewell said before the game. ``With the seriousness of what
happened, it's not like you shake hands, say, OK, it's fine. And
that's it. It's not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell insisted his edge to this game did not conjure up the
angry edge that he had when he stepped into the hostile vibes
crashing around the New Arena at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   When his name was announced there, boos rushed through his head.
Last night, the atmosphere was much different for Starks' arrival.
Starks' name was the first one announced, and on cue, he popped
through the gantlet of Warriors, blew four kisses to the screaming
crowd and stood alone, bouncing like a kid on box springs during
the 15 to 20 seconds of applause.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a few seconds after the opening tip, Starks
plunged right into the feel-good moment. In an effort to save the
jump ball that began the game, Starks leaped into celebrity row.
Everyone roared approval.
</P>
<P>
   It was Starks' night; even Sprewell understood that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it'll be an emotional game,'' Sprewell had said
earlier. `'But I don't know if it'll be as emotional for me as it
will be for John Starks. It's really kind of flip-flopped.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, so were the performances. Sprewell seemed too hyped,
too emotionally charged to find his shot in Oakland. Starks, under
pressure to perform well in an arena he had always adored as a
Knick, seemed as tight as a clenched fist to begin the game.
</P>
<P>
   Still backpedaling after every shot _ some things never change _
Starks was off his mark. He was long, short, and he missed
completely as he finished the first half 0 for 4 from the floor.
His counterpart to the emotional night, Sprewell, was just the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was the offensive supplier for the Knicks. While
Houston struggled to hit 2 of 7 shots, Sprewell made 7 of his first
8 shots and ended the first half with 21 points, helping to give
the Knicks a 49-38 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A revolving door of defenders _ from Starks, to Mills to
Blaylock _ tried to put up a resistance to Sprewell, but it was in
vain. On one made-for-television move, Sprewell drove past Mills,
tiptoed through the paint and a thicket of defenders, launched
himself and sent a double-pumped scoop shot into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Sprewell's performance overwhelming Starks', the
Knicks were not running away with the game. They built a 13-point
lead in the second quarter, but a drought that left them scoreless
for a four-minute stretch, plus their inability to come up with
offensive rebounds, allowed the Warriors to creep within 39-34 with
4:23 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The second-chance points players like Jamison, who had 18
first-half points, were firing over Kurt Thomas, Chris Dudley and
Marcus Camby to keep the Warriors close.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as Sprewell, who took a three-and-a-half-minute
rest, returned, the Knicks were able to gather themselves, score
points and hold their 11-point lead at the half. Although the
Knicks held the Warriors to 24.5 percent shooting from the field,
they were outrebounded, 33-24.

POLICE CHIEF'S RESIGNATION WON'T HALT PROBES INTO WTO PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 and KERY MURAKAMI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper's decision to leave
office has not dampened demands for an investigation into the
performance of the city _ and Mayor Paul Schell _ in planning for
and handling World Trade Organization protests last week.
</P>
<P>
   Though some community leaders Tuesday said they were saddened by
Stamper's announcement that he will retire in March, his impending
departure did not affect how passionately many felt about last
week's performance by police and Schell's administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Paul Schell thinks he is off the hook, he's got another
thing coming,'' said Democratic political strategist Cathy Allen.
``But one thing Stamper's resignation will do for him is allow him
to tell the whole truth about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Councilwoman and Public Safety Committee chair Tina
Podlodowski, ``it puts the sights right on Schell.''
</P>
<P>
   The embattled mayor is likely to come under fire Wednesday at a
special City Council hearing where hundreds of people are expected
to air grievances.
</P>
<P>
   While council members lamented Stamper's decision to retire,
saying he has accomplished much to implement community policing and
improve relations with minority communities, they said recent
controversies _ including allegations of officer misconduct and
disappearance of sensitive police files _ meant he was likely on
his way out in any event.
</P>
<P>
   City Council members remain furious at the mayor for leaving
them out of WTO planning and out of the loop now. They learned of
Stamper's resignation from reporters Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The council has launched its own investigation, in addition a
review ordered by Schell and an American Civil Liberties Union
investigation. The council also is considering yet another,
independent review commission similar to one that looked into
internal police department investigations earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The chief's announcement, noted Councilman Jim Compton,
``doesn't answer any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many council members and leaders of community, anti-WTO,
business and environmental groups agreed it is essential for the
investigations to move forward so Stamper does not become the
scapegoat for the week's events.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dolan, deputy director of Public Citizen's Global Trade
Watch, a organizer of peaceful protests last week, said Stamper
``doesn't have all the responsibility'' for the week's missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Direct Action Network, which helped organize civil
disobedience last week, said they, too, fear the resignation will
divert attention from others' responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel like they're using him like a fall guy,'' said
David Solnit, a street theater artist who was jailed for
demonstrating against the WTO. ``The decisions had to go up to the
Clinton administration and the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamper has said his decision was his alone. He said he is
leaving so Schell's review won't be compromised by suggestions he
is trying to save his job.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Joncas, president of the Downtown Seattle Association, said
what downtown businesses fear most is that the investigations will
become politicized and drag on needlessly for months. She said
questions about who is accountable and whether the city and police
department ignored signs that the demonstrations could spin out of
control need to be answered quickly, so that those in leadership
aren't stuck ``second-guessing without knowing the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Honig, spokesman for the ACLU, said Stamper's resignation
does not lessen the need for an independent review panel to
investigate last week's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ACLU is concerned with policies and practices of the
police department and city,'' he said. ``No matter who is in charge
of the police department, the same issues have to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He recommended a panel modeled on the commission that
investigated police accountability earlier this year. It was
staffed by community leaders without ties to Seattle police.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about is a commission ... separate from
city government, not a City Council panel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Eason, president of the Seattle branch of the NAACP, said
he would gladly serve on such a panel. ``These people (on the
panel) need broad investigatory power, with subpoena power,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Pickett, chairman of the Pike-Pine neighborhood planning
committee, also urged an independent commission.
</P>
<P>
   Podlodowski is urging her colleagues to give its own review
panel subpoena powers, saying the council could not otherwise get
at the truth. The City Attorney's office was researching whether
the council has subpoena powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't spend hundreds of hours to make Pike-Pine a better
neighborhood only to have it tear-gassed by police,'' Pickett said.
``We need to find out what were the abuses and how can we keep this
from happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Taylor, the ACLU's executive director, said her
organization will press its legal challenge of the city's
declaration of a ``no-protest'' zone during the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of impending lawsuits against the city, City
Councilman Peter Steinbreuck said that on Monday he'll propose an
independent citizens review panel. He said a citizen's panel would
have more credibility than a council review.
</P>
<P>
   Other council members stopped short of rejecting the idea but
questioned the need for a panel in addition that of Schell's group
and the council's WTO Accountability Task Force, which includes
council members Jan Drago, Nick Licata and Compton.
</P>
<P>
   The concensus that the city should move forward with its WTO
investigations did not prevent community leaders Tuesday from
mourning the loss of chief with a deep commitment to community
policing and the end of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Several council members said Stamper's problems preceding the
WTO meetings, which centered on a highly publicized case in which a
detective allegedly stole $10,000 from a crime scene and a
subsequent investigation in which critical files were lost, had
already weakened the chief. Still, they expressed sadness at the
loss of a man they said restored police credibility among
minorities and gays.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard McIver said he'll miss Stamper, despite the
criticism he piled on the department after he was pulled out of his
car by officers on the way to a WTO event. He said Stamper had come
to his office afterwards and urged him to file a complaint about
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``As critical as I've been of the police, I've also found that
the chief was willing to listen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Kelly, president of the Urban League of Metropolitan
Seattle, praised Stamper's ability to hear minority communities'
concerns through advisory boards and his Stop the Violence
campaign, which took 2,000 handguns out of circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he made a giant step toward healing tensions between
the community and police department,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   June Wiley, community advocacy manager of New Beginnings, a
battered women's shelter, praised the chief for setting up a
special domestic violence unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped officers shift their attitudes towards domestic
violence _ that such cases aren't just a pain in the neck, but are
potential homicides and must be taken seriously,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Noted Seattle City Attorney Mark Sidran, ``many of the people
who may be critics of his in and out of the police department
concede he's a genuinely decent person.''

THE FORCE LEAVES HASBRO WITH JOBS CUT AND A $97 MILLION
RESTRUCTURING CHARGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The toymaker Hasbro Inc. said Tuesday that it was eliminating
2,200 jobs, or more than 20 percent of its work force, and taking a
restructuring charge of $97 million, or 50 cents a share, in the
final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro hopes to increase sales by expanding its offerings of
electronic toys and CD-ROM games and its popular Pokemon line. But
analysts said retail sales of Hasbro's ``Star Wars'' line were
sluggish as the latest movie failed to meet the hype-induced
expectations at the box office. The company, based in Pawtucket,
R.I., hopes to compensate with Pokemon trading cards, one of this
year's sensations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The force is with Pokemon, not `Star Wars,''' said Tony Gikas,
an industry analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Krutick, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said Hasbro
had sold $600 million to $650 million of ``Star Wars'' products to
retailers in 1999, but they were not exactly flying out of the
stores, raising concerns in the industry about a crimp in demand
for new toys next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon sales exceeded $100 million, bolstered by Hasbro's
purchase of the maker of the cards, Wizard of the Coast. Industry
analysts projected $750 million or more in combined sales for
``Star Wars'' and Pokemon next year as Pokemon gains.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Furby dolls, another strong seller, brought in
$300 million this year. Total 1999 revenue will be about $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toy industry is switching to electronics,'' said Jim
Silver, publisher of The Toy Book, a monthly trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen of the top selling items this year had electronic
bells and whistles,'' he said, adding that Amazing Ally, an
electronic smart doll made by Playmates Toys Inc., was already sold
out in most New York stores.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Gustafson, a senior portfolio manager in Chicago with Stein
Roe &AMP; Farnham, which owns Hasbro shares, said Tuesday's
announcements were ``an admission that Hasbro has to change the way
it does business in order to adjust to the changing environment for
toy companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that big customers like Wal-Mart Stores were insisting
on delivery on demand for hot products, pushing the costs of
maintaining inventories back on the toy makers. ``As a result,
Hasbro has to cut its cost structure to absorb that inventory
expense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Hasbro declined 18.75 cents Tuesday, to $21.25, on the
New York Stock Exchange. Mattel Inc., the biggest toy maker, was
down 37.5 cents, to $14.50.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Hasbro announcements were anticipated, and the
company said it expected earnings for the quarter and year would
meet expectations on Wall Street. About 40 percent of Hasbro sales
come in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expected to squeeze out cost savings of $16
million next year and $23 million in 2001. But next year, at least,
Hasbro said the savings would not be reflected in higher earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro plans to close plants in Tijuana, Mexico, and Ashford,
England, and move production to China and other Asian countries.
The company is eliminating 2,200 jobs, about 300 in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Charness, a senior vice president of Hasbro, said it was
also closing its flight simulation studio in Alameda, Calif.,
because production costs were high and sales volume was low.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focusing on higher profit margin categories and mass
market categories,'' he said, as well as ``untapped potential'' in
new versions of brands like Monopoly and Scrabble.
</P>
<P>
   About half of Hasbro's sales are in board games of all sorts,
including electronic versions, he said. Analysts said Hasbro was
the third-largest maker of entertainment games for personal
computers, behind Electronic Arts, which makes sports games, and
French-based Havas Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro forecast $300 million in sales of interactive products
this year, or about 7.5 percent of its $4 billion total, compared
with $150 million last year, or 4.6 percent of 1998 sales of $3.3
billion. Toy industry sales in all categories are growing at only
about 5 percent annually.  &QL;

THE POWERFUL IDEA OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Dec. 8: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A great flowering of the ideal of universal human rights has
taken place in the last 50 years, a blink of time in a millennium.
It is among the most important political legacies of this century.
Despite the persistence of state-sponsored repression and genocidal
conflict, the belief that individuals have a claim to basic rights
and dignities is being embraced by ordinary citizens on every
continent. Freedom of speech and assembly, freedom from slavery,
torture and arbitrary arrest, and the right to equality under the
law as common values are still quite new in many parts of the
world. But leaders who violate these principles now face
international exposure, sanctions and even outside intervention, as
Slobodan Milosevic discovered this year.
</P>
<P>
   The past 30 years have seen the birth of hundreds of human
rights organizations that give voice to aspirations of freedom and
equality. These groups have worked to expose criminal regimes and
help their victims. Many groups have become political forces in
their own right, joining together to push for initiatives such as
banning land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The movement grew out of the horrors of World War II and the
brutal tyrannies that darkened the rest of the 20th century. But
its roots can be traced to the Greek Stoics, who believed in
universal natural laws; the Romans, who refined concepts on the
rule of law; and the Enlightenment philosophers, who believed that
freedom was a natural condition and that the purpose of government
was to serve and protect citizens. In this millennium, documents
like Magna Carta of 1215, the English Bill of Rights of 1689, the
French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789,
and the American Constitution of 1787 and the Bill of Rights of
1791 advanced the universality of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in Western cultures where these notions of rights first
developed, the progress of freedom took centuries. During the first
half of the millennium, slavery was a common condition in Europe.
In feudalism, only those wealthy enough to own land and arms
enjoyed any semblance of freedom. In some 11th-century documents,
those who were called ``free'' were hereditarily bound to their
masters' land and transferred like livestock, with no rights to own
or inherit property or even marry without a master's consent.
</P>
<P>
   In 15th-century Genoa, a census counted more than 2,000 slaves
in city households. In 1860, more than half the population of South
Carolina was in slavery, and government-sanctioned racial
discrimination existed in America for 100 years more. The struggle
for women's suffrage across Europe and America did not end until
after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Well into this century, human rights were not accepted as a
matter for international discourse. The Covenant of the League of
Nations of 1919, for example, did not address human rights
generally. Earlier international agreements dealt with certain
protections for victims of war, but not with how governments
treated their own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The enormity of the Nazi atrocities forced the world to consider
human rights as a concern of international law. The Nuremberg
Principles established the authority of the international community
to prosecute crimes committed by a state against its own people. In
1948 the United Nations approved the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, a document that boldly proclaimed that recognition of ``the
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is
the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.'' Its 30
articles catalog civil, political, economic and social rights.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few decades the vision of that document, which is not
a treaty but a ``common standard of achievement for all peoples and
all nations,'' has become part of the dialogue among nations. Its
principles were incorporated in the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which
subjected human rights abuses in the former Soviet bloc to closer
scrutiny. It remains the foundation of the global human rights
movement, used by citizens from diverse cultures to express their
hopes to the world.
</P>
<P>
   This Friday marks the 51st anniversary of the adoption of the
Universal Declaration. The human rights movement is younger in age
than the oldest baby boomers, and still embattled in many nations.
In the 1990s the world has witnessed the horror of genocide in
Rwanda and the use of rape and torture as methods of war in the
former Yugoslavia. The enforcement of human rights against rogue
regimes, and even in nations that have adopted these principles,
remains a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of the idea is undeniable. Human rights ideals
have been accepted by people around the globe, whether they are
students seeking democratic reform in China or women demanding
equal protection under law in Pakistan. This development could not
have been imagined at the start of the millennium or even this
century. It offers a promise that could prove as important as the
great revolutions of the preceding centuries.

Today's game against the 76ers will be billed as Charles Barkley's
return to Philadelphia, the city where he began his Hall of Fame
career in 1984, and rightfully so.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barkley, who has announced he will retire at the end of the
current season, will be the subject of most of the interviews and
will be honored by the Sixers during tonight's game at First Union
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the game represents a homecoming for another Rocket, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley, a Philly native, attended Cardinal Dougherty
High School in Philadelphia before spending a year at Maine Central
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, however, learned most of his basketball lessons in the
Philadelphia schoolyards, where he was tutored by some of the
city's best, including Eddie Jones, now with the Charlotte Hornets,
and current Sixer Aaron McKie, who grew up in Philadelphia and
attended Temple University.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley is especially close to Jones, a Florida native who played
with McKie at Temple. It was Jones, who has that same long-armed,
slender physique that Mobley possesses, who took the relatively
unheralded player under his wing and showed him how to play the
game at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my mentor,'' Mobley said of Jones. ``Since I was 15 or 16
years old. He and Aaron McKie. I've been watching and playing with
them since I was around 16 years old, just playing and learning
more. And (Temple's) John Chaney is right there, who is a great
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was things like when you're on defense, keeping your hands
active. Just being a complete player. I've always said that I model
myself after Scottie Pippen and Eddie Jones because they don't have
a weakness. They do everything. They might not be excellent at one
thing, but they're good at everything, and that's what you need to
be. That way you're more valuable to your team.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mobley is certainly that to the Rockets _ one of the most
valuable assets on a team that seems to keep losing key pieces with
each passing game. Mobley's success with the Rockets, however, begs
the simple question: Why did he last so long in the draft?
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing for a high-profile program at Rhode Island,
Mobley lasted until the 41st pick in the 1998 NBA draft. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Mobley just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point in time when they were saying, `Oh, he can't
handle the ball. Oh, he's too small (to play shooting guard),' and
all this and all that,'' Mobley said. ``And these people have never
even played basketball before, but they're the critics. How can you
never have played the game, even in the streets, and then go tell a
person that they can't play basketball?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an overachiever. I graduated college with a double major,
and it wasn't food nutrition; it was psychology and communications.
I'm just an overachiever. I love it when people say I can't do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's used to being overlooked. During his high school
days in Philadelphia, Mobley was easy to overlook since Simon
Gratz, the No. 1 team not only in the state of Pennsylvania but in
the nation, featured a kid named Rasheed Wallace who hogged all the
attention. And any remaining ink spilled over to Philadelphia's
Roman Catholic, which was the 20th-ranked high school team in the
nation, or to Olney High, which starred 6-11 Jason Lawson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like that little bug that's surrounded by a lot of big
bugs,'' Mobley said. ``You get overshadowed. It really doesn't
matter to me. I don't need the (publicity). I don't need anything,
really. I just want to play and go hard. We have 30-something pros
in Philadelphia every summer, and they live there and are from
there. So it's kind of hard to not get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can go to the hole there and get beat up like that, I
don't care where you are in the country, you'll do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets kept their fingers crossed in the draft, hoping they
could still nab the 6-4 guard in the second round. And if they had
any doubts at all after selecting Mobley at No. 41, they were
erased during the prolonged lockout, when Mobley spent his time
playing in high-level pickup games around Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he was good, and then during the lockout people who
had been around on the East Coast and had been working out and were
around Cuttino kept coming back with stories about how this guy
could really play,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``And we knew
that he was good. We just couldn't wait to get him here because
everybody was talking about his talent and his attitude toward the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is what keeps Mobley on the upward curve when it
comes to learning his craft _ another byproduct of his days with
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A point guard last year, Mobley has made the move to shooting
guard with the arrival of super-rookie Steve Francis. And Mobley
has responded well, giving the Rockets an added dimension of being
able to break defenses down with his one-on-one moves.
</P>
<P>
   Already a 3-point threat, Mobley, who is averaging 13.5 points,
has worked on his midrange game as well, all to keep defenses off
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie told me to always work on every single thing,'' Mobley
said. ``And I try to work on everything possible. A coach can't
say, `OK, he (Mobley) is the type of guy who's either going to
shoot the 3 or go inside for a layup.' Or, `He's only going to go
left or only going to go right.' I try to work on every single
thing possible, and it helps me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that work ethic that has allowed Mobley to develop into
one of the top young guards in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Is he surprised?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say no because people will take that as too
cocky,'' Mobley said. ``I've been practicing a long time. I've been
playing (against) pros since I was 16. That's six or seven years,
so I've just been ready. It's not that I surprise myself, but I
think I've surprised a lot of people.''

AMGEN CEO RETIRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, CA. _ After more than a decade of leading Amgen
Inc. through one of the most spectacular run-ups on Wall Street,
Gordon Binder announced late Tuesday that he will retire as the
company's chief executive officer and chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Binder will hand control of the company to the man he has been
grooming as his successor for years, Chief Operating Officer Kevin
W. Sharer.
</P>
<P>
   Binder will remain CEO through the company's May 11 shareholder
meeting and continue on as chairman until the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement of Binder, 64, and his naming of Sharer as his
successor came as little surprise to Amgen's followers on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Curtis Hogue of Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. said Sharer had
begun to perform some of the duties of CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had taken over the conference call responsibility for the
most part and was making the transition gradually,'' Hogue said.
``It was pretty much expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Binder joined Amgen in 1982, when the company was a small
biotechnology interest with 89 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, he succeeded George Rathmann to become the
company's second chief executive. By then, the company had grown to
457 employees.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Amgen launched what is now one of its two flagship
products, the anemia drug Epogen, which stimulates the production
of red blood cells. A decade after its launch, the drug generates
more than $1 billion in sales annually.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said in a statement he wanted to pass the reins to Sharer
well before Amgen launches the new products it is developing.
</P>
<P>
   Long criticized for its lack of a substantial pipeline of drugs
in development, Amgen's future no longer appears to be tied to
continued sales of Epogen and Neupogen.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said in his statement that sales of both drugs have
provided the capital for Amgen to research and develop the new
drugs it is now testing.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has taken hits as a result of its heavy
reliance on long-term development, as evidenced in October when
Amgen announced it will continue to invest heavily in research and
development at the expense of earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   The day the statement was made, the company's stock dropped
nearly 7percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, shares of Amgen have increased dramatically in the
decade-plus that Binder has led the company. An investor who bought
$10,000 worth of Amgen shares in early 1990 would have stock worth
approximately $450,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   The company is working on second-generation versions of both of
its top-selling drugs, including a longer dose version of Epogen,
known as NESP, which it will be allowed to market more widely than
the original product.
</P>
<P>
   Also in development is a rheumatoid arthritis treatment known as
Kineret, and researchers working for the company recently announced
the discovery of a compound that might be the cause of Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   During Binder's tenure, Amgen has been fiercely protective of
its franchises, challenging rival Johnson &AMP; Johnson in court to win
the right to market NESP as a separate drug to Epogen or the
Johnson &AMP; Johnson drug Procrit.
</P>
<P>
   Sharer, 51, who has been president and chief operating officer
since joining Amgen in 1992, came to the company from MCI
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   He will take over the duties of CEO at the May 11 shareholder
meeting, then assume the top position on Amgen's board when Binder
steps down from that position.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen shares closed at $44.8125 on Tuesday, down 18.75 cents.
Binder's retirement was announced after the markets closed.

CITYWALK EXPANSION TO NEARLY DOUBLE SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY _ Universal CityWalk is on track to complete its
ambitious expansion in April, adding 34 tenants as the flashy
entertainment district seeks to bolster its status as a key tourist
destination for Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick with CityWalk is to keep it fresh and
over-the-top,'' said Larry Kurzweil, president and chief operating
officer of the entire Universal Studios Hollywood complex, during
an interview Tuesday. ``We're not looking to be mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion, announced a year ago, will boost the area by more
than 90,000 square feet and nearly double the number of individual
CityWalk sites to more than 70 at the eclectic, 6-year-old
promenade just outside the amusement park grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love CityWalk, so we're giving them a lot more of it,''
Kurzweil said.
</P>
<P>
   New attractions will include an Imax 3-D theater, a food court
with a handful of chains opening their first quick-service outlets,
10 retail outlets designed to offer ``best in category'' inventory,
four restaurants, two nightclubs, ``rock n' roll bowling'' and
virtual-reality NASCAR racing. The new space is 100percent leased.
</P>
<P>
   The revamp will boost the profile of two areas, especially
during evening hours _ the eastern end, currently dominated by
Loews Cineplex 18-screen theater and the Hard Rock Cafe, which will
gain the food court, retail and dining outlets; and the second
level of the Fountain Court, anchored by B.B. King Blues Club and
Daily Grill, which will gain a dance club, beer garden and dueling
piano bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come out of the theater, they'll have a lot more
options than what's now available,'' Kurzweil said.
</P>
<P>
   With the new venues taking shape, Kurzweil noted, the expansion
already carries the same eclectic feel of the existing CityWalk by
mixing offbeat spending opportunities amid a jumble of colors and
textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying very much for a seamless transition,'' Kurzweil
said. ``We have a lot of back-and-forth talks about issues like the
colors of tile and concrete, along with the signage, which we want
to be over-the-top.''
</P>
<P>
   CityWalk's growth comes amid unexpectedly strong business
generated by its core attraction _ offering the feel of a theme
park for only the $7 parking fee. Officials estimate CityWalk
attracts 3.95million tourists annually along with 6.05million
locals with an average visit of 3.2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although doubts persisted when CityWalk opened in 1993, the idea
has become one of the most popular concepts among commercial retail
planners. The site _ employing some of rival Walt Disney Co.'s most
successful theme-park strategies _ blends dining, entertainment,
live performers and offbeat retail outlets in an idealized
environment lacking traffic and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Chernack, president of Burbank-based theme-park design
specialist Metavision, said CityWalk took advantage of already
operating a trio of attractions _ the theme park, the Universal
Amphitheater and the movie complex _ to convince customers to stay
longer and spend more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``CityWalk has helped to redefine the whole idea of a
manufactured urban entertainment district,'' Chernack noted.
``They've created one of the early benchmarks of what's known as
place-making, where you have a very citylike experience where
everything is within walking distance. You're seeing it replicated
on an international basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagram Co., which bought Universal in 1995, liked the idea so
much that it opened a second CityWalk last year adjacent to
Universal Studios in Florida and plans to build a third next to
Universal's upcoming theme park in Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has opened similar retail-entertainment districts at its
massive Walt Disney World complex in Florida and recently announced
plans for a Downtown Disney development sandwiched between its new
California Adventure theme park and Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Kurzweil said the basic idea has been to create a
haven-and-hangout alternative to a shopping mall. ``We would never
want to be thought of as a mall,'' he added. ``What we're looking
for is a best-in-category approach.''

SOTHEBY'S CANCELS SALE OF GOLD SALVAGED FROM 1857 WRECK 
 &HT;    (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C., Va., Ohio, Panama, Britain   By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The auction house Sotheby's has canceled an auction
of millions of dollars in Gold Rush treasure after a federal court
ruled against the sale. The auction was scheduled to begin
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   An injunction was issued last week by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Virginia to prevent the sale of the gold, which had
been expected to bring between $7 million and $10 million,
Sotheby's said. Sotheby's identifies the gold's consignors as a
group of American and British insurers or their successors.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was to take place at Sotheby's in New York on
Wednesday and Thursday and then Thursday night on a Web site
operated by Sotheby's and -Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The gold was recovered from the paddle steamer Central America,
which sank in the Atlantic in 1857. It was salvaged in the late
1980s by the Columbus America Discovery Group of Ohio, founded by
the engineer and explorer Tommy Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, after a decade of battles over the gold's ownership,
the U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Va., awarded the insurers
nearly 400 pounds of gold _ about 8 percent of the total _ with the
rest going to the salvagers.
</P>
<P>
   David Redden, an executive vice president of Sotheby's, said
Tuesday night that negotiations had been taking place between the
insurers and the Columbus group from the time the injunction was
issued through Tuesday afternoon. ``We were notified this evening
that discussions had broken down and that the sale had to be
canceled,'' Redden said.
</P>
<P>
   Three tons of gold bars, ingots, coins and dust was shipped in
August 1857 from San Francisco bound for New York. It was
transferred to the Central America in Panama, but the boat sank in
a storm 160 miles off Cape Fear, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's said that it hoped the auction could be rescheduled.

ANIMATED, REVEALING AFRICAN FOLK TALE
</HEADLINE>
  (mg) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an animated film that has been a hit in France, a
tiny boy demands to be born, only to crawl out of his mother's womb
and find his African village terrorized by a witch.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a blend of West African fables, the film, ``Kirikou
and the Sorceress'' shows how the innocence and perseverance of the
boy, Kirikou, help him prevail over ignorance and cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   The film is scheduled to be released in the United States in
February during Black History Month. It will open first in New York
followed by Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kirikou and the Sorceress'' is one of the highlights of the
seventh annual African Diaspora Film Festival in New York, which
ends on Sunday. This year, the two-week festival, at various sites
throughout the city, has scheduled 52 films from 25 countries.
Organizers of the festival, Reinaldo and Diarah N'Daw-Spech, have
obtained the United States distribution rights.
</P>
<P>
   With a musical score by a renowned Senegalese musician, Youssou
N'Dour, this simple, graphic tale would seem to be a natural for
the big screen. And yet the film's director, Michel Ocelot of
France, was told by European and American distributors that the
animated feature would never sell because the female characters
were bare-breasted and the boy was naked.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors wanted bras on the women and pants on the
newborn Kirikou. Ocelot refused and went ahead anyway. He spent two
years raising the $4 million needed to make the film and four more
years producing it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns about nudity, the film has become a success
in France, where it has been seen by more than one million
moviegoers since its release a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In June, ``Kirikou'' won the grand prize for best animated
feature at the International Festival of Animated Film in Annecy,
France. And in October, the film received first prize from juries
of both children and adults in the Chicago International Children's
Film Festival, the first time that has happened in the festival's
16-year history.
</P>
<P>
   For the festival organizers, the film succeeded precisely
because it does not present a sanitized or distorted view of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Spechs, a husband-and-wife team who are the founders of
ArtMattan Productions, one of only a few black distribution
companies in the country, said the film conveyed positive images of
Africans.
</P>
<P>
   The film also reflected the couple's own international
sensibilities. They lived in France before moving to the United
States. Spech was born in Cuba of Haitian and Jamaican descent; his
wife, Diarah, is French and of Malian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no monolithic black experience,'' Spech said. ``There
is a diversity of experiences that people of African descent have
been dealing with for many centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a white person goes into our culture and comes
out with an artistic product of value shows you the
interrelationship between cultures and how things are happening in
the world today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, where the subjects of race and sex are
more sensitive than in Europe, the Spechs have admitted to worrying
about how American audiences will react to the nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing a contract for the distribution rights, the
couple conducted an informal survey of 20 people who watched the
film and received no complaints about the nudity. The Spechs also
have received some reassurance from the reaction of groups of
schoolchildren who clapped and sang along to the film's folk tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never came up once,'' said Mrs. Spech, who also works as
the budget manager at Teachers College, while her husband is a high
school teacher in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural for kids in Africa to be running around naked
until they are a certain age,'' she said. ``It's part of the
culture. Over all, people are not as hung up on nudity as they are
in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chicago film festival, the reaction was similar. But the
festival director, Rebekah Cowing, said the French distributors
initially did not want to enter the film in the festival because
they had been warned by American distributors that it would not
play well because of the nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cowing said the film had something that was missing from a
blockbuster like ``The Lion King.'' The film is about people, not
talking animals, she said. ``It shows African culture. It was
really refreshing that it features people with black skin who
weren't just sidekicks. It reinforces the positive role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocelot, the director, said the film explored African themes that
were true to his own memories of a childhood in Guinea. He said
those memories were of beauty, the importance of family and of the
group, and of a certain harmony with the body. He said the
partly-clad women were part of his memories, though he conceded
that the practice was now more confined to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, all over the streets were bare-breasted
women,'' he said. ``They are not naked women; they are dressed
normally. That's what people understand when they see the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocelot said he decided against using celebrities on the
soundtrack in favor of Senegalese voices in the French-language
version and black South African voices in the version dubbed in
English, to retain the flavor of Africa. He also decided to use
music by N'Dour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it to make money,'' Ocelot said. ``I did it to
make you feel good and to have one hour of some kind of pleasure
and something which stays afterward.''

AUDITORS IN DEEP DISGUISE CRACK PENSION COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Security experts easily broke into computers at the federal
agency that guarantees pensions, acquiring the ability to create
fictitious beneficiaries and send them money, according to a report
expected to be made public on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For three months beginning in May, the auditors rummaged through
high-level administrative and financial system computer files at
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. in Washington, their activities
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   The break-ins succeeded even though Wayne Robert Poll, the
benefit corporation's inspector general, told officials in advance
that he had retained PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditing firm, to
penetrate the computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The report warns that the computers at the pension guarantee
agency are ``vulnerable to malicious external and internal
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   David Strauss, the agency's executive director, maintained in an
interview on Tuesday that, had the hackers tried to make a payment,
other security measures would have prevented any checks from being
issued.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having the power to create fictitious
beneficiaries and send them money, the auditors reported that they
could have altered or deleted files on individuals and changed the
internal systems used by the benefit corporation to manage its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation, which is owned by the federal government,
guarantees that the 42 million Americans with defined-benefit
pension plans will get their retirement checks even if their
employer goes out of business. It holds $18 billion in assets, pays
$900 million annually to more than 200,000 people and will pay
benefits to at least 300,000 others when they reach retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Access was gained in two ways. One was through dial-up modems.
Using software readily available to hackers, the auditors found
passwords that gave them high-level access. The second technique
was to masquerade as benefit corporation employees who needed a new
password or other help logging into the system.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors failed, however, to penetrate the firewall that
protects the benefit corporation's Web site from outside attack.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen of two Senate committees that have oversight of the
benefit guarantee agency said they were disturbed by the ease of
entry and would hold a hearing in February on computer security at
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's computer security ``has more holes than Swiss
cheese,'' said Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and
head of the Select Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri and chairman of
the Small Business Committee, said ``their inspector general told
them he was setting the alarm clock, but the agency chose to hit
the snooze button.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss, the agency's executive director, termed Bond's remark
``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we are on a very high state of alert here,''
Strauss maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the security gaps have been filled, Strauss added. He
argued that even with access, the auditors could not have actually
sent money to people who were not entitled because of other
security measures, including a system of checking each new
beneficiary manually and randomly assigning which employee
authorizes each new or changed payment to a beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the auditors could not break in through the
Web site because in 1997, the agency hired consultants to make it
secure.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies and companies often devote much more
attention to protecting against attacks over the Internet than over
telephone lines, said Fred Rica, partner in charge of penetration
studies for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In almost 100 percent of the penetration tests I have done or
managed,'' Rica said, ``we have been able to penetrate through a
dial-in.''

TWO DEVELOPMENTS OFFER COMMUNICATIONS FLEXIBILITY
</HEADLINE>
  (mg) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the communications equipment industry continues to advance at
a white-hot pace, two small companies intend to announce on
Wednesday the development of products meant to increase the
flexibility of big communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks Inc., which mounted a successful initial
public stock offering in October, intends to announce the
development of a communications switch that is possibly the first
to use light instead of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   And Ennovate Networks Inc., which has been underwritten
primarily by Japanese conglomerates and venture capitalists,
intends to announce that Psinet, a large Internet carrier, will be
the first customer for Ennovate's main product, which allows
corporations to tie far-flung offices together with ``virtual
private networks.'' Ennovate anticipates that it will make an
initial public stock offering next year.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Sycamore and Ennovate products differ, the
announcements highlight the importance that major communications
carriers are placing on delivering flexible services rather than
raw capacity. Such capacity is largely becoming a commodity,
forcing big carriers to offer customized services that relate
directly to the core operations of their corporate customers. That
requires new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Sycamore product could prove revolutionary. Optical
technology has been widely used for at least a decade to transmit
data between fixed points. But the network ``intelligence'' that
figures out what goes where has remained electrical, increasing the
complexity and preventing carriers from manipulating light waves as
finely as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore's product may solve those problems, allowing
communications carriers to direct different light waves to
different places with mere keystrokes. That could allow carriers to
provide large communications links to companies on demand and for
flexible amounts of time. Sycamore intends to announce that iaxis,
a small, new carrier in Europe, has agreed to try the product.
</P>
<P>
   Ennovate's product allows a corporate customer to construct
national or perhaps global networks that appear to be based on
private, dedicated communications lines. In reality, that company's
data will travel intermingled with those of other enterprises,
reducing costs, but Ennovate's product will help keep each traffic
stream separate and secure.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the deal said that Psinet has agreed to
purchase $15 million worth of equipment from Ennovate over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   That is a relatively small number, but small numbers haven't
hurt Sycamore. The company posted only $11 million in revenue in
its last fiscal year and it now has a market value of about $19
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore's technology, however, is more far-reaching than
Ennovate's and Ennovate, based in Boxborough, Mass., is unlikely to
reach that sort of valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sycamore, based in Chelmsford, Mass., closed on
Tuesday at $247.125, up $6.6875, in Nasdaq trading. &QL;

SMALL BANKS WILL SURVIVE DESPITE BIG-BANK CLIMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The recent
dismantling of the banking industry's Depression-era regulatory
relic raises implicit questions as to whether this historic
development finally gives the industry's giants too much market
power.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reality is that the world of big banking is indeed likely to
get bigger, according to a St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank
economist. Nevertheless, he says, the liberalization of banking
regulations hasn't necessarily sounded a death knell for small
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy J. Yeager, in an analysis titled ``Down But Not Out: The
Future of Community Banks,'' wrote in the October edition of the
bank's publication, The Regional Economist, that small banks would
survive because of the personal service they can offer both
individuals and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, community banks, which are generally defined as
institutions with less than $300 million in assets not owned by
large bank holding companies, find safety in numbers. Of the 8,567
commercial banks in business during this year's first quarter,
Yeager notes, 82 percent were community banks.
</P>
<P>
   And while their market share is declining and probably will
continue to do so, their prospects are reasonably bright because of
the personal marketing touches they can offer. They have, for
instance, a particular edge over larger banks in the realm of
small-business lending, Yeager says.
</P>
<P>
   This edge derives from grass-roots knowledge of the local
community and its players not readily available to chain banks.
This is especially the case, Yeager points out, when prospective
business and individual borrowers are bank depositors because loan
officers can more readily and accurately track cash flows.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager concedes that improving technology combined with
deregulation have reduced some of the competitive advantages
previously enjoyed by community banks. This means community banks
must continue to distinguish themselves with innovative marketing
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   One area Yeager explores is what he calls economies of scale vs.
``economies of scope.'' Whereas large bank holding companies can
exploit economies of scale and thus operate at lower average costs,
for example, smaller banks ``can use their edge in originating and
monitoring small business by exploiting economies of scope.'' This,
he says, is the ability to produce two or more related products
more cheaply than producing them individually.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt smaller banks are a diminishing breed. From
1983 to 1998, the percentage of assets held by banks with assets of
$300 million and under fell 50 percent, while banks with $15
billion and more in assets saw their share nearly double. Meantime,
the number of $300 million-and-under banks declined nearly 40
percent, while the number of $15 billion-and-over banks increased
150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these numbers, Yeager appears relatively confident that
imaginatively managed small banks will find niches in which they
not only will survive, but also prosper. Much of that market, he
predicts, will be outside urban areas and among prospective
customers willing to pay a premium for personal service, ``rather
than just be another anonymous face at a growing regional or
national (bank) chain.''

KANSAS BOARD VOTES TO SEND SCIENCE STANDARDS TO REVIEW BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The saga of the Kansas
science standards continued Tuesday, with the state school board
voting to send them to an outside reviewer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a 9-1 vote, the Kansas Board of Education agreed to send the
standards to a reviewer, which the board probably will select at
its January meeting. Education Commissioner Andy Tompkins said it
would be February at the earliest before any reviewer would be
finished with the standards.
</P>
<P>
   In August the state board approved the standards, which are
guidelines for what students should learn and be tested on. The
standards have caused much controversy because they downplay
evolution and leave out some references to the age of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The standards reappeared before the board Tuesday for review
after substantial portions were rephrased by state staff members.
The rewrite became necessary because three national science
organizations, citing the August vote downplaying evolution,
refused the state's request to use their copyright material.
</P>
<P>
   Several state board members pushed for the review. Janet Waugh
of Kansas City, a moderate, proposed the move, saying the standards
approved in August were substantially changed from those written by
a 27-member committee of science teachers and professors. Those
original standards were reviewed last winter by the Council for
Basic Education in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bingman, a Shawnee Mission West High School biology teacher
and writing committee member, suggested the second review to the
board Tuesday. When he learned of the board's vote, Bingman let out
a whoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked, didn't it?'' Bingman said. ``It has to be better
than them just adopting them on the spot. Here's another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, another writing committee member, said the action
kept the standards controversy from fading away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it pushes everything back to February or March before
they even can get an external review and can act,'' Case said.
``Then what are we _ five months from the primary?''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 10 board members will be up for election next year,
including four of the six who voted in August to approve the
revised standards: conservatives Linda Holloway of Shawnee, Steve
Abrams of Arkansas City, Mary Douglass Brown of Wichita and Scott
Hill of Abilene. Moderate Bill Wagnon of Topeka, who voted against
the revised standards, is the fifth member up for election.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who helped write the August standards, said after the vote
that he thought an external review was an expensive redundancy. He
and the two other writers _ Abrams and moderate Harold Voth of
Haven _ based their document on the committee's standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if certain board members need a $20,000 comfort pill, I'm
open,'' said Hill, explaining his vote in favor of the review.
</P>
<P>
   Wagnon was the lone dissenter. He said after the meeting that he
could not support the process that led to the August standards. The
previous review cost between $18,000 and $20,000. Wagnon said the
board would pay that again to find out something he already knew
about the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fatally flawed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the board's open forum Tuesday morning, several evolution
supporters spoke. Some vowed to work for the defeat of board
members who supported the August standards. Others, like Bingman,
urged the board to reject the standards.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Ruden, a University of Kansas professor, told the board
he was representing a new organization called ROUND, or Remove Our
Uncivil Nonscience Delegates. Ruden called Holloway uncivil because
``she tried to file an arrest warrant for Steve Case.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway told the board as Ruden stepped away from the lectern
that she did not seek to have Case arrested. Later, during a break
in the meeting, she confronted Ruden, who was sitting near Case,
and told him his facts were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said she did talk to the Shawnee police about an e-mail
message Case sent her, requesting that she stop attacking him and
the writing committee or he would ``not hesitate to explore how I
can stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawnee Lt. Jim Morgan confirmed Tuesday that Holloway
approached police when she received the message. However, an
investigating officer saw no threat in the message. Police offered
to make an informational report for future referral, but Holloway
declined, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said she sought police help because she felt
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is what he said,'' she said. ``I don't know what he
meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Case has said he wrote the note after Holloway publicly
criticized the writing committee. Case said he considered her
comments slanderous.
