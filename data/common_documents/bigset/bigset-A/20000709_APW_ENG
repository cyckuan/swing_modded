<P>
	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) - Two people were seriously injured
Saturday when the light plane they were flying in crashed at a golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Vitvitsky, 55, and David E. Heim, 44, both of Lake Placid,
suffered head injuries. They were eventually flown to a Burlington,
Vt. hospital where they were listed in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   State Police did not know which of the men was piloting the 1966
Cessna 172-G fixed-wing single-engine aircraft. The Craig Wood Golf
and Country Club lies on the flight- pattern approach to Lake
Placid Airport.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known whether the plane was approaching the airport
or had just taken off. It was not registered to either man. l

<HEADLINE> Quake Jolts Islands Off Tokyo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIYAKEJIMA, Japan (AP) -- A volcanic eruption and strong
earthquake jolted a string of islands Sunday, cracking roads,
triggering mudslides and damaging homes.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude 6.0 quake struck the Izu island chain, about 100
miles south of Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The quake sent rocks and mud tumbling from cliffs, damaging six
homes and bursting a water pipe on the island of Kozushima, a local
official said. The tremor also triggered landslides on the nearby
island of Niijima. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Kozushima was hit by a tremor that buried a motorist
under rocks, demolished a shrine and buckled roads.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's pre-dawn quake came just hours after a volcano erupted
on Miyakejima, just south of Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   Ash began billowing Saturday evening from Mount Oyama, the
island's 2,700-foot peak. But no lava was flowing from the
mountain, and officials said there were no plans to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Miyakejima and neighboring islands have been rattled by more
than 34,000 quakes in recent weeks, including about 3,500 tremors
that have been strong enough to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 people on Miyakejima were evacuated last month, but
the order was lifted after experts said magma was flowing away from
the island under the seabed, lessening the chance of the volcano
spewing lava onto populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several eruptions in the last 60 years. In a
1940 eruption, 11 people died and 20 were injured.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 4, Mets 2, 1st Game  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A long day of baseball in New York ended with
the Yankees sweeping the majors' most unusual doubleheader in 97
years and Mike Piazza in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden and Roger Clemens teamed up to shut down the Mets,
giving the Yankees identical 4-2 victories Saturday in the Subway
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, everything went against the Mets, including the
traffic. They were especially angry after losing Piazza, who
sustained a concussion when hit in the helmet -- the Mets claimed
deliberately -- by Clemens' fastball in the second game at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''My player who's had pretty good success against their pitcher
got hit in the head,'' said Mets manager Bobby Valentine, ejected
in the opener at Shea Stadium. ''I've seen him hit guys in the head
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens insisted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't hit Mike on purpose. I was going to pitch him in,
that was the game plan,'' he said. ''But that wasn't how I wanted
to get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was taken to the Hospital for Special Surgery. Mets
spokesman Jay Horwitz said the catcher would miss Sunday night's
series finale, and that his status for Tuesday night's All-Star
game was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez homered and drove in three runs to win the first
game, then Chuck Knoblauch -- the center of controversy earlier in
the day -- hit a three-run homer to take the nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won for the third consecutive time in this Subway
Series, and took their fifth straight overall. Mariano Rivera saved
both games, ensuring the World Series champions would head into the
All-Star break in first place in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed like longer than one day,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said. ''My daughter came in looking for cereal at 6:30 this
morning and here we are at 11:10 at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was tossed after the first pitch of the day for
arguing an obstruction call. He played the first game under
protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first double-ballpark doubleheader in the majors
since Sept. 7, 1903, when the New York Giants played the Brooklyn
Superbas, later the Dodgers. Both road teams won that day in games
at Brooklyn's Washington Park and the Giants' Polo Grounds -- a year
later, New York city's subways opened.
</P>
<P>
   After the opener, many in the sellout crowd of 54,165 at Shea
immediately headed for Game 2, which drew 55,821. At both parks,
loyalties were divided.
</P>
<P>
   For fans, it took them about one hour to ride the No. 7 Flushing
train, change at Grand Central Terminal and catch the uptown No. 4
Lexington Avenue line to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, their bats and bags packed in an equipment truck,
left less than an hour after the game. They rode a bus back over
the Triborough Bridge to their park, taking only 14 minutes. A
closed-off entrance to the Grand Central Parkway sped their path.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had lunch at the Diamond Club at Shea while waiting for
the clubhouse attendants to do laundry, then changed into their
road uniforms and rode a bus to Yankee Stadium. A police escort
helped, but none of the highways were cleared for them.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (6-6), hit hard throughout his career by Piazza and the
Mets, struck the first blow in the second game, which began 3&AMP;frac12;
hours after the opener ended.
</P>
<P>
   He hit Piazza in the helmet leading off the second inning, and
the slugger immediately crumbled to the ground. Piazza, who had
homered in three straight games against the Rocket, was down for
about a minute and helped to his feet, and walked to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom half of the inning, Glendon Rusch (6-7) hit
Martinez in the backside with his second pitch. With tension
running high, Martinez calmly walked to first base and plate umpire
Doug Eddings warned against further trouble. There wasn't any as
the Yankees increased their interleague series lead over the Mets
to 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell and Edgardo Alfonzo hit RBI singles in the Mets
fifth. In the bottom half, Scott Brosius singled home a run and
Knoblauch launched a drive that escaped left fielder Lenny Harris'
glove when he hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't tell if he caught it or not. It was so far away,''
Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens went 7 1-3 innings, and Rivera pitched the ninth for his
21st save. Rusch struck out a career-high 10 in a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching from the very mound he once owned, Gooden (3-3)
celebrated his return to the big leagues with a win.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, traded by Houston and cut by Tampa Bay earlier this
season, pitched at Shea for the first time since June 24, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular players in Mets' history, Gooden faced
his former team for the first time. The Yankees signed him to a
minor league contract on June 11 and promoted him before the game.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, the 1985 NL Cy Young winner who helped the Mets win the
1986 World Series did not throw as hard as he once did, struggling
to reach 90 mph with his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden gave up two runs and six hits, keeping the Mets
off-balance with off-speed stuff. He struck out one and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones (3-4) fell behind 2-0 in the first inning.
Martinez's solo home run in the sixth made it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch led off the game with a hit to center field and was
thrown out trying to stretch it into a double.
</P>
<P>
   But first base umpire Robb Cook ruled that first baseman Todd
Zeile had gotten in Knoblauch's way, and awarded him second.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine sprung from the dugout and engaged all four umpires in
an argument, tracing Knoblauch's steps in the freshly raked dirt.
Replays showed that Zeile, though he never touched Knoblauch, stood
in his path and made him take a wide turn.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine eventually was ejected, for the first time this year,
by crew chief Dana DeMuth.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Zeile and Knoblauch met again in the fourth. Zeile
was called out for interfering with the Yankees second baseman as
he tried to field a grounder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bernie Williams' 17-game hitting streak was stopped in the
opener. ... Gooden won at Shea for the first time since April 16,
1994, when he beat Houston.

<HEADLINE> 2 teams, 2 games, 2 ballparks, 2 Yankees wins  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Fourteen minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On a summer afternoon, it can take two hours to get from Shea
Stadium in Queens to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But when you close two major highways and one of the city's
busiest bridges, put police cars and motorcycles ahead and behind,
travel in a Subway Series takes less time than three outs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like this all the time. They treat us good,'' Paul
O'Neill said after the Yankees zoomed home to the Bronx on Saturday
in the middle of their 4-2, 4-2 sweep of the Mets, baseball's first
moving doubleheader in 97 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, 9 hours, 23 minutes after the first
pitch was thrown at 1:21 p.m., both teams looked weary. The Mets
were furious Roger Clemens hit Mike Piazza in the head, knocking
their star out in the second inning of the second game with a
concussion. The Yankees were thrilled to stretch a winning streak
to five for the first time in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter came in looking for cereal at 6:30 this morning,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said, ''and here we are at 11:10 at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   And what a day it was.
</P>
<P>
   Just 48 minutes after the final out in the opener at Shea, the
Yankees were showered and back in street clothes, filling three
buses parked beyond the right-field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was open highway. When an unfortunate motorist
tried to pass the motorcade, he was pulled over faster than a
Mariano Rivera fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a presidential escort today, it seemed like,'' Andy
Pettitte said.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred fans cheered them as they left Queens, a few dozen
stood on overpasses of the Grand Central Parkway. Then, after they
went over the Triborough Bridge - three news helicopters flying
overhead - there were more fans cheering beside the Major Deegan
Expressway, some holding up signs.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:39 p.m, 62 minutes after the final out, they were outside
the big ballpark in Bronx, with 200 fans there to great their
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees were changing into their famous pinstripes,
the Mets were up in the Diamond Club at Shea Stadium, having an
early dinner, sushi included, with their families before their trip
to the Bronx. After the meal, there was this strange sight: road
grays hanging in their Shea Stadium clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like thousands of high school and college players, the
Mets put on their uniforms and got on the buses, already dressed to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like a Legion game or something,'' said Todd Zeile, who
videotaped the trip with his camcorder. ''The fan reception was a
little different from legion ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets traveled, police didn't shut down the highways and
bridges - they cleared only one lane. It took them 20 minutes, and
they walked in at 6:58 p.m., 70 minutes before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we went later in the afternoon,'' John Franco said,
trying to explain the second-class treatment.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets walked off their two buses - with another for
family right behind - there were about a thousand fans outside
Yankee Stadium, some chanting, ''Let's go Mets!'' others booing.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I signed here, one of the reasons was the passion of the
fans,'' said Zeile, who came to the Mets in December as a free
agent. ''This is something that raises the level of play, or should
test you as an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the major leagues saw anything like this, a tale
of two ballparks in one city, was Sept. 7, 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the venues were Washington Park in Brooklyn and the
Polo Grounds in Manhattan, just across the Harlem River from where
Yankee Stadium was later built two decades later. The New York
Giants won 6-4 on the road before 9,300 on that Labor Day morning -
first pitch was 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Superbas - as Brooklyn was known back before the Dodgers
nickname took hold - won the afternoon game 3-0 when Henry Schmidt
pitched a four-hitter before 23,623.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of that day don't describe how fans transported
themselves from ballpark to ballpark - trolleys and elevated trains
were available - or even if they did.
</P>
<P>
   This time, fans had numerous choices - subways (including John
Rocker's favorite, the No. 7 IRT), cars and even ferry boats. A
company even ran a promotion for 3,000 fans to travel gratis on the
subway.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, who usually takes the No. 4 train from
Manhattan to the ballpark, knew about the program, but took the
team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's free travel if you show your two tickets stubs,''
the Yankees second baseman said kiddingly, ''but I don't have my
two ticket stubs. I'm sure that they're a lot of people going to
both games to say they went to both games.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea Stadium had been filled to the brim, 54,165, with slightly
more Mets fans in evidence. Yankee Stadium drew a sellout, too:
55,821.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where traditions die slowly if at all, Mets' fans
still are considered by some to be baseball nouveau riche, with
only two World Series titles, unending noise from jetliners landing
at nearby LaGuardia Airport and that garish flashing home-run apple
in right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were America's team before there was an ''America's
team,'' the proud winner of 25 championships, whose field is
hallowed ground, containing monuments and plaques honoring many of
the sport's patron saints.
</P>
<P>
   Players have said the two-ballpark twinbill was an
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not just on fans, but on players, media, equipment managers,''
Knoblauch said. ''It's only fun if you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in the Mets clubhouse, all wasn't well.
</P>
<P>
   ''First problem of the day,'' Turk Wendell yelled out. ''I
brought two left shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   It only got worse. By the time they walked out for the bus back
to Shea, Yankees fans were serenading them. ''Sweep! Sweep!'' was
the song.

   BEIJING (AP) -- Rescuers pulled 25 more bodies from the wreckage

5 Million Americans Risk AIDS
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Roughly 5 million Americans have sex and drug
habits that put them at a high risk of catching AIDS, according to new U.S.
figures, and experts fear an upsurge of the disease after a decade of stability.
While AIDS infections in the United States have fallen dramatically since their
peak in the 1980s, public health officials worry that complacency about the
disease has caused backsliding -- especially among young gay men -- that could
bring AIDS roaring back.

defense project to intercept a dummy missile early Saturday suggests to some
analysts that the Pentagon needs more time to develop it. ''It's hard to see how
they can recommend a deployment decision of a missile system that doesn't

<HEADLINE> Tigers 4, Brewers 2, 15 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Tony Clark hit a two-run single in the 15th
inning to give the Detroit Tigers a 4-2 victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that stretched into Sunday over five hours and 20
minutes, Brewers hitters struck out a franchise-record 20 times,
including nine times in extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15th, Valerio De Los Santos (1-3) walked Brad Ausmus and
allowed an infield single by Bobby Higginson. After a double steal,
Clark singled to right for his only hit in seven at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers reliever Nelson Cruz (2-0) pitched four shutout innings,
and striking out six straight hitters in the 12th and 13th innings.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee nearly scored in the 11th when Dave Mlicki allowed a
two-out single to Luis Lopez and walked pinch-hitter Charlie Hayes.
Ron Belliard then singled to left, but Higginson threw out Lopez at
the plate for his 10th outfield assist.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the extra innings were quiet, with Brewers hitters
going down with alarming frequency. Ten of Milwaukee's 20
strikeouts were looking.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers led 2-1 entering the ninth, but closer Bob Wickman
blew his fourth save of the year on a walk and two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Becker, who scored Detroit's first run with a pinch-hit
homer in the eighth, hit a looping single to left with two outs,
bringing home Damion Easley with the tying run. Only Belliard's
running stab of pinch-hitter Jose Macias' liner prevented the
Tigers from moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third blown save and fourth poor outing in 10 days
for Wickman, who saved the Brewers' previous two victories, but
allowed four runs in one inning of a loss on Tuesday. His wild
inconsistency didn't discourage NL manager Bobby Cox from making
him the Brewers' All-Star representative, however.
</P>
<P>
   Wickman wasted an exceptional performance by John Snyder, who
held the Tigers to four hits over 7 2-3 innings in his most
impressive outing with the Brewers. Snyder gave up a third-inning
double to Luis Polonia, but then retired 12 of his next 13 hitters
before Easley's two-out single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Becker homered to center with one out in the eighth. Jeromy
Burnitz, who drove in three runs Friday night, drove in Milwaukee's
first run with a third-inning double, and Geoff Jenkins' sacrifice
fly scored Tyler Houston in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder allowed just two walks and barely missed taking a
no-hitter into the seventh inning. Polonia's double fell into
center field only because Marquis Grissom was playing exceptionally
deep. Grissom dove to make the catch, but the ball bounced six
inches from his glove.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Easley and Juan Encarnacion singled for Detroit.
Snyder then threw a wild pitch to Deivi Cruz, but catcher Raul
Casanova recovered the ball and tossed it to Snyder, who tagged out
Easley as he slid home.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also had his first two major league hits, both against
Hideo Nomo, who pitched well in his return to County Stadium but
got no run support.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, who resurrected his career by going 12-8 with the Brewers
last season, allowed two runs and nine hits over six innings. He
struck out seven with a sharp curveball.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit used eight pitchers. Todd Jones, the Tigers' only
All-Star, struck out four straight Brewers in 1 2-3 innings of work
in the ninth and 10th innings. ... Juan Acevedo threw two perfect
innings of relief for the Brewers. ... Juan Gonzalez missed his
second straight game and seventh in the Tigers' last 12 with
tendinitis in his left ankle. Gonzalez might be put on the disabled
list if his ankle doesn't improve during the All-Star break.

Clinton Urges Action on Drug Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused the pharmaceutical industry
Saturday of unleashing ''a shameless, scorched-earth campaign'' aimed at killing
his prescription drug plan for older Americans. Clinton urged Congress to act on
his proposal, saying they should reject election-year maneuvering and the
appeals of ''reckless special interests.'' In his weekly radio address,
broadcast live, Clinton said his proposal to help senior citizens afford
prescription drugs is bogging down in Congress despite what he said was great
support for it.

   MIYAKEJIMA, Japan (AP) -- A volcanic eruption and strong earthquake jolted a
string of islands Sunday, cracking roads, triggering mudslides and damaging
homes. The magnitude 6.0 quake struck the Izu island chain, about 100 miles
south of Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said. The quake sent rocks and mud
tumbling from cliffs, damaging six homes and bursting a water pipe on the island
of Kozushima, a local official said. The tremor also triggered landslides on the
nearby island of Niijima. No injuries were reported.

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair and

Sunday when police and soldiers block them from marching through a Catholic
neighborhood. Security forces readied extensive defenses Saturday on the eve of
the Orange Order march in Portadown that has inspired a week of street clashes

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The latest setback for the Pentagon's missile defense

quick push for a national anti-missile system. The failure of the missile
defense project to intercept a dummy missile early Saturday suggests to some
analysts that the Pentagon needs more time to develop it. ''It's hard to see how
they can recommend a deployment decision of a missile system that doesn't

<HEADLINE> Fiji Crisis May End Soon  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Coup leader George Speight said Sunday he and
military leaders were very close to an agreement that would free 27
hostages and end Fiji's lingering government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he hoped a deal would be signed later Sunday,
allowing the hostages to be released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement hammered out over two days of meetings,
Fiji's influential tribal chiefs would meet Thursday to choose a
new president. At the same time, the hostages would be released and
rebels would turn in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to sign an accord today which basically says that the
Great Council of Chiefs will choose the next president and vice
president,'' Speight said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He said a signing ceremony would likely take place at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The military would offer amnesty to all those involved in civil
disturbances since May 19 when Speight and six gunmen stormed
Parliament and took the government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The military seized control 10 days after Speight's coup and
installed Commodore Frank Bainimarama as head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Maj. Howard Politini agreed a deal was close.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fairly confident everything is pretty well wrapped
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Military negotiators already have agreed to most of Speight's
demands, including deposing Mahendra Chaudhry, the first Fijian of
Indian ancestry to lead the country, and scrapping the multiracial
1997 constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has so far refused to release the hostages in a dispute
over who will lead an all-ethnic Fijian civilian government named
this week by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry is among the hostages at Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday ,about 1,000 people attended a memorial service in
Parliament for a supporter of Speight who died of a gunshot wound
suffered Tuesday in a gunbattle with the military.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old victim, a member of the elite
Counter-Revolutionary Warfare unit, was the second fatality in the
crisis that has enveloped Fiji for seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He died in the hospital Saturday from blood loss.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of 28 additional hostages who were snatched Saturday
was unclear, but they likely also would be released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new hostages were taken by about 100 Speight supporters in
the town of Korovou, about 40 miles outside Suva.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages included soldiers, police and government officials.
Nobody was injured in the seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one percent of Fiji's 812,000 residents are indigenous
Fijians and many resent the clout of ethnic Indians, who account
for 44 percent and dominated the ousted government.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Hits Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- As a killer typhoon left Japan, another
one hit Taiwan Sunday morning, cutting power, shutting down
airports, and causing a grisly car accident that left one dead.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Taiwan, power outages in Taitung city and Pingtung
county affected more than 3,000 homes, while authorities canceled
flights, trains, and boats as the typhoon moved north at 17 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Kai Tak came ashore packing with winds of up to 93 mph, Taiwan's
Central Weather Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Pingtung county, one person died and five others
were injured when their cars rammed into each other at a coastal
highway. Officials said visibility was poor and the road slippery.
</P>
<P>
   Airports in Taitung, as well as the outlying Green Island and
Orchid Island, were closed. Highways near Taitung were strewn with
soil, tree branches and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   In the beach resort of Kenting many residents and tourists
ignored the official warning to stay indoors. They instead headed
to the coast to watch the waves crash against the sea walls.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, Prime Minister Tang Fei urged extra caution.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been particularly vigilant in handling
natural calamities following the 7.6-magnitude quake last September
that left 2,400 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saturday, officials have been urging residents to evacuate
the mountainous areas in central Taiwan which were struck by the
September earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Kai Tak was the second typhoon to have struck the region this
week. An earlier typhoon left 42 dead in the Philippines and five
dead in Japan. The storm weakened into a tropical storm Sunday as
it veered off Japan's eastern coast and headed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's toll included two 11-year-old boys who were found
drowned Sunday in a water-filled ditch. They had gone missing
Saturday after going for a ride on their bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year-old boy also drowned outside Tokyo after falling
into a swollen river near a park where he was playing.
</P>
<P>
   The other Japanese victims were an 81-year-old man who drowned
in a swollen canal and a 30-year-old man who was flung into an
irrigation ditch after his car hit a guard rail.

<HEADLINE> Treason Conviction Upheld in Kuwait  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- A Kuwaiti appeals court upheld the treason
conviction and death sentence Sunday of a Kuwaiti man who headed a
puppet government after the Iraqi invasion of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   An anguished Alaa Hussein cried out, ''This is not fair!'' after
hearing the decision. The 41-year-old has one more appeal. Death
sentences in Kuwait are usually carried out by hanging.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein lived in Iraq, Turkey and Norway before he returned to
Kuwait in January, saying he wanted to prove his innocence. He had
been convicted of treason and sentenced to death in absentia in
1993, two years after Kuwait was liberated from the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal court upheld the 1993 sentence in May.
</P>
<P>
   Nawwaf al-Mutairi, the lawyer for the former army reservist, had
told the appeals court that there was no evidence his client
willingly cooperated with the Iraqis. The lawyer said Hussein
accepted the short-lived post ''under duress.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Ali al-Rashed, argued Hussein just gave in to
promises of riches and power, and could not ''produce one witness
to testify he was forced'' to work for the invaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the text of the ruling, which was released later Sunday, the
court said it found that Hussein was ''fully aware of what he was
doing and chose to do it willingly and without being forced.'' The
court said Hussein refused to come back to Kuwait immediately after
liberation, staying in Iraq where he ''conducted a normal life,''
marrying and buying a farm.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal said Hussein and his defense failed to prove their
''under duress'' allegations or to provide new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was taken prisoner while driving his car to an army camp
where Kuwaiti troops were assembling to defend their country. He
had said in the criminal and the appeals courts that although his
mother was Iraqi and he studied at a Baghdad university before the
invasion, he had no connections to the ruling Baath Party and no
idea why he was chosen for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the puppet government returned to Kuwait after
liberation and were cleared of any wrongdoing. Many of them told
the criminal court that Hussein was as confused as they were in the
beginning, but as the days went by, seemed to enjoy ordering them
around and did not look happy when Kuwait was freed.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said he was under continuous surveillance by Iraqis, who
prevented him from coming home with the rest. When Iraqi
authorities allowed him to leave the country, he started his
attempts to return to Kuwait and was not successful until January,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant told The Associated Press in a recent telephone
interview that he has ''lost confidence in everything,'' and that
he wanted his four children who came home with him to go back to
Norway to live with their Iraqi stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian government granted Hussein and his family asylum
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Caregiving an Obstacle to Exercise  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Busy caring for others, many middle-age and
older women would go off by themselves to exercise -- if they only
had the energy.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of caregiving, a lack of time and feelings of
weariness are powerful obstacles to exercise, according to a
national telephone survey of 2,912 women ages 40 and older.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first national survey to examine how nurturing others
blocks a path to the nurturer's own better health, according to the
lead researcher of the report in an American Psychological
Association journal, Health Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are just beginning to understand how these caregiving acts
for children and other relatives can be quite burdensome and can
eat into their time to take care of themselves,'' said researcher
Abby C. King of Stanford University's Center for Research in
Disease Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The study was looking for reasons why few Americans -- only 9
percent in this survey -- get what researchers consider a healthful
amount of physical activity. Federal guidelines say people should,
at the least, walk briskly or use an equivalent amount of energy in
some other activity 30 minutes a day on most days.
</P>
<P>
   Caregiving duties, lack of time and lack of energy were among
the most common reasons. About one in five women, when asked,
believed that at least one of those barriers applied to her.
</P>
<P>
   Women under these pressures can't count on showing up at a
typical scheduled exercise class such as aerobics. ''They just
don't have the freedom,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   But many are looking for ideas on how to fit activity into the
time they have, King said. In the survey, 62 percent rated exercise
on their own, with advice from an expert, as more appealing than
formal classes with an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone-based outreach, in which counselors encourage these
women to be more active, and give them advice on how to do it, can
work, King said. Such a system worked for women ages 50 and older
who were caring for a relative with dementia, she said. The women
were able to increase their activity levels, and even get better
sleep, she said. Results of the one-year study were presented in
April at a meeting of the Society of Behavioral Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Caregiving will become an obstacle to more people as the Baby
Boom population ages, said David M. Buchner, chief of physical
activity and health at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. ''Women tend to live longer than men and tend, in the
older age groups, to be a caregiver for a spouse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   King's telephone survey demonstrates the need to develop
activity programs with less structure, Buchner said. ''This
encourages us to create a menu that older women can use, and they
get to pick from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government encourages people to work more physical
activity into their daily lives, including tasks around the house
and in the yard. Climbing stairs, trimming hedges without a power
tool and raking leaves count, according to the National Institute
on Aging. The NIA also advises caregivers to free time for
themselves by getting other family members to help.
</P>
<P>
   And a new report in The New England Journal of Medicine
underlines the benefits these women can gain. The project looked at
coronary heart disease among 84,129 women in the long-running
Nurses Health Study.
</P>
<P>
   The women reported no signs of coronary heart disease in 1980,
but the Harvard researchers found that, 14 years later, only the 3
percent who had good health habits kept a low risk of heart
disease. These women didn't smoke, ate a diet high in fiber and low
in saturated fat, drank alcohol sparingly, kept their weight under
control, and did moderate physical activity for at least 30 minutes
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those lifestyle factors carried an independent
reduction, so exercise by itself reduced heart disease risk. But
the more lifestyle factors the women had, the more benefit they
gained, the study found.

<HEADLINE> Work To Preserve Jamaica's Past  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   INVERNESS, Jamaica (AP) -- Fragments of 1,400-year-old red clay
pottery glisten from mounds of dirt dumped beside the gravelly
beginnings of a road running through the Jamaican bush over what
was once a Taino Indian village.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologist Dorrick Gray plucks one fragment from the dark
soil, doing his best to ignore the rumble of heavy trucks and earth
movers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we weren't doing this, sites such as this would be lost
forever,'' says Gray, who as chief archaeologist for Jamaica's
National Heritage Trust leads a struggle to protect the traces of
past civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Gray's six-person team of archaeologists has been
surveying land and cataloguing historical sites around Jamaica in
advance of road construction and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Their list of sites has grown sixfold to some 3,000, of which
about one in seven are former villages of the Tainos -- a native
American people who predated the Spanish and English colonizers and
the African slaves whose descendants dominate Jamaica today.
</P>
<P>
   The team is too busy to do much excavation -- the most they
generally can hope for, after some rudimentary digging, is to
prevent the wholesale destruction of a site and note its existence.
</P>
<P>
   With the village near Inverness, Gray and the contractor
compromised: the road couldn't be moved, so instead it was elevated
onto a 7-foot-high gravel foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They get the road, but are not digging up the ground under it,
so the site will remain intact,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   A small step forward in a land where development has tended to
trump conservation -- a situation that has more than anything
hampered study into the origins of the Tainos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jamaica is virtually a black hole in terms of archaeology and
cultural preservation and what we know about the Taino,'' said
William Keegan, an archaeologist at the University of Florida.
''The government seems to be insensitive to the importance of
cultural heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the damage wrought by construction, ''there has
also been a tremendous loss along the beaches and coves where
(Taino) villages were located. ... Foreigners come down and build
vacation houses and then everything is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Most excavations in Jamaica, and they are relatively few, are
carried out by American universities.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials more concerned with Jamaica's high murder
rate and providing essential services like education and health say
they are striving for a balance -- but most refuse to address on the
record an issue perceived as sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a country that is slowly beginning to understand the
need for archaeological exploration,'' said former Trust director
Ainsley Henriques. ''Perhaps (Jamaica) is not doing it fast enough.
How much has been lost in the mining of bauxite -- we don't have a
clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about the estimated 50,000 to 60,000 Tainos who
lived in Jamaica, which they called Yamaye. Within two centuries of
Columbus' arrival the Tainos who inhabited the Caribbean had been
slaughtered or enslaved. Their traces all but disappeared. Hints of
their culture remain -- such as in the English word ''barbecue,''
which they used to describe the rock slabs on which they cooked
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he thought the 10-acre Inverness site, discovered in
December, may reveal something about ''the interaction between the
Taino and Spanish,'' who dominated the island from Columbus'
arrival in 1494 to the British takeover in 1655.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt floors of Taino dwellings and a few chunks of Taino pottery
and Spanish ceramics have been found at the site. Holding the Taino
pottery in his palm, Gray compared it with a piece from the more
refined blue-and-white 17th-century Spanish ''Delph Ceramics''
found in the same pile of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to balance the country's need for economic development
and cultural preservation,'' Gray said. ''The hope is that we can
preserve a site like this until someone with the necessary
resources decides to do the work.''

<HEADLINE> India Cops Seek Minister for Torture  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- Police in India's most lawless state were
searching Sunday for a government minister suspected of torturing
two men for a month after accusing them of stealing his truck.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Patna, capital of Bihar state, registered a
preliminary case against state Cooperation Minister Lalit Kumar
Yadav, a day after three television news channels showed footage of
a truck driver pleading with a cameraman to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   The footage showed Deenanath Baitha emaciated and bruised from
what he said were daily beatings by the minister and his
supporters. The nails of his feet were torn; he said the minister,
Lalit Kumar Yadav, had yanked them out with a pair of pliers.
</P>
<P>
   Police also rescued Baitha's assistant, Kunwar Ram, from a room
in the minister's house.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were searching for Yadav, who is wanted on charges
of illegally detaining the two men and torturing them. If
convicted, Yadav can be jailed for at least seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm being subjected to third degree torture every day since I
was forcibly brought here on June 7,'' Baitha told reporters at a
news conference after police rescued the two men.
</P>
<P>
   He said he became unconscious after some strangers offered him
liquor at a roadside bar. When he woke up, he found his truck
missing. The minister, who owns the truck, detained him and the
assistant, accusing them of stealing the vehicle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident highlighted the lawlessness in Bihar, where caste
violence is rampant. Both the driver and his aide were Dalits, who
are at the bottom of the rigid caste hierarchy. The Yadavs are the
most powerful group in Bihar and are routinely accused of torturing
Dalits, causing caste clashes.

<HEADLINE> 30 More Algeria Deaths Reported  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- The death toll after a week of sporadic
violence in Algeria rose still higher Sunday as local newspapers
reported another 30 deaths, bringing the number of people killed in
the past week to nearly 80.
</P>
<P>
   The La Tribune newspaper said 20 Islamic militants were killed
in an army crackdown in the forests of Mizrana, east of the capital
Algiers. It said the militants belonged to the Salafist Group for
Preaching and Combat, led by rebel Hassan Hattab. Soldiers had been
scouring the region, believed to be a stronghold for the militants,
for a month.
</P>
<P>
   La Tribune also said three people were killed Saturday when a
bomb exploded in Keddara, 25 miles east of Algiers. Also on
Saturday, a soldier was killed by a mine in the nearby Dellys
region, and an Islamic militant was killed by security forces in
the Tassadort region, 60 miles east of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberte newspaper said two women and a 12 year-old were
kidnapped while minding sheep in El-Marsa, west of Algiers, on
Friday. Their throats were cut and the bodies found Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of two 15-year-old shepherds were found Friday and
Saturday near Sidi Bel Abbes, 260 miles west of Algiers and in Bou
Saada, 280 miles south of the capital. Their throats had also been
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a peace drive by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Islamic
insurgents continue to carry out attacks in this North African
nation. They have been fighting since 1992, when the army canceled
legislative elections the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was
set to win.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people have been killed in the eight years of
fighting since then.

<HEADLINE> Tainted Milk Hits Japan Again  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC PRIDEAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Harmful bacteria were discovered at a Japanese
dairy plant after three people who drank the company's milk said it
made them sick, officials said Sunday, in the second case of milk
contamination in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Murayama Milk has recalled four tons of dairy products and
temporarily suspended production, said company official Hiroki
Murayama.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier case, Snow Brand Milk Products Co. was also
forced to recall products and stop production when people fell ill
after drinking tainted milk. More than 11,000 were sickened in
Japan's worst case of food poisoning in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators found cereus bacteria, which can cause
diarrhea and nausea, in bottles of milk at Murayama's plant in Saga
state, said Tsutomo Kumon, a state official. Saga is about 560
miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Three people said they fell ill after drinking milk from
Murayama. A man, 37, and his wife, 38, said they developed stomach
pains, while a 70-year-old woman said the milk gave her diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three required hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Kumon cautioned that it is was not certain that cereus bacteria
caused the 70-year-old's discomfort, as milk commonly causes
diarrhea in elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials were still investigating the cause of the
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Snow Brand Milk case, bacteria allowed to accumulate in a
production-line valve caused the outbreak, which started when
residents began suffering diarrhea and vomiting after drinking
lowfat milk from the supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Cereus was among the harmful bacteria found in Snow Brand milk,
said Kumon.

<HEADLINE> US Sgt. Arrested in Hit-and-Run  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAHA, Japan (AP) -- Police arrested a U.S. Air Force serviceman
on suspicion that he drove through a red light Sunday and hit a
pedestrian, the latest in a string of alleged crimes on the
southern island of Okinawa involving the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Johnny S. Miller, stationed at the Kadena Air Base in
Okinawa, was arrested later in the day when he returned to the
street corner where he allegedly hit 27-year-old Takeya Higa, said
police official Jun Yogi.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 21, allegedly fled after hitting Higa, who was knocked
unconscious. A friend who was with the victim gave police the car's
license plate number, said another officer, Akira Toyama.
</P>
<P>
   Miller initially admitted the car was his, but said he was not
driving it. He later told police he was the one who hit Higa,
Toyama said.
</P>
<P>
   Higa, an employee at a local honey supplier, was slightly
injured on the elbow and legs and did not require hospitalization,
Toyama said.
</P>
<P>
   Police will now send evidence to public prosecutors, who will
decide whether to charge Miller with involuntarily inflicting
injury and traffic violations. He could face three years in prison
if convicted, Toyama said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was in the custody of Okinawan police, who did not know
his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the latest in a series of alleged crimes
involving the U.S. military on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Police on July 3 charged a Marine on suspicion he broke into an
unlocked apartment in Okinawa City and crept into the bed of a
14-year-old junior high school student.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, awakened by her screams, says she found the
drunk, half-naked Marine on top of the girl, kissing and fondling
her.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents were expected to spark protests during the G-8
summit that will be hosted in Okinawa from July 21-23.

<HEADLINE> Assad Nears Syrian Presidency  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Bashar Assad the man enjoys cooking,
scolds his cousins when they rely on chauffeurs instead of driving
themselves, is neat to a fault and follows an exercise regimen that
includes biking, jogging and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad the doctor has a good bedside manner and is precise
and inquisitive.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether such qualities will prove a
blessing or a curse for Bashar Assad the president.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide referendum scheduled for Monday in which Bashar is
the only candidate is the last formality before he succeeds his
father, Hafez Assad, as head of state. The elder Assad died June
10. It would be the first such father-to-son succession in an Arab
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Before his father's death, Bashar Assad, 34, held no formal
political office, no senior party post and no significant military
position -- the usual requirements for leadership in authoritarian
Syria. But since June, the political apparatus Hafez Assad left
behind has hastily elevated Bashar from colonel to general,
appointed him commander of the armed forces, elected him chief of
the ruling Baath party and nominated him for president.
</P>
<P>
   If the referendum on Bashar follows the same pattern as past
ballots on his father, 99 percent of voters will approve his
accession. Syrian officials say Bashar's swearing-in has been set
for July 17.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unlikely ascent for a man who, until 1994, was quietly
practicing ophthalmology in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar had pursued specialized studies in Britain after
graduating from Damascus University's medical school. The death of
his elder brother Basil -- widely believed to have been his father's
first choice as heir -- in a 1994 car crash brought Bashar home.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare Bashar for leadership, the late president sent him
abroad on official visits, giving him international exposure. At
home, Bashar's anti-corruption campaign made him popular among
ordinary Syrians and gave him a platform to eliminate potential
rivals within the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   He also pushed for modernizing his country. As patron of the
Syrian Computer Society, he has launched a drive to computerize
government institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Edmund Schulenburg, a consultant eye surgeon at
Western Eye Hospital who trained Bashar Assad from 1992 to 1994,
described him as ''intelligent,'' ''a good learner'' who was always
punctual. Bashar never went around with bodyguards and insisted on
being treated as an equal, Schulenburg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was quiet, he was unassuming and his bedside manners with
the patients were extremely good,'' he said. ''He's very
inquisitive and ... very precise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramie Makhlouf, Bashar's cousin, said the tall, lanky younger
Assad has his father's calm disposition, his humility and his
penchant for an ascetic lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''After eating, he puts his plate in the sink,'' said Makhlouf,
31, a businessman. ''At college, he parked his car outside campus,
like the other students. And he always scolds us for having
chauffeurs ....''
</P>
<P>
   At meals following early morning exercise, Bashar Assad would
ask his friends and relatives why they had ordered more dishes than
they could eat, according to Makhlouf.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't like to see anything going to waste,'' Makhlouf
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar, a bachelor, enjoys reading and cooking but detests being
surrounded by bodyguards, Makhlouf said. He said Bashar's faith in
God allows him to brush off concern about his safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a believer. He always says that He who has created him
will take him when the time comes,'' Makhlouf said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Discusses Mideast Summit  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If this week's Mideast summit fail to produce
an agreement, President Clinton predicts the region will ''slide
back into turmoil'' that will lead to more hostility and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, who are to begin talks Tuesday at Camp David, must seize
the movement to resolve the most complex and sensitive issues that
have eluded negotiators, Clinton writes in Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delay is no longer an option: the parties themselves have set
a September deadline for resolving the final issues dividing them.
Moreover, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict knows no status quo. It
can move forward toward peace, or can slide back into turmoil. It
will not stand still,'' the president says in the latest edition.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the parties do not seize this moment to make more progress,
there will be more hostility and more bitterness -- perhaps even
more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The states are high on all sides, Clinton writes.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs a peace that can fulfill his citizens' quest for
security and recognition and a real reconciliation with the
Palestinians, Clinton says. Arafat needs a settlement that fulfills
his people's aspirations to determine their own future on their own
land.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither side can achieve 100 percent of its goals,'' Clinton
writes.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the summit last week, Clinton said the two sides
were deadlocked on the key issues. The toughest appears to be
Jerusalem's future, with Arafat seeking to wrest control of East
Jerusalem from Israel and make it the capital of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have made some real progress on the ''final status
issues,'' Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
Sunday on CBS' ''Face the Nation.'' But the leaders need to hold a
summit because ''they've taken things as far as they can. They've
hit a wall and only now the leaders can make the tough decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ''This Week,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
declined to say whether the dispute had to be settled for an accord
to emerge from the summit. ''We have a responsibility to move
forward here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have suggested that if Clinton could not get a
total agreement the outcome could be a partial accord -- in
preference to a breakdown. There is talk already within the
Palestinian and Israeli camps of a second summit, in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not going to predict what has to be and not has to be
settled at this summit,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barak's political troubles worsened as his biggest
coalition partner, the Shas party, said Sunday it planned to bolt
the government and Foreign Minister David Levy, a moderate, said he
was not going to the summit with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our ministers are resigning from the government and we are
withdrawing from the coalition,'' Shas party spokesman Yitzhak
Soudri told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The move came hours after Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet
dissident, withdrew his Russian immigrant party over prospective
concessions to the Palestinians, including a toehold in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Party is leaving as well,
</P>
<P>
   Barak's strength comes largely from the left wing of Israel's
political spectrum. His concessions to the Palestinians far exceed
any made by an Israeli prime minister, including his mentor, the
late Yitzhak Rabin, who started the process of an Israeli pullback
on the West Bank in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were beginning two days of
presummit talks Sunday in Washington, with Albright and senior U.S.
mediator Dennis B. Ross assisting.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat were due to arrive separately late Monday at
Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington and go directly to Camp
David.

<HEADLINE> Gaultier Line Heavy on Paris  </HEADLINE>
By SUZY PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Who might be the new king of Paris fashion?
Welcome, Jean-Paul Gaultier.
</P>
<P>
   His Sunday haute couture show for fall was not only sleek, sexy
and modern, but featured Paris all the way through, from Eiffel
Tower dresses and shoes to Kiki of Montparnasse, the famous model
of great artists, printed on a jacket or a dress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love Paris'' was written in stiff velvet on an evening
dress, and the passion wove throughout the show.
</P>
<P>
   Guests crowded into gilded or wood-paneled rooms in a mansion
that once belonged to Anna de Noailles, a rather homely, but clever
fashion arbiter of the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Here were near-perfect clothes to suit models or women with a
few million bucks. From the admirable knee-length black and white
flocked tweed dress, embroidered with ''Kiki'' and paired with net
stockings, to the glimmering gold-beaded lame and moire long sheath
called City of Light, it was a glorious moment for glamorous
Parisians.
</P>
<P>
   After so many seasons of hearing that foreigners -- Japanese,
English, Italians, Germans, even Russians -- are taking the lead in
fashion, it's great to see genial French Gaultier get a big
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   He's a creator, no doubt about it. Many years ago he showed
maids' outfits, costumes based on Indians, Jewish traditions,
Eskimos and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is backed 30 percent by Hermes, and he's in stride with
his true talent: making clothes not only to show on runways, but to
be worn.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone could like the double-faced black wool trouser suit with
its draped-collar jacket and comfortable, slightly wide pants. It's
excitingly Parisian, worn with high heels and a net coif.
</P>
<P>
   There are no outstanding trends here, except black as a
leitmotif, and fitted cocktail and evening wear.
</P>
<P>
   A caviar-beaded red and black twinset with short black fringed
skirt looked easy to wear to the cocktail lounge.
</P>
<P>
   For Paris on a rainy day, the putty-shaded wrapped trenchcoat
was handsome with buckle fastenings, brown leather details to match
a leather skirt. The audience nearly drooled to have it, as
unseasonal rain poured outside.
</P>
<P>
   A grassy green draped silk velvet skirt and striped
t-shirt-style topper called ''the Seine Meets Paris'' provided a
witty recollection of Gaultier's fondness for striped sailor
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe de Paris was a perfect little outfit -- dark chocolate lean
leather pants and a cognac mink bolero with braided fur on the
sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury took in plenty of mink and sable, plus modern touches in
silk or sequined outfits in computer patterns. These were handsome
in various greens and rusty oranges, sometimes with Paris motifs on
the long dresses, which were inevitably slinky and flared at the
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The Flesh-colored georgette crepe Eiffel Tower dress with its
pearled and black lace embroidery was stunning, among many similar
elegant, embroidered decollete or backless evening gowns. Some
outfits even showed towering Eiffel Tower shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander McQueen at Givenchy showed his party animal side,
staging a disco scene to display his dressy clothes, in a huge hall
out at La Defense, known as the skyscraper or ''Chicago-sur-Seine''
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ''This collection is for a woman who wants to stand
out.'' Yes, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   His models, dressed in black with sparkly details, knocked on
the disco door. Then the walls came down, and everyone was dancing,
beginning with a fur-topped model in sequined black and white pants
that looked like paving stones.
</P>
<P>
   An amazing party number was a pyramidal tunic in gold and
turquoise blue mosaic patterns, over matching slim pants.
</P>
<P>
   While evening ruled the Givenchy roost, one semi-daytime outfit
stood out: a beige sweater with gold and black glittering sequined
sleeves, worn with a slim glen plaid skirt. Hardly for most
offices, but not bad for ladies who lunch and go out to cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Fur was all over the place, sometimes bicolored, adding jacket
interest to shiny, clinging pants. An Oriental interest added
fascination in beautiful silk kimono tops, dresses in lace with
Cambodian crystal headdresses.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly-nude number was fetching -- the dress was
flesh-colored chiffon -- and prettily sparkling with rhinestones or
crystals.

North Korea on the communist nation's missile program, considered a

   Jang Chang Chon, head of U.S affairs at the North Korean foreign
ministry, will lead his delegation.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials have refused to give details of the
agenda for the three-day talks or what a likely outcome could be.
But last year during talks in Pyongyang, North Korea rejected a
U.S. demand for a halt to its missile development and exports.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang said it will never change its missile policy under
pressure from the United States -- a position maintained during
three previous rounds of talks in New York and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   It has also reportedly demanded $1 billion per year for three
years to compensate for losses from curbing missile exports.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has warned North Korean officials that further
missile tests and exports would hamper their hope of improving ties
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kuala Lumpur round, the fifth since 1996, comes at a
time of lowered tensions between the two countries, and only weeks
after the first ever inter-Korea summit. North Korea's leader Kim
Jong Il met South Korean President Kim Dae-jung on June 13-15 and
agreed to work toward reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas fought a three-year war in the early 1950s. The
conflict ended in 1953 without a peace treaty. Their border is
sealed and heavily armed. Several thousand U.S. troops are
stationed on the South Korean side.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on tests of
long range missiles in exchange for an easing of U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Pentagon's missile defense project failed a
test intercept. The decoy was meant to simulate the kind of evasive
measures an attacking country like North Korea might use to fool a
U.S. missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket took off as scheduled. But the warhead-busting ''kill
vehicle'' never separated from the booster rocket and failed to
activate the sensors it uses to hunt down its target.
</P>
<P>
   The interceptor passed harmlessly by the target, and few of the
critical technologies of missile defense got put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million test was the third attempt at an intercept and
the second to fail.
</P>
<P>
   The United States identifies North Korea as the world's No. 1
exporter of missile equipment and technology and accuses it of
providing Pakistan and Iran with equipment or technology that
enabled them to test-fire medium-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has developed its own missile technology from Soviet
Scud missiles. Its Taepondong missiles are known to have a range of
over 900 miles.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is believed to have far more advanced missile
programs than South Korea. In mid-1998, it rattled the region by
firing a missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Push Afoot To Sign Up Kosovo Voters  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The United Nations has launched a
major push to register as many Kosovars as possible for the
province's first internationally supervised election before the
deadline expires next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the province's estimated 100,000 Serbs, however, have
refused to participate in the municipal elections, set for October.
A boycott would cast doubt about whether the vote can be the
legitimate foundation for democracy that the international
community hopes will end more than a decade of political oppression
and ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Serb leaders have refused to take part in the electoral
process until the United Nations satisfies their demands for
security against ethnic Albanian attacks and provides for the
return of Serbs who fled the province when Yugoslav forces withdrew
in June 1999 after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovo Serbs have never accepted Belgrade's effective loss
of the province. NATO officials believe Yugoslav agents are
operating in Serb communities and encouraging Serbs to refuse to
take part in U.N.-sponsored political activity.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for registration is next Saturday. To draw
attention to the upcoming deadline, the U.N. administration is
sponsoring a ''Race to Register,'' a one-mile run Sunday down
Pristina's main street with prizes for winners.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's chief U.N. administrator, Bernard Kouchner, plans to
enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   No date for the election has been set, and rules and procedures
have yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is expected that voters in Kosovo's 30
municipalities will choose local councils, which in turn would
select a municipal president. If all goes well, elections for
Kosovo-wide positions are likely next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the powers of the local administrations will be
limited, the election will be a key test of the U.N.'s capability
of building democracy in Kosovo. It will also test the ethnic
Albanian community's commitment to democracy and gauge the
influence of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the
dwindling Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   Previous elections in Kosovo were either considered invalid by
Yugoslav authorities or were manipulated, first by the Communists
and later by Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, a total of 879,137 of the province's estimated
1.9 million people have registered, presenting themselves at 196
local centers where inspectors verify their right of residence and
other qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is supervising the election, said Serb participation
has been low. For example, in four Serb municipalities -- Zubin
Potok, Zvecan, Strpce and Novo Brdo -- no one had registered as of
Thursday. In the largest Serb enclave of Kosovska Mitrovica, no
more than a couple of hundred Serbs are believed to have
registered.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, OSCE official Daan Everts met with representatives of
all remaining Serb communities -- including hard-liners and
moderates -- urging them to encourage registration so that Serbs
could take part in the political life of the province.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Serbs turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are refusing to register because we have no security,
freedom of movement, legal security and what's the most important --
there's no return of Serbs,'' said Oliver Ivanovic, leader of the
Kosovska Mitrovica Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Councilman sleeps out in trailer to clean up neighborhoods  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A few blocks from a majestic cathedral lies
one of the most drug-infested corners in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Open-air drug sales in front of the local bodega are common
during morning rush hour. Residents peek out worriedly from behind
doors and complain of gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled neighborhood has become the summer home of
Councilman Cory Booker, 31-year-old Stanford and Yale graduate,
Rhodes scholar, native of the well-off suburb of Harrington Park.
In May, Booker moved into a 1987 motor home and planted it in front
of a housing project, daring drug dealers to continue their work
under his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Booker's four-month trailer tour of the city's poorest, neediest
streets is the freshman councilman's latest, brash attempt to
expose poverty and drive out crime simply by putting himself in the
middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he slept in a tent outside one of the city's most
violent housing projects and fasted for 10 days until the city
promised to increase police presence and build a park for children.
Fresh out of law school in 1997, Booker moved to Newark and into
Brick Towers, a towering, low-income housing complex in one of the
city's worst areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers University history professor Clement Price called
Booker's antics ''rather unprecedented. They remind one of the
dramatic demonstrations of the 1960s when you would try to draw the
moral outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker is an earnest, philosophical sort who likes to name-drop
and quote heroes such as Thomas Jefferson, Mahatma Gandhi and
Harriet Tubman every few minutes. He said he bypassed high-paying
law jobs out of school to move to Newark, feeling an obligation to
share his privileged background with the least privileged people he
could find.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not that much difference from me and the drug dealer
on this corner who looks like me, who's my same age,'' said Booker,
a former college football player who seems too big for the armchair
inside his Holiday Rambler with mauve interior. ''Given the same
opportunities that I had, there'd be a dozen other Rhodes scholars
on this corner alone, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker relied on the votes of many of the city's poorer
residents to unseat veteran councilman George Branch in 1998. While
Branch won roughly the same amount of votes that he had every
previous election, Booker blanketed the housing projects to bring
out new voters. He now sees it as a mission to go to the most
dangerous places in the city to be there for residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people who have to live in those environments. They
have to live with that fear and intimidation all the time,'' Booker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Booker's trailer cost between $20,000 and $30,000, raised
through private donations. In May, he drove it to the corner of
Victoria Avenue and Garside Street, just a few blocks from the
Archdiocese of Newark and the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred
Heart.
</P>
<P>
   He painted over graffiti at a nearby convenience store, held a
job fair and organized a neighborhood meeting. He went door to door
and asked residents what they needed - safer streets, jobs, in one
case a new refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything calmed down a lot'' after Booker arrived, said
resident Lydia Mendoza. Fewer crowds, which neighbors would usually
associate with drugs, filled the streets. ''It'd be nice if they
had him here all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Booker's critics, who include some neighborhood residents,
say his activism is more of a publicity stunt that produces no real
results. Booker's trailer didn't rid the neighborhood of drugs, it
just moved them to another block, said one former resident.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a few weeks or a few months, it'll go back to the
same,'' said Daniel Mendoza, Lydia Mendoza's son and an admitted
former drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Magdalena Arington didn't raise Booker's hopes that residents
would empower themselves to make things better after he is gone.
She said she wasn't happy with the drug dealing, but had no plans
to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just mind my business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Newark politicians have said Booker is merely trying to call
attention to himself to take him to the mayor's office in 2002, or
perhaps a higher office outside of Newark. A councilwoman once said
that he didn't actually live in Brick Towers, which produced a
storm of phone calls to her office from the residents at the
housing project.
</P>
<P>
   ''Publicity stunts? You're darn right,'' Booker says proudly.
''You've got to attract attention to a problem sometimes to get
something done about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the charges that he lives elsewhere, he says, ''One look at
my messy apartment and you can see it's very well lived in.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker says he is enjoying life in the trailer, which has a
bedroom, table for his laptop, extra beds for staffers who
occasionally sleep over and a kitchen with a stove he has never
used. Paring down possessions and space makes life very simple, he
said, and makes him more focused on his goals.
</P>
<P>
   He is undecided about his political future in Newark, but says
he will never leave. While he enjoys the renaissance of the
downtown, he believes the city's ultimate comeback lies in its
children. Until that happens, he says, he's going to fight drugs,
crime, slumlords and especially indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to put myself out there in scary ways,'' Booker
said.

<HEADLINE> Violence Mars World Cup Qualifier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Players choked and writhed on the field
and fans stampeded from the stands Sunday after police fired tear
gas at bottle-throwing spectators during a World Cup qualifying
game.
</P>
<P>
   Players from South Africa and Zimbabwe covered their faces as
tear gas spread through the stadium. There were no immediate
reports of injuries or arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium officials called the police response a ''total
overreaction,'' the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
   The violence began after South Africa's Delron Buckley scored
his second goal in the 84th minute. Fans disputed a referee's
decision not to award a penalty kick to the home team, a move they
felt contributed to Buckley's second goal.
</P>
<P>
   The game was called off with 10 minutes left but South Africa's
2-0 victory over Zimbabwe was ruled official.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe fans hurled bottles and other items onto the field and
jumped from the tiered grandstands to jeer the South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded by firing tear gas, triggering a stampede as
the crowd of about 50,000 tried to flee National Sports Stadium. A
fire hydrant was torn from its mountings, spraying water over
fleeing fans.
</P>
<P>
   The violence came three days after South Africa was denied in
its bid to become the first African country to hold the World Cup.
Germany was awarded the 2006 tournament in a 12-11 vote by soccer's
ruling body.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa made it to the first round of the 1998 World Cup
and placed third in this year's African Nations Cup. Zimbabwe has
never qualified for the World Cup and did not qualify for this
year's African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The game was one of eight World Cup qualifiers, all in Africa,
on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Seek Cheaper AIDS Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa needs to struggle
against HIV and AIDS with the same commitment it used to fight
apartheid, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela told a crowd demonstrating
Sunday for affordable access to AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of protesters gathered a few hours before the 13th
International AIDS Conference was to open to rail against
pharmaceutical companies, high drug prices and governmental
inaction that has kept people with AIDS from getting medication
that could prolong their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have failed to take HIV/AIDS seriously,'' said
Madikizela-Mandela, head of the African National Congress' Women's
League. ''That failure is a betrayal of our struggle for social
justice and hope for our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Madikizela-Mandela, ex-wife of former President Nelson Mandela,
attacked the government and drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the South African government saw how AIDS damaged eastern
Africa in the 1980s and 1990s, it wasted time on ineffective
policies and bogus drugs instead of stopping the epidemic from
causing the same damage in South Africa, she said. About 10 percent
of South Africans are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are marching to demand that a government that we have
elected puts the interest of its people before the profits of the
drug companies,'' she said, calling for the government to allow
importation of cheaper, generic AIDS medication and to allow local
firms to produce the drugs without patents.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the marchers wore T-shirts saying ''HIV positive.'' Some
carried placards with pictures of pharmaceutical executives,
calling them ''Drug profiteers.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd sang as it marched toward the cricket stadium where
President Thabo Mbeki was to open the conference. About 12,000
international scientists and journalists have come to Durban for
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's AIDS policies have come under a torrent of international
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The government has refused to finance a program to treat
pregnant mothers with the AIDS medicine AZT, and Mbeki has said
there was significant evidence the drug was so dangerous it would
do more harm the good. AIDS experts argued that the side effects of
AZT, a widely accepted medicine, were minor compared to its
effectiveness in reducing the chances the virus will be transmitted
to a baby during childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also said it would not make effective drug
therapies available to AIDS sufferers because they remain too
expensive, despite promised discounts from pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the president convened a panel of scientists, many of
them on the fringe of AIDS research, to discuss the efficacy of
accepted AIDS treatments and whether HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused Mbeki of wasting time, energy and resources
while the epidemic continued cutting a swath of destruction across
the world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the 34 million people infected with HIV or
AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 2 million people
died of the disease last year.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the conference, 5,000 doctors, scientists and
other AIDS professionals took the extraordinary step of releasing
''The Durban Declaration,'' widely seen as a rebuke to Mbeki,
saying the link between HIV and AIDS is ''clear-cut, exhaustive and
unambiguous.'' The declaration demanded that public health
professionals focus immediately on stopping the spread of the
disease.

<HEADLINE> Pennsylvania plane bombed New Jersey, then the real battle began  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The war between New Jersey and Pennsylvania
was over after only one bomb.
</P>
<P>
   A Pennsylvania Air National Guard plane dropped it on April 30,
1999, over eastern Burlington County, igniting a forest fire that
burned 12,000 acres of Pinelands in four days before being brought
under control.
</P>
<P>
   But that accidental act - the plane was aiming for a National
Guard bombing range - set the stage for a much longer battle, this
one for financial compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, more than 14 months after the blaze, the Air Force
offered indications to Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., that it
would reimburse the state for the cost of extinguishing the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli had said it was ''unbelievable'' that the Air Force
was refusing to pay costs incurred in fighting a fire ''for which
it was responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The dummy bomb that ignited the fire landed in Bass River State
Forest, more than a mile from its target, the Warren Grove Range.
The training bomb releases smoke so officers can identify where it
landed; the spark that activates the smoke was evidently enough to
start the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The fire burned nearly 12,000 acres of forests, wetlands, cedar
swamps and cranberry bogs. Using markings from the recovered bomb,
investigators traced it back to an A-10 aircraft from
Pennsylvania's Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Forest Fire Service sought reimbursement from the
Air Force for nearly $93,000, representing the costs associated
with fighting the fire. That is a modest amount in terms of
government budgets, but ''to us, it's real money,'' said Maris
Gabliks, forest fire warden for central New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have fire trucks that need to be replaced because they're
aging,'' he said. ''There are plenty of things that could have been
used for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabliks said state law requires that anybody who starts a forest
fire - whether accidentally or intentionally - has to reimburse the
state for the costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Air Force declined to pay, saying the federal National
Guard Claims Act covers only property damage, personal injury or
death, not reimbursements for fire suppression. The state Attorney
General's office appealed the Air Force decision.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli also pursued the case in Washington, drafting a
nonbinding resolution urging the Air Force to pay the bill of
$92,974.86. By voice vote, the Senate added the resolution to the
2001 defense spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Torricelli's office said the Air Force had indicated
it will pay up. The Air Force press office did not reply to a
request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gabliks said his research indicates the Air Force has reimbursed
New Jersey on several occasions since 1980 for helping extinguish
fires at the Warren Grove bombing range. But until the wayward bomb
of April 1999, all the incidents involved fires inside or
immediately adjacent to the bombing range, and easy to put out.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the first significant (fire) that was actually on the
wrong day in the wrong conditions, where it could get really big,
really quick,'' Gabliks said, recalling April 30, 1999, as dry,
warm and windy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a serious threat for that to happen again,'' he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   The Warren Grove Range is managed by the New Jersey Air National
Guard. Lt. Col. John Dwyer, spokesman for the state National Guard,
said planes from as far away as Vermont and the Carolinas fly to
New Jersey to practice at the range, which sees activity virtually
every day.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the National Guard's 108th Air
Refueling Wing, a total of 2,621 fighters, helicopters and other
aircraft ''bombed, strafed, fired rockets, and air dropped training
cargo at Warren Grove'' in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer said the range is known for its careful environmental
practices, located as it is in the ecologically sensitive
Pinelands.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian military officials wanted advice on how to clean up
their old ranges, Dwyer said, ''they were taken to Warren Grove.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Apologizes for Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israel apologized to the
Palestinian Authority for the killing earlier Sunday of a
Palestinian woman and the wounding of four other civilians, an
Israeli general said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident happened soon after midnight when Israeli soldiers
guarding a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip came under fire from
Palestinian guerrillas in a passing car, said Brig. Gen. Yair
Naveh, the Israeli divisional commander in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers fired at the car in which the civilians were
traveling, mistaking it for the source of the shooting, Naveh told
a news conference. He said it was ''a terrible mistake'' and that
the army offered his apologies to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire killed Atidal Muammer, 33, critically injured her
baby son, and seriously wounded her husband. Two other civilians
were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police said they found no spent cartridges in the
area and did not believe the Israeli soldiers who claim that they
were fired upon by Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The soldiers fired without reason,'' said Colonel Khaled Abu
Al-Auola, the Palestinian commander of the joint
Israeli-Palestinian patrol in Khan Junis.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli Army spokesman, Maj. Ran Adam, said the guerrillas'
cartridges could have fallen inside their car, leaving no evidence
at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Muammer died of chest wounds on the way to the hospital, said
Moawie Hassanien, a doctor at Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Her
7-month-old son, Hassan Sharif Muammer, was hit in the head and was
in critical condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza City over 200 people attended Muammer's funeral and
shouted: ''We will avenge your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah group fired
automatic rifles into the air and Palestinian police fired 21
volleys over the coffin, which was draped by a Palestinian flag.

<HEADLINE> Not for the faint of heart, New York struggles with millions of rats </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hordes of foot-long, mangy rats are the stuff of
nightmares. For the residents of the Lower East Side's Baruch
Houses, that nightmare becomes reality every evening when the sun
goes down.
</P>
<P>
   The rats, stirred from their homes by underground steam pipe
replacement, swarm over the city-owned housing development,
trapping residents in their homes and leaving city officials
shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to shake my keys and throw rocks at them just to get
out of my building. I can't live like this,' said Christine Morton,
a 22-year resident of the Baruch Houses.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't suffer alone.
</P>
<P>
   The rat problem is widespread in the city and Bill Perkins,
chairman of the City Council's Select Committee on Pest Control
estimates that there are nine rats for every person in the city -
bringing New York's rat population to about 70 million.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the highest estimate of the rat population - a
speculative count since the actual number is impossible to verify -
put it at about four rats per person, or about 30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're everywhere - parks, city-owned buildings, they're even
showing up in our schools,'' Perkins said, rattling off a list of
housing developments and city streets where the rats are so out of
control that people won't walk along the sidewalks at night.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins blames the growing problem on an increase in
construction, poor garbage disposal practices and a lack of
coordination in the city's response to rat infestations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in the past we had a much more aggressive approach
to fighting this problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents at the Baruch Houses agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''They come out and have a party here at night time. I've never
seen rats like this,'' said Kitty Person, who has lived at Baruch
for 39 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents say that although the rats have besieged the
housing development for months, it was only after news reports
detailed the predicament that the Health Department came in and
laid poison.
</P>
<P>
   But with little effect. Last week, the Health Department baited
the entire housing development with rat poison. A Housing
Department employee working on the new steam pipe said that he and
his co-workers found about 200 dead rats the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somehow I bet that was just the tip of the iceberg,'' said the
worker, who declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, shortly after dark, the grounds were crawling with
hundreds of the feral beasts, brazenly picking their way through
the tenants' garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are an extraordinarily adaptable and hardy breed,'' said
Dr. Patrick Thomas, curator of mammals at the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Norway rats- which are the variety most commonly seen in New
York - were introduced to America by the first European settlers
and are primarily nocturnal creatures, Thomas explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are extreme generalists - meaning they have a very wide
range of food items in their diets. ... They will consume things
that we don't generally consider food, such as soap or leather,''
Thomas said. ''They are very comfortable around human activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many observers say they've seen rats as large as house
cats, Thomas said they generally don't get heavier than a pound.
</P>
<P>
   When they grow bigger than that, said Perkins, it's because
they're overfed on garbage that is not disposed of properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are feeding rats by the manner in which we are containing
our garbage,'' he said, likening the practice of leaving plastic
garbage bags on street corners to a ticking time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''The black bags are not a solution - they are rat feeders, not
rat beaters,'' he said. He believes the solution begins with
securely covered garbage cans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to educate people on how to interact with government
to better deal with this kind of problem. We must make a more
grassroots effort to combat this so the government doesn't, in
effect, have to become the ratbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a notion the Health Department welcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rodent control as an activity is something in which we all
play a part,'' Health Department spokesman John Gadd says. ''We can
only succeed in an area with the full cooperation of the community,
with landlords keeping their buildings clean, and residents
throwing their garbage out properly.''
</P>
<P>
   This does little to calm Kitty Person's nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some nights I feel they might just lift my building right up
off the ground,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> For Long Island man, three-week vacation becomes six-month horror  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) - William Labrador's three-week Caribbean
holiday has stretched on for six months. But he's hardly enjoying
the pleasures of the island of Tortola - he's in jail charged with
a murder he says he knows nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador, 36, a Manhattan public relations man, went to the
island about 60 miles east of Puerto Rico in late December to surf
and celebrate the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, days before his planned return, Labrador and three
friends were arrested and charged with the death of Lois McMillen,
a 34-year-old abstract artist and feminist from Middlebury, Conn.,
who was visiting her parents at their island villa.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador and his friends have been in a mountaintop jail since
as his mother, who is from Southampton, spearheads a campaign for
his freedom, contacting political figures, the State Department and
the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all a big mess,'' a soft-spoken Labrador said in a
telephone interview from jail. ''I can't help but imagine that this
is what purgatory is like.
</P>
<P>
   ''But,'' he added, ''I have faith. I know in my heart I am
innocent. I just keeping saying to myself I have to let the process
find me not guilty. I am powerless to do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   When arrested, Labrador was staying with a friend, Michael
Spicer, 36. Over the past 10 years, he has made numerous visits to
a home owned by Spicer's family on Tortola, part of the British
Virgin chain.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador said McMillen stopped by Spicer's house on Thursday,
Jan. 13. Then he, McMillen, Spicer and a friend of Spicer, Evan
George, 22, of Washington, D.C., had drinks and chicken wings at a
bar. Labrador said he returned alone to Spicer's house about 7 p.m.
while the others visited another nightspot. That was the last time
he saw McMillen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, the three men and another Spicer house guest,
Alex Benedetto, 34, of Manhattan, hiked all day and had an evening
barbecue. Labrador said he then went to bed and the three others
headed off to a nearby bar. He heard them come back around 2:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the police came to Spicer's and arrested the four
men, charging them with murdering McMillen, whose fully clothed
body had been found that morning near the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the men were seen with McMillen in the days before
her death and quoted a witness as saying he saw the victim walking
alone on the beach Friday night, followed by three shadowy figures
whom he could not identify.
</P>
<P>
   McMillen's parents said she drove to the Jolly Roger nightclub
by herself that Friday, and the club's bartender said McMillen left
alone about 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''To us, this is a mystery, but I'm sure they will find out who
did this to my daughter,'' McMillen's mother, Josephine, said by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador says he hardly knew McMillen, having met her only
twice. One of the men arrested with him, Benedetto, admitted to
having an affair with the woman several years ago but said it ended
amicably.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard is conducting DNA tests on a stained shirt and a
sneaker seized from the defendants to determine if the stains are
blood and, if so, whose blood, said prosecutor Terrence Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The results are to be presented at a hearing set for July 25. If
there is evidence linking any of the men to the death, a trial
would not be held until at least October when the high court sits.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Gonsalves, an attorney representing Labrador, said that
the case is dragging on because ''the prosecution has been tardy in
sending out the items for testing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said tests were done in Barbados and Jamaica before the
seized items were sent to London. A hearing to examine the evidence
has been postponed several times.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador's mother, Barbara, chairwoman of the Southampton Town
Zoning Board of Appeals, visits him as often as she can. ''I think
it has been a horrendous mistake from the beginning, and
unfortunately police did not investigate her death properly,'' Mrs.
Labrador said. ''The initial coroner's report stated she drowned.
Her bruises probably came from hitting the rocks. This was a tragic
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Williams disagrees. ''We are confident that this was
certainly a homicide,'' he said. The victim was beaten but there
was no sign of robbery or rape, he said. ''We have a theory but I
am not going to try this in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Labrador remains in a 6- by 12-foot cell in her
Majesty's Prison at Balsam Ghut. Labrador says he spends his days
in prayer and meditation, or he writes in a diary and reads under
the single lightbulb dangling from the ceiling. He says the guards
treat him well but the food is not very appetizing. He's lost 20
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   During his hour exercise period, he jogs in a small fenced area
overlooking the glistening sea. ''It is so beautiful. That's the
irony,'' he said. ''I am trying to live my life as it is now. I
won't get these days back.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ledge of the tiny window in his cell, he is growing a
garden in three plastic cups from seeds his mother sent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flowers are doing quite well,'' he said. ''They are
morning glories and forget-me-nots.''

<HEADLINE> GOP fundraiser faces trial on corruption charges  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - When President George Bush hosted a state dinner
for Korean officials at the White House in 1991, among the guests
invited to dine on baby lobster and medallions of veal was Yung Soo
Yoo.
</P>
<P>
   That Yoo was on the guest list with Frank Gifford, Sandra Day
O'Connor and other luminaries was no surprise. The Republican Party
valued Yoo as a deft fundraiser in Korean-American communities in
New York, New Jersey and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the roster of politicians with ties to Yoo read
like a who's-who of the GOP, including former senators Alfonse
D'Amato and Bob Dole, Sen. Jesse Helms and Gov. George Pataki. The
wealthy New Jersey businessman once even gave Pataki's wife, Libby,
a pet dog.
</P>
<P>
   But these days neither Pataki nor any other elected official
want anything to do with Yoo.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo, 63, of Glen Ridge, N.J., is scheduled to go on trial this
week in Brooklyn federal court on charges of campaign corruption
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from an ongoing investigation into whether the
Korean parents of three violent felons made $36,000 in
contributions to Pataki's campaign for governor in the mid-1990s on
the promise their children would be paroled.
</P>
<P>
   The deals allegedly were brokered by Yoo and a top Pataki
campaign aide, Patrick Donohue, at a time when Pataki was taking a
public stand against early release of hardcore offenders.
</P>
<P>
   One case involved an Asian gang member, John Kim, who was
convicted in a string of robberies, including one in which a store
owner was tortured with a stun gun. Authorities say it was no
coincidence the inmate was paroled after his father, the pastor of
a Queens church, and mother arranged more than $2,000 in donations
to ''Friends of Pataki.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also have accused Yoo of trying to funnel $40,000
from a South Korean yogurt company into the campaign coffers of
D'Amato and Dole in 1996. The scheme involved creating phantom
donors to bypass campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations have renewed questions about the murky
background of Yoo, an enigmatic defendant who once described
himself as a spy and was convicted in a bank fraud scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo has denied the latest charges, which carry a maximum penalty
of up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a court appearance Friday, Yoo for the first time implied the
governor knew firsthand what he was up to. He also tried, with no
success, to get the court's permission to replace his attorney,
Nicholas DeFeis, because DeFeis refused to call Pataki as a
witness; DeFeis refused comment on Yoo's request.
</P>
<P>
   A Pataki spokesman, Michael McKeon, called Yoo's comments ''a
last-minute desperate act by a very desperate man. He noted that
the U.S. Attorney's office has said there is no evidence Pataki,
D'Amato or Dole was aware of any illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that what members of this administration did was
right and proper,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no one close to Pataki has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   But three parole officials have been charged or convicted of
lying to authorities investigating allegations of influence
peddling, and some of the governor's top aides have been called to
testify before a grand jury. One of the officials claimed in a
guilty plea that he had been ''instructed to communicate the
interest of the governor's office in the release of (Kim)'' to the
parole board members who ordered the inmate's 1996 release over the
objections of Queens prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Donohue, though not indicted, has been identified as a
target of the investigation; his attorney did not return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The parole case is not Yoo's first brush with notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   According to news accounts, Yoo left South Korea in 1962 for the
United States, where he launched several business ventures, the
latest an optical lens company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Yoo testified before Congress that he had worked for a
Korean intelligence agency as it tried to hush witnesses in a
bribery scandal. Seven years later, he was found guilty in
Philadelphia federal court of forging documents in a $4 million
bank fraud case and sentenced to probation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his shady background, Yoo gained access to the inner
circle of the GOP by raising money - and giving his own. Yoo and
his wife reportedly made 45 contributions totaling $93,440 to state
and federal campaigns between 1988 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities targeted Yoo after a Korean man went to
police in 1997 complaining that he and Donohue failed to deliver on
their guarantee to free his son for $20,000 in donations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they later found documents suggesting that at
Donohue's prompting, Pataki's New York City staff pressured parole
officials to consider early release for three Korean-American
inmates whose families had made sizable campaign contributions. Kim
was the only one paroled.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeis said last week that before his client was indicted, he
was considered ''the man to see'' by Korean-Americans who wanted
their voice heard in Albany and Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ''He tried to do the right thing,'' DeFeis said. ''He tried to
help the families who came to him. ... But he never promised them
anything.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Tests, Counsel Curtail HIV  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Offering free sex counseling and HIV tests to
people in the developing world would curtail unsafe sex and could
slash infection rates by more than 10 percent a year at a
reasonable cost, new research suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Funding agencies have been reluctant to finance such programs,
which are widely used in the West, because no proof exists they
would change sexual behavior in developing countries. But now
scientists for the first time have gathered evidence that shows the
programs are a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   The research, published in the latest Lancet medical journal,
was commissioned by the United Nations and the U.S. government to
determine whether intervention would make a difference, especially
as HIV treatment is unaffordable outside the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The answer is overwhelmingly yes,'' said Tom Coates, director
of the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California, San
Francisco, who led one of the two studies. ''Risky behavior
declined by 35 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1,104 HIV infections were averted in Kenya for every
10,000 tests done in the first year of an intervention program
there, Coates added. That equates to avoiding 11 percent of
expected infections.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Van de Perre, a West African AIDS researcher who was
not connected with the studies, wrote in a commentary published in
the same issue of The Lancet that the research was ''reliable and
convincing,'' and settled the question of whether such programs
would work.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that 24 million people in sub-Saharan Africa
have HIV and that infections are growing by between 4 percent and 8
percent a year, Coates said. Between 25 percent and 40 percent of
the population already is infected.
</P>
<P>
   In Coates' study, which sought to determine whether the programs
do any good, the scientists recruited 3,120 single people and 586
couples in Kenya, Tanzania and Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ''People came in droves. There is no lack of demand for this,''
Coates said.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were randomly divided into two equal groups,
with half receiving counseling about their sex lives and HIV tests.
A counselor designed a tailor-made risk-reduction program that
addressed behaviors such as condom use inside or outside a stable
relationship and reducing the number of sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the other half were given no HIV tests and watched a
basic AIDS education video and a demonstration on how to use a
condom.
</P>
<P>
   They were contacted again seven months later. Single men given
the test and counseling reported 35 percent less unprotected sex
with non-primary partners, while those who just watched the video
improved their behavior by just 13 percent, the study said. In
women, the improvement was 39 percent in the program group,
compared with 17 percent in the video group.
</P>
<P>
   The video group were then given counseling and testing, and
another follow-up was scheduled for all participants six months
later.
</P>
<P>
   The people who had originally been given the tailored advice and
HIV tests had maintained their improved behavior and the ones who
had switched to the more intense intervention showed improvements
similar to the original group.
</P>
<P>
   It would cost about $27 per person to give the HIV tests and
provide counseling, according to Michael Sweat of the
Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, who led the
study examining cost-effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The cost per averted infection was $249 in Kenya and $346 in
Tanzania, similar to other AIDS interventions, such as treating
other sexually transmitted diseases. Targeting the program to those
most at risk of AIDS, people aged 20-35, would make it even
cheaper, Sweat's study said.
</P>
<P>
   Coates said it would cost about $350 million to roll out a
counseling and testing program across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Perre, of the Organization of Coordination and
Cooperation for the Struggle Against the Big Epidemics in Burkina
Faso, added that the challenge is no longer to prove such programs
work, but to make them accessible to those who need them.

<HEADLINE> Move Afoot To Sign Up Kosovo Voters  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The United Nations launched a major
push Sunday to register as many Kosovars as possible for the
province's first internationally supervised election before the
deadline expires next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the province's estimated 100,000 Serbs, however, have
refused to participate in the municipal elections, set for October.
A boycott would cast doubt about whether the vote can be the
legitimate foundation for democracy that the international
community hopes will end more than a decade of political oppression
and ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Serb leaders have refused to take part in the electoral
process until the United Nations satisfies their demands for
security against ethnic Albanian attacks and provides for the
return of Serbs who fled the province when Yugoslav forces withdrew
in June 1999 after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovo Serbs have never accepted Belgrade's effective loss
of the province. NATO officials believe Yugoslav agents are
operating in Serb communities and encouraging Serbs to refuse to
take part in U.N.-sponsored political activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's very destructive,'' said the Kosovo head of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Daan Everts.
''It's directly against the interests of the Serb community.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Milosevic government in Belgrade, Everts said
''they don't want them to commit to the new Kosovo society, to the
new Kosovo democracy. That's very sad, in fact, because they are
holding their own people hostage. They should let them go and vote
for themselves and register if they feel Kosovar, which they do,
most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for registration is next Saturday. To draw
attention to the upcoming deadline, the U.N. administration is
sponsoring a ''Race to Register,'' a one-mile run Sunday down
Pristina's main street with prizes for winners.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's chief U.N. administrator, Bernard Kouchner, joined the
race, which was sparsely attended. Ethnic Albanian men lounging at
sidewalk cafes under warm, sunny skies stared curiously as dozens
of runners -- many of them employees of international organizations
-- chugged down the dusty street.
</P>
<P>
   No date for the election has been set, and rules and procedures
have yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is expected that voters in Kosovo's 30
municipalities will choose local councils, which in turn would
select a municipal president. If all goes well, elections for
Kosovo-wide positions are likely next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the powers of the local administrations will be
limited, the election will be a key test of the U.N.'s capability
of building democracy in Kosovo. It will also test the ethnic
Albanian community's commitment to democracy and gauge the
influence of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the
dwindling Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   Previous elections in Kosovo were either considered invalid by
Yugoslav authorities or were manipulated, first by the Communists
and later by Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, a total of 879,137 of the province's estimated
1.9 million people have registered, presenting themselves at 196
local centers where inspectors verify their right of residence and
other qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the OSCE, which is supervising the election, said
Serb participation has been low. For example, in four Serb
municipalities -- Zubin Potok, Zvecan, Strpce and Novo Brdo -- no one
had registered as of Thursday. In the largest Serb enclave of
Kosovska Mitrovica, no more than a couple of hundred Serbs are
believed to have registered.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Everts met with representatives of all remaining Serb
communities -- including hard-liners and moderates -- urging them to
encourage registration so that Serbs could take part in the
political life of the province.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Serbs turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are refusing to register because we have no security,
freedom of movement, legal security and what's the most important --
there's no return of Serbs,'' said Oliver Ivanovic, leader of the
Kosovska Mitrovica Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Group: N.Y. pot arrests out of line with rest of U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Odds of getting arrested for marijuana use
or possession are better in New York than in any other state except
Alaska, according to a statistical analysis conducted for a
marijuana-law reform group.
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on FBI crime data, also shows a wide disparity
between the way police enforce marijuana laws from county to county
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The five boroughs of New York City, for instance, are all in the
top 10 among counties of 250,000 people or larger in America for
marijuana arrests per 100,000 residents. But Nassau County, which
borders Queens and Brooklyn, has the lowest marijuana arrest rate
in the state, one roughly nine times lower than New York City's.
</P>
<P>
   The second-lowest county marijuana arrest rate was in
Westchester, which borders New York City to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were compiled and analyzed for the NORML
Foundation, the research arm of the Washington, D.C.-based group
the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws. The
foundation's executive director Allen St. Pierre said the study
shows the arbitrary and excessive enforcement of marijuana laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''One can look and properly question why one jurisdiction has
350 arrests (per 100,000) a year and another nearby will have
100,'' St. Pierre said. ''Why is there a disparity? It really can't
be that there are three times more people using marijuana in the
next county.''
</P>
<P>
   The state averaged 404.6 marijuana arrests per 100,000 residents
in 1997, the last year analyzed in the study, second only to
Alaska's rate of 417.7. The national average was 256 arrests per
100,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre said the numbers contain no great mysteries. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's policy of ridding the streets of New York City
of lawbreakers has been aimed squarely at the low-level
''nuisance'' kind of offenders like aggressive panhandlers,
windshield washers and marijuana smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Pierre argued that activities by New York City police
officers run counter to the intent of New York state's
decriminalization of the possession of less than an ounce of
marijuana. New York City police officers are going too far by
arresting people - sometimes keeping them in jail overnight or over
a weekend until they can be arraigned - when they should be writing
violators a ticket and letting them go on their way.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of this seems extraordinarily excessive when the
Legislature intended for this to be treated like a speeding
ticket,'' St. Pierre said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said
the NORML-commissioned study suggests ''serious and substantial
civil liberties questions regarding the exceptionally high number
of marijuana arrests in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The figures are very troubling,'' Siegel said. ''Should we be
arresting people for possessing a joint of marijuana? It is
reminiscent of the '20s when people were arrested for drinking a
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said the disparity between New York City's marijuana
arrest numbers and those in nearby counties also raises doubts
about the equal application of the law by authorities in the city.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to comment on the arrest statistics, Det. Walter
Burnes of the New York Police Department responded, ''Smoking
marijuana is against the law and the New York City Police
Department enforces the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The five boroughs of New York City had per-100,000 marijuana
arrest rates of between 646.7 (Manhattan) and 632.4 (Brooklyn).
</P>
<P>
   The highest arrest rate in the state was in Greene County, at
895.5 arrests per 100,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The rural county just south of Albany has long been favored
territory for commercial marijuana growers, Sheriff Richard Hussey
said. In addition, state police patrol the state Thruway which runs
through Greene County, including the New Baltimore rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are places on the road where troopers can really eyeball
the cars,'' Hussey said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre said that in addition to counties along major
roadways like the Thruway, resort areas where young people
congregate also tend to have higher-than-average marijuana arrest
rates.

	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) - Two men remained in critical condition
Sunday after their light plane crashed on a golf course the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Vitvitsky, 55, and David E. Heim, 44, of Lake Placid,
suffered head injuries in the Saturday night crash at the Craig

</P>
<P>
   They were being treated Sunday at Fletcher Allen Health Care in
Burlington, Vt., where they were flown after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   State Police did not know which of the men was piloting the
Cessna 172-G fixed-wing single-engine aircraft. The town of North
Elba municipal golf course is on the flight- pattern approach to
Lake Placid Airport. It was not known whether the plane was
approaching the airport or had just taken off.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has been contacted and will
investigate the crash, reported the Plattsburgh Press-Republican.

<HEADLINE> GOP fundraiser from NJ faces trial on corruption charges  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - When President George Bush hosted a state dinner
for Korean officials at the White House in 1991, among the guests
invited to dine on baby lobster and medallions of veal was Yung Soo
Yoo.
</P>
<P>
   That Yoo was on the guest list with Frank Gifford, Sandra Day
O'Connor and other luminaries was no surprise. The Republican Party
valued the wealthy New Jersey businessman as a deft fundraiser in
Korean-American communities in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the roster of politicians with ties to Yoo read
like a who's-who of the GOP, including former senators Alfonse
D'Amato and Bob Dole, Sen. Jesse Helms and Gov. George Pataki. Yoo,
of Glen Ridge, N.J., once even gave Pataki's wife, Libby, a pet
dog.
</P>
<P>
   But these days neither Pataki nor any other elected official
want anything to do with Yoo.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo, 63, is scheduled to go on trial this week in Brooklyn
federal court on charges of campaign corruption and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from an ongoing investigation into whether the
Korean parents of three violent felons made $36,000 in
contributions to Pataki's campaign for governor in the mid-1990s on
the promise their children would be paroled.
</P>
<P>
   The deals allegedly were brokered by Yoo and a top Pataki
campaign aide, Patrick Donohue, at a time when Pataki was taking a
public stand against early release of hardcore offenders.
</P>
<P>
   One case involved an Asian gang member, John Kim, who was
convicted in a string of robberies, including one in which a store
owner was tortured with a stun gun. Authorities say it was no
coincidence the inmate was paroled after his father, the pastor of
a Queens church, and mother arranged more than $2,000 in donations
to ''Friends of Pataki.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also have accused Yoo of trying to funnel $40,000
from a South Korean yogurt company into the campaign coffers of
D'Amato and Dole in 1996. The scheme involved creating phantom
donors to bypass campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations have renewed questions about the murky
background of Yoo, an enigmatic defendant who once described
himself as a spy and was convicted in a bank fraud scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo has denied the latest charges, which carry a maximum penalty
of up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a court appearance Friday, Yoo for the first time implied the
governor knew firsthand what he was up to. He also tried, with no
success, to get the court's permission to replace his attorney,
Nicholas DeFeis, because DeFeis refused to call Pataki as a
witness; DeFeis refused comment on Yoo's request.
</P>
<P>
   A Pataki spokesman, Michael McKeon, called Yoo's comments ''a
last-minute desperate act by a very desperate man. He noted that
the U.S. Attorney's office has said there is no evidence Pataki,
D'Amato or Dole was aware of any illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that what members of this administration did was
right and proper,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no one close to Pataki has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   But three parole officials have been charged or convicted of
lying to authorities investigating allegations of influence
peddling, and some of the governor's top aides have been called to
testify before a grand jury. One of the officials claimed in a
guilty plea that he had been ''instructed to communicate the
interest of the governor's office in the release of (Kim)'' to the
parole board members who ordered the inmate's 1996 release over the
objections of Queens prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Donohue, though not indicted, has been identified as a
target of the investigation; his attorney did not return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The parole case is not Yoo's first brush with notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   According to news accounts, Yoo left South Korea in 1962 for the
United States, where he launched several business ventures, the
latest an optical lens company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Yoo testified before Congress that he had worked for a
Korean intelligence agency as it tried to hush witnesses in a
bribery scandal. Seven years later, he was found guilty in
Philadelphia federal court of forging documents in a $4 million
bank fraud case and sentenced to probation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his shady background, Yoo gained access to the inner
circle of the GOP by raising money - and giving his own. Yoo and
his wife reportedly made 45 contributions totaling $93,440 to state
and federal campaigns between 1988 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities targeted Yoo after a Korean man went to
police in 1997 complaining that he and Donohue failed to deliver on
their guarantee to free his son for $20,000 in donations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they later found documents suggesting that at
Donohue's prompting, Pataki's New York City staff pressured parole
officials to consider early release for three Korean-American
inmates whose families had made sizable campaign contributions. Kim
was the only one paroled.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeis said last week that before his client was indicted, he
was considered ''the man to see'' by Korean-Americans who wanted
their voice heard in Albany and Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ''He tried to do the right thing,'' DeFeis said. ''He tried to
help the families who came to him. ... But he never promised them
anything.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Hostage Crisis Over  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Rebels who have held Fiji's government hostage
for 52 days got much of what they were looking for Sunday, signing
a deal to release their captives in return for destruction of the
country's multiracial democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between the rebels and Fiji's military government
calls for the captives to be freed Thursday, ending this Pacific
island nation's long hostage crisis. But Commodore Frank
Bainimarama, the military head of state, was not celebrating: He
looked morose as he bowed to indigenous Fijian rebel leader George
Speight's demands to disenfranchise Fiji's ethnic Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
   The move signed away Fiji's democracy -- and possibly its
economic future.
</P>
<P>
   Speight acknowledged Fiji would be shunned by the international
community as a result of his actions, but he was unrepentant. He
smiled as he signed the deal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a path that has begun in a manner which to the world at
large ... they do not condone or accept,'' Speight said. ''I
totally understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels stormed Fiji's Parliament on May 19 and took several
dozen hostages, including now-deposed Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry. They demanded that the country's multiracial constitution
be scrapped and that Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime
minister, be deposed.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which took control of Fiji 10 days after the
hostages were seized, agreed to those demands Sunday. It also
granted Speight and his henchmen immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he would release Chaudhry and the 26 other hostages
Thursday and turn in arms held by his rebels. After that, Fijian
tribal chiefs are expected to name an interim government that will
guide Fiji to elections under a new constitution curtailing ethnic
Indian political rights.
</P>
<P>
   The exact nature of the new constitution will not be known for
months, but the makeup of the new government should be clear by
week's end. It is unlikely to include any Fijians of Indian
descent.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian community did not immediately react. But many have
said in recent weeks that if Speight got his way, they would leave
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji will almost certainly be slapped with sanctions from
countries including the United States, trading partners Australia
and New Zealand and the European Union, which buys Fijian sugar,
the country's cash crop, at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ''is not the end, it is the beginning of a long
journey,'' a somber Bainimarama said. ''We must be united.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff here has pitted Fiji's poor indigenous majority
against its relatively affluent Indian minority, whose ancestors
were brought to Fiji by English colonialists over a century ago to
work in the country's rich sugar cane fields. Indo-Fijians make up
44 percent of the nation's 812,000 people. Many of the indigenous
Fijians who comprise 51 percent of the population resent the
Indians' economic clout.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Indian sentiment was unleashed a year ago when Chaudhry
became Fiji's first prime minister of Indian descent. During his
yearlong tenure, Chaudhry angered many indigenous Fijians by
refusing to allow higher rents to be charged to Indian sugar cane
farmers on land owned communally by indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, the hostage-takers' leader, has capitalized on that
anger in what he calls a battle for the rights of indigenous
Fijians. In the days after he stormed Parliament, anti-Indian
violence broke out across the nation. Gutted Indian shops and
burned-out Indian restaurants are reminders of the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks into the crisis, the military had said it would no longer
negotiate with the rebels. But it returned to the table following a
wave of civil unrest: Local landowners shut down a major
hydroelectric power station and villagers blocked the main road
linking Suva, the capital, with Nadi, where the international
airport is located.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Speight and about 500 supporters walked less than a
mile from Parliament to the vice president's official residence for
the signing of the deal. His supporters chanted hymns and clapped
rhythmically as they walked, some waving palm fronds.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a small table in front of a large traditional painting
on the rear lawn of the residence, Bainimarama signed the agreement
first, followed by Speight, dressed in a jacket, tie and
traditional ''sulu'' skirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe what I started reflects a deep desire in the hearts
of all Fijians,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of 28 other hostages snatched Saturday in a town 40
miles Suva was unclear, but Speight will likely order their
release.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bronson Pinchot doing Shakespeare?
</P>
<P>
   Pinchot, 40, who played Balki Bartokomous in the TV sitcom
''Perfect Strangers,'' sings and dances in his role as a thieving
troubadour in Public Theater's ''The Winter's Tale.''

<P>
   Pinchot made his singing debut last fall in Broadway's ''Putting
It Together, a review of songs from Stephen Sondheim musicals.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was first in that show I couldn't sing,'' Pinchot said
in Sunday's Newsday. ''I hired a singing guy and had a lesson every
day for months. It was learn while you earn. Like the old MGM
studio system. Let's see what we can do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinchot is ecstatic about the new turn his career has taken and
about his new life in New York.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Prince William's Coat of Arms Shown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prince William's royal coat of arms was revealed
Sunday and included a unique addition -- a tribute to his late
mother, Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   The coat of arms, which marks the prince's 18th birthday,
incorporates aspects of the royal arms used by Queen Elizabeth II
and Prince Charles in addition to a small red escallop shell
derived from the Spencer coat of arms.
</P>
<P>
   The escallop motif, used by Princess Diana, has been borne by
the Earls Spencer since the 16th century and was a popular symbol
for medieval pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   The design was incorporated at Prince William's insistence, a
palace spokeswoman confirmed. The design was also approved by the
queen and Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a welcome innovation to incorporate maternal symbols
into the royal family's arms and it is something that Prince
William and his family wanted to do,'' said Peter Gwynne-Jones, who
organizes coats of arms on behalf of the royals.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Head Defends AIDS Policies  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- President Thabo Mbeki defended his
government's AIDS policies Sunday by telling thousands of AIDS
experts from around the world that he is simply looking for an
African solution to the scourge that is ravaging the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has endured a hail of criticism since he convened a panel
of scientists to investigate whether the HIV virus causes AIDS -- a
fact long-accepted by most AIDS experts -- and refused to provide
medicine to pregnant women to reduce risks for mother-to-child
transmission of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some in our common world consider the questions that I and the
rest of our government have raised around the HIV/AIDS issue ... as
akin to grave criminal and genocidal conduct,'' he told delegates
at the opening ceremony of the 13 International AIDS Conference.
''What I hear said repeatedly, stridently is 'Don't ask
questions.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, since the poverty in Africa magnifies every health
crisis the continent faces, South Africa needed to search for a
solution to the AIDS pandemic that would deal with Africa's unique
problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the 34 million people infected with HIV live
in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 2 million people died of
AIDS last year.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Mbeki convened a panel of scientists, some of them on
the fringe of AIDS research, to discuss the efficacy of accepted
AIDS treatments and whether HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused Mbeki of wasting time, energy and resources
while the epidemic continued cutting a swath of destruction across
the world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the conference, 5,000 doctors, scientists and
other AIDS professionals took the extraordinary step of releasing
''The Durban Declaration,'' widely seen as a rebuke to Mbeki,
saying the link between HIV and AIDS is ''clear-cut, exhaustive and
unambiguous.'' The declaration demanded that public health
professionals focus immediately on stopping the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki told the AIDS conference that he had convened the panel to
educate himself about the pandemic and to learn whether the Western
weapons against AIDS -- safe sex campaigns, condom use and
anti-retroviral drugs -- was sufficient to fight the disease in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel meets, South Africa continues its campaign to
stop the spread of the disease, find humane treatments for those
infected and help in the push for an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no substance to the allegation that there is any
hesitation on the part of our government to confront the challenge
of HIV/AIDS,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government has also come under criticism for
refusing to finance a program to treat pregnant mothers with the
anti-AIDS drug AZT, and Mbeki has said there was significant
evidence the treatment was so dangerous it would do more harm than
good.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS experts argued that the side effects of AZT, a widely
accepted medicine, were minor compared to its effectiveness in
reducing the risks that the virus will be transmitted to the baby
in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also said it would not make effective drug
therapies available to AIDS sufferers because they remain too
expensive, despite promised discounts from pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Before the speech, thousands of singing protesters marched to
the cricket stadium where the ceremony was held Sunday, demanding
affordable medication for all those infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the marchers wore T-shirts saying ''HIV positive.'' Some
carried placards with pictures of pharmaceutical executives,
calling them ''Drug profiteers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have failed to take HIV/AIDS seriously,'' said Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, head of the African National Congress' Women's
League. ''That failure is a betrayal of our struggle for social
justice and hope for our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Madikizela-Mandela, ex-wife of former President Nelson Mandela,
attacked the government and drug makers and said the country needed
to tackle the disease with the same commitment it used to fight
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Though the South African government saw how AIDS damaged eastern
Africa in the 1980s and 1990s, it wasted time on ineffective
policies and bogus drugs instead of stopping the epidemic from
causing the same damage here, she said. About 10 percent of South
Africa's 44 million people are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Madikizela-Mandela called on the government to allow importation
of cheaper, generic AIDS medication and to allow local firms to
produce the drugs without patents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are marching to demand that a government that we have
elected puts the interest of its people before the profits of the
drug companies,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Weight Loss, Activity Ease Pressure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Combining weight loss and exercise lowers blood
pressure more effectively than exercise alone, according to a new
study.
</P>
<P>
   Though a healthy diet and exercise generally are recommended for
the estimated 50 million Americans with hypertension, data have
been mixed on their effectiveness without accompanying medication.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 133 overweight men and women with untreated
hypertension found that about an hour of exercise three to four
times weekly for six months reduced blood pressure, and weight loss
lowered it even more.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''These findings provide further evidence for the effectiveness
of non-pharmacological approaches to treating hypertension,'' said
Dr. James Blumenthal of Duke University Medical Center, the lead
author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The participants' average age was 47. One group did aerobic
exercise including jogging, resulting in an average weight loss of
less than 4 pounds; the other combined the exercise with dieting,
attaining an average weight loss of about 17 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   All began with blood pressure ranging from high-normal -- 130
over 85 -- to 180 over 110. A measurement of 140 over 90 signals
mild hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the weight loss and exercise group lowered their
systolic blood pressure, the top number, by an average of 7 points
and their diastolic pressure, the bottom number, by an average of
five points. The average reduction in the exercise only group was 4
points for both readings.
</P>
<P>
   The authors noted that medication often is prescribed for people
with high blood pressure, including those who can't lower it enough
with diet or exercise. However, lifestyle changes usually are
recommended first because drugs may be costly and have side
effects.

<HEADLINE> Hypertension Reduction Studied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Combining weight loss and exercise lowers blood
pressure more effectively than exercise alone, according to a new
study.
</P>
<P>
   Though a healthy diet and exercise generally are recommended for
the estimated 50 million Americans with hypertension, data have
been mixed on their effectiveness without accompanying medication.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 133 overweight men and women with untreated
hypertension found that about an hour of exercise three to four
times weekly for six months reduced blood pressure, and weight loss
lowered it even more.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''These findings provide further evidence for the effectiveness
of non-pharmacological approaches to treating hypertension,'' said
Dr. James Blumenthal of Duke University Medical Center, the lead
author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The participants' average age was 47. One group did aerobic
exercise including jogging, resulting in an average weight loss of
less than 4 pounds; the other combined the exercise with dieting,
attaining an average weight loss of about 17 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   All began with blood pressure ranging from high-normal -- 130
over 85 -- to 180 over 110. A measurement of 140 over 90 signals
mild hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the weight loss and exercise group lowered their
systolic blood pressure, the top number, by an average of 7 points
and their diastolic pressure, the bottom number, by an average of
five points. The average reduction in the exercise only group was 4
points for both readings.
</P>
<P>
   The authors noted that medication often is prescribed for people
with high blood pressure, including those who can't lower it enough
with diet or exercise. However, lifestyle changes usually are
recommended first because drugs may be costly and have side
effects.

<HEADLINE> Puppy love leads to 'marriage,' honeymoon for Zac and Lakata  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) - Puppy love is leading to bow-wow vows for
two dogs that will ride a stretch limousine to a honeymoon in
Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Canines Zac and Lakata will go through a marriage-type ceremony
on Saturday. Zac's owner, Pat Higgins of the western New York town
of Alden, made the arrangements including the stretch limo ride to
the honeymoon capital.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins says the animal magnetism between the two German
Shepherds was clear when Zac turned down the temptation of a Burger
King Whopper to be with his fido fiance.
</P>
<P>
   The nuptials attracted the attention of the Animal Planet
television network, which will tape the whole tail-wagger for

<HEADLINE> Alzheimer's Epidemic Feared  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alzheimer's disease is increasing so fast that
more than 22 million people worldwide will be affected by 2025,
experts warned Sunday. They urged new research to spot the very
earliest symptoms -- subtle ones that can emerge a decade before
true dementia hits -- and hunt for ways to protect these people's
brains.
</P>
<P>
   Already, doctors have discovered that a mild memory impairment
sometimes confused with normal aging can progress to full-blown
Alzheimer's at a rate of about 12 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   This ''mild cognitive impairment'' is ''a slippery slope to
Alzheimer's,'' Dr. Ronald Petersen of the Mayo Clinic told
scientists gathered for the world's largest Alzheimer's meeting.
The challenge now, he said, is ''can we predict who will convert
more rapidly?''
</P>
<P>
   There is no known cure for Alzheimer's, which today afflicts
about 4 million Americans and 8 million others. Scientists do not
know what causes the sticky brain deposits that inevitably kill off
neural cells until memory disintegrates and ultimately the patient
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of risks are under study. Certain genes make some families
vulnerable. Head injuries may increase risk; high blood pressure is
a new suspect.
</P>
<P>
   People with more education, in contrast, seem at lower risk of
Alzheimer's. A study presented Sunday of Swedish twins where one
twin had Alzheimer's and the other was healthy suggests a love of
reading, as a child and adult, might be protective.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest risk for Alzheimer's is simply age: Alzheimer's
cases double with every five years of age between 65 and 85.
</P>
<P>
   With global population aging, ''We have an imminent worldwide
epidemic,'' warned Edward Truschke, president of the Alzheimer's
Association. ''If we don't find a cure ... more than 22 million
people will have this disease in 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, by 2050, 45 million people worldwide may have
Alzheimer's, a toll rivaling cancer, said Dr. Robert Katzman of the
University of California, San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be able to at least delay the onset of Alzheimer's
disease,'' Katzman said, because even a treatment that fends off
symptoms for a mere five years could halve the disease's burden.
</P>
<P>
   Battling Alzheimer's ''is going to be contingent on identifying
symptoms very early, before the disease has gained a foothold in
the brain,'' added Dr. Kathleen Welsh-Bohmer of Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has occasional memory lapses. Memory loss from
early-stage Alzheimer's is far more severe, affecting people's
ability to work and causing problems with language or judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Mild cognitive impairment, also called MCI, falls between normal
forgetfulness and early Alzheimer's. How to diagnose it is hugely
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   But Petersen reported Sunday that people with MCI specifically
have trouble with visual memory. Shown a drawing, for example, they
are less likely to recall it later than are other people their age.
</P>
<P>
   He said that 12 percent of MCI sufferers progress to full-blown
Alzheimer's each year, compared with just 1 percent to 2 percent of
normal elderly people who get Alzheimer's each year.
</P>
<P>
   A key factor appears to be the size of the hippocampus, a region
of the brain that is important for learning and memory. People with
a normal-sized hippocampus, as measured by an MRI machine, seem to
decline slowly. People whose hippocampus has started to atrophy at
the time of MCI diagnosis decline faster, Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us think the hippocampus is where the action is in
dementia,'' agreed Dr. Yakov Stern of Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He traced which brain cells become active during memory tests
administered while people lie inside MRI machines, and found that
decreased activity in a certain hippocampal region may predict
which patients' memory will disintegrate faster.
</P>
<P>
   Five studies involving 4,000 patients around the world are under
way to see if early use of Alzheimer's drugs or other substances
like vitamin E can prevent, or at least slow, MCI's progression to
full Alzheimer's. Results could come as early as 2002, Petersen
said.

<HEADLINE> Horror Spoof Takes Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Scary Movie,'' a horror film spoof filled
with foul language and crude sexual humor, was the runaway favorite
of weekend moviegoers, according to industry estimates released
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension film took in $42.5 million for the three-day
period that began Friday, the second-largest opening weekend of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Only ''Mission: Impossible 2'' opened with a bigger bang this
year, taking in $57.8 million for three days over the Memorial Day
weekend. ''The Perfect Storm'' grossed $41.3 million during its
Fourth of July weekend opening.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Perfect Storm'' and ''The Patriot'' finished second and
third this weekend, despite being off more than 30 percent from
their opening numbers the previous week. ''Storm'' brought in $27
million on 3,407 screens, and ''Patriot'' took in $15.5 million on
3,061 screens.
</P>
<P>
   The other film to be widely released this weekend, ''Disney's
The Kid,'' earned $12.5 million on 2,167 screens nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Bruce Willis as a 40-year-old image consultant
who magically encounters his chubby 8-year-old self, played by
Spencer Breslin. The kid winds up teaching his adult self what's
missing in his life: family, fun, dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Distributor Buena Vista Pictures said it played well to its
target audience of families and adult couples, opening higher than
1992's ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and 1998's ''The Parent Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a fantasy everybody would like to have happen, that
ability to do it again,'' said Chuck Viane, Buena Vista's president
of distribution. ''Plus, I think having the attraction of Bruce
makes such a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In limited release, ''But I'm a Cheerleader,'' a Lions Gate film
about a girl who is carted off to sexual-orientation boot camp
after her parents suspect she's a lesbian, drew a $15,000
per-screen average in just four theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scary Movie,'' a parody of such teen horror flicks as
''Scream'' and ''I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' earned $14,595
per screen. Its total gross was the most ever for an R-rated movie,
beating ''Air Force One,'' which took in $37.1 million during its
opening weekend in 1997, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box
office-tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co.
</P>
<P>
   The film earned far more than the originals: ''Scream'' earned
just $6.3 million during its opening weekend in 1996, and ''I Know
What You Did Last Summer'' took in $15.8 million during its opening
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''This obviously tapped into something that audiences were
looking for,'' Dergarabedian said. '''Scary Movie' came into the
market with everything going for it -- a dearth of movies for teens,
a genre that teens love and a great marketing campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely to continue having a good run this month. ''Scary
Movie'' won't face serious competition from other comedies until
Eddie Murphy's ''Nutty Professor'' sequel opens July 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to laugh, this is the movie to go to,'' said
Dennis Rice, president of marketing for Miramax-Dimension Films.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second weekend in a row that total box office
receipts topped earnings from the previous year, after three weeks
of declines.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to studio estimates:
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Scary Movie,'' $42.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Perfect Storm,'' $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''The Patriot,'' $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Disney's The Kid,'' $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Chicken Run,'' $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Shaft,'' $4.13 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Big Momma's House,'' $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' $3.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Ponder Failed Missile Test  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said Sunday
they expect the president will decide whether to go ahead with the
next phase of a national missile defense system and not leave it up
to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Senators raised concerns about spending billions on the proposed
system, which failed an important test early Saturday, and some
suggested the United States faced more potential threats from
terrorists on the ground than missiles in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said it would be
''irresponsible'' for the administration to put off the decision,
as suggested by Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. Such a delay, she said on
ABC's ''This Week,'' would give countries such as North Korea and
Iran more time to develop missiles that could threaten the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the president will be making his decision later this
summer,'' she said, based on recommendations from her, Defense
Secretary William Cohen and Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are four criteria that the president is going to be
looking at: the threat, the technology, the cost and what it does
to overall American security,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The missile defense project on early Saturday had its second
failed intercept in three tries. The warhead-busting ''kill
vehicle'' failed to separate from its booster rocket and passed
harmlessly by the target missile.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Saturday's failure does not necessarily mean the
president will scrap the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, this does go to the question of technical
feasibility or how far along the system is, but we need an
assessment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel contended the next president should decide whether to
continue. He supports a missile defense plan by Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush that is more extensive than
that proposed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't hold America's national security interests hostage to
any threats from some other nation,'' Hagel, a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said on CBS' ''Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would be willing to violate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which forbids such systems. The
Clinton administration, including Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic presidential candidate, has not ruled that out but would
prefer to see the treaty amended to allow a national defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., questioned the administration's
premise that North Korea, Iran and other countries threaten U.S.
national security when the United States has such an edge in the
number of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The threat is not at all clear to me -- number one. And the
response to the threat seems to me to be adequate where we are
now,'' Biden, ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee,
told CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Biden also questioned whether investing in a missile defense
system was prudent, given the cost -- by some estimates $36 billion
to $60 billion -- when the country might be more vulnerable to a
nuclear, chemical or biological weapon delivered on a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are clearly more vulnerable to a terrorist attack with a
weapon of mass destruction than we are from an (intercontinental
ballistic missile) coming out of the blue with a return address on
it,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., insisted that an anti-missile
defense system is vital and that the United States is aware of the
potential for other treats.
</P>
<P>
   ''People overlook the fact that we're spending several times
what we're talking about for a missile defense program on
anti-terrorism programs in this country. ... We've got to do
both,'' Thompson, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., noted that Congress has
authorized some 16 more tests. ''Too much has been made of this one
test over the weekend,'' Lieberman, a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I think President Clinton, notwithstanding this
disappointment on Saturday morning, ought to decide to at least
keep the process moving forward,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Most oppose Corzine's plan to invest Social Security in market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A majority of New Jerseyans oppose
Democratic Senate nominee Jon Corzine's proposal to allow the
government to invest Social Security funds in the stock market,
according to a poll released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gannett New Jersey poll indicated 62 percent of those
interviewed oppose Corzine's proposal. It would have the federal
government invest a small portion of Social Security funds in the
stock market. Only 28 percent of people in the survey said they
favored the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the government to keep their hands off my money,''
Frank Carini, 70, of Long Branch, told Gannett New Jersey for
Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the government, how screwed up it is. Would you let
them fool with your money?'' asked Carini, one of the survey
respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Carini said he instead favors a plan proposed by Corzine's
opponent for Senate, Republican Rep. Bob Franks. Franks has
proposed allowing people the option of investing a small portion of
their own Social Security funds in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The poll indicated 70 percent favored Franks' plan. Twenty
percent of those in the poll opposed that plan; 10 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Carini, a retired construction worker, said he favors Franks'
plan because it would give him more control of what to do with his
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I make mistakes, it's my loss. If the government does it,
they just say goodbye to your money, and it's all over,'' Carini
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Franks plan isn't such a good idea because ''some people
have a tendency not to be so good at (investing),'' said Jane
Frost, 47, of Millville. ''And then they want you to fund them if
they don't do so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of respondents said people who make bad
investments should receive no bailout; 22 percent said there should
be some way to help those investors.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also asked 408 likely voters about Corzine's plan to
create a universal insurance plan that would provide lifetime
coverage. Sixty-one percent favored national health insurance, 29
percent opposed it and 10 percent were undecided. The poll also
found 79 percent of those people who supported a national health
plan would be willing to pay increased taxes to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 91 percent of those in the survey said Medicare
should pay for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The survey included interviews with 599 people from June 22 to
25; 408 described themselves as registered or likely voters. The
poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, Corzine had a slight lead over Franks, 36
percent to 24 percent. Thirty-one percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Among people who said they considered themselves independent,
Corzine had an 8 percent lead over Franks.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed support wasn't solid for either candidate -
65 percent said they might change their minds about who they
support.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Coalition Collapses  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With stunning speed, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's painstakingly constructed coalition government collapsed
around him Sunday, threatening his ability both to govern and to
make peace on the eve of a high-stakes summit with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Three right-wing parties, including Barak's biggest coalition
partner, Shas, announced they were leaving the government, all
fearful that Barak would go too far in his concessions to the
Palestinians at the Camp David summit due to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, said he would
boycott the summit because he felt the Palestinians were not
showing enough flexibility. The decision by Levy, formerly of the
right-wing Likud party, was seen as a symbolic blow to Barak
because the fiery minister has often been a good barometer of
public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was defiant and angry in an evening address to the nation,
tossing aside opposition calls for him to remain home.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of these rejectionists will teach me how to defend Israel
and its future,'' he thundered, appealing directly to the people
who elected him a year ago -- people he is convinced still support
his quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one will teach me what security is. I must distance myself
from all the political controversies and party considerations to
find the way to peace that will end the conflict of blood between
ourselves and our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began with Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident
still seen by some as a moral force in Israel, withdrawing his
Yisrael B'Aliya party from the coalition, as he had threatened last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Shas' announcement, followed quickly by a similar
statement from the National Religious Party, which supports
settlers in the West Bank and opposes all land concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to be genuine partners on the way (to peace),'' said
Eli Ishai, the Shas party chairman. ''But we need to know the way.
We don't know the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, resignations don't take effect for 48 hours, and
Shas has threatened to bolt time and again, only to be reeled back
in by last-minute concessions from Barak. But this time, with the
prime minister leaving the country Monday, his options appeared
limited.
</P>
<P>
   And though it seemed Barak's problems couldn't get any worse,
opponents had scheduled three no-confidence votes for Monday in the
parliament. Barak's office said he would delay his flight to the
United States to attend the late-afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
   Under Israel's political system, a prime minister can govern
indefinitely with a minority in parliament, though it seriously
weakens his authority. If the three parties do not reverse their
decisions, Barak will control only about a third of 120 seats in
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   But if a no-confidence motion passes by a simple majority of 61
votes, Barak's government would fall, forcing new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts predicted Barak would survive the no-confidence
motions, only to remain in a very precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has very little room to maneuver,'' said Gerald Steinberg,
an expert on Israeli politics at Bar Ilan University. ''His only
chance to reverse this tide is to go to Camp David and get some
solid concessions from the Palestinians. Then he could go over the
heads of these politicians and take the deal straight to the
people'' in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving a significant change in Palestinian positions appeared
unlikely, however.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since President Clinton announced the summit last week,
Palestinian officials have been clear about what they will demand:
return of all territory captured by Israel in 1967, the right of
their refugees to return home, and east Jerusalem as the capital of
their independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in turn, has said he won't bargain away Israel's
sovereignty over Jerusalem, nor allow all refugees to return, nor
return all of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Still, right-wing parties have been stung by consistent reports
that he is ready to hand over close to 90 percent of the West Bank,
including some Arab neighborhoods adjacent to Jerusalem and part of
the Jordan Valley, considered a crucial buffer zone against foreign
invasions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens at Camp David, the day's events made clear
Barak has paid a heavy price for his single-minded pursuit of peace
with Israel's neighbors in the year since he won a landslide
victory over Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   In that quest, he has dropped allies and made painful
compromises on social issues, severely reducing his political base
-- all in the name of holding together an awkward coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Many who voted for Barak a year ago are now bitterly
disillusioned with the country's economic problems and growing
social divisions. And they've been angered by what they perceive as
his blatant sellouts to religious parties, including the touchy
issue of drafting Orthodox students into the army.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically for Barak, such compromises in the name of
peacemaking haven't earned him any gratitude from his peace
partners.
</P>
<P>
   When he thought there was a better chance for peace with Syria,
for example, Palestinians felt he simply turned his back on them --
until the Syria talks failed in January. Now, Barak faces in Arafat
an adversary with whom he once had warm ties, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Savir, who was instrumental in the secret talks that led to
the 1993 Oslo accords, says this lack of chemistry will weigh
heavily at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   To make peace, he said in an interview, ''you need to develop a
sense of trust. Barak and Arafat don't have that.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian Party Leader Has Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY (AP) -- In a matter of months, former preacher Stockwell
Day has propelled himself from little-known provincial Cabinet
minister to leader of a new nationwide Canadian political party.
</P>
<P>
   Day now is poised to lead the new Canadian Alliance's challenge
to the governing Liberal Party in a federal election expected to be
held within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   His unknown face became one of his greatest strengths -- a new
leader for a new party, replacing longtime Reform Party leader
Preston Manning in the quest to unite Canada's divided political
right to defeat the governing Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic Day, 49, made a point of being photographed
practicing karate, in-line skating and taking part in other
youthful activities. He spoke of the need for change in a country
governed by the Liberal Party since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   His politics, however, are rooted in the social conservatism of
central Alberta, where he once ran a conservative Christian school
and served as a preacher. Day is anti-abortion, opposes giving
homosexual marriages the same legal standing as heterosexual
marriages and supports capital punishment in a nation with strong
liberal leanings.
</P>
<P>
   His call for tightening immigration policies could alienate the
nation's large immigrant populations, which have benefited from
social programs that could be slashed under Day's fiscal
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, though, Day offers a new direction for Canadian
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The former Reform Party, which dissolved itself to form the
support base of the new Alliance in March, strongly opposed special
rights for Francophone Quebec province and never had much support
there. But Day, who speaks French, made a point of campaigning in
Quebec and promoting strong federalism for all Canadian provinces
to address the desires of French-speaking Quebec for protection of
its culture and heritage.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Day reminded audiences of his varied resume
-- logger, auctioneer, youth counselor, meat packer, interior
decorator, deck hand, school administrator and assistant pastor. An
avid Christian, he generally refuses to work on Sundays, devoting
that time to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Barrie, Ontario, about an hour north of Toronto, Day
moved across Ontario, Quebec and eastern Canada wherever his father
set up discount stores for a national chain.
</P>
<P>
   He has admitted to a hippie period of long hair and smoking
marijuana until he met his wife, Valorie, and they married in 1971.
Life was never boring, his family says, especially during the years
when Day worked with drug and alcohol addicts in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was 12 or 13, one guy came storming into our house,
highly intoxicated, ruckusing around,'' Day's son Luke, 26,
recalled. ''It took some time to get it solved and the next day
Stock was willing to give him a second chance. He always is willing
to give people a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Day won a provincial parliament seat with the Conservative Party
in 1986 in Red Deer, Alberta, and by 1992 he was labor minister. He
later became provincial treasurer and gained popularity for
continuing balanced budgets introduced by his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Known for a quick wit and ability to speak at length without
notes, Day is considered more telegenic than most Canadian
politicians. Whether that proves useful against an expected strong
Liberal attack on his social conservatism remains to be seen.

<HEADLINE> Report: DaimlerChrysler eyes 'virtual headquarters' in New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) - German-American automaker DaimlerChrysler AG
apparently looks to lease up to five floors in New York City's
towering Chrysler Building in what observers call the company's
symbolic bid to create a virtual American headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seriously considering it,'' Christoph Walther,
DaimlerChrysler's head of global communications, told The Detroit
News for a story Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The move neither would move DaimlerChrysler's legal headquarters
from Stuttgart, Germany, nor impact the automaker's North American
headquarters in the Detroit suburb of Auburn Hills, the News said.
Thousands of workers at both sites also would be unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   By occupying the New York City landmark built by Walter P.
Chrysler, observers say, DaimlerChrysler would signal its
committment to American roots, as well as the company's increased
attention on Wall Street, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler describes the possible Chrysler Building offices
as a de facto policy-making center where the company's 13-member
management board would meet, the News said. The board already meets
twice each month at newly remodeled offices in the Seagram's
Building on New York's Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler Building offices also would house a small number of
staffers from the automaker's treasury, investor relations, and
legal and communications departments, many of whom already work in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Tishman Speyer Properties of New York, which
became co-owner of the landmark three years ago, would not discuss
any negotiations perhaps under way with DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the proposed lease still being negotiated, the
News said, the automaker would pay an estimated $100 per square
foot for space in the Chrysler Building, as well as another $5
million for renovations that would include restoring the building's
Cloud Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly what they're most interested is symbolism,'' said Bob
Casey, an automotive historian and curator of transportation at
Henry Ford Museum &AMP; Greenfield Village in Dearborn.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Larson, president of Larson Realty Group in Detroit and a
former partner in a New York commercial real estate firm, called
the possible deal ''less a serious office and more a strike at
serious visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll gain a major presence - from a perception standpoint -
in the world financial center,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Chrysler Building transaction would come less than two years
after DaimlerChrysler spent nearly $5 million to transform the
treasury offices of predecessor Daimler-Benz AG into a New York
base for the company's management board.
</P>
<P>
   Walter P. Chrysler opened the Chrysler Building in 1930 but
never established headquarters there.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Tire in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   BACHI-YURT, Russia (AP) -- At the Bachi-Yurt checkpoint in
Chechnya, the alert level is high but morale among Russian troops
is low.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers at the checkpoint on Sunday expressed disillusionment
about prospects for hunting down elusive Chechen independence
fighters who have turned to hit-and-run attacks and car and truck
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should get out of here before it is too late,'' said Sgt.
Alexei Ilyin, 19. ''There will never be peace here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said local residents ''smile at us, pretending to help us,
but they won't hesitate to shoot us in the back if the opportunity
arises.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Vladimir Volodin, 24, said efforts to track down rebels were
not working.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the mopping-up operations in the towns and villages don't
bring tangible results,'' he said. ''What we should do is comb the
forest areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers serve with an Interior Ministry unit from the city
of Kursk in southern Russia. Their job is to search the town for
rebels and monitor traffic to and from the border with the
neighboring region of Dagestan, nine miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops nominally control most of Chechnya after rolling
into the rebellious region in September, and are chasing rebel
bands hiding in the southern mountains. But they remain vulnerable
to sniping, bombings and hit-and-run attacks in lowland areas they
captured months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens last struck in force on July 2, when they hit
Russian positions with five suicide truck bombs that killed at
least 33 soldiers and wounded 84, according to the official toll.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesmen promised more attacks, but instead things were
quieter, after Russian forces arrested dozens and clamped down on
residents' movements. But the soldiers in Bachi-Yurt, many of them
teen-agers, drew little encouragement from the clampdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll leave here soon enough ... Let them kill each other
themselves,'' Pvt. Dmitry Ligachev, 19, said.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from one of the units hit by the suicide attacks
returned Sunday to their hometown of Chelyabinsk in the Ural
Mountains. Television reports showed crowds of teary relatives who
greeted them on the train platform with hugs and kisses.
</P>
<P>
   At least 22 members of the Interior Ministry unit were killed
when their barracks was destroyed, and dozens more were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tightened Sunday in the capital Grozny, with only
those who could show proof of residency allowed in, the Interfax
news agency reported, quoting officials in the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of two Russian soldiers were found on the outskirts
of the Chechen capital over the past 24 hours, apparent victims of
rebels who also stole their weapons, the Russian Interior Ministry
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya by independence
fighters in a 1994-96 war. They returned 10 months ago after
Islamic militants raided villages in neighboring Dagestan, and 300
people died in apartment bombings the government blames on
Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers recover destroyed rescue boat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAMBERTVILLE, N.J. (AP) - A rescue squad airboat that sank last
month during a training exercise on the Delaware River has been
raised, but it appears to be damaged beyond repair, the squad said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lambertville-New Hope Ambulance &AMP; Rescue Squad said the
15-year-old airboat was recovered Saturday after a five-hour
operation involving special recovery devices such as airbags and
barrel cages. Swift river currents made the job particularly
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   BRS Diving of Upper Black Eddy, Pa., raised the boat for free,
with the assistance of about 50 members of the rescue squad, the
Columbia Fire Co. of Lambertville and the Point Pleasant (Pa.) Fire
Co. Dive Unit, and community volunteers who provided boats,
equipment and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The boat, which resembles swamp boats used in the Florida
Everglades and so can safely traverse shallow sections of the
river, was taken to the rescue squad's headquarters here. A
detailed inspection found major damage. The squad said the boat,
valued at $30,000, is considered a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   Squad members plan to meet with the manufacturer this week to
discuss how to replace the boat, but will await the outcome of an
investigation into the cause of the sinking to decide whether to
replace the boat with one of similar design. The squad said a
special fund-raising drive is likely.
</P>
<P>
   The boat sank June 14 after it became swamped and capsized
during a routine exercise about 1 1/2 miles south of the
Lambertville-New Hope Bridge; two volunteers on the boat were
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, rescue squad volunteers found the boat about a
mile further south in the river. They had to wait until this month,
when water levels are a bit lower and currents less swift, to
retrieve the sunken boat.
</P>
<P>
   The squad still operates two motorboats to respond to distress
calls.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Defends AIDS Policies  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- President Thabo Mbeki defended his
government's AIDS policies Sunday by telling thousands of AIDS
experts from around the world that he is simply looking for an
African solution to the scourge that is ravaging the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has endured a hail of criticism since he convened a panel
of scientists to investigate whether the HIV virus causes AIDS -- a
fact long-accepted by most AIDS experts -- and refused to provide
medicine to pregnant women to reduce risks for mother-to-child
transmission of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some in our common world consider the questions that I and the
rest of our government have raised around the HIV/AIDS issue ... as
akin to grave criminal and genocidal conduct,'' he told delegates
at the opening ceremony of the 13th International AIDS Conference.
''What I hear said repeatedly, stridently is 'Don't ask
questions.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, since the poverty in Africa magnifies every health
crisis the continent faces, South Africa needed to search for a
solution to the AIDS pandemic that would deal with Africa's unique
problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Mbeki spoke, hundreds of people walked out of the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the 34 million people infected with HIV live
in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 2 million people died of
AIDS last year.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Mbeki convened a panel of scientists, some of them on
the fringe of AIDS research, to discuss the efficacy of accepted
AIDS treatments and whether HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused Mbeki of wasting time, energy and resources
while the epidemic continued cutting a swath of destruction across
the world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the conference, 5,000 doctors, scientists and
other AIDS professionals took the extraordinary step of releasing
''The Durban Declaration,'' widely seen as a rebuke to Mbeki,
saying the link between HIV and AIDS is ''clear-cut, exhaustive and
unambiguous.'' The declaration demanded that public health
professionals focus immediately on stopping the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki told the AIDS conference that he had convened the May
panel to educate himself about the pandemic and to learn whether
the Western weapons against AIDS -- safe sex campaigns, condom use
and anti-retroviral drugs -- are sufficient to fight the disease in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no substance to the allegation that there is any
hesitation on the part of our government to confront the challenge
of HIV/AIDS,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government has also come under criticism for
refusing to finance a program to treat pregnant women with the
anti-AIDS drug AZT, and Mbeki has said there was significant
evidence the treatment was so dangerous it would do more harm than
good. AIDS experts argue that the side effects of AZT, a widely
accepted medicine, are minor compared to its effectiveness in
reducing the risks that the virus will be transmitted to the baby
in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also said it would not make effective drug
therapies available to AIDS sufferers because they remain too
expensive, despite promised discounts from pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS Executive Director Peter Piot, who spoke after Mbeki,
appealed to developed countries to forgive African debt so
impoverished countries can concentrate more of their resources on
fighting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we need billions -- not millions -- to fight AIDS. We
need, at a minimum, $3 billion per year for Africa alone for basic
prevention and basic care. And this figure is ten times what is
being spent today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some AIDS experts expressed disappointment in Mbeki's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every South African hoped for a firmer acknowledgment for the
links between HIV and AIDS,'' said Alan Whiteside, head of the
Health, Economics and HIV/AIDS Research Division at the University
of Natal in Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki also ''didn't go far enough in giving details of the
situation and where we as a country were going to go next,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Seth Berkley, president of the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative, praised Mbeki for laying out the fundamental issues of
poverty that have made the AIDS pandemic so difficult to fight in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Before the speech, thousands of singing protesters marched to
the cricket stadium where the ceremony was held Sunday, demanding
affordable medication for all those infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the marchers wore T-shirts saying ''HIV positive.'' Some
carried placards with pictures of pharmaceutical executives,
calling them ''Drug profiteers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have failed to take HIV/AIDS seriously,'' said Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, head of the African National Congress' Women's
League. ''That failure is a betrayal of our struggle for social
justice and hope for our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Madikizela-Mandela, ex-wife of former President Nelson Mandela,
attacked the government and drug makers and said the country needed
to tackle the disease with the same commitment it used to fight
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Though the South African government saw how AIDS damaged eastern
Africa in the 1980s and 1990s, it wasted time on ineffective
policies and bogus drugs instead of stopping the epidemic from
causing the same damage here, she said. About 10 percent of South
Africa's 44 million people are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Madikizela-Mandela called on the government to allow importation
of cheaper, generic AIDS medication and to allow local firms to
produce the drugs without patents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are marching to demand that a government that we have
elected puts the interest of its people before the profits of the
drug companies,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Teens plucked from park embankment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW SCOTLAND, N.Y. (AP) - Rescuers rappelled down a steep
embankment to free four hikers stuck for more than two hours
Saturday at John Boyd Thacher State Park.
</P>
<P>
   None of the hikers was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   A park visitor called police after hearing yells for help from
the group, trapped on a shale slope some 300 to 400 yards off the
park's scenic Indian Ladder Trail, which runs directly below the
sheer face of the park's eastern edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were way off the trail, so it wasn't a question of just
stepping off to the side,'' park police Chief Joe Spofford told The
Daily Gazette of Schenectady. ''It was definitely much harder to
get to them than it was to do the rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   It took rescuers about 30 minutes to reach the group - two men
and two women ranging in age from 17 to 28. Two were about a third
of the way down the embankment and the other two were farther down,
about 40 yards above a 10-foot drop.
</P>
<P>
   Once they reached the teens, crews secured them with ropes and
lowered them down the embankment to make the 45-minute hike out of
the ravine.
</P>
<P>
   For their adventure, the hikers face a fine of up to $100.
</P>
<P>
   The park is nine miles west of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Talk About Peace  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURG AL-ARAB, Egypt (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
consulted Sunday with Egypt's president -- the latest in a series of
regional diplomatic whistle-stops by Israeli and Palestinian
leaders preparing for a summit called to hash out their toughest
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and President Hosni Mubarak met alone and then with top
aides for almost an hour in a meeting hall at the Bourg al-Arab
airport, about 120 miles north of Cairo near the Mediterranean sea.
</P>
<P>
   They did not speak to reporters afterward. But Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said Egypt is concerned about Israel's ''five
'no's,'' which he said do ''not really give the Palestinian side
the necessary assurances'' going into the U.S.-sponsored summit.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa was referring to a series of positions Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak has taken on the issues that divide Israel and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said Jerusalem will remain united and under Israeli
sovereignty and that the sides will not return to 1967 borders. He
says there will be no foreign army west of the Jordan and no
blanket ''right of return'' for Palestinians displaced in 1948 and
1967 wars. He also says a majority of the Israeli settlements in
heavily Palestinian areas like the West Bank will remain under
Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian Minister of Planning Nabil Shaath, who
accompanied Arafat to Egypt, told reporters that the Palestinian
negotiators at this week's summit at Camp David will insist on an
Israeli withdrawal to the lines before June 5, 1967; the return of
Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital; the end of settlements; and the
right of Palestinians to return to their former homes in what is
now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak are to meet with President Clinton on Tuesday
at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin
Mountains where an Egyptian-Israeli peace was hammered out two
decades ago with the help of then-President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was headed to the summit weakened by an announcement
Sunday from his biggest coalition partner, the Shas party, that it
will abandon his government. Shas is among several rightist parties
that fear Barak will make too many concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has declared that nothing will stop him from doing
everything possible to end the conflict with the Palestinians. He
has expressed confidence that when a peace agreement is submitted
to parliament, it will be overwhelmingly endorsed. Barak would
probably have the support of the Arab parties, which have 10
members, and a few other dovish parties, on a peace vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before the make-or-break summit, both Israeli and Palestinian
leaders were putting their case before the region's peace brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Barak met Saturday in Amman with King Abdullah II of Jordan,
which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Jordanian Foreign
Minister Abdullah-Illah Khatib held talks with Arafat in Gaza on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian talks has a direct effect
on Jordan, home to thousands of Palestinian refugees. Addressing
his parliament Sunday, Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu-Ragheb said
Jordan will not take in more Palestinians -- a response to
unsubstantiated Arab newspaper reports of clandestine U.S.-Israeli
plans to resolve the refugee question by resettling in Jordan an
estimated 750,000 Palestinians now in Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, a senior Palestinian negotiator said any peace
agreement with Israel would be brought before the Palestinian
people for approval in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Both Palestinians living in Palestinian areas and those who live
abroad would be included in such a vote, Yasser Abed Rabbo told
reporters in the West Bank. He is among the Palestinian negotiators
heading to the Camp David summit.

   The White Sox, with the majors' best record at 55-32, hit four
homers with the wind blowing out Sunday -- two by Carlos Lee and one
each by Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   But for a second straight day, their pitching staff couldn't
contain the Cubs' suddenly potent bats.
</P>
<P>
   After the White Sox won the series opener 4-2 in 12 innings, the
Cubs captured Saturday's middle game 9-2 with 14 hits. The White
Sox had won two of three -- all one-run games -- at Comiskey Park in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Since interleague play began in 1997, the rivals, whose parks
are a mere eight miles apart, have split 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who went 9-for-13 this weekend, hit his second homer of the
game and 17th this season, a two-run shot, to give the White Sox a
6-5 lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs, who had 11 hits, responded immediately off
reliever Bill Simas (1-2). Eric Young had a squeeze bunt to score
Damon Buford, who had singled and move to third on a single by Jeff
Huson. After Joe Girardi walked, Kelly Wunsch relieved and gave up
Mark Grace's sacrifice fly and Sosa's 23rd homer that put the Cubs
ahead 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who'd blooped a bases-loaded single to drive in two
runs in the third, hit a two-run homer in the fifth for a 5-4 Cubs
lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth homer in nine games for Rodriguez and his 17th
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, snubbed for the All-Star game, hit his 26th homer far
over the back fence in left, giving him 75 RBIs and cutting the
Cubs' lead to 2-1 in the fourth. Ordonez, who was selected to the
AL team, followed four pitches later with his 21st for a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who'd hit his 16th homer in the third, then singled and
came around on Mark Johnson's two-out double for a 4-3 lead off
Kevin Tapani (5-7), who won despite surrendering four homers in his
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Worrell pitched a perfect ninth for his first save of the
season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Donald threw out the first pitch Sunday. Donald Trump,
an acquaintance of Sammy Sosa, delivered the ball to Sosa. He also
led a very off-key version of ''Take Me out to the Ballgame'' in
the seventh and was booed loudly by the large crowd at Wrigley
Field. ... Rodriguez's two-run single in the third gave him 500
RBIs for his career. ... Cal Eldred, who hasn't lost since May 10,
got his third no-decision in his last 11 starts. He gave up six
hits and five runs in five innings. ... Worrell, who has five
career saves, earned his first since July 18, 1997, while with San
Diego.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Flag Supporters Rally  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- About a dozen protesters waved the Confederate
flag outside the NAACP's national convention Sunday and defended
the banner that the civil rights organization has deemed a symbol
of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, members of three conservative groups, feel the
NAACP's 9-year-old campaign to have the banner removed from all
public properties is an attack on Southern heritage and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leave our flag alone,'' said Richard Gebo, a Virginian now
living in Pennsylvania. ''That's all we have left.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry we had these people as slaves,'' said protester
Michael Chandler of Blue Ridge, Ga. ''But there's no reason for
them to try to tear down our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag was recently removed from atop the South
Carolina statehouse dome after the NAACP called for a tourism
boycott of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said the protesters, who were ''to
some extent racist,'' were only hurting themselves and anyone who
examined them closely would find them ''repugnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally was sponsored by the Southern Party of Georgia, a
newly formed conservative political party that calls for
''peaceful, lawful and orderly secession'' of the 16 southern
states from the American union.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a call from the Southern Party for 50 volunteers, only
about 12 showed up, marching for several hours in a square
barricade under the sun dressed in woolen Confederate grays.
</P>
<P>
   About an equal number of police, some on horseback, were on
hand. The rally stayed peaceful, despite a steady dialogue between
the white demonstrators and overwhelmingly black passers-by that
often grew heated.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Wins Senior Tourney  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Leonard Thompson made a 2-foot birdie putt
on the second playoff hole Sunday to ruin a sensational comeback by
Isao Aoki and win the State Farm Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki made up three shots over the final four holes to force the
playoff. But after his 15-foot birdie putt on the second playoff
hole missed by an inch, Thompson sank an uphill putt for his second
career win in four years on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   His other victory, at the 1998 Coldwell Banker Burnet Classic,
was also in a playoff with Aoki.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the co-leader after the second round, earned $202,500.
He shot a 69 for a 205 over 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't putt great, but got enough close to the hole to get
some birdie chances,'' he said. ''I never lost my focus, never
thought I was not going to make a shot I needed to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Both playoff holes were held on the par-5, 541-yard 18th hole.
After Thompson sank a 1-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole,
Aoki matched that with a 12-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson birdied No. 18 all five times he played the hole over
the three-day tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki, who started the day four shots back in a 10th-place tie,
shot a bogey-free 7-under-par 65.
</P>
<P>
   He trailed Thompson by three strokes before getting a birdie on
15. He then got within a shot of the leader when Thompson got his
only bogey of the day on 16.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki birdied 17 and finished the run with a fist-pumping 15-foot
birdie putt on 18. He then watched as Thompson barely missed a
30-footer on 18 for an eagle and the win.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki, who had only one top-10 finish in 11 events this year, was
vying for his ninth career win on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a birdie on 18 to tie for the lead, Larry Nelson bogeyed
the hole to finished with a 69 for a 207, tied with second-round
co-leader Dana Quigley, who shot a 71.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Green had a hole-in-one en route to a 70 and a three-way
tie at 208 with Bruce Fleisher and Jim Albus.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson started the day tied with Quigley and defending
champion Christy O'Connor. Thompson distanced himself from the
co-leaders on No. 3, when he made a 15-foot birdie putt from the
fringe to go 9 under.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley lighted a cigar at No. 6 and immediately ran into
trouble. He chunked a chip from the behind the green and bogeyed
the hole, as did O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley and O'Connor also bogeyed the par-3 eighth hole to fall
four shots back. Quigley missed a 5-footer for par and O'Connor
angrily hacked at the sand after his shot from the left bunker
passed the hole by 30 feet. Thompson, meanwhile, sank a 6-foot
birdie putt to move 10 under.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been luckier with his putter, Thompson could have pulled
away on the front nine. He had putts at 1 and 4 lip the cup, and
left a 15-foot birdie putt at No. 6 just an inch short of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Green made his 22nd career hole-in-one on the 152-foot, par-3
11th hole. Using a 7-iron, he hit a drive that bounced three times
before rolling two feet into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   He followed that with a birdie on 12 to move to 10 under, but
fell out of contention with bogeys on 14 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor shot a 75 and finished at 211.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 8, Giants 7  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pat Hentgen allowed two hits in five scoreless
innings and Fernando Tatis had a two-run homer as the St. Louis
Cardinals ended the San Francisco Giants' eight-game winning streak
with an 8-7 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central leaders avoided a three-game sweep heading into
the All-Star break and moved eight games in front of second-place
Cincinnati. The Cardinals dropped their three previous games,
losing a game off their lead each time.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen (8-6) worked on three days' rest for the third time in
his career, and first since Sept. 24, 1996. He's won all three
starts with a 0.89 ERA. He walked three and struck out two Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Hentgen was the weak link in St. Louis' rotation.
But in his last three starts he's allowed three earned runs in 17
innings, lowering his ERA from 5.85 to 5.16.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis' eighth homer, and second since coming off the disabled
list June 30, came off Livan Hernandez (7-7) with one out in the
fifth. The previous batter, Jim Edmonds, was hit in the knee by a
pitch. Ray Lankford and Craig Paquette added homers in the seventh
off Joe Nathan, who'll open the second half for the Giants on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds was the only one of the four big stars on the two teams
who started. Mark McGwire sat out the entire series with a sore
right knee and will miss the All-Star game, while Barry Bonds
missed his eighth start with a thumb injury and Jeff Kent sat due
to illness for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds was announced as a pinch-hitter in the Giants' five-run
eighth, but was pulled for Ellis Burks when the Cardinals brought
in left-hander Mike Matthews. Kent had a three-run, pinch-hit
double off Dave Veres that hiked his NL-leading RBI total to 85,
and Calvin Murray had a run-scoring infield hit to cut the gap to
8-7.
</P>
<P>
   Veres, who entered with one out and the bases loaded in the
eighth, finished for his 18th save in 22 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who had won his previous three decisions, lasted six
innings. He gave up five runs -- four earned -- and eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis had a two-run single and Fernando Vina an RBI single
to give the Cardinals a 3-0 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants scored in the sixth when J.T. Snow walked, advanced
to third on a throwing error by first baseman Paquette and scored
on Ramon Martinez's groundout. Murray added an RBI double in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Andy Benes made his fifth career relief appearance
and first since Oct. 3, 1999. He allowed five runs -- three earned --
on three hits and two walks in 2 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burks was 7-for-9 in the series and is a .392 career hitter
against the Cardinals. He's batting .437 over his last 24 games
with five homers and 17 RBIs. ... ... The Giants have won seven of
their last nine series. They're 42-28 after a 4-11 start this
season. ... A crowd of 44,202 fell just short of capacity for the
Cardinals, who have 10 sellouts in 12 games. ... The Cardinals also
lost three in a row June 3-5. ... Lankford pulled back ahead of
McGwire for the Busch Stadium career homer lead with 106. Lankford,
who has 14 homers this season, has played 675 games at Busch,
McGwire 220.

<HEADLINE> Pope Celebrates Prison Mass  </HEADLINE>
By ALESSANDRA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Inmates and guards were on the same side of the bars
Sunday as Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in a Roman prison,
repeating his call for clemency for prisoners worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the name of Jesus who came to liberate us, I ask
authorities for a sign of clemency toward all prisoners,'' the
pontiff said during his pastoral visit to Regina Coeli, the Italian
capital's oldest prison. The words echoed his June 30 message on
clemency and better prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   During the homily, one prisoner held up a sign saying in
Spanish: ''God loves everyone. Clemency.''
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff was surrounded by about 75 prisoners and twice as
many guards. Among them were a group of women from another Roman
prison. Nine inmates served as altar boys; 14 others made up the
choir.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Regina Coeli's 900 inmates followed the event from
giant screens placed inside the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Punishment, prison only make sense if, while affirming the
needs of justice and discouraging crime, they serve man's
renewal,'' John Paul said. He said prisons must offer inmates ''the
possibility to reflect and change their life, in order to fully
become part of the civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   While the pope did not mention the death penalty, which he has
often criticized, one of the inmates offered a prayer for those
''who await the end of their existence in the death row.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, identified only by his first name, Roberto, thanked the
pontiff on behalf of all his fellow inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your visit is lighting up this room with faith, hope and
humanity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Mass, prisoners and guards went to the pope to kiss his
ring and receive his blessing. Applause rang out as the pontiff
left.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Coeli is in Trastevere, one of Rome's oldest
neighborhoods. Its name means ''Queen of Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other Italian prisons, it is overcrowded and has been the
scene of recent unrest sparked by demands for clemency. Some of the
demonstrators were moved out of the prison before the papal visit,
according to Italian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Italian lawmakers have been unable to agree on any sort of
clemency measure to relieve the overcrowding. Instead, the
government has decided to build more prisons, hire more guards and
try alternatives to prison for minor crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the alternatives would be house arrest or, for foreigners,
deportation. Nearly a quarter of the inmates in Italian prisons are
foreigners, mainly immigrants from Morocco and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Italian state doesn't have, and does not want to have, a
spirit of revenge toward those who make mistakes,'' said Justice
Ministry Piero Fassino, who was among the officials who welcomed
the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bernard Pinet, the vice president of the International
Commission of Catholic Prison Pastoral Care, praised John Paul's
appeal for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important that the Holy Father has made a gesture
which will have repercussions all over the world, not just in
Italy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul is the third pope to visit Regina Coeli, a former
monastery built in the 17th century. Pope John XXIII paid a visit
in 1958, and Pope Paul VI went there in 1964.

<HEADLINE> GOP Convention To Draw Protesters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Protests planned for the Republican National
Convention are unlikely to draw as many people as trade meetings in
Seattle last year, police and protest organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10,000 demonstrators are expected for GOP gathering
here from July 31-Aug. 3, far less than the 40,000 people who
descended upon Seattle for World Trade Organization meetings last
fall, according to interviews with organizers and local group
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100,000 protesters had been forecast for
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, organizers say up to 30,000 people could attend
demonstrations during the Democratic National Convention, Aug.
14-17. But that West Coast event is likely to draw upon the same
group of people who were in Seattle, the organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the GOP convention will attract mostly East Coast
activists, some of the same 10,000 people who protested
International Monetary Fund talks in Washington in April. More than
1,300 people were arrested, but police generally describe the event
as a success because there were few reports of property damage, in
comparison to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to tell, but I don't get the sense that this is
going to be as big as the other ones,'' Philadelphia Deputy Police
Commissioner Robert Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest event, Unity 2000 on July 30, is expected to attract
up to 10,000, organizers estimate.

<HEADLINE> Report: 4th LA Cop To Be Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors are preparing to charge a fourth
anti-gang officer with misconduct in the city's widening police
corruption scandal, and more charges are expected by the end of the
summer, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unnamed sources, the Times said prosecutors will charge
the fourth officer with perjury and conspiracy charges stemming
from two 1996 arrests, and his role in a third arrest is under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also plan to file more criminal counts against two
officers previously charged, and more officers are expected to be
charged over the next two months, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, involving allegations that members of the elite
Rampart Division anti-gang unit beat, framed and shot innocent
people, came to light last fall after former officer Rafael Perez
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a lighter
sentence on charges of cocaine theft.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 felony convictions have been overturned and more
than 20 officers have left active duty since the allegations
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The three officers already charged, Sgts. Edward Ortiz and Brian
Liddy and Officer Paul Harper, have pleaded innocent to allegations
that they framed a gang member arrested on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the fourth officer expected to face charges,
identified by the Times on Sunday as Officer Michael Buchanan, 30,
told the Times his client denies any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Hot Winds Fan Fires in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Flames fanned by hot, gusty winds
swept Sunday over hills parched by the recent Balkan heat wave,
burning some houses in Kosovo and setting off unexploded ordnance
left over from last year's conflict here.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Maj. Scott Slaten reported fires in four of
Kosovo's five military sectors, including one blaze which destroyed
houses near Planeja in southern Kosovo. Residents in several areas
were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Slaten said ethnic Albanian and international firefighters were
hampered by the large number of land mines and unexploded ordnance.
The explosives were left behind after the conflict in this southern
Serbian province, which ended in June 1999 when Yugoslav forces
withdrew following the 78-day NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't send in our guys until we know that the fire has
cleared through the minefield,'' Slaten said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Planeja area, fires triggered several explosions from
leftover ordnance, a NATO statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the blazes had been contained by late Sunday, although
one was threatening a Kosovo Liberation Army cemetery near
Landovica, NATO said. Following record-setting temperatures and no
rain, Kosovo's hardscrabble hills are a tinderbox, and the danger
of further fires remains high.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of trash scattered in the countryside, and 90
percent of the population smokes,'' Slaten said. ''All it takes is
one cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police were questioning witnesses in the Friday
shooting of politician Ramush Haradinaj, who was wounded in a
pre-dawn encounter with the family of a man named Sadik Musa.
Musa's family is linked to Haradinaj's political rivals in the
western village of Streoce.
</P>
<P>
   Haradinaj was taken Friday afternoon to the U.S. military
hospital at Camp Bondsteel in eastern Kosovo. NATO said Sunday he
was later flown to the U.S. military hospital at Landstuhl,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The case is politically explosive because it raises the specter
of armed clashes among ethnic Albanian political factions in
advance of local elections in October. Western Kosovo is known as a
smuggling center where clans and political groups are competing for
power.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has refused to release details of the incident pending
completion of an investigation. Haradinaj's followers claim the
Musa family opened fire when Haradinaj, his brother Daut Haradinaj
and others went to the house to discuss their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Musa told The Associated Press that Haradinaj's men fired on his
house and threatened him before he managed to grab a grenade and
throw it at Haradinaj.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who comes to your house in the middle of the night with armed
men who start shooting to have a dialogue?'' Musa asked.

Barak's Coalition Falls Apart in Israel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With stunning speed, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
painstakingly constructed coalition government collapsed around him Sunday,
threatening his ability both to govern and to make peace on the eve of a
high-stakes summit with the Palestinians. Three right-wing parties, including
Barak's biggest coalition partner, Shas, announced they were leaving the
government, all fearful that Barak would go too far in his concessions to the
Palestinians at the Camp David summit due to begin Tuesday. What's more, Barak's
foreign minister, David Levy, said he would boycott the summit because he felt
the Palestinians were not showing enough flexibility.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said today they expect
the president will decide whether to go ahead with the next phase of a national

concerns about spending billions on the proposed system, which failed an

potential threats from terrorists on the ground than missiles in the air.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said it would be ''irresponsible'' for the

Experts: 22 Million With Alzheimer's by 2005
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alzheimer's disease is increasing so fast that more than
22 million people worldwide will be affected by 2025, experts warned today. They
urged new research to spot the very earliest symptoms -- subtle ones that can
emerge a decade before true dementia hits -- and hunt for ways to protect these
people's brains. Already, doctors have discovered that a mild memory impairment
sometimes confused with normal aging can progress to full-blown Alzheimer's at a
rate of about 12 percent a year.

Hypertension Reduction Studied
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Combining weight loss and exercise lowers blood pressure more
effectively than exercise alone, according to a new study. Though a healthy diet
and exercise generally are recommended for the estimated 50 million Americans
with hypertension, data have been mixed on their effectiveness without
accompanying medication. The study of 133 overweight men and women with
untreated hypertension found that about an hour of exercise three to four times
weekly for six months reduced blood pressure, and weight loss lowered it even
more.

12 Die in Zimbabwe Soccer Stampede
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Twelve people died in a soccer stampede, set off
when police fired tear gas at bottle-throwing fans during a World Cup qualifier
Sunday between Zimbabwe and South Africa. Players from both teams choked and
writhed on the field, covering their faces as tear gas spread through the
stadium. The 12 victims were dead on arrival, Davison Sadza, head of the
Parirenyatwa hospital, told state radio. Four stampede victims were in critical
condition and many others were injured, he said. A doctor said most of the
deaths were from internal injures consistent with being crushed.

<HEADLINE> Charity battle takes a new turn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A legal battle between a New Jersey-based
charity and one in New York City took a new turn after state
officials said the New York charity group has no license to solicit
funds in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to register with the state could mean prosecution and
fines of up to $15,000 for the New York charity, said Genene
Morris, spokeswoman for the state Division of Consumer Affairs,
which regulates charities.
</P>
<P>
   But William Fugazy, a New York businessman who is chairman of
the famed Forum Club, said he was surprised to hear his group could
be violating New Jersey law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got lots of members in New Jersey,'' Fugazy told The
Trentonian of Trenton for Sunday's editions. ''We've been
soliciting money for 30 or 40 years. Let them come after us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trentonian reported that the investigation involves the
legal status of the Forum Club and two charities it manages - the
National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations Foundation and the
Children of the World Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Fugazy said no fund-raising materials have been sent to New
Jersey under the Children of the World Foundation name. Money to
help children under Children of the World came from a $2 million
fund in the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations Foundation,
or NECO, Fugazy said. NECO routinely sends fund-raising materials
to members who live in New Jersey, according to an opinion by U.S.
District Court Judge Jerome B. Simandle.
</P>
<P>
   The legal dispute that resulted in the federal decision began
because Forum and the Deborah Heart and Lung Center, based in
Pemberton Township, both want to use ''Children of the World
Foundation'' for charities they manage.
</P>
<P>
   The Deborah Heart and Lung Center has used the name for nearly
30 years for its fund that flies children and their parents from
developing countries to the United States for major medical care.
That program has helped nearly 3,000 children, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Forum, which is made up of mostly big-name business people and
politicians, began using the name two years ago for its fund to
help children who are ill. Forum's Children of the World program
has helped 10 children, the nonprofit group said.
</P>
<P>
   When Forum refused to change the name of its charity, Deborah
president Spero Margeotes took the group to the federal court and
won. Fugazy said his organization plans to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Margeotes said he sued over the name because he was afraid
people would confuse the charities, especially since they are in
the same region.
</P>
<P>
   The case shows donors need to look closely at organizations they
want to fund, said Bennett Weiner, director of Philanthropic
Advisory Service of the National Council of Better Business Bureaus
at Arlington, Va.

<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Australia's Paul Gow won the Buy.Com Tour's
Hershey Open on Sunday, closing with an even-par 71 for a
one-stroke victory over Paul Claxton.
</P>
<P>
   Gow, also the 1997 Permian Basin Open winner, had a 3-under 281
total on the Country Club of Hershey's East Course. He earned
$72,000 to move into 10th place on the money list with $139,377.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to know that you can actually handle yourself down
the stretch and that you don't choke,'' said Gow, who birdied No.
15 and finished with three straight pars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pars around this golf course meant something. When I got to 3
under, I thought I could par the last three holes. Then someone
would have to do something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Claxton finished with a 72. J.J. Henry (67), Joe Daley (69),
Shane Bertsch (71) and Todd Demsey (72) tied for third at 283.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: Keep praying for me  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
asked the congregation of a largely black Baptist church on Sunday
to not stop praying for her and her husband quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady began the fourth day of a five-day campaign trip
across upstate New York with a visit to the Mt. Olivet Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand here before you today to thank those of you who have
prayed for me and my husband. I believe that we have been sustained
and uplifted over the last many years because of prayer and so I
thank you and ask you not to quit yet,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she agreed with the concept some
parishioners talked about Sunday regarding the importance of
providing service and not just talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a difference between talking the talk and walking the
walk ... That might be a pretty good way to judge folks in
politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was welcomed to the church by the Rev. Dwight Cook, who
said, ''She shines like a light for all the world to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, like her husband, is using attendance at largely black
churches as part of her campaign strategy to help increase turnout
by minority voters come November. She also says that she simply
enjoys going to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love the enthusiasm, the music, the spirituality, the energy
that you find,'' Clinton told The Associated Press during an
interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton visited an ambulance service in Rochester to talk
about the high costs of fuel and to promote her previously
announced plans to lower fuel prices and increase fuel efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   It also allowed her to once again attack Republican rival Rick
Lazio's plan for repealing part of the federal gasoline tax. The
first lady has said the Long Island congressman's idea would hurt
New York because the state gets extra money from the federal gas
tax for highway projects. Lazio has said the tax repeal could
immediately lower gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the opportunity to bash the campaign support
from major oil companies for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue in the election because the major oil
companies are rather strong supporters of the other party,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for a renewed effort by Congress to impose
tougher fuel efficiency standards on the automobile industry. But
she stopped short of calling for cracking down on large sports
utility vehicles and small trucks, a sensitive issue for many SUV-
and pickup truck-loving Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to look hard at how we become more fuel efficient
(but) I don't have any specific recommendations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to take a hard look at all of our vehicles ... without
in any way infringing on people's rights to drive what they want to
drive,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a car-loving country and I'd be the last to argue
against that because it's given Americans that sense of mobility
and independence that is unique in the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said she felt empathy for her former Republican
opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over recent revelations contained
in a book by Village Voice reporter Wayne Barrett about the New
York City mayor. Among other things, the book said Giuliani's late
father had ties to mobsters. The book, ''Rudy! An Investigative
Biography,'' has led to a flurry of news stories over the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone feels an empathy for any person who has their past,
with their life, their family's life on the front pages. I know a
little bit about that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if such coverage was fair, the first lady said, ''Fair is
something for the media to determine. Those of us who are on the
other side of the microphone, all we can do is keep going,
persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later attended picnics near Syracuse and Utica where she
was greeted by supporters.

<HEADLINE> Villagers Burn Eight in Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A crowd of 200 villagers burned to death
eight men they accused of running guns and drugs in western
Guatemala's mostly-Indian highlands, police reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In what authorities described as a carefully planned attack late
Saturday, roads were blocked to trap the men, and the crowd pulled
them from their trucks, doused them with gasoline and set them on
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a well-planned attack by a few people that grew into
a huge crime,'' said De Mateo Sanchez, a spokesman for Guatemala's
national police force. ''The excitement attracted so many people to
join.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family and its associates had lots of enemies in town,
that is now very clear,'' Sanchez said. ''Neighbors and those who
committed the crime said they were criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred in the hamlet of Xalvaquiej, near the town
of Chichicastenango, 90 miles northwest of the capital, a popular
tourist destination known for its Indian handicraft market.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest instance of mob vigilante justice in several
years. In April, a Japanese tourist and a Guatemalan man were
attacked by mobs; dozens of similar attacks occurred in 1998 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the victims were members of a family that operated
trucks that carried people and supplies through the region, Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were all men, including a 60-year-old and his four
sons ages 26, 23, 18 and 17. Sanchez said two of the remaining
victims were drivers who worked for the family. The eighth man's
body was burned so badly police had not determined his identity or
age.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said the villagers involved in the slayings were
informed of the route the family's trucks would take through the
village Saturday night by a ''small group of men who planned the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The mob blocked off the few nearby dirt roads to trap their
victims. When the unsuspecting pickup trucks arrived, the villagers
pulled their occupants onto the road, dowsed them with gasoline and
burned them alive.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said local authorities had ''absolutely no evidence''
that the family and its employees were involved in any crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have a small and lonely, isolated village like this
one, outsiders can be scary to many of the people that live
there,'' he said. ''The victims were locals, but they came and left
so much it could have seemed suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Faustino Sanchez said Sunday that authorities
had identified three men thought to be ringleaders of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The men, whose names have not yet been released, were locals who
have since fled Xalvaquiej and are believed to be hiding in the
mountain woods of the western state of Quiche, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's gruesome attack in the popular and normally tranquil
region came two days before Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo
is scheduled to unveil a state plan aimed at improving Guatemala's
reputation for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Travel groups say this country's poor world image has prompted a
significant drop in tourism here recently. A Japanese tourist and a
Guatemalan bus driver were stoned and beaten to death in April in
the tourist village of Todos Santos Cuchuman, about 100 miles
northwest of Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   Until the April attack, Guatemala's wave of attacks -- which
claimed about 50 victims in 1998 and about three dozen in 1999 --
had appeared to be diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 U.N. report on previous attacks here said they were often
not misguided attempts at justice. Mobs were in some cases formed
before any crime was committed, and then attacked people suspected
of minor crimes or no crime at all.
</P>
<P>
   Villages such as this one, composed of mostly indigenous people,
faced the brunt of a bloody 36-year civil war. Villagers suffered
violence at the hands of military and paramilitary groups in the
protracted war.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Won't Play in All-Star Game  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Junior can play Home Run Derby, but he can't
play in his 11th All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds told Ken Griffey Jr. to sit out the All-Star
game Tuesday in Atlanta to rest his sore right knee. He'll be
allowed to defend his Home Run Derby title, but that's all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no say. Well, I do to a certain extent,'' Griffey said
Sunday. ''I guess they feel I don't need to aggravate it anymore.
I'll do the home run competition, then rest for two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has been wearing a protective brace for the last couple
of weeks because of his sore knee, Dr. Timothy Kremchek. Kremchek
and general manager Jim Bowden talked to Griffey before a 5-3 loss
to Cleveland on Sunday and told him to sit out the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's in the best interests for the baseball team that
he not play, not run the bases, not play the outfield, take the
three days off,'' Bowden said. ''We're in a pennant race and he's
an important part of this team and it's about winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Steve Finley was chosen to replace Griffey on the NL
All-Star roster.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey hurt his knee when he pulled up in the outfield on July
1 in Arizona. He argued with his father, bench coach Ken Sr., when
the Reds decided to remove him from the game later on.
</P>
<P>
   Kremchek said Griffey aggravated the knee while rounding third
base in a game in St. Louis last week, forcing him out of the
starting lineup for one day. The Reds said at the time that Griffey
was sick, and Griffey said he had a headache and stomachache.
</P>
<P>
   The outfielder hopes the knee heals to the point where he can
stop wearing the brace, which limits his movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like wearing that brace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injury, the Reds let him play all nine innings of a
14-5 victory over the Indians on Saturday. Griffey homered twice
and drove in a career-high eight runs.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey was in the lineup Sunday and made a nice running catch
on Travis Fryman's sinking liner to center in the fourth inning. He
went 0-for-3 and was ejected after arguing a called third strike
with home plate umpire Justin Klemm.
</P>
<P>
   Kremchek said Griffey was disappointed he couldn't play in the
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted to play in the All-Star game,'' Kremchek said. ''We
felt batting in the home run competition was not going to aggravate
it. We thought Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday off should have him
as close as he's going to be for the second half.''

<HEADLINE> Albert the Great Wins Belmont  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Albert the Great, a lightly regarded newcomer to
the 3-year-old stakes competition, beat three others, including the
winners of the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, in the $150,000, Grade
II Dwyer Stakes at Belmont Park on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Albert the Great led from start to finish and beat More Than
Ready by three lengths. Another 1&AMP;frac34; lengths back was Preakness
winner Red Bullet, while Belmont champion Commendable finished
last, another half-length back.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Richard Migliore and carrying 115 pounds, Albert the
Great extended his winning streak to four races after covering 1
1-16 miles on a fast track in 1:42:3.
</P>
<P>
   The colt by Go for Gin is undefeated in four starts since adding
blinkers to his equipment on April 22. Trainer Nick Zito said he
was ''ecstatic'' at the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Albert the Great returned $16 and $8.20, while More Than Ready,
which had not raced in two months, paid $4.30. There was no show
wagering.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Orseno, Red Bullet's trainer, was ''disappointed'' in the
Preakness winner's third-place finish but pointed to his horse's
''flipping in the gate'' as the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just can't break like that in a race like this'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, trainer of Commendable, admitted that ''coming
off the mile-and-a-half of the Belmont Stakes, I felt like he
wouldn't be sharp, but we needed this race to get him sharp. We're
trying to sharpen him up for the Haskell (at Monmouth on Aug. 6).
... This was not the immediate goal for Commendable. ... You can't
crank them up for every start.''

<HEADLINE> Selig: Change in Baseball Contract  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Two days before the All-Star game, baseball
commissioner Bud Selig promised there will be change in the next
labor contract, a demand that points toward a possible work
stoppage in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, speaking Sunday with union head Donald Fehr on NBC's
''Meet the Press,'' said the revenue disparity between the large
and small markets has increased.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that revenue sharing, salary restraint,
the way we do business with each other, all of that has to be
changed,'' Selig said. ''The fact of the matter is that the
disparity thing is so serious, wherever I go, whether it's
Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, San Diego, Milwaukee, Seattle,
that people are concerned. They're concerned that their team
doesn't have a realistic chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, the New York Yankees became the first baseball
team ever with a $100 million payroll -- more than six times
Minnesota's at $16.5 million. Management's attempt to get a
restraint on salaries is the primary reason baseball has had eight
work stoppages since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any historical precedent for it,'' Fehr said.
''We've always believed in free markets. ... The key is going to be
revenue sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' association is expected to exercise an option to
extend the current labor contract through the 2001 season. If
owners are serious about getting a restraint on salaries, a work
stoppage the following season is likely.
</P>
<P>
   On other topics, Fehr said it's doubtful the union would ever
agree to eliminate the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large generation of fans in American League cities have
grown up with the DH. I think it's popular there,'' Fehr said. ''I
think the controversy actually is good for baseball, and I don't
see any realistic prospect that that's likely to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Selig also repeated that Pete Rose's lifetime ban from baseball
is unlikely to change. Rose applied for reinstatement three years
ago, but Selig hasn't ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pete accepted voluntarily a lifetime suspension from Bart
Giamatti. There aren't any of us who are happy about it, and I
understand,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But protecting the integrity of the game is a responsibility
of the commissioner and of major league baseball, and until there's
anything further to talk about, it's just a subject that's painful
for all of us who have to be involved. ... I told a group of
children the other day that if there's ever a scintilla of doubt
when people go to a game that there's anything in question about
that game, we have no game left.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   COULD HAVE BEEN THERE: This marks the second straight All-Star
game not played at the site originally selected.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27, 1997, the commissioner's office announced the 2000
game would be played at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami, the home of
the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Major League baseball is gung-ho on the future of baseball in
South Florida,'' NL president Len Coleman said then. ''The year
2000 is a very special year all around the world and certainly the
All-Star game will be a significant event.''
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 1, 1998, baseball's tune had changed. The Marlins had
just sold off most of their stars and gone 54-108, the worst record
ever for a World Series champion. Attendance plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The National League has decided the All-Star game should be
played in new facilities, except in special circumstances,''
Coleman said then.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's game, originally scheduled for Milwaukee, was moved
to Boston's Fenway Park when it became clear Miller Park wouldn't
be ready and the Brewers then switched to the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's game is scheduled for Seattle's Safeco Field, the
2001 game for Milwaukee and the 2002 for Chicago's Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Plane Crash in Colombia Kills 13  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A twin-engine plane crashed Sunday on a
farm and burst into flames shortly after taking off south of the
capital, killing at least 13 people, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven injured passengers were pulled from the charred wreckage
of the Curtis C-46, and one died later at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One of the aircraft's engines apparently caught fire in flight.
However, authorities said they were just beginning to investigate
the crash outside Villavicencio, a state capital 45 miles from
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plane took off normally but soon afterward an engine
caught fire and I realized it was going down,'' Edgar Pabon, a
policeman who survived the accident, told the local RCN television
station from a clinic where he was being treated for minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody on board was panicking,'' Pabon added ''I was saved
by a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other police officers on the plane were killed, along with
the aircraft's four crew members, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The C-46 was a private plane, and the police officers were not
thought to be on official business.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty people were thought to have been on board. One was
unaccounted for and may be in the wreckage, Meta State police chief
Col. Yesid Vasquez reported.
</P>
<P>
   Villavicencio resident Eulalia Baquero said she heard the
aircraft making ''strange noises'' before seeing it plummet two
minutes after takeoff into a grove of trees on the farm located
about a mile from the city airport.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was headed for Mitu, a city near the eastern border
with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Local media reported the plane was 40 years old but had been
inspected and tested two months ago. That report could not
immediately be confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Tomatoes hit by fungus that started Irish Potato Famine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A farmer's tomato crop has been wiped out by
the moisture-loving fungus responsible for the Irish potato famine,
state agriculture experts have confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus, commonly associated with potatoes, can also ravage
tomato plants, which are genetically related to potatoes. Eggplants
and peppers, others in the family, don't seem to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The Potato Association of America at the University of Maine
reported Friday that late blight has become a significant problem
in Washington state, the nation's top potato producer. The disease
also has become a problem in Oregon, Nebraska and North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of the fungus in Maine or Idaho, the
nation's second- and third-ranked potato growing states.
</P>
<P>
   The wet weather of this spring and summer has provided a perfect
breeding ground for the fungus in New York where potatoes accounted
for 2 percent ($65 million) of total farm sales in 1998. Tomatoes
were worth $13.5 million that year.
</P>
<P>
   The state's farmers have dealt successfully with the fungus in
the past, keeping it in check with fungicides. But in the early
1990s, it began to develop resistant strains that have challenged
pest control experts and researchers who try to rein in the blight
that produces millions of spores which can be carried in the air to
surrounding crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is real serious,'' John Mishanec, pest control expert
with the Cornell Cooperative Extension, told The Daily Gazette of
Schenectady. ''It can knock a whole field down in four or five
days.''
</P>
<P>
   After he examined the fungus at an Albany County farm, Mishanec
mailed a warning letter to about 400 commercial growers in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of the blight include large spots on leaves and stems,
usually the size of a quarter or half dollar. They start out black
and turn brown, sometimes with a white powdery residue on the
outside of the lesion. On tomato fruit, it can cause a firm dark
greasy lesion that can cover half the tomato.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to deal with it is to prevent by planting disease
resistant varieties of vegetable and applying fungicide regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we don't want to hear about too many more cases,''
Thomas Lindberg, executive assistant to state Agriculture
Commissioner Nathan Rudgers, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   From 1845 to 1849, the blight wiped out the Irish potato crop,
resulting in 1.1 million deaths. Another 1.5 million people left
the country.

Cops: Villagers Burn Eight in Guatemala
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A crowd of 200 villagers burned to death eight men
they accused of running guns and drugs in western Guatemala's mostly-Indian
highlands, police reported today. In what authorities described as a carefully
planned attack late Saturday, roads were blocked to trap the men, and the crowd
pulled them from their trucks, doused them with gasoline and set them on fire.
''This was a well-planned attack by a few people that grew into a huge crime,''
said De Mateo Sanchez, a spokesman for Guatemala's national police force. ''The
excitement attracted so many people to join.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alzheimer's disease is increasing so fast that more than
22 million people worldwide will be affected by 2025, experts warned today. They
urged new research to spot the very earliest symptoms -- subtle ones that can
emerge a decade before true dementia hits -- and hunt for ways to protect these
people's brains. Already, doctors have discovered that a mild memory impairment
sometimes confused with normal aging can progress to full-blown Alzheimer's at a
rate of about 12 percent a year.

<HEADLINE> DePaula Activated, Davis Optioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians activated right-hander
Sean DePaula from the disabled list Sunday, the latest move to try
to steady their wobbly pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians optioned right-hander Kane Davis back to Triple-A
Buffalo a day after he got hit hard in a 14-5 loss to the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   DePaula had no decisions and a 5.94 ERA in 13 relief appearances
before he went on the disabled list May 29 with tendinitis in his
right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   DePaula pitched for Buffalo last Thursday as part of a rehab
assignment, giving up three runs on four hits in 1 2-3 innings. He
made five appearances for Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Davis gave up five hits, including three homers, and six runs in
2 2-3 innings Saturday. In two starts since he was called up from
Buffalo, Davis went 0-2 and gave up 13 hits and 13 runs in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have forced the Indians to use 26 pitchers this season,
matching the franchise record.

<HEADLINE> SAG Protests Bush Campaign Ad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- The Screen Actors Guild, in the midst of a strike
over pay for actors in radio and television ads, is quarreling with
George W. Bush's campaign over its use of non-union actors in at
least one commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of SAG members picketed for three hours on Saturday
outside a residence in Brooklyn that the Bush campaign rented to
tape a campaign spot.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the Bush campaign broke a promise not to
use non-union actors in its ads -- or to at least seek a waiver from
the union stipulating the campaign would pay the wages and
residuals union members are striking for. SAG officials were
further outraged that the campaign ignored a picket line to make
the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one thing to be involved in a non-union commercial. That
happens all the time. But to cross a picket line in the middle of a
political campaign -- that speaks for itself,'' said Pat O'Donnell,
executive director of SAG and the American Federation of Television
and Radio Actors in the Washington-Baltimore area.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials did not return calls on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker denied that any
agreement existed between SAG and the campaign. ''I don't know
where they got that idea,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and another union, AFTRA, went on strike May 1 against the
advertising industry, seeking to protect residuals, or fees paid
each time a radio or television commercial is broadcast.
Advertisers want to replace residuals with flat-fee payments for
work aired on major networks.
</P>
<P>
   The two unions -- the Screen Actors Guild and the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists -- have a combined
membership of 135,000.

<HEADLINE> Allenby Beats Price at Western Open  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Another playoff, another victory for Robert
Allenby.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian won the Western Open for his second PGA Tour
title Sunday, tapping in a 2-foot par putt to beat Nick Price on
the first extra hole. Allenby beat Craig Stadler on the fourth hole
of a playoff in the Houston Open in April.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time a playoff has cost Price a Western Open
title. Tom Kite won the 1986 tournament on the first extra hole of
a playoff with Price, Fred Couples and David Frost.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby and Price finished regulation at 14-under 274 and went
back to the par-4 18th to begin the playoff. Price made things
tough on himself right away, putting his tee shot into a bunker on
the right side of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   With a cluster of trees blocking his way to the hole, Price
played it safe and punched out to the fairway. But with Allenby on
the green in two, Price needed to put his next shot close to the
pin. Instead, it hit the green and rolled off, finally stopping in
the rough about 18 feet from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby missed an 18-foot birdie putt but tapped in for par,
forcing Price to hole his chip shot to force a second playoff hole.
The two-time Western Open winner came within a few inches, but his
ball rolled right on by to make Allenby the champion.
</P>
<P>
   He won $540,000 with the victory in the tournament, sponsored by
Advil.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Kraft, Shigeki Maruyama and Jim Furyk tied for third at
12-under 276. Tiger Woods, playing his first tournament since his
amazing 15-stroke victory in the U.S. Open, never got his putter
going and finished seven strokes back at 7-under 281.
</P>
<P>
   It was his worst finish since a tie for 37th in the Sprint
International last August. Coincidentally, that finish came a week
after he won the PGA Championship, his second major.
</P>
<P>
   Woods probably could have taken home his third Western Open
trophy if he'd only made half of the putts he missed. He missed so
many -- short and long -- he almost looked like a weekend hacker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just didn't make any putts. When that happens, you're not
going to go very low,'' said Woods, who closed with a 72.
''Overall, I hit the ball beautifully, hit a lot of good, solid
shots, held the ball in the wind. I drove it great this week. I
just didn't make any of those 10- or 15-footers to get the momentum
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Allenby appeared to have the title wrapped up with a birdie on
the par-5 15th that moved him to 16 under, two strokes ahead of
Price. But the Australian duffed a chip shot just off the green on
the next hole, hitting the lip of a bunker. The ball dropped into
the bunker, and Allenby settled for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   After Price missed birdie putts on 16 and 17, all Allenby had to
do was par the 18th -- something he'd done the first three days --
for a victory. But it wasn't that easy.
</P>
<P>
   His second shot landed on the back, right side of the green,
uphill from the pin that was tucked in the bottom, left corner. Hit
it too hard, and the ball would roll right into the water. Hit it
too soft, and it would stop.
</P>
<P>
   Using an iron, Allenby gently tapped the ball. The ball picked
up speed as it rolled and got within an inch of the cup, coming so
close its shadow covered the cup. But it kept going, rolling about
10 feet past the hole as Allenby bent his head.
</P>
<P>
   He still had a chance for par, but his putt curled away from the
hole and missed by about a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the group behind Allenby, Price knew he could win
with a birdie. But he sent his drive screaming off to the left side
and then sent his second shot dribbling off the green and down into
the sloping rough. It looked as if it might roll all the way into
the water, but it hung up in the apron off the green.
</P>
<P>
   Price chipped within 2 feet, and had to settle for par and the
playoff.

<HEADLINE> Dad Charged in Hockey Game Death  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SUKIENNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   READING, Mass. (AP) -- A man accused of a beating another father
at a youth hockey game has been charged with manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex County District Attorney Martha Coakley said Sunday
investigators have obtained a complaint and arrest warrant for
Thomas Junta, 42, in the death of 40-year-old Michael Costin.
</P>
<P>
   Junta allegedly beat Costin unconscious on Wednesday in a
dispute over rough play in a youth hockey game, and Costin died
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Costin had been out on the ice with a group of youngsters, all
about 10 years old, including his three sons and Junta's son. The
hockey game was supposed to be non-contact, but police say Junta
got agitated when things got rough and some of the players engaged
in checking.
</P>
<P>
   Junta and Costin began arguing with each other, and a rink
manager threw Junta out, but Junta returned, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Junta, who police say is 6-foot-1 and weighs 275-pounds, knocked
the 6-foot, 150-pound Costin to the floor and punched him in the
head, police said. Another adult broke up the fight, but Costin was
unconscious
</P>
<P>
   Coakley said Junta had notified authorities on Friday that he
was leaving for a vacation. She said Junta had been cooperative so
far and she expected him to turn himself in, but would not comment
on his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   An arraignment was tentatively scheduled for Monday at Woburn
District Court. Junta's phone number is unlisted, and the district
attorney's office declined to provide the name of his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest warrant for Junta, who was originally charged with
assault and battery, came after an autopsy by the state medical
examiner's office concluded Costin died of blunt force trauma to
the head and neck.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley said Junta was charged with manslaughter because there
was no indication of intent to kill.

<HEADLINE> Astros 9, Royals 6  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jose Lima snapped a personal 13-game losing
streak despite allowing three homers over seven innings, and Lance
Berkman drove in four runs with two homers as the Houston Astros
defeated the Kansas City Royals 9-6 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (2-13) hadn't won since his first start of the season on
April 5 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. After a slow start Lima
settled in, tying his season high with eight strikeouts and walking
three. He allowed seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Lima's 13 consecutive losses set a franchise record and lead the
majors. He also leads with 29 home runs allowed, 93 runs and 87
earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel got five outs for his first career save.
</P>
<P>
   Lima added to his stats early when he allowed three homers over
the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa hit a solo homer in the second inning and Mike
Sweeney, who went 4-for-4, added a two-run homer in the third that
gave the Royals a 3-2 lead. Sweeney has four hits eight times this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers tripled and scored on Jeff Bagwell's sacrifice fly
in the first off Jay Witasick (2-8), who lasted just three innings.
Moises Alou hit a solo homer in the second and Berkman's three-run
homer in the third put the Astros ahead 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio had a sacrifice fly in the fourth for a 6-3 lead,
and Johnny Damon led off the fifth with the third homer of the game
off Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers went 3-for-4 with two doubles and a triple. Spiers'
sixth-inning double drove in Lima, who got his third hit of the
season, and reliever Doug Bochtler walked Alou with the bases
loaded to make it 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Randa's RBI grounder scored Sweeney, and Dave
McCarty added a sacrifice fly off Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman's solo homer off Jeff Suppan in the fifth marked his
second career multihomer game and tied his career best with four
RBIs. Berkman had consecutive four-RBI games May 30-31 last season
at Colorado, and his other multihomer game was at San Diego last
July 31.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Royals shortstop Rey Sanchez had his franchise record of 60
consecutive games without an error snapped with a second-inning
miscue. It was his second error of the season. ... Witasick has two
complete games this season, the only ones registered by Royals
pitchers. ... The Astros have allowed a club-record 75 home runs at
home this season. They gave up 71 in 1998 at the Astrodome. ...
Bagwell's 10-game hitting streak equals his longest of the season.

   Lake Compounce will now require children between 46 inches and
56 inches tall to wear a life jacket while riding the Lake Plunge
slide, in which riders on inner tubes plunge down an enclosed slide
and into the park's lake. Children may opt out of that requirement
if they are accompanied by an adult on the inner tube. In the past,
children in that height range could ride alone if they professed to
being strong swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Devon M. Alexander fell off his inner tube while riding the Lake
Plunge on July 1. It took lifeguards 25 minutes to find Alexander
and pull him from the water. He died Friday at Connecticut
Children's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was closed following the accident, but reopened on
Saturday with the approval of the Department of Public Safety's
Fire Marshall's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bisi, spokesman for Lake Compounce, said the change in
the safety policy was designed to compel greater parental
supervision on the water slides, but was not an acknowledgment of
wrongdoing on the part of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials said Devon's stepfather told lifeguards after the
accident that the boy could not swim. Devon was not wearing one of
the optional life vests provided for water rides.
</P>
<P>
   Devon rode alone, but Lake Compounce officials said the family
was advised of the policy that riders must be strong swimmers, and
the boy's father gave permission for him to ride on the slide.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Dworkin, a professional aquatic safety and water rescue
consultant, told The Bristol Press he believes the park's minimum
height requirement of 46 inches was misleading, given the posted
warning that riders must be strong swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there are too many 5-or-6-olds that can be
strong swimmers,'' said Dworkin, who works for Lifesaving Resources
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bisi noted that Dworkin and other experts quoted by the
newspaper had never seen the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to feel very confident that we have followed all
of the correct procedures and that there is nothing out of the
ordinary regarding the design of this water slide,'' Bisi said.
</P>
<P>
   Bisi pointed to a report by Jeff Ellis &AMP; Associates, a firm the
park hired to study the ride after the drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based upon my review it appears that all applicable water-park
industry safety standards appear to have been satisfied or exceeded
with regard to your existing operation of the Lake Plunge water
slides,'' Ellis wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Police and state officials were still investigating the accident
this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Stabbing, Drugs Overshadow Parade  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- An 18-year-old girl died of an apparent drug
overdose and a man was stabbed at the weekend Love Parade, casting
a shadow over the huge open-air dance party that drew 1.3 million
techno music fans to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowds headed back home Sunday, the young woman was found
dead at a Berlin apartment after attending Saturday's mega-party.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they suspected she died of an overdose of ecstasy, a
hallucinogenic drug popular among teen-agers, especially those who
frequent nightclubs and all-night techno-dance parties known as
''raves.''
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing victim, a 20-year-old Belarusian, had surgery for
serious wounds and was expected to survive, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the parade largely lived up to its spirit of peace
and good times as youths from across Europe and beyond bounced to
pounding beats from 53 floats that rolled down western Berlin's
main street.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a demonstration for respect, tolerance and communication
between peoples,'' Love Parade organizer Matthias Roeingh -- better
known as DJ Dr. Motte -- declared to a huge cheer from the crowd.
Hot pink appeared to be the fashion color of choice, and many of
the ''ravers'' revealed more than they covered despite only
spring-like temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers didn't reach their goal of a record 1.7 million
people and even fell below last year's 1.5 million attendance. But
a simultaneous parade in Leeds, England, underlined the motto of
''One World, One Love Parade'' in the event's 12th year.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup crews fanned out in the city's main park Sunday to
remove tons of bottles, drink cans and other debris left by ravers,
many of whom spent the night outside. Garbage floated in park
ponds, and the stench of beer and urine hung over the area around
the landmark Victory Column in central Berlin where the parade
converged.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained at least 114 people, including 38 for illegal
drug dealing. Paramedics aided more than 700 people, including many
overwhelmed by party drugs or alcohol. But Peter Daube, in charge
of some 3,100 police officers called out for the event, called it a
''peaceful party'' overall.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut in 1989 with 150 people marching down western
Berlin's main shopping boulevard, the Love Parade has grown into
the world's biggest street party.
</P>
<P>
   This year brought an unlikely new star: German folk crooner
Gotthilf Fischer, 72, belted out one of his trademark songs to a
techno beat, sporting a strip of shaggy artificial turf on his
shirt to blend in with parade fashions. The crowd went wild.

Clinton Warns of Mideast Turmoil
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says the Middle East ''can move forward
toward peace, or can slide back into turmoil'' depending on the outcome of this
week's Israeli-Palestinian summit at Camp David. ''If the parties do not seize
this moment to make more progress, there will be more hostility and more
bitterness -- perhaps even more violence,'' the president writes in Newsweek
magazine. A stumbling block to the peace talks has arisen in Israel, where Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's coalition government collapsed around him Sunday,
threatening his ability both to govern and to make peace on the eve of a
high-stakes summit with the Palestinians.

Protestants March in N. Ireland
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Offering bitter words but no violence, an
estimated 3,000 Protestant hard-liners marched Sunday to a British army
barricade that prevented them from parading through the main Catholic district
of this fiercely Protestant town. Compounding intercommunal tensions, a car bomb
planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents detonated in front of a police
station in Stewartstown, 10 miles north of Portadown. The blast wounded a
policewoman in the leg and demonstrated that extremists on both sides want to
tear apart Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.

<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A crowd of 200 villagers burned to death eight men
they accused of running guns and drugs in western Guatemala's mostly-Indian
highlands, police reported today. In what authorities described as a carefully
planned attack late Saturday, roads were blocked to trap the men, and the crowd
pulled them from their trucks, doused them with gasoline and set them on fire.
''This was a well-planned attack by a few people that grew into a huge crime,''
said De Mateo Sanchez, a spokesman for Guatemala's national police force.

illnesses, a jury now is on the verge of punishing Big Tobacco like no jury ever
has punished anyone before. In closing arguments set to start tomorrow, smokers'
attorney Stanley Rosenblatt is expected to specify an amount for punitive
damages to be sought from the nation's five biggest cigarette makers. Witnesses
in the landmark class-action case, filed on behalf of some 300,000 to 700,000
sick Florida smokers, contended that the companies could afford to pay $150

GOP Convention To Draw Protesters

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Protests planned for the Republican National Convention
are unlikely to draw as many people as trade meetings in Seattle last year,
police and protest organizers say. At least 10,000 demonstrators are expected
for GOP gathering here from July 31-Aug. 3, far less than the 40,000 people who
descended upon Seattle for World Trade Organization meetings last fall,
according to interviews with organizers and local group leaders. As many as
100,000 protesters had been forecast for Philadelphia.

   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) -- Four men were injured and several others suffered
cuts and bruises from stampeding bulls Sunday -- the third day of Spain's
immensely popular San Fermin Fiesta bull runs in Pamplona. Six bulls trotted
through Pamplona's crowded cobblestone streets in a three-minute dash to the
arena where they later faced bullfighters. The run was far more crowded than in
previous days, increasing the danger to the runners.

Piazza: Clemens Threw At Me

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza angrily accused Roger Clemens today of throwing
at his head in the second inning of Saturday night's game at Yankee Stadium. The
New York Mets catcher was hit on the helmet by Clemens' pitch and had to leave
the second game of the day-night doubleheader against the Yankees with a slight
concussion. Piazza was not in the starting lineup for Sunday night's Subway
Series finale at Shea Stadium, and his status for Tuesday's All-Star game in
Atlanta is doubtful.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Reform Makes Exceptions  </HEADLINE>
By VICKI SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, W.Va. (AP) -- Welfare laws force recipients to leave
the house, get a job and become self-sufficient -- the very things
batterers try to prevent their victims from doing.
</P>
<P>
   People who don't meet federal work requirements, regardless of
the reason, can lose benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A state program in the planning stages since 1997 is finally
getting started, granting exemptions to victims who disclose their
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare case workers help identify victims, then refer them to
programs offering support and guidance. People who qualify can be
exempted from work, training or educational requirements, and can
receive a check beyond the federal limit of five years. Exemptions
last for six months and can be renewed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ''West Virginia is one of only a handful of states to make a
financial commitment to moving battered women through welfare
reform,'' said Anne Menard, a consultant to the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The state has used surplus money from its welfare program to
hire a family violence option advocate in all 55 counties, as well
as a full-time state coordinator. It also is funding job training,
parenting courses and other services, for a total investment of
$2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a visionary decision to provide this kind of funding,''
said Menard, who helped train the county advocates. ''The reality
is, some states are very hostile to their welfare populations.''
</P>
<P>
   The family violence option also can exempt a parent from
enforcement of child support or spousal support orders, both of
which are required under welfare reform and both of which can
escalate or renew abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Most women who are being abused are already working, Menard
said. But those venturing into the work force because of welfare
reform often see their abusers go to great lengths to maintain
control.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates and welfare case workers are forging a new alliance
through the family violence option, learning each other's job
duties and restrictions as well as the dynamics of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Already, bringing them together has paid off. During the
training session, some advocates discovered why they had not been
receiving referrals. In many cases, state Department of Health and
Human Resources case workers were interviewing men and women
together about their long-term plans for getting off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not going to say anything if the guy's sitting right
there,'' said an exasperated Sarah Thumm, Monongalia County's
advocate. ''Case workers won't pick up on signs unless you have
something as obvious as a big black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the decision of whether to interview people
individually was left to the local case worker. Soon, the state
will make it standard procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Working out kinks like that is just part of the process, said
Sue Julian, team coordinator at the Coalition Against Domestic
Violence in Kanawha County.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been very slow getting off the ground,'' she said of
the family violence option. ''But it was really important for the
state to take time to understand more thoroughly the possible
implications of their policies.''

<HEADLINE> Protestants March in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Offering bitter words but no
violence, an estimated 3,000 Protestant hard-liners marched Sunday
to a British army barricade that prevented them from parading
through the main Catholic district of this fiercely Protestant
town.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding intercommunal tensions, a car bomb planted by Irish
Republican Army dissidents detonated in front of a police station
in Stewartstown, 10 miles north of Portadown. The blast wounded a
policewoman in the leg and demonstrated that extremists on both
sides want to tear apart Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In Portadown, leaders of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's
major Protestant fraternal group, promised they would eventually
get their way and march down disputed Garvaghy Road by wearing down
British authorities through mass civil disobedience. That tactic
worked in 1996, but Britain has insisted it won't cave in this
time, reinforced by the 2,000 soldiers backing up police units in
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   And unrest did resume after dark in a few hard-line Protestant
neighborhoods. Police seized nail bombs, clubs and slingshots from
rioters in Larne, north of Belfast, and chased youths away from
burning road barricades in north and south-central Belfast. Two
vehicles were hijacked and set on fire near the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Protestants, mostly young men, massed at the
Portadown confrontation zone, among them Johnny ''Mad Dog'' Adair,
the most infamous anti-Catholic terrorist in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd tossed firecrackers and golf balls at police and
soldiers standing about a hundred yards away on the far side of
extensive barbed-wire defenses. About a hundred men ran through
pastures in a bid to invade Garvaghy Road via the graveyard
adjoining the area's Catholic church, but soldiers and police in
armored cars cut them off and forced them back. No serious
casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, which represents a sizable chunk of Protestant
opinion opposed to the 1998 accord, has refused to meet Garvaghy
Road residents since militants there first blocked the Orangemen's
parade route in 1995. Orangemen cite the IRA background of the
Catholic protest leader, Breandan MacCionnaith, as justification
for refusing direct talks.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's car bomb attack in Stewartstown heightened many
Protestants' belief that the IRA itself remained committed --
despite its 1997 cease-fire -- to the abolition of Northern Ireland
as a Protestant-majority state linked with Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan, commander of the province's
police force, said the car bomb outside the Stewartstown police
station had been planted by a dissident group dubbed the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   That faction, representing IRA members opposed to the 1997
cease-fire, officially proclaimed a cease-fire after committing the
single deadliest terrorist strike in Northern Irish history -- the
1998 car bombing of the religiously mixed town of Omagh that killed
29 people.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who today is a
Sinn Fein member of Northern Ireland's new power-sharing
government, called the bombers ''people of no credibility who are
locked in the past and have nothing to offer the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the scene at Stewartstown, where the blast blew in
windows and doors and damaged a gas station, McGuinness said it was
''an ironic fact'' that both Orangemen and the Real IRA were
similarly hostile to the peace process and ''working to the same
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech, Gracey won laughs and cheers as he parodied
the idea that the Real IRA faction was separate from the mainstream
IRA. ''There's no such thing as a dissident republican,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its formation in 1998, a government-appointed Parades
Commission has ordered Portadown Orangemen to stay away from
Garvaghy Road. The joint Catholic-Protestant commission this year
emphasized the only way it would sanction an Orange parade through
the area would be after extensive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bigoted, biased and discriminatory Parades Commission
determination is not and will not be accepted by this district,''
declared the Portadown Orangemen's district secretary, Nigel
Dawson, who tried to hand a formal letter of protest to a police
officer on the far side of the barricade.
</P>
<P>
   When that proved technically impossible, Dawson won more cheers
by claiming that the predominantly Protestant police force had
refused to take the letter ''not because of the barrier, but
because of the shame.''
</P>
<P>
   And the hatred between Portadown Protestants and Catholic
protesters was on display as the Orange parade passed a Catholic
church near Garvaghy Road en route to the confrontation point.
</P>
<P>
   As riot police stood between the sides, backed by barbed-wire
coils and armored cars, several Protestants accompanying the Orange
march spotted MacCionnaith leading the Catholic crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''You IRA scum certainly go out of your way to be offended,''
shouted one woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't get to you now, Breandan, but a bullet'll get you
someday,'' said a teen-age boy.

and the fan favorite finished with six points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit used a late 10-0 run to take a 34-28 halftime lead, and
they were ahead 52-45 edge with 9:42 to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Orlando scored the next eight points, five from Shannon
Johnson, to go up 53-52 with 7:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded the lead until jumpers by Elaine Powell and
Tiffany Wait gave the Miracle a 59-56 lead with 4:45 to go.
</P>
<P>
   After a jumper by Detroit's Elena Tornikidou jumper, Adrienne
Johnson hit a 3-pointer to increase the Orlando margin to four.
</P>
<P>
   The Miracle led 65-59 with 90 seconds left, but a layup by
Palmer and a free throw by Astou Ndiaye-Diatta pulled Detroit
within three with 25 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Johnson made one of two free throws, and after Palmer
missed, Carla McGhee made two free throws to clinch the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tornikidou added 13 points for the Shock.

<HEADLINE> 5 Injured at Chrysler Plant in Ontario  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAMPTON, Ontario (AP) -- An explosion Sunday in the paint shop
of a Chrysler plant sparked a massive fire and toxic fumes,
injuring five workers.
</P>
<P>
   Police officer Wendy Sims said it was unclear what caused the
explosion at the Chrysler Bramalea Assembly in Brampton's
industrial area. A solvent line in the plant's paint area had
ruptured, and fire officials were waiting for it to die down before
they could determine the cause of the explosion, Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, 32, was airlifted to a hospital with head and chest
injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Two workers, a 21-year-old male and a 24-year-old female, were
transported to area hospitals for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A male and female, both 48, were treated at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The plant was on a summer shutdown but more than 200 employees,
contract workers and security personnel were at the plant Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Toxic fumes and flames that resulted from the explosion were
under control late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bramalea Assembly Plant, which opened in 1987, produces the
Intrepid, Concorde and 300M, among other car models.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the plant underwent $850 million in renovations to
allow for construction of the vehicles' new designs.

<HEADLINE> Haitians Vote in Elections  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORNILLON, Haiti (AP) -- Former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
was expected to emerge more powerful than ever Sunday, after
Haitians voted in a final round of legislative elections that have
inspired international criticism and a boycott by nearly every
opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout appeared to be lukewarm as the balloting ended Sunday
night without incident. Vote-counting began immediately afterward,
but the first results were not expected to be released for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their own doubts, many voters said they felt Aristide's
Lavalas Family party was their only hope for restoring a working
government to the impoverished Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lavalas was sent from God to save Haiti,'' said Joseph
Francois, a 30-year-old university student in the eastern town of
Cornillon.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, the United States, Canada and France have
condemned the first-round count, and international observers
refused to monitor Sunday's second round in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds gathered for the 6 a.m. opening of polling stations, but
turnout appeared to be lower than the 55 percent seen during
first-round elections on May 21. Figures were not immediately
available, but elections operations director Luciano Pharaon said
he expected about 40 percent participation.
</P>
<P>
   Pharaon reported no violence, though he said militants tried to
barricade streets in protest in two northern towns and near western
Gonaives during the night and early Sunday. The protests were
broken up by police without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Local elections officials postponed balloting in northern Le
Borgne Sunday morning, apparently fearing unrest. The postponement
left 44 seats in contention for the 83-member Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake is $500 million in frozen foreign aid and, in all
likelihood, the future of a tortuous decade-old experiment with
democracy in the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of legislative and local elections yielded
strong support for Aristide's Lavalas Family party -- but also
bitter recriminations over a vote count that allegedly was
illegally manipulated to favor his party.
</P>
<P>
   ''The elections were not fair,'' said 75-year-old voter Kiefer
Nazaire in northern St. Marc. But in a reflection of the resilience
of Aristide, Nazaire said he would vote Sunday for Lavalas because
he felt there was no viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   First-round results showed Lavalas ahead in all of the districts
at stake Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties may have sent a contradictory message: Their
candidates ran Sunday, but their national leaders had called for a
boycott of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Pharaon said only about six candidates out of more than 90 had
publicly withdrawn from Sunday's vote -- but only verbally, not
formally by letter.
</P>
<P>
   The elections have been tainted from the beginning by charges
that Lavalas used intimidation tactics and stacked electoral
councils with its people. Fifteen people, most from the opposition,
were killed in the run-up to the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   But the main point of disagreement now is the method used to
calculate which candidates would go to the second round. The method
used gave Aristide candidates 16 of 19 contested seats in the
27-seat Senate. An independent candidate won one seat, and results
have not been announced for the other two.
</P>
<P>
   In the 83-member Chamber of Deputies, Aristide's party won 26
seats in the first round, and in the cases of 12 other seats -- most
in the Grand'-Anse district -- counting has not been completed or
will be decided in a later runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Results released Friday also gave Lavalas 89 of 115 mayoral
elections and 321 of 485 rural councils.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti hasn't had a Parliament since January 1999, when an
18-month struggle over legislative elections marred by
irregularities led Aristide's successor and protege, President Rene
Preval, to dismiss lawmakers. He has ruled by decree since.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean country of 8 million people lives in crushing
poverty that the government has been unable to ease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hungry, we don't have houses, we have no hospital,''
said Ynela Dorcee, a 45-year-old farmer in Cornillon. ''We don't
have a responsible authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people still view Aristide -- who is favored to win November
presidential elections -- as a potential savior and say that support
is filtering down to his party.

<HEADLINE> Sharif's Wife Vows To Fight  </HEADLINE>
By MUNIR AHMED
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- The wife of deposed prime minister Nawaz
Sharif vowed Sunday to launch a nationwide campaign to oust
Pakistan's military government, a day after the army stopped her
from staging a protest march.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Kulsoom Sharif, who says she is under
house arrest, accused army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf of
endangering Pakistan's security, although she didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot allow a few incompetent generals to threaten
Pakistan's existence and deny democracy to its people,'' she said.
''We will force them to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   The army threw out her husband's government in a bloodless coup
last Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sharif, who was rarely seen in public while her husband was
in power, has been catapulted into the public eye since the coup,
which the army said it staged because of runaway corruption and
economic incompetence of the Sharif regime.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mrs. Sharif conducted a nine-hour standoff with
police, refusing to leave her locked vehicle after the military and
police stopped her from beginning a protest march.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she was escorted to one of her family's homes on the
outskirts of Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's populous Punjab
province.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday I proved that a weak woman like me can challenge the
military rulers,'' she said. ''They cannot dampen our spirits. We
will force them to quit power.''
</P>
<P>
   The army has banned public demonstrations and protest marches
saying that the military rulers want stability while they try to
fix Pakistan's ailing economy and root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif is in prison currently serving two concurrent life terms
after being convicted of terrorism and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif also faces several charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest crackdowns since the coup, the military
ordered the arrest last week of an estimated 260 Sharif supporters
in an apparent attempt to stop the protest march.
</P>
<P>
   However Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League is deeply divided over
his wife's role in championing his innocence. None of the senior
leaders of his party are participating in the protest march.

<HEADLINE> 19 Die in Mexico Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- A twin-engine
passenger plane crashed on a domestic flight from the southern
Mexican state of Chiapas, killing all 19 people aboard, authorities
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   AeroCaribe flight 7831, carrying 17 passengers and two crew
members, crashed Saturday evening after it left the Chiapas state
capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez on a short flight to Villahermosa,
capital of the neighboring Gulf coast state of Tabasco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plane ... was found Sunday morning in a gully which is
very difficult to reach. It has been confirmed that there are no
survivors,'' AeroCaribe said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included four children, 13 adults, and two pilots.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of those aboard were believed to be Mexican
citizens, said Jose Ferroso, manager of AeroCaribe's main offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetstream-32 turbo prop, made by British Aerospace, is
similar to the J-31 commuter plane that crashed in Pennsylvania in
May after both engines failed. Nineteen people were also killed in
that crash.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate report on the cause of Saturday's crash,
but the pilot reported bad weather conditions ten minutes before he
lost contact with the control tower.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last message from the pilot was that he was deviating
slightly from the route because of bad weather,'' said Gerardo
Bracamontes, AeroCaribe's regional manager in Tuxtla Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   The AeroCaribe flight crashed in a remote, roadless northern
section of Chiapas about 35 miles south of Villahermosa. Rescue
crews were dispatched to the area, but will take several hours to
reach the mountainous site, said the regional director of the
Tuxtla Gutierrez airport.
</P>
<P>
   According to passenger lists, two of the children -- Anthony and
Christopher McDade -- listed their father as an American who was
apparently not aboard the flight. However, the children's
nationalities were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   AeroCaribe, an affiliate of Mexicana -- one of Mexico's two major
carriers -- covers routes in southern Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Voters Choose Committee  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARET WONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- An elite group of voters went to the polls
Sunday to choose a committee charged with selecting Hong Kong's
future lawmakers in an election critics labeled as undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Only 177,000 of Hong Kong's 3.1 million registered voters were
eligible to choose the 800-member Election Committee, which will
elect six lawmakers for the 60-seat legislature in September's
general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Voters from 35 professional, financial, commercial, and other
business groups chose candidates of the sectors they represented.
</P>
<P>
   When voting ended, only 19.5 percent of 168,000 voters had cast
ballots. The remaining 9,000 voters did not vote because candidates
in their groups ran unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   Among those contesting the election were Li Ka-shing, Hong
Kong's wealthiest man and chairman of the property giant Cheung
Kong (Holdings) Ltd., and his son, Richard Li, owner of Pacific
Century CyberWorks Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Some 136 seats on the committee were filled automatically by
religious leaders, current lawmakers, Hong Kong members of China's
National People's Congress and a mainland advisory committee. An
additional 182 people ran unopposed, leaving 723 candidates running
for the remaining 482 seats.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen democracy activists demonstrated outside two of
the 100 polling stations, calling for a full-scale general
election. They waved placards with such slogans as ''Abolish small
circle elections'' and ''We demand general elections.''
</P>
<P>
   There were minor scuffles with police but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the system served only the interests of local
business leadera and China, which gained sovereignty over Hong Kong
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The committee may also be empowered to select a replacement for
Hong Kong's top leader, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, when his
first term expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 of the 60 lawmakers will be popularly elected in the
legislative polls on Sept. 10. Thirty will be chosen by small
groups of voters representing various professions, such as doctors,
lawyers and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong has never been a full-fledged democracy. Efforts by
the last British colonial governor, Chris Patten, to give voters
more power were reversed by Beijing after it regained the
territory's sovereignty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The territory's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law,
promises slow but progressive democratization. Hong Kong could
become a full democracy by 2007 under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the slow pace of democracy is needed to
maintain political and economic stability in the territory.

<HEADLINE> Water contamination worries ailing neighbors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST FISHKILL, N.Y. (AP) - State and federal officials have
joined residents to determine how drinking water here is being
contaminated with industrial solvents and other pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're totally contaminated,'' resident Peter Parenti told The
Poughkeepsie Journal. His family has been advised by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and the state departments of health
and environmental conservation to drink and cook with bottled water
and take lukewarm, well-ventilated showers.
</P>
<P>
   Parenti is among 47 homeowners in the Shenandoah Road area whose
water has tested positive for high levels of the industrial
solvents tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) as
well as other chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
which have been linked to an increased risk of cancer and other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum contaminant level allowed for PCE in drinking water
is five parts per billion. Some wells in East Fishkill have tested
as high as 1,100 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination was uncovered in March when John Condon had
his water tested after his family suffered from a host of health
problems over the past year including sinus and ear infections,
migraine headaches and a worsening of his son's asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The government agencies are installing filtration systems in
homes while they study the contamination. Once a source is
discovered, a remedy will be sought.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials have said the nearby IBM East
Fishkill site is probably not the source of the contamination since
groundwater flows in the other direction. That determination has
upset neighbors who point to a spill at the plant about years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Residents hope the neighborhood eventually can tie into a
regional water system but local government officials say that is at
least three years away.

Gas Prices Drop, First in Months

   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices dropped an average of 4.45 cents a
gallon nationwide in the past two weeks, marking the first decline since prices
began skyrocketing two months ago, an analyst said. The weighted average price
of gasoline dipped to $1.6689 Friday, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000
stations. The decline follows a series of price increases that pushed the
average cost of self-serve regular in Chicago to $2.13 -- the first time ever a
city's overall average gas price topped $2 a gallon. Dramatic drops in Midwest
gasoline prices since the last survey June 23 helped bring the national average
down, but prices elsewhere in the country have shown little change or are up
slightly, analyst Trilby Lundberg said today.

<HEADLINE> Fort Drum to get battle simulation center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT DRUM, N.Y. (AP) - Within two years, the Army expects to
have a sophisticated battle simulation center built here, letting
planners wage virtual reality wars anywhere, under any circumstance
with zero risk to human life.
</P>
<P>
   Congress recently approved $12 million for construction of the
center as part of a $23.7 million financing package for projects at
the base near Watertown, 66 miles north of Syracuse. The president
is expected to approved the bill this month.
</P>
<P>
   The facility will feature state-of-the-art computers to simulate
a military operation anywhere in the world, digitally depicting
everything from the terrain of a particular country to the layout
of its cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The advantage of that is there are skills we can train in
simulation that used to be trained in the field environment with
soldiers and it was much more expensive and less efficient,'' said
Col. Galen Jackman, assistant division commander for support at the
base.
</P>
<P>
   The site also will include a top-secret storage facility so
classified battle maneuvers also could be practiced.
</P>
<P>
   The base currently uses an older, outdated simulation center
housed in six separate World War II-era buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The center will allow links to other simulation centers at bases
across the country and have video teleconferencing facilities and
classrooms.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Blaze Brought Under Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GATEWAY, Colo. (AP) -- Crews brought a 4,960-acre wildfire under
control Sunday and hoped to have another fire encircled by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze south of here was controlled at 6 p.m. Sunday, a week
after it was reported, and crews began packing up to go home, said
Jenny Farenbaugh, a spokeswoman for the interagency firefighting
team.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was caused by lightning. It cost $1.3 million to
extinguish.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 miles to the north, the Buster Flats Fire remained 65
percent contained for a second day after burning 11,033 acres in
and around Dinosaur National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast called for cooler temperatures and higher humidity.
Officials projected the fire would be 100 percent contained, or
completely encircled by fire lines, by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four helicopters and 221 firefighters, including three hot shot
crews, were on the scene Sunday and the cost of battling the blaze
was estimated at $700,000 to date.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 10, Devil Rays 9  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Preston Wilson homered and drove in a career-high
four runs and Cliff Floyd added a three-run shot as the Florida
Marlins beat the Tampa Bay Devils Rays 10-9 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins broke a 4-4 tie in the fourth inning against Doug
Creek when Wilson doubled in Floyd from second base for a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson made it 6-4 when he forced catcher Mike DiFelice to drop
the ball for an error on an attempted steal of home.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Wilson, who was 3-for-5 with two runs scored, hit
a 3-run homer off reliever Esteban Yan to extend the lead to 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd also scored three times as part of his 3-for-4 day.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays pulled within one when Gerald Williams hit a
three-run home run off Brad Penny in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez (5-7) allowed five hits while striking out three
and walking one in five innings for the Marlins. Two of the hits
were home runs to Fred McGriff and Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca got four outs for his major league leading
28th save in 31 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Rupe, called up by the Devil Rays from Triple-A Durham on
Saturday night, had a rough time in his first major league start
since May 2.
</P>
<P>
   In 2 2-3 innings, Rupe allowed six hits, walked four, hit two
batters and issued a wild pitch while allowing four earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Creek relieved Rupe in the third. Creek (0-1) allowed two
runs and two hits in 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays tied it with two runs in the fourth. Greg Vaughn
led off with his 14th home run to make it 4-3. McGriff then
doubled, advanced to third on Andy Fox's fielding error and scored
on a sacrifice fly by Vinny Castilla.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McGriff's first inning homer, a two-run shot, was the 408th
of his career. He passed Duke Snider to move into 30th place on the
career list. ... Wilson's homer traveled 459 feet, the fifth
longest by a Marlins player at home. ... The Marlins have a
team-record 97 home runs at the All-Star break. ... A 1 hour, 45
minute rain delay in the top of the seventh inning was only the
Marlins third at home this season.

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam Wins LPGA's Jamie Farr  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) -- Annika Sorenstam's four-shot lead faded in
the rain, but her birdie on the second hole of a playoff in the
Jamie Farr Kroger Classic gave the Swedish star her fourth LPGA
Tour victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Hetherington birdied the final two holes of regulation to
pull even with Sorenstam at 10-under 274.
</P>
<P>
   After playing together all day Sunday, they returned to the 18th
tee for the first hole of the playoff. Hetherington missed a
20-foot birdie putt, then had to make a slick 5-footer coming back
to save par. Sorenstam just missed her birdie putt from 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Both drove into ideal position in the fairway on No. 1, a par-4.
However, Hetherington's 6-iron approach to the front of the green
spun back, leaving her 20 feet short of the green and 60 feet from
the hole. She chipped 6 feet past the hole, but Sorenstam, after
hitting her 6-iron just below pin high, coolly rolled in her
straight 11-footer for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam collected $150,000 for her 22nd career win.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 25th time Sorenstam has led an LPGA event heading
into the final round and she won for the 16th time -- including
three of the four this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth playoff in the tournament's 16 years,
including last year's LPGA record six-way playoff, won by Se Ri
Pak.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to become only the seventh player to ever win the same
LPGA tournament three consecutive years, Pak climbed the
leaderboard in the final round and tied Sorenstam. Down five shots
at the start, she pulled even with a birdie at the 13th hole.
</P>
<P>
   But Pak's three-putt bogey at 16 gave Sorenstam the lead again --
until Hetherington's fast finish.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam started the day at 10 under. But she came up short
with a 5-iron on the very first hole and missed a 10-footer --
resulting in her first bogey in 41 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Her lead was cut in half by the time lightning and rain caused a
suspension of play, just after she parred No. 2. Pak's two early
birdies and one by Hall of Famer Beth Daniel on No. 2 pulled them
within two shots.
</P>
<P>
   She still wasn't out of the woods -- literally.
</P>
<P>
   After a 44-minute suspension of play due to lightning,
Sorenstam's next shot -- her drive on the dogleg par-4 4th -- clipped
a tree and her ball ricocheted into the rough short of the fairway.
From there she hooked a wood into a trap 50 yards short of the
green, and then blasted out to 9 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding another misstep, she canned the par putt -- pumping her
fist for emphasis as the ball fell in the cup.
</P>
<P>
   She followed that with birdies on three of the next four holes --
hitting putts of 7, 22 and 14 feet -- to build a three-shot lead
over Pak.
</P>
<P>
   But Sorenstam encountered trouble again at No. 9, finding a trap
off the tee and then watching as her line-drive 5-iron skipped off
the right side of the green and rolled all the way down a big hill.
</P>
<P>
   Just as she readied to hit her approach to the green, however,
play was suspended again. She marked her ball and hurried to the
clubhouse before black clouds dumped rain on the course. Play was
halted for 1 hour and 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the players returned, Sorenstam chipped to 3 feet but
missed the par putt and Pak was only two back. Another bogey by
Sorenstam at the 12th, in conjunction with Pak's birdie at 13,
pulled them even.
</P>
<P>
   After Pak's bogey at 16, she had a 6-footer for birdie on the
last hole to tie Sorenstam again but it just skimmed off the lip.
She had to settle for a 67 that left her alone in third at 9-under
275.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's 69 put her next at 276. Heather Bowie, Jane Crafter and
Jeong Jang were another shot back.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Vahe Oshagan, a critically acclaimed
Armenian-language poet, died June 30 of complications from heart
surgery. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Oshagan was famed in Armenian intellectual circles for his eight
volumes of poetry, six volumes of fiction, and many short stories,
plays and commentaries. Most of his works were written in Armenian
but some have been translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   Oshagan is credited with having revolutionized Armenian poetry
by rejecting its imposed formality, often writing in colloquial
language. He was also hailed for giving a voice to the Armenian
diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   Oshagan grew up in Cyprus and Jerusalem, and studied at the
Sorbonne in Paris, where he received a doctorate in comparative
literature in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He taught in Lebanon for the next quarter-century while writing,
but came to Philadelphia with the advent of civil war in Lebanon in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 to 1982, he taught Armenian language, history and
culture at the University of Pennsylvania. His 1980 poem
''Ahazank'' (''Alert'') includes several street scenes and
landmarks of Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Father Speaks in Lane Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Fred Lane had returned to Charlotte the
day he was shot and killed by his wife so he could raise some cash,
not to reconcile with her, Lane's father says.
</P>
<P>
   Family, friends and former teammates of the former Carolina
Panthers running back also said Lane told them he was broke and
that Deidra Lane was concealing the location of their money.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was going to sell (a) motorcycle, so he would have some
money,'' Fred Lane Sr. said Saturday. ''She wouldn't tell him where
(the couple's money) was.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a former Carolina Panthers running back traded in April to
Indianapolis, was fatally shot Thursday by Deidra Lane in their
suburban Charlotte home, according to police. Investigators
questioned her Thursday for several hours before she was released.
Deidra Lane has not been charged and police spent the weekend
determining whether the shooting was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point in the investigation, it's not probably strong
one way or the other,'' said Mark Corwin, the lead investigator in
the case for Charlotte-Mecklenburg police. ''Everybody has a
theory, but what can be proved, at this point, it's not one way or
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Former teammates of Fred Lane on the Panthers say they have
scheduled a meeting with police investigators to relay what they
claim was reckless behavior by Deidra Lane, The (Nashville)
Tennessean reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Running back William Floyd said he, Chris Terry and Muhsin
Muhammad, set up the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned he could have called the police on her
several times for domestic violence,'' Floyd said. ''I've seen
stuff with my own eyes ... He's come around my house with knots on
him and all scratched up and telling me about her throwing stuff at
him and trying to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd and two of Lane's other friends said Lane had told them
that Deidra Lane had drained the couple's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Pelpes, a friend of Lane's in Charlotte, said he had to
loan Lane a total of $155 on two separate occasions to get home
after Lane told him he was broke. According to Pelpes, Lane said
Deidra Lane had told him she'd been sending money to a financial
planner, but when Lane called the financial planner recently he had
no knowledge of the money's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lane Sr. confirmed that story.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money that was supposed to be there wasn't there, Fred
Lane Sr. said. ''I told him, son, whatever she did with the money
it doesn't make any difference, it's only money and you're going to
make more. I told him to just let it be.''
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane released a statement through her attorney Sunday
evening in which she said she loved her husband and shares his
family's grief over his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''At his best, Fred could be very good,'' she said. ''At his
worst, Fred was very different. I choose to remember Fred at his
best. I want to help all of our children to remember Fred at his
best.
</P>
<P>
   ''... Celebrity and the environment that comes with fame
surrounded our lives and was sometimes a destructive force,'' she
added. ''... Hurtful things have already been said in the press. I
do not wish to add to the pain. I put my trust in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane signed a prenuptial agreement before her 1998
marriage to Fred Lane, The Charlotte Observer reported Sunday,
citing a family source. That agreement specified that the couple's
Charlotte home, bought last year for $190,500, belonged to Fred
Lane, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's father said his son left Charlotte for home in Nashville,
Tenn., a few weeks ago after a pair of gun-related incidents
involving Deidra Lane.
</P>
<P>
   In one, the father said, his son claimed his wife fired a
shotgun through a wall while he was in another room. In the other,
Fred Lane Sr. said, his son told him Deidra Lane pointed a handgun
at him. After both incidents, he said, his son took the gun and
gave it to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lane Jr. did not report the gun incidents because of an
earlier domestic violence complaint filed by Deidra Lane against
her husband and due to his own arrest in February in Tennessee,
Fred Lane Sr. said. He faced a misdemeanor drug charge at the time
of his death. Lane was killed Thursday shortly after a flight from
Tennessee to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service Deidra Lane planned for her husband on Monday
in Charlotte has been canceled. Instead, visitors will be received
from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday at University Park Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family decided not to have it,'' A.L. Jinwright, a funeral
service director, said of the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral service for Lane will be held at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the
People's Baptist Church in Franklin, Tenn.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Now Wants To Stay With Cubs  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Sammy Sosa reversed course Sunday and told the
Chicago Cubs they should stop trying to trade him, saying he would
remain in Chicago through the end of his contract in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who earlier this year told the Cubs to trade him unless
they would extend his contract, now says he would use his rights to
block any deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's agents, Tom Reich and Adam Katz, met Sunday morning in
Chicago with Cubs president Andy MacPhail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told him don't even explore a trade. If you do try to trade
him, he will not approve it,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is signed through next season as part of a $42.5 million
four-year contract. He then is eligible to become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs and New York Yankees spent much of last month
discussing a possible deal, but Chicago demanded more prospects
than New York was willing to give up. Talks ended June 29 when the
Yankees acquired outfielder David Justice from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   MacPhail said the Cubs would cease all trade talk involving
their top star.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were happy to hear that,'' MacPhail said. ''We're happy
that Sammy wants to stay in Chicago through 2001. I didn't really
have any interest in trading the guy who drove in 300 runs the last
two years for prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   By saying he would veto any deals, Sosa puts the Cubs in
position of potentially losing him while getting nothing in return
if he decides to leave Chicago as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Many teams who fall out of contention trade their top players
who are eligible for free agency in the months before their
contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who followed up his 66-homer effort in 1998 with 63 more
last year, is batting .305 with 23 homers and 74 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who took two of three games from the crosstown-rival
White Sox this weekend, trail NL Central-leading St. Louis by 15&AMP;frac12;
games at the All-Star break.

<HEADLINE> Mayor's detail involved in accident on Grand Central Parkway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's motorcade was involved
in an accident on the Grand Central Parkway on Sunday, and three
police officers were injured, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very fortunate,'' Giuliani said. ''I was not injured.
I was wearing a seat belt.''
</P>
<P>
   The injured officers - whose names were not immediately released
- were treated at the New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens,
where Giuliani went to visit them. Two were released Sunday night,
and one was being kept overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the accident happened on the parkway right around
Flushing Meadow Park. He said he didn't see it, but was told by his
escorts that a car cut off the van he was riding in.
</P>
<P>
   The van stopped short, and the motorcade vehicle behind the van
crashed into it.
</P>
<P>
   The officers in that second motorcade car and Giuliani's driver
were the ones hurt, but Giuliani said none of the injuries was
serious. One passenger had stomach and knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the car that cut off the van drove away without
stopping to check on the other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why the man ran away,'' Giuliani said, adding
that he hoped the driver would come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had been scheduled to attend a baseball game between
the Mets and Yankees at Shea Stadium in Queens on Sunday. He was
planning to head there in hopes of catching the last few innings.

<HEADLINE> French Clinic Deaths Inquiry Opens  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHE BERNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French prosecutor said Sunday he had ordered an
investigation into a series of suspicious deaths of elderly and
seriously ill patients at a private care center outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The state prosecutor for Evry, Laurent Davenas, told France
Inter radio that medical examinations would determine the exact
cause of death of some patients at La Martiniere clinic near
Saclay, south of the French capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police, who have been put in charge of the inquiry, have
received a number of troubling testimonies, leading me to submit
the case to an investigating judge, who went to the clinic Friday
to recover the medical files of people who have died in recent
months or years,'' Davenas said.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial sources said the investigation, opened July 3, concerns
allegations of ''voluntary homicide, attacks on vulnerable people,
theft and possession of stolen goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect that between 25 and 40 elderly or seriously ill
patients were killed with a powerful cocktail of sedatives,
administered by clinic personnel. Euthanasia is a crime under
French law that is punishable by prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ill treatment of patients, people who were badly cared for,
practices ... which for the moment are qualified as homicide. If
everything that has been said is true, it goes beyond all
understanding,'' the prosecutor told France Inter radio.
</P>
<P>
   He said police were examining staff testimonies.
</P>
<P>
   The daily le Parisien newspaper said Sunday that 15 employees
took the clinic before the labor relations board for ''moral
harassment.'' When interviewed by the board, the employees made
more specific accusations, prompting an investigation, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was available at the clinic Sunday to comment on the
investigation. Le Parisien newspaper quoted a doctor as saying
there would be no comment until the inquiry was completed.

<HEADLINE> Notes from Sunday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressINTERLEAGUE:
White Sox-Cubs:
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO WHITE SOX: When Frank Thomas didn't make the AL All-Star
team, despite a first half of 26 homers, 75 RBIs and a .333
average, he was understandably disappointed. Despite several
players dropping out with injuries, Thomas said he wasn't contacted
to be a replacement. ''I haven't been asked, not that I know of,''
he said following Sunday's 9-6 loss to the Cubs. ''It's too late.
I've made plans for the next three days. I can deal with it.'' ...
Thomas is just two RBIs from passing Luke Appling as the White
Sox's career leader. Appling had 1,116. ... In the final 11 games
before the All-Star break, Thomas was 18-for-43 with eight homers
and 14 RBIs. ... Carlos Lee has 17 homers, one more than last
season as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO CUBS: Eric Young stole his club-high 27th base Sunday.
The Cubs haven't had a player with 30 steals since Brian McRae's 37
in 1996. ... Mark Grace and Sammy Sosa enjoyed beating the White
Sox two of three to tie the season interleague series 3-3. But they
both said after Sunday's game they'd like to see the White Sox make
the World Series. ''If we're not going to do it, we should
definitely support the White Sox,'' said Sosa, who once played on
the South Side. ''They still play in Chicago.'' ... Sosa said he's
not sure what his future will bring, but is relieved that trade
talk has died down a bit. ''I'm human. When you hear so many
things, this and that, it's pretty much like you can talk or you
can do, but you are not going to be 100 percent happy. I produce
when I'm happy. '' ... Grace, who hit the go-ahead sacrifice fly
Sunday, went into the All-Star break with just seven hits in 48
at-bats over 13 games.
Braves-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Greg Maddux was scratched from Sunday's start with a
sore right shoulder. Maddux will also miss Sunday's All-Star game
in Atlanta. He was replaced by Cincinnati closer Danny Graves. ...
The Braves have led at the break every year since 1995. Their
biggest lead was 12&AMP;frac12; games in 1998. ... The Braves are 17-2 when 1B
Andres Galarraga homers. ... CF Andruw Jones is the only major
leaguer to play every inning of every game this season. ... 2B
Quilvio Veras extended his hitting streak to eight games.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox optioned Paxton Crawford to Triple-A
Pawtucket, in anticipation of Pedro Martinez's return following the
All-Star break. The right-hander was 1-1 with a 2.19 ERA in two
starts. ... Starting pitcher Tim Wakefield last started against the
Braves on Aug. 30, 1997, losing 15-0. ... The Red Sox are 25-36 in
interleague play. ... As a protective measure for Braves reliever
John Rocker, Red Sox concessionaires were not allowing Fenway Park
patrons to keep bottle caps.
Blue Jays-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: 3B Tony Batista, added to the AL All-Star team prior to
Sunday's game, went 3-for-5 with three RBIs. ... The Blue Jays are
13-6 overall against Montreal, including 6-2 at Olympic Stadium.
... Raul Mondesi homered for the third straight game as Toronto
ended its longest road trip of the season 6-7. ... The Blue Jays
collected a season-high 18 hits against six Expos pitchers in the
13-3 win. Toronto tied its season-high for runs, also against
Montreal on June 9. ... The Blue Jays sent 33 batters to the plate
from the fourth through seventh innings. ... CF Jose Cruz Jr. left
in the fifth due to a virus.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The loss, Montreal's second straight after winning
four of five, dropped the Expos to .500 (42-42) at the All-Star
break. ... Expos LF Rondell White missed his second straight start
with a strained right hamstring. ... 1B Lee Stevens missed just his
fourth start of the season after he was forced to leave Saturday
night's game when struck on the right hand by David Wells' pitch.
X-rays of Stevens' hand proved negative. ... All-Star RF Vladimir
Guerrero will participate in Monday night's Home Run Derby. ... The
Expos will work out Thursday afternoon at Tropicana Field before
resuming play that night against Tampa Bay.
Devil Rays-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: P Ryan Rupe was recalled from Triple-A Durham
following Saturday's game, his second tour with the team this
season. He was 0-4 in six starts earlier with a 9.68 ERA, and last
pitched May 2 at home against Texas in an 8-1 loss. His last win
was Aug. 31 last season, a 3-0 victory at Baltimore. On Sunday, he
was lifted after 2 2-3 innings and got a no-decision. ... Tampa Bay
optioned RHP Cory Lidle to Durham to make room for Rupe. ... Fred
McGriff's 18th homer of the season in the first inning moved him
past Hall of Famer Duke Snider on the career list to 30th place
with 408. Next on the list is Darrell Evans in 29th place with 414,
and Cal Ripken in 28th with 415.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Preston Wilson's fifth-inning homer, his 19th of the
season, traveled 459 feet, fifth longest hit by a Marlin at Pro
Player Stadium. ... The Marlins experienced only the third rain
delay of the season at Pro Player Stadium Sunday. ... The Marlins
head into the All-Star break with at least a .500 record for only
the second time in the franchise's eight-year history. The Marlins
were 50-36 at the All-Star break in 1997. ... Luis Castillo has a
five-game hitting streak.
Twins-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: SS Cristian Guzman leads the majors with 12 triples,
four behind Rod Carew's 1977 club-record. ... Twins CEO Chris
Clouser attended Sunday's game. ... Brad Radke (5-10) will pitch
Thursday at home against the Cubs, with Eric Milton (8-4) going
Friday. LHP Mark Redman is likely to start Saturday. ... The Twins
are 4-8 in interleague play after going 10-7 last season. ...
Minnesota is 38-52 at the break, compared to 34-52 last season.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates have two players in the All-Star game
(Jason Kendall and Brian Giles) for the first time since 1993, when
Jay Bell and Andy Van Slyke were picked. Giles and Kendall traveled
to Atlanta following Sunday's game. With C Mike Piazza likely to
sit out with a concussion, Kendall might start. Asked about it
following the Pirates' 3-2 loss Sunday, Kendall said, ''Honestly,
that's the last thing on my mind right now.'' ... The Pirates are
38-48 12&AMP;frac12; games back in the NL Central at the break, compared to
43-44 and seven games back a season ago. ... With RHP Francisco
Cordova (elbow) still hurting, the same three pitchers who started
against Minnesota will start in the three-game series beginning
Thursday in Cleveland: Todd Ritchie (5-5), Kris Benson (8-6) and
Jose Silva (5-3). Either LHP Jimmy Anderson or RHP Bronson Arroyo
probably will be recalled from the minors to start next Sunday in
Los Angeles. The two pitch Monday in the minors, Anderson for
Double-A Altoona and Arroyo for Single-A Lynchburg. ... The Pirates
have only five saves, four by Mike Williams and one by Chris
Peters, in nine opportunities in their last 35 games. ... OF Adrian
Brown (hamstring) might go on another rehabilitation assignment
next weekend before rejoining the Pirates. He played in Altoona
last week before returning to Pittsburgh, only to reinjure himself
in his second game back.
Orioles-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: 3B Cal Ripken is not expected to come off the DL when
first eligible July 13. Ripken, elected to his 18th All-Star game,
will not play. He's still bothered by the lower back pain that has
sidelined him since June 28. ... Baltimore's rotation after the
break will be Mike Mussina, Sidney Ponson, Scott Erickson, Pat Rapp
and Jose Mercedes. ... Erickson has started the last game prior to
the break each of the last six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: RHP Robert Person, out since June 19 with a
strained shoulder, threw two innings in a simulated game Sunday,
and reported no discomfort. He begins a rehab assignment at
Single-A Clearwater on Wednesday. ... 1B Rico Brogna, out since May
11 with a fractured bone in his wrist, took batting practice for
the third straight day. He also begins a rehab assignment at
Clearwater on Wednesday. ... Phillies starters have pitched through
the fifth inning in 77 of 86 games. They've pitched through the
sixth 65 times.
Indians-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: 3B Travis Fryman and 2B Roberto Alomar headed for the
All-Star game nursing injuries. Fryman was able to play all nine
innings of the Indians' 5-3 victory Sunday on a tender left ankle.
A day earlier, Fryman was concerned that the ankle could force him
to drop out of the All-Star game. Alomar bruised his right elbow
when hit by Danny Graves' pitch in the ninth inning. ... Omar
Vizquel has five homers against the Reds the last two years. ...
The Indians activated reliever Sean Depaula off the DL and optioned
right-hander Kane Davis to Triple-A Buffalo. ... When closer Steve
Karsay came to bat in the ninth for his first major league plate
appearance, he borrowed Bartolo Colon's bat because he doesn't have
any of his own. He reached on Graves' throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Aaron Boone came in to play third as the Reds
juggled their lineup after Ken Griffey Jr.'s ejection. He twisted
his strained left knee while trying to field a grounder in the
ninth and limped off the field. The injury wasn't considered
serious. ... Scott Williamson, 1999 NL Rookie of the Year, made his
first major league start after 100 relief appearances. He'll stay
in the rotation after giving up only three hits and one walk in 5
2-3 innings, longest outing of his career.
Tigers-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: OF Bobby Higginson and manager Phil Garner were ejected
by home plate umpire Gerry Davis in the seventh inning of Sunday's
10-3 loss following an inning-ending called third strike with two
runners in scoring position. ... Cleanup hitter Dean Palmer was
0-for-7 in Saturday's 4-2 victory in 15 innings. Tony Clark,
batting fifth, was 0-for-6 until grounding a game-winning two-run
single in the 15th. Palmer went 0-for-5 and Clark didn't play
Sunday. ... Winning reliever Nelson Cruz (2-0), the last of eight
pitchers used in Saturday's marathon, struck out seven, including
the first six he faced. ... Closer Todd Jones (24 saves, 2.53 ERA)
warmed up for the All-Star game by retiring all five batters,
striking out the first four, on Saturday. ... After starting the
season 5-17, the Tigers are 33-29 since April 30. ... OF Juan
Gonzalez (tendinitis left ankle) sat out his fifth game in the last
six. He's listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Tyler Houston became the sixth Brewer to hit three
home runs in a game. His three in Sunday's 10-3 victory traveled
410, 425 and 440 feet. The others to hit three in a game: Jose
Valentin, Dale Sveum, Ben Oglivie, Paul Molitor and Cecil Cooper.
... P John Snyder had the first two hits of his career, a double
and single, in Saturday's 4-2 loss in 15 innings. ''I thought I
might go through the whole season without a hit,'' said Snyder, who
allowed only four hits and one run in 7 2-3 innings. ... Closer Bob
Wickman goes to the All-Star game with mixed results the past 10
days. He had three saves and three blown saves in the 10-game
homestand. His ERA jumped to 3.07. ... In setting a dubious
franchise record by striking out 20 times in Saturday's loss,
manager Davey Lopes was concerned that 10 were on called third
strikes. ''That's not good,'' he said, ''not good at all.'' ...
After starter Jason Bere issued three walks in the first inning
Sunday, the Brewers didn't walk another batter until two outs in
the ninth. They lead the majors by issuing 442 walks.
Royals-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Manager Tony Muser is waiting as patiently as
possible for his young pitching staff to mature. ''We don't have
any veteran trick-type pitchers with screwballs,'' Muser said.
''They're all guys with pretty good arms who haven't gotten over
the hump in terms of learning how to pitch. I think there's a
certain amount of bruising when you kind of run from the bat and
try to have better control than you do and walk people. Then you
try to center the ball and guys hit it hard.'' Muser thinks Mac
Suzuki is about to get the hang of it. ''I think maybe Mac is
getting through those two things right now. It's called maturity
and relaxing a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Astros bench coach Matt Galante has been up-and-down
with the Astros for 20 years and knows what to do when things are
not going good. ''There's always a positive,'' he said. ''You have
to build on that. That's the only way we're ever going to get to
the point of being a good team. We're getting a chance for our
younger players to play. That's good because you get a much better
evaluation than just having a guy come up for two weeks. When the
year is over, you can look back and evaluate what you have.''
Diamondbacks-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 3B Matt Williams, on the DL since June 25 with a
strained right quad, began a rehab assignment Saturday night by
going 3-for-4 with a homer for Class-A High Desert of the
California League. ... 1B Erubiel Durazo, on the DL recovering from
right wrist surgery, was 1-for-2 as DH for Triple-A Tucson of the
Pacific Coast League on Saturday to start his rehab stint. ... The
Diamondbacks are 4-5 in interleague play this season, with six
games left. They are 16-21 in three years of interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The A's have made at least one error in eight straight
games. They made two Sunday, both in the fifth inning, and have 15
in eight games. Oakland leads the AL with 80 errors this season.
... The A's are 9-3 in interleague play. ... Frank Menechino made
his first major league start at third base, and also made his first
start overall since May 21. He struck out against Randy Johnson in
all three plate appearances.
Dodgers-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers had only one healthy available player
on the bench, INF Dave Hansen, for Sunday's game. ... Rookie Mike
Metcalfe got his first major league hit in his eighth game. ...
Shawn Green was 0-for-12 with five strikeouts and one walk in the
series. ... Gary Sheffield was 1-for-2 with a walk against
Seattle's Jamie Moyer. For his career, he's 6-for-8 with two home
runs and four walks against the left-hander. ... The Dodgers were
shut out for the sixth time this season. Four of the shutouts are
by AL West teams. ... After Sunday's game, the Dodgers optioned
Metcalfe and RHP Jamie Arnold to Triple-A Albuquerque. Manager
Davey Johnson said he will fill out his roster Wednesday or
Thursday after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: All-Star SS Alex Rodriguez was at Safeco Field before
Sunday's game and had treatment on his right knee that he twisted
Friday night when he attempted to break up a double play. He then
left before the game to fly to Atlanta for Tuesday night's All-Star
game. Rodriguez will have to sit out the game because of a
concussion he got when hit in the head by the knee of Dodgers SS
Alex Cora. ... Rodriguez was surprised to find that former teammate
Ken Griffey Jr. will miss the All-Star game because of a sore right
knee, but will participate in the Home Run Derby, which Griffey won
the past two years. Rodriguez said he thinks home run contests are
harder on players than games. ''To me, it's very difficult because
it affects your ribs, it affects your legs, it affects your lower
back.'' ... The Mariners got their seventh shutout of the season.
Padres-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: C Ben Davis, who entered Saturday night's game as a
defensive replacement after being called up from Triple-A earlier
in the day, was in the lineup Sunday at DH. He was 1-for-16 for the
Padres in his first stint earlier this season. ... Interleague play
has been a disaster for San Diego. After going 11-4 with a 2.78 ERA
last season, the Padres were 1-7 with a 5.27 ERA through Saturday.
They had the second-best record and top ERA last season. ... Shane
Hopper of Class-A Rancho Cucamonga had hits in seven straight
at-bats Friday and Saturday, pushing his hitting streak to 21
games.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: C Ivan Rodriguez, who was off Saturday, will be out of
the lineup more often in the second half. Texas manager Johnny
Oates said that with 77 games in 81 days following the All-Star
break, he's likely to use backup Bill Haselman ''at least a game a
week, each week.'' ... The second-half rotation is set -- for two
days. Oates will use Rick Helling on Thursday and Kenny Rogers on
Friday. After that, he's being flexible to see about future
matchups and the progress of lefty Darren Oliver, who is on the DL.
... The 8-1 victory over San Diego on Saturday was the fourth time
in five games the Rangers scored that many runs.
Rockies-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Kent Bottenfield, Sunday's starter against Colorado,
started the very first home game in Colorado, as a member of the
Expos on April 9, 1993. ...Though they reeled into the All-Star
break, the Rockies have a winning record at the halfway mark for
the first time since 1995. ... Larry Walker was hitless as a DH
until Sunday's first-inning single, his first hit in 13 lifetime
at-bats as a DH.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Including this year's selections, Darin Erstad and Troy
Glaus, 11 of the Angels' last 12 All-Stars have been products of
their farm system. The exception was reliever Lee Smith in 1995.
... Glaus batted cleanup for the first time Sunday; Tim Salmon had
been the Angels' No. 4 hitter in 86 of the first 87 games. ...
Entering Sunday's game, rookie Bengie Molina's last 17 hits
included nine homers.
Yankees-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK YANKEES: Dwight Gooden on Saturday became the 18th
pitcher to appear in a game for the Yankees in 2000, and 10th
starter. ... The only Yankees with more career hits on his 26th
birthday than Derek Jeter were Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle. ...
LF Shane Spencer left in the bottom of the first inning with a
twisted knee. He stumbled fielding a hit by Melvin Mora, who was
credited with a double.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK METS: The Mets are sending three players to the
All-Star game for the first time since 1990. Mike Piazza was the
leading vote-getter for the NL, but his status is doubtful because
he got a concussion Saturday night when beaned by Roger Clemens.
The other two Mets are left-hander Al Leiter and 2B Edgardo
Alfonzo. The 1990 Mets All-Stars were Darryl Strawberry, John
Franco and Frank Viola. ... Piazza's 72 RBIs are the most in Mets
history prior to the All-Star game. ... Mike Hampton pitched 4 1-3
innings without allowing an earned run in three relief appearances
for Seattle against the Yankees in 1993. Sunday's game was his
first start against them.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Giants-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: OF Barry Bonds was voted as an All-Star game
starter, and will make the trip, but won't play. The team is
worried about him aggravating his thumb injury. ''They decided
it,'' Bonds said. ''You know guys, I don't even want to talk about
this.'' ... Livan Hernandez has worked at least six innings in 75
of 98 career starts, including 16 in 18 tries this season. ... Joe
Nathan (5-2) opens the second half on Thursday against Oakland,
followed in the rotation by Russ Ortiz (4-8) and Kirk Rueter (6-4).
... Jeff Kent is no fan of Busch Stadium, especially on 97-degree
days like Sunday. ''I feel for these Cardinals guys having to play
in this heat,'' Kent said. If he played there, ''They'd have to
close the door, shut the roof. I'm not a young buck. I played here
when they had Astroturf.''
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals homered in 11 straight games before
going without a long ball Saturday, then hit three Sunday. They
lead the majors with 149, two short of Seattle's pre-break record
of 151 last year. ... Andy Benes (9-3) will start the second half
Thursday at Chicago against the White Sox, followed by Garrett
Stephenson (9-5) and Darryl Kile (11-5). Manager Tony La Russa said
he was told by Braves manager Bobby Cox that Kile should get some
time in the All-Star game. ... Fernando Tatis, who hit a two-run
homer Sunday, said he's not close to 100 percent yet. He was
activated from the DL June 30 after missing 43 games with a torn
groin. ''I think I need 15, 20 days, or a month,'' he said. ''I
don't feel comfortable yet. I don't feel like the real me.''

<HEADLINE> High School trip ends with fatal van crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) - Two people were killed and two others
hospitalized when a van carrying New York high school students
crashed on the way to the Grand Canyon, according to Department of
Public Safety reports.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 22 people was traveling Saturday as part of the
Mineola, N.Y., Chaminade High School USA trip, a biannual tour for
sophomores and juniors at the all-boys Catholic high school.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, a white 2000 rental van carrying some of the
students and faculty veered off the northbound lane of Arizona
Highway 64. When teacher and driver Lawrence Zarzycki
overcorrected, the van rolled 1&AMP;frac12; times before coming to a rest.
</P>
<P>
   Zarzycki, 38, and 16-year-old Brendan Tracey were killed. James
Iovino and Kevin Pedersen, both 16, were taken to Flagstaff
Hospital for observation. Seven other passengers were treated for
minor injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
   DPS officers said Zarzycki was wearing a seat belt at the time
of the accident. It was unknown whether the passengers were wearing
seat belts. The crash investigation was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Zarzycki was a 1980 graduate of Chaminade who joined the
Marianists, the brotherhood that runs the school, after high
school. He had been teaching math there since 1985, school
president James Williams said in a telephone interview from
Mineola.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of four faculty moderators of the USA trip, which
seeks to combine spiritual growth with historical education as
students visit national landmarks and religious shrines around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is offered to sophomores and juniors every other year,
and each trip varies in length and itinerary. The group had just
finished one week of this year's three-week excursion when the
accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey was about to begin his junior year at Chaminade, Williams
said. He described the teen as very involved in the school, one of
the yearbook editors as well as a participant in Chaminade's
volunteer program.

Barak's Coalition Falls, Jeopardizing Talks

<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With stunning speed, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
painstakingly constructed coalition government collapsed around him Sunday,
threatening his ability both to govern and to make peace on the eve of a
high-stakes summit with the Palestinians. Three right-wing parties, including
Barak's biggest coalition partner, Shas, announced they were leaving the
government, all fearful that Barak would go too far in his concessions to the
Palestinians at the Camp David summit due to begin Tuesday.

alone and then with top aides for almost an hour in a meeting hall at the Bourg
al-Arab airport. They did not speak to reporters afterward. But Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said Egypt is concerned about a series of positions Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has taken on the issues that divide Israel and the

captives in return for destruction of the country's multiracial democracy. The
agreement between the rebels and Fiji's military government calls for the
captives to be freed Thursday, ending this Pacific island nation's long hostage
crisis. But Commodore Frank Bainimarama, the military head of state looked

Gas Prices Drop, First in Months
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices dropped an average of 4.45 cents a
gallon nationwide in the past two weeks, marking the first decline since prices
began skyrocketing two months ago, an analyst said. The weighted average price
of gasoline dipped to $1.6689 Friday, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000
stations. The decline follows a series of price increases that pushed the
average cost of self-serve regular in Chicago to $2.13 -- the first time ever a
city's overall average gas price topped $2 a gallon. Dramatic drops in Midwest
gasoline prices since the last survey June 23 helped bring the national average
down, but prices elsewhere in the country have shown little change or are up
slightly, analyst Trilby Lundberg said today.

of this fiercely Protestant town. Compounding intercommunal tensions, a car bomb
planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents detonated in front of a police

Doug Creek when Wilson doubled in Floyd from second base for a 5-4 lead. Wilson
made it 6-4 when he forced catcher Mike DiFelice to drop the ball for an error

runs scored, hit a 3-run homer off reliever Esteban Yan to extend the lead to
9-5.

<HEADLINE> Big Lineup of All-Star No-Shows  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The best place to find baseball's top All-Stars
this week is the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., Barry Bonds, Cal Ripken, Mike Piazza and Greg
Maddux became the latest casualties Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, Pedro Martinez, Alex Rodriguez and Manny Ramirez
already were scratched from Tuesday night's game at Turner Field
because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, a list of the dropouts seems more imposing than
anything the AL and NL actually will trot out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looking at who we could've had if everybody was
healthy and it looked like it could've been one of the best
All-Star lineups of all-time,'' said Atlanta third baseman Chipper
Jones, a starter. ''It's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for a power-packed NL batting order, now minus starters
McGwire, Bonds and Griffey, the top three home run hitters in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   It was announced Sunday night that Piazza would not travel to
Atlanta. The Mets catcher sustained a concussion Saturday night
when hit in the helmet by Roger Clemens' fastball, and did not play
in the series finale against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little groggy,'' said Piazza, who will stay home and
rest during the break. ''I have a headache, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cleveland second baseman Roberto Alomar also hurting -- he
was hit by a pitch below the right elbow Sunday -- there's an
injured All-Star at every position.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been bugging me for a lineup the last few days,'' said
NL manager Bobby Cox of the Braves, ''but I just don't know who I
can provide right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati pitcher Danny Graves, Arizona outfielder Steve
Finley, Baltimore shortstop Mike Bordick and Toronto third baseman
Tony Batista are among the replacements coming to play.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago White Sox slugger Frank Thomas, still upset that he was
left off the American League roster, is not.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got plans and I'm not changing them for nobody,'' Thomas
said before the White Sox lost 9-6 to the Cubs at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and All-Star games are not strangers. Tony Gwynn and
Jose Canseco missed last year at Fenway Park and, when the game was
previously held in Atlanta in 1972, five players originally picked
were absent: Luis Aparicio, Amos Otis, Freddie Patek, Gary Nolan
and Joe Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey will be absent because of a sore right knee. He homered
twice and drove in a career-high eight runs Saturday for
Cincinnati, and started again Sunday and made a nice running catch
in center field against Cleveland but was ejected in the eighth
inning for arguing a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey will take part in the home run derby Monday in Atlanta,
defending the crown he won last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess they feel I don't need to aggravate it any more,'' he
said. ''I'll do the home run competition and then rest for two
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, Vladimir Guerrero and Jones will join Junior on the
NL side for the derby, taking on Carlos Delgado, Ivan Rodriguez,
Carl Everett and either Edgar Martinez or Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's record streak of 16 straight All-Star starts will come
to an end. The Baltimore third baseman is on the disabled list
because of a back injury, but baseball rules would have allowed him
to take part Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds missed his eighth straight start Sunday with a hairline
fracture on the tip of his right thumb. The San Francisco
outfielder will make the trip to Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to honor the fans because they voted me in,'' Bonds
said. ''After that, I'll wave good-bye. It's better than sitting at
home and doing nothing anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, one of five Braves on the NL roster, was scratched from
his start Sunday at Boston because of a sore right shoulder, having
been hit by a ball during batting practice Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire leads the majors with 30 home runs, but is out of the
St. Louis lineup because of knee tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was knocked out of the game by a concussion. The
Seattle shortstop tried to break up a double play Friday night and
took a knee to the head from Los Angeles shortstop Alex Cora.
</P>
<P>
   The concussion will keep Rodriguez out for a week. He also
twisted his right knee in the collision, and there was a chance he
has torn cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little more bit more swollen today, but it feels a lot
better,'' he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, whose 1.44 ERA is the best in the majors, is out of
the Boston rotation with an injured muscle in his side. He is
expected to be in uniform in Atlanta, however.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, elected to start in the AL outfield, has been on the
disabled list for Cleveland since May 30 with a hamstring injury.

<HEADLINE> Piazza: Clemens Threw At Me  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza angrily accused Roger Clemens on
Sunday of throwing at his head in the second inning of Saturday
night's game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets catcher was hit on the helmet by Clemens'
pitch and had to leave the second game of the day-night
doubleheader against the Yankees with a slight concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was not in the starting lineup for Sunday night's Subway
Series finale at Shea Stadium, and he will not travel to Atlanta
for Tuesday's All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to say he intentionally hit me in the head, but I
think he intentionally threw at my head,'' a groggy Piazza said.
''There's no place for that in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza scoffed at Clemens' claim Saturday night that the ball
just got away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no respect or appreciation for his comments,'' said
Piazza, who will stay home to rest during the All-Star break.
''Roger Clemens is a great pitcher, but I don't have respect for
him now at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could respect the fact of his throwing inside. Getting hit
in the ribs and body are part of the game. But he has very good
control; he only walked one guy (in 7 1-3 innings). If he knew he
had to come up and hit the next inning, I think he would have been
more careful. I think it was very much an intentional pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award winner, was hit hard by
Piazza in interleague games the last two years. Although the
Yankees said Clemens tried to call Piazza after he was helped off
the field, Piazza said Sunday that Clemens ''had no remorse. But
I'm flattered in a way because he feels the only way to get me out
is to hurt me. I didn't accept a call last night, and I wouldn't if
he called me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who was not available for comment Sunday, threw inside
to two Mets batters before hitting Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ''We handed his lunch to him, so he threw at the first guy,
threw at the second guy and hit the third guy,'' an enraged Mets
manager Bobby Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   But Yankees manager Joe Torre reiterated on Sunday that Clemens'
intent was only to throw inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Roger knows what it takes for a pitcher to be successful, and
that's to throw inside,'' Torre said. ''His fastball's not
straight. It's got a lot of movement and a lot of explosion. I
think that had a lot to do with what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer, hit in the head twice during his
playing career in the 1950s and was once in a coma for 13 days
after being beaned, said he got a ''sick feeling'' when Clemens hit
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt he was trying to pitch him tight,'' Zimmer
said. ''There's also no doubt that no one felt worse about it than
Roger Clemens.''

<HEADLINE> Townshend Enjoying Reunion Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pete Townshend, chief songwriter and guitarist
for The Who, describes the rock group's latest reunion tour as a
get-together with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the kind of thing that people do when they're retired,
isn't it -- they go on a cruise with their golf clubs or
something,'' Townshend, 55, said in Sunday's Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   Townshend, who immortalized the words ''Hope I die before I get
old'' in the song ''My Generation'' almost 35 years ago, is in the
midst of a 20-date tour with two other surviving members of The
Who, singer Roger Daltrey and bassist John Entwistle.
</P>
<P>
   Recently separated from his wife of 34 years, Townshend says his
life is at a crossroads. And he is somewhat mournful about where
nearly four decades of rock has taken him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that rock and roll was a different form of show
business. I thought it unlocked something different about the human
spirit and about the artistic process. And of course it didn't.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Commutes 4 Prison Sentences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has commuted the prison
sentences of four women who were convicted of drug crimes but
received much harsher sentences than men involved in the cases, a
White House spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president felt they had served a disproportionate amount
of time,'' said spokesman Jake Siewert. ''They received much more
severe sentences than their husbands and boyfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   The women freed under Friday's order were Louise House, Shawndra
Mills, Amy Pofahl and Serena Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   One man, Alain Orozco, also was ordered freed after serving time
on a drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were joking with me at first,'' Nunn told ABC
News, which first reported on the commutations. ''After I realized
it was actually happening, I began to tremble and one of the staff
members asked me if I wanted to take a seat. Right after that, the
tears just started flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Nunn was convicted after being drawn into a
Minneapolis drug ring by her boyfriend, but received a stiff
14-year sentence after refusing to inform on him. She served 10
years before her release.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge who sentenced her lobbied the White House for
her early release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I frankly have never written a letter to the president before
asking that one of my sentences by commuted,'' U.S. District Judge
David Doty told ABC News. ''Ms. Nunn was obviously guilty of a
crime, but a crime that did not deserve the penalty the court was
required to impose under the sentenciung guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to guidelides imposed by Congress in the 1980s,
requiring mandatory sentences for a number of drug violations. The
guidelines have be criticized by a number of federal judges who
complain they strip them of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Pofahl was convicted along with her husband, a Stanford
University Law School graduate and wealthy Dallas businessman, in
connection with the drug Ecstasy. While he received three years
probation, she was sentenced to 24 years without parole.
</P>
<P>
   My knees buckled,'' Pofahl told ABC News. ''I was overwhelmed. I
just felt incredible that I was free to do things without someone
looking over my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pofahl case was profiled in Glamour magazine last year and
the Star Tribune of Minneapolis wrote about the Nunn case in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the House and Mills cases were not available from the
White House.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Chairman: More Black Vote  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Saying one more conservative vote on the
Supreme Court could bring a setback for civil rights advocacy,
NAACP Chairman Julian Bond implored 2,000 delegates to the group's
convention to use their voting franchise this November.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who leads the 64-member NAACP national board, also said in
a speech Sunday night that the group will continue its boycott
against South Carolina even though the Confederate flag has been
lowered from the statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where else on the face of the earth do the losers get to fly
their flag as if they had won?'' Bond asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's speech served as the official start of the NAACP's 91
annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Under the convention banner ''Race to Vote,'' more than NAACP
10,000 members are expected to attend the weeklong meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics will take center stage at the conference
when Republican Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
speak Monday and Wednesday respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Though the group can not endorse candidates, Bond said the act
of voting is an important responsibility and that not voting could
have dire consequences for civil rights supporters this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bond noted that 5-4 decisions have prevailed in several key high
court rulings and said ''in 65 percent of these cases, the right
wing-position carried the day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Your one vote could translate into two, three or even four
votes on the Supreme Court, determining whether the court will be a
refuge for civil rights or a dumping ground,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond added that the next president's federal appointments will
decide whether the next cabinet ''will look like America or will
look like a hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Health care, education, economic opportunity, gun control,
fairness for Africa, all these matter,'' Bond said. ''All these
will bear the imprint of the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flag issue, Bond said the NAACP will keep in place its
economic boycott in South Carolina even though many lawmakers there
feel the issue is behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no compromise on this issue. The NAACP boycott
will continue until the flag is removed from a place of honor and
put in its rightful place as an artifact of history,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   The national NAACP last year called for nationwide boycott of
tourism, athletic contests, cultural events and film-making in
South Carolina to pressure lawmakers to remove the flag from at the
statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   The flag was removed from the capitol dome July 1 but was
erected on a 30-foot flagpole still on state grounds. The NAACP
said the so-called compromise was inadequate and that the flag must
be housed in a museum-like setting to place the symbol in a
historical context.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon sent a
letter asking NAACP leaders ''to lay aside your concerns'' about
the flag placement and end the economic boycott against the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boycott should not be broadened but broken,'' Condon
wrote. ''We have too much polarization and too much controversy
over this question.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Condon hinted that he might investigate the
legality of the NAACP boycott but gave no further specifics on the
legalities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, about a dozen protesters waved the Confederate
flag outside the NAACP's convention.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, members of three conservative groups, said the
NAACP's 9-year-old campaign to have the banner removed from all
public properties is an attack on Southern heritage and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leave our flag alone,'' said Richard Gebo, a Virginian now
living in Pennsylvania. ''That's all we have left.''

<HEADLINE> Early Pioneer Wins in Gold Cup  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- John and Betty Mabee figured to be in
the winner's circle with General Challenge. Instead, they watched
one of their former horses steal a victory in the $1 million
Hollywood Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Early Pioneer, bred and raised by the Mabees before they lost
him in a claim, beat General Challenge by a length Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden for the first time by Victor Espinoza, whose freshly dyed
hair nearly matched his orange silks, Early Pioneer covered 1&AMP;frac14;
miles in 2:01 2-5. The 5-year-old horse paid $51, $12.20 and $6.60
as the longest shot in the nine-horse field at 24-1 odds. Each
carried 124 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''As they were coming down the lane I knew we were going to
win,'' owner David Wilson said. ''The race developed like it was
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge fell short in his first race in three months
after surgery for a throat ulcer. The loss ended his bid for a
$1.28 million bonus that required victories in the Gold Cup and the
Whitney Handicap at Saratoga on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lacking a recent race, that might have been a factor,''
trainer Bob Baffert said. ''I thought when he turned for home he
looked like a winner, but he got pretty late in the final furlong.
But the horse is back, and that's the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, ridden by Corey Nakatani, returned $3.40 and
$3, while pacesetter David, under Aaron Gryder, was another 1&AMP;frac12;
lengths back in third and paid $8.20.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian-bred Out of Mind was fourth, followed by Cat Thief,
Irish-bred Blueprint, Chester House, Chilean-bred Big Ten and
Pleasant Breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Vladimir Cerin claimed Early Pioneer from the Mabees for
$62,500 in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Gold Cup victory for Wilson and his wife,
Holly, Cerin and Espinoza, who leads the Hollywood Park jockey
standings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't realize this was his first Grade I race,'' David
Wilson joked. ''I might have hired a more experienced trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who owns car dealerships in nearby Orange County,
doesn't come to the track often. Saying he operates on a limited
budget, Wilson chooses which horses he'd like to claim by studying
the Daily Racing Form at home. Then Cerin looks Wilson's picks over
at the track and makes the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cerin had his doubts about Early Pioneer the first time he
removed bandages from the horse's legs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I called him (Wilson) and asked if he had claiming
insurance,'' Cerin said. ''He (Early Pioneer) has unusual looking
ankles. They've never given him any trouble, but when you first
look at him, you think it's the end of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson recalled Cerin's panicked call.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I don't know if this horse is going to survive this
race,''' Wilson said. ''Vladimir has done a great job with the
horse with big ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Pioneer, running on the outside, overtook General
Challenge, who was between horses, in mid-stretch. General
Challenge stayed close to the pace early and briefly put his head
in front in the upper stretch, while Espinoza and Early Pioneer sat
back and waited.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we'd have had a race under our belt, I think we would have
won it easy,'' Nakatani said. ''He came out and positioned himself
perfectly, but being off for three months and being an athlete,
you've got to think he lost some kind of fitness.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Day, in from Churchill Downs to ride for trainer D. Wayne
Lukas, said his options were limited once Cat Thief started
dropping back on the backside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you can force the issue with this horse and have
any finish. So I had to be content with just letting him kick
along,'' Day said. ''It wasn't his usual enthusiastic self.''
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly the case with Espinoza, who got into the spirit
of the race by dyeing his hair gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had such a good feeling that I was going to win,'' he said.
''This was great. I think I'll keep the hair gold until Del Mar (in
August), then I'll wait until next year's Gold Cup to dye it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge again proved undependable. The 4-year-old
horse has been beaten as the odds-on favorite five times in 17
races.
</P>
<P>
   Although he won last year's Santa Anita Derby and Pacific
Classic and this year's Santa Anita Handicap, General Challenge has
had his share of high-profile flops. He was 11th in last year's
Kentucky Derby and 10th in the Breeders' Cup Classic in November.
</P>
<P>
   Early Pioneer and General Challenge could meet again in the
Pacific Classic next month at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Cup is sponsored by Sempra Energy.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak's painstakingly constructed
coalition government collapsed around him rapidly Sunday, threatening his
ability both to govern and to make peace on the eve of a high-stakes summit with

Gas Prices Drop, First in Months
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices dropped an average of 4.45 cents a
gallon nationwide in the past two weeks, marking the first decline since prices
began skyrocketing two months ago, an analyst said. The weighted average price
of gasoline dipped to $1.6689 Friday, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000
stations. The decline follows a series of price increases that pushed the
average cost of self-serve regular in Chicago to $2.13 -- the first time ever a
city's overall average gas price topped $2 a gallon. Dramatic drops in Midwest
gasoline prices since the last survey June 23 helped bring the national average
down, but prices elsewhere in the country have shown little change or are up
slightly, analyst Trilby Lundberg said today.

barricade that prevented them from parading through the main Catholic district
of this fiercely Protestant town. Compounding intercommunal tensions, a car bomb
planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents detonated in front of a police
station in Stewartstown, 10 miles north of Portadown. The blast wounded a

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Darin Erstad went 4-for-5, scored three
runs and had two RBIs Sunday as the Anaheim Angels downed Colorado
10-4 to win their fourth straight and hand the Rockies their
seventh consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad capped a remarkable first half of the season with his
47th multihit game. His major league leading 144 hits are the most
at the All-Star break since Atlanta's Ralph Garr had 149 in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield (5-7) pitched 7 1-3 steady innings for his
first victory since June 2. He allowed 10 hits and four runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels snapped a 4-4 tie with a three-run rally in the
fourth, with Erstad's single off Masato Yoshii (4-9) driving in the
tiebreaking run. Gabe White allowed Mo Vaughn's RBI single and Troy
Glaus' sacrifice fly as the Angels broke the game open.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson gave the Angels a 4-3 lead with a solo homer in
the third. Anderson set the club record for most homers prior to
the break. His 26th broke Leon Wagner's 1962 mark which was also
matched this season by Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin's sacrifice fly scored Brent Mayne in the fourth to
tie it at 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies wiped out Anaheim's early 3-0 lead with three runs
in the second, on Jeffrey Hammonds' RBI double, a run-scoring
single by Mayne and Goodwin's RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   As they had in the first two games of the series, the Angels
took a first-inning lead as Kevin Stocker and Vaughn delivered
consecutive RBI doubles before Glaus' run-scoring single made it
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii was battered for eight hits and seven runs in 3 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Stocker's run-scoring double in the sixth made it 8-4, and the
Angels tacked on two runs in the seventh, when Mike DeJean's wild
pitch scored Scott Spiezio and another run scored on Erstad's
infield grounder.
</P>
<P>
   As Erstad ran off the field after making his only out of the
game, the Edison Field crowd of 23,820 gave him a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Left-hander Gabe White allowed his first run since May 6 on
Stocker's sixth-inning double, snapping a franchise record
scoreless streak at 29 1-3 innings. ... The Angels are 8-4 in
interleague play, after entering this season with a 20-30 record
against the NL. ... The Rockies have lost six consecutive games at
Edison Field. ... Larry Walker's first-inning single was his first
hit in 13 career at-bats as a DH, but he went 1-for-3 to finish the
first half in a 2-for-22 slump. ... Erstad is hitting .552
(16-for-29) during an eight-game hitting streak. ... Vaughn has hit
in 10 straight (16-for-42). ... Erstad had two fewer weeks to get
his hits than Garr.

<HEADLINE> Woman struck with cement chunk in rob try  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A woman walking on a Manhattan street Sunday was
attacked by a would-be robber who struck her on the head with a
chunk of concrete, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Goldberg, 25, was walking in front of 105 E. 29th St.
just after noon when the man approached, tried unsuccessfully to
snatch her purse, hit her with the concrete and fled.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg was in critical but stable condition at Bellevue
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   It was at least the third such attack in New York during the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a woman in Queens was hit by a brick and robbed.
</P>
<P>
   And last November, Nicole Barrett was hit on the head with a
paving brick in midtown Manhattan while walking to work. She
underwent two brain operations and has returned to her home in
Texas for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Drake, an ex-convict and drug abuser, was arrested in
connection with Barrett's attack and was charged with second-degree
attempted murder, first-degree assault and criminal possession of a
weapon. Drake has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

<HEADLINE> Mets 2, Yankees 0  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - There was no sweep and no more controversy in
the Subway Series.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton pitched seven shutout innings before leaving with a
muscle cramp Sunday night as the New York Mets beat the crosstown
Yankees 2-0 to avoid a four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won the first three games of the series 2-1, 4-2 and
4-2, and the finale was the best pitchers' duel of all.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (9-5), 7-1 in his last 12 starts, and Andy Pettitte
(9-5) kept the game close, and even Todd Zeile's 14th homer, to the
opposite field in the fourth inning, barely cleared the fence over
Paul O'Neill's glove. The ball was in nearly the same spot where
O'Neill robbed Derek Bell of a two-run homer on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game was controversy-free after a day of turmoil in
Saturday's two-stadium doubleheader sweep by the Yankees. A
disputed interference call on Zeile helped them win the opener,
which the Mets protested.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, All-Star catcher Mike Piazza sustained a
concussion when he was hit in the head by Roger Clemens. On Sunday,
Piazza accused Clemens of intentionally throwing at the catcher's
head, but there were no brushbacks in retaliation for the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who has not allowed an earned run in 11 1-3 career
innings against the Yankees, gave up six hits and two walks. He
struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton started warming up for the eighth, but he was replaced
by Armando Benitez, who finished for his 19th save, retiring Felix
Jose on a grounder with two on and two out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   After walking Jose Vizcaino in the eighth, Benitez struck out
Chuck Knoblauch, and catcher Todd Pratt nailed Vizcaino at second,
the Mets' second strikeout-caught stealing of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed five hits and four walks, while striking out
four, in 6 1-3 innings. He was replaced in the seventh by Jeff
Nelson after a walk and a sacrifice, and the Mets made it 2-0 on a
wild pitch and Melvin Mora's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees fell into a virtual first-place tie in the American
League East with Toronto, which beat Montreal 13-3. They are
percentage points ahead.

<HEADLINE> Two arrested after family is held hostage in hotel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GLOUCESTER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A Camden man and a 14-year-old
boy broke into a room at the Howard Johnson Express Inn here, raped
a Blackwood woman in front of her two young sons and held the
family hostage, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The family escaped after about 30 minutes, but the
hostage-takers barricaded themselves in the room for three hours
before surrendering about 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the suspects bound the woman and sexually assaulted
her while her sons, ages 2 and 6, watched. When the father returned
to the room, he also was bound.
</P>
<P>
   The family escaped when the suspects left the room briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested were Ernest Buffaloe, 23, and a 14-year-old Gloucester
Township boy, whose name was not released. They face several
charges, including robbery, aggravated assault, sexual assault,
kidnapping, and cruelty to a child.
</P>
<P>
   Buffaloe is being held at the Camden County Jail. The
14-year-old boy was taken to a juvenile facility in Lakeland.

<HEADLINE> Padres 4, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Trevor Hoffman earned his 250th career
save as the San Diego Padres beat Texas 4-3 Sunday night, snapping
the Rangers' five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman entered with runners on first and second and two out in
the eighth inning and got out of it by getting Luis Alicea to fly
out to right field on the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed Ivan Rodriguez's sacrifice fly that cut it to 4-3 in
the ninth before Hoffman got David Segui to pop out.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman became the 17th pitcher with 250 saves when left fielder
Damian Jackson robbed Chad Curtis of an extra-base hit with a
diving catch.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Clement (9-7) survived 5 2-3 rocky innings to become the
first Padres starter to win three straight games this season.
Clement got out of a bases-loaded, one-out situation in the fourth
inning by striking out consecutive batters. The only two runs he
allowed came earlier in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Clement allowed more walks (six) than hits (five) and threw
three more balls than strikes. The key was that he allowed only
five hits and forced Texas to strand six runners. Two more were
wasted when Kevin Walker replaced Clement and needed only one pitch
to get out of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were more successful taking advantage of Kenny
Rogers, who started on three days rest after throwing 114 pitches
against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (9-6) lasted a season-low 5 2-3 innings and ended a
streak of six straight victories. He allowed four runs on 11 hits,
striking out three and walking none, to lose for the first time
since May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Eight San Diego starters got hits off Rogers, including two each
by Ruben Rivera, Ryan Klesko and Kevin Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, the No. 9 hitter, drove in the first run with a
double in the second inning. Bret Boone and Wiki Gonzalez had
consecutive RBIs with two out in the third and Phil Nevin doubled
in a run in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers fell back under .500 one day after breaking even for
the first time in almost a month. This is the first time Texas has
gone into the All-Star break with a losing record since 1994 and
only the second time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the leading All-Star vote-getter, went 2-for-3 to
extend his hitting streak to a season-high 11 games. The catcher
raised his average to .366, the highest ever for a Rangers player
at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez doubled after Rafael Palmeiro's leadoff walk in the
fourth as part of Texas' near big inning against Clement. Palmeiro
scored on Segui's sacrifice fly and Dave Martinez followed with an
RBI single. Walks to Mike Lamb and Gabe Kapler were followed by
strikeouts by Scott Sheldon and Alicea. Alicea also made the last
out of the sixth against Walker.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego won for just the second time in nine interleague
games. It was the Padres' second victory in eight games career at
The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Padres are 8-6 on Sundays, the only day they have a
winning record. ... This was the 13th straight game Texas had at
least two doubles, extending a team record. ... There were only
30,070 tickets sold, and probably about 25,000 fans in the stadium.
... Texas' Darren Oliver threw four scoreless innings on a rehab
assignment with Triple-A Oklahoma. He allowed two hits, struck out
two and walked two on 61 pitches. ... Had Rodriguez hit for the
cycle, a fan would've won $10 million.

Garfield Heard as his top assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Gar, I think we got everything,'' said Kruger, who left

respected throughout the league, a guy who's worked awfully hard
wherever he's been and he's got that head-coaching experience.''

   Heard was fired by the Wizards in January after only 44 games.
He also served as an interim head coach with Dallas in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Commutes 4 Womens Sentences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has commuted the prison
sentences of four women who were convicted of drug crimes but
received much harsher sentences than men involved in the cases, a
White House spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president felt they had served a disproportionate amount
of time,'' said spokesman Jake Siewert. ''They received much more
severe sentences than their husbands and boyfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   The women freed under Friday's order were Louise House, Shawndra
Mills, Amy Pofahl and Serena Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   One man, Alain Orozco, also was ordered freed after serving time
on a drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were joking with me at first,'' Nunn told ABC
News, which first reported on the commutations. ''After I realized
it was actually happening, I began to tremble and one of the staff
members asked me if I wanted to take a seat. Right after that, the
tears just started flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Nunn was convicted after being drawn into a
Minneapolis drug ring by her boyfriend, but received a stiff
14-year sentence after refusing to inform on him. She served 10
years before her release.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge who sentenced her lobbied the White House for
her early release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I frankly have never written a letter to the president before
asking that one of my sentences by commuted,'' U.S. District Judge
David Doty told ABC News. ''Ms. Nunn was obviously guilty of a
crime, but a crime that did not deserve the penalty the court was
required to impose under the sentenciung guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to guidelides imposed by Congress in the 1980s,
requiring mandatory sentences for a number of drug violations. The
guidelines have be criticized by a number of federal judges who
complain they strip them of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Pofahl was convicted along with her husband, a Stanford
University Law School graduate and wealthy Dallas businessman, in
connection with the drug Ecstasy. While he received three years
probation, she was sentenced to 24 years without parole.
</P>
<P>
   My knees buckled,'' Pofahl told ABC News. ''I was overwhelmed. I
just felt incredible that I was free to do things without someone
looking over my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pofahl case was profiled in Glamour magazine last year and
the Star Tribune of Minneapolis wrote about the Nunn case in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the House and Mills cases were not available from the
White House.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With stunning speed, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
painstakingly constructed coalition government collapsed around him Sunday,
threatening his ability both to govern and to make peace on the eve of a
high-stakes summit with the Palestinians. Three right-wing parties, including
Barak's biggest coalition partner, Shas, announced they were leaving the
government, all fearful that Barak would go too far in his concessions to the
Palestinians at the Camp David summit due to begin Tuesday.

agreement between the rebels and Fiji's military government calls for the
captives to be freed Thursday, ending this Pacific island nation's long hostage

planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents detonated in front of a police
station in Stewartstown, 10 miles north of Portadown. The blast wounded a
policewoman in the leg and demonstrated that extremists on both sides want to
