YALE SCIENTIST KNOWS HIS ATOMS INSIDE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who suspects that it is close to impossible to feel
paternal about atomic particles hasn't done time _ in a college
classroom, a Senate hearing room, a nuclear laboratory _ with the
father of heavy ion science, Dr. D. Allan Bromley, Yale's
avuncular, bow-tied, rarely tongue-tied dean of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he heaped normal fatherly attention on his two children,
but Bromley, a widower and three times a grandfather, can't help
waxing paternal about his enduring relationship with the atom, the
thing he has spent decades smashing, studying, and, much as he did
with his mother's sewing machine when he was a boy, taking apart
just to see what's inside.
</P>
<P>
   And he is so bullish about Yale's need to keep pushing the
envelope on atomic research and engineering that he has spent six
years convincing colleagues and benefactors that a $500 million
expansion of the science and engineering departments, announced
last week, is crucial to the university's ability to recruit and
graduate the leading players of the 21st century. Bromley hopes to
observe the construction from the window of his clubby corner
office.
</P>
<P>
   Next month Bromley, who holds no grudge about the rejection
letter Yale sent him when he applied to graduate school in 1948,
celebrates his 40th anniversary on the faculty, a long leap for a
Canadian boy who got into college on the merits of a
tuition-winning essay called ``The Evils of Alcohol.'' He was so
beholden to the scholarship's sponsor, the Women's Canadian
Temperance Foundation, that he swore off alcohol for his entire
undergraduate career at Queen's University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up for it later,'' Bromley admits. When he wasn't busy
in his atomic bunker at Yale, he says, he was souping up his home
stereo system to two kilowatts. ``It shook the leaves on the trees
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a tinge of the nutty professor lurking
beneath his Savile Row splendor (he owns more than a thousand bow
ties) and Mr. Chips orations. (He cut his lecturing teeth as an
amateur preacher at St. Andrew's Presbyterian in his hometown _
Westmeath, Ontario.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, as a nuclear scientist, you do your research and
calculations with care, but sometimes,'' he confesses, sitting
ramrod straight in an office armchair as he fends off a case of
winter flu with the non-nuclear remedy of hot tea and a carrot
muffin, ``you have to have your adventures.'' Don't tell his life
insurance company, but he has had a few.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 years ago he jumped inside the balky accelerator he had
built at Yale, slammed the door, and had his assistants turn it on
and rev it up ``to two atmospheres'' to see why it wasn't
combusting. ``For all I knew it could have blown a lightning bolt
right through me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, again for a good cause (``I love knowing how things
work!''), he risked vaporization to see a simulated triggering of a
genuine H-bomb in ``the nuclear flats'' north of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ingenious as all hell,'' recounts the scientist, who
claims he ran the risk ``of being shot and buried when they
realized I wasn't an American citizen and wasn't supposed to see
the deepest, darkest secret known to the U.S at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Are there darker secrets now? Bromley, who was quickly sworn in
as a U.S. citizen that day in a roadside ceremony attended by a
judge and some tumbleweeds, isn't disclosing any. The same goes for
his unofficial role advising presidential hopeful George W. Bush on
the science and technology issues best suited to a successful
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now 73 but decidedly nongeriatric even after a series of
open-heart surgeries and, as of last May, a fascinated recipient of
nuclear medicine in the form of a radioactive seed implant for
prostate cancer (``it works, it works!''), the man is a consummate
atom-smasher from back when nuclear physicists were curiosities
rather than cultivators of the future.
</P>
<P>
   A fire-and-brimstone scientist (intonations like his are usually
emitted from pulpits) with a 22-page resume, Bromley has a Rolodex
that hard-wires him to the captains of industrial technology as
well as to the policy-makers of Capitol Hill. He has long believed
that ``engineering is the interface between the new technology
that's pouring out of the research labs and the needs of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Yale forged into this expensive expansion, his reputation
for atomic research and atomic-powered grant-getting figured large
as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   He is, if he does say so himself _ and he likes to _ widely
regarded as the father of modern heavy-ion science. This means he
has spent the last four decades in atomic research, give or take a
few years when he went to the White House as science and technology
adviser to President George Bush (Yale '48), a perk of which was
his heated debate about global warming with Al Gore, then a
senator. (``I would like to think he can't become president.'').
</P>
<P>
   And don't get him going on homeopathic medicine: ``I'm trying to
kill it!''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he has spent life probing atomic nuclei with a series of
precision instruments, the latest a one-of-a-kind, $60 million,
25-million-volt Extended Stretched Trans Uranium accelerator.
Fluoride in toothpaste, titanium nitride in prostheses and the
irradiation of pancreatic cancers are all positive fallout from
that type of research, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He came by his devotion to scientific technology the hard way,
growing up on a hardscrabble cattle farm on the northernmost border
of Ontario, where conveniences like electricity and indoor plumbing
were figments of the future. For him, cold fusion meant
60-degrees-below-zero winters. He attended a one-room school; in
most years he was the only one in the class.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, he still is.

EDITORIAL: A COMBATIVE START IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for complete rewrite w/new hed.)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 25: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The solid Iowa victory of Vice President Al Gore and the shakier
win for Gov. George W. Bush sustain their front-runner status, but
hardly insulate them from New Hampshire's upset-minded voters next
week. Steve Forbes, who poured a fortune into Iowa, and Alan Keyes,
who packed his message with emotional zeal, demonstrated that
conservative Republican voters could be pulled away from Bush.
Their surprisingly strong showing portends a tough fight for Bush
in the New Hampshire primary and an opportunity for Sen. John
McCain to woo GOP moderates while Bush is protecting his right
flank. On the Democratic side, former Sen. Bill Bradley went into a
skid in Iowa but remains a formidable challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent money and energy in Iowa, only to create a
revitalizing chance for Gore. Responding to a Bradley surge in the
polls, Gore re-packaged himself as a fighter able to survive
without the protective cloak of inevitability. He also used his
union and party backing to stretch Bradley's thinner resources. New
Hampshire provides a different test. With the vice president
looking for a knockout, Bradley may find that the price of survival
is to practice a little politics-as-usual and respond in kind to
Gore's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more attack politics on the Republican side, too.
Although McCain's insurgency had flagged recently, the failure of
Bush to do better against Forbes and Keyes could galvanize the
McCain forces in New Hampshire. McCain's decision to step up his
advertising attacks, declaring himself to be the ``only'' candidate
qualified to serve as commander in chief, was a harbinger. Another
factor that will feed the combative mood is the battle across party
lines between Bradley and McCain for the independent voters who
make up 37 percent of the New Hampshire electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The new necessity for Bush to defeat persistent foes on his
right as well as McCain in the center could be costly down the
road. The governor had sought to present himself as a moderate on
social issues, particularly abortion. But in Iowa he began to
suggest that he might indeed require Supreme Court nominees to
share his anti-abortion views. The need to appeal to Christian
evangelicals has also taken its toll on the governor's campaign
style, which has become increasingly querulous. This expedient
hardening of his position on abortion is likely to make it harder
for Bush to achieve his goal of winning over moderates in the
general election, should he be nominated.
</P>
<P>
   So the debates Wednesday night in New Hampshire promise to be
more personal and, on the GOP side, ideological. Bush remains the
front-runner in his race, but for the next seven days he will be
pummeled personally and tested ideologically. Despite the gracious
tone of Bradley's concession speech in Des Moines, competitive
pressures will almost surely throw him and Gore into more heated
confrontations. These things happen when real votes replace polls
and prognostication. Over the next few weeks, delegates will be won
and candidacies will either strengthen or die. And a sequence of
elections that sometimes seems irrational, debilitating and endless
will eventually show its value in seasoning the candidates and
shaping the choice offered to voters in November.

RAMS CELEBRATE SURPRISE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kevin Carter, the NFL sack leader, could point to so
many elements that defined the St. Louis Rams' rise from a ragtag
4-12 team of a year ago to the NFC Championship club that swaggered
into town Monday as a seven-point favorite to beat the Tennessee
Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There was the off-season trade with the Indianapolis Colts for
running back Marshall Faulk, who compiled 2,429 yards rushing and
receiving to break Barry Sanders' NFL single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   There was the made-for-TV-movie emergence of former Arena League
quarterback Kurt Warner, who stepped in after starter Trent Green
was lost for the season to pass for 4,353 yards and 41 touchdowns
in leading the Rams to a 13-3 regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   There was the constantly overshadowed defense, which ranked
first in the league against the rush and sixth overall and also
scored eight touchdowns to help the Rams compile the third-highest
point total in league history.
</P>
<P>
   There was Carter, who had 17 of the Rams' league-high 57 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was venerable coach Dick Vermeil, whose
task-master-to-Teddy-bear transformation showed that even the
oldest dog can dig up a few new tricks.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, when the Super Bowl hype officially kicked off with
an early evening interview session at the Rams' team hotel, Carter
called an audible when asked to select the turning point in his
team's about-face season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' Pro Bowl defensive end picked a game the Rams lost _
their first setback of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It came against the Titans in Nashville on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 6-0, and I think when we actually lost the game in
Tennessee that's when we realized we were a good team,'' Carter
said of the 24-21 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? It wasn't so much that the Rams lost, as how they lost.
They were getting blown out 21-0 after the first quarter but
refused to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing that game and seeing the kind of character we had
coming back,'' Carter said. ``We were all looking at each other
like, we've got a bunch of guys who will fight on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger, the Rams lost the next week to the Lions 31-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``After those two losses, we were like, `Man, we're real close
to being undefeated,''' Carter said. ``This is a good team, and I
think those losses helped us realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans like to say they provided the blueprint for how to
beat the Rams with that three-point win on Halloween. The Tampa Bay
Buccaneers refined that plan Sunday before falling to the Rams 11-6
in the NFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams used their safeties to help stop Faulk and then put
pressure on Warner. Faulk averaged just 2.6 yards against the Bucs,
after gobbling yards at a 5.5 pace during the regular season.
Warner lost two fumbles on sacks against the Titans and threw three
interceptions against the Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   Blueprint or no blueprint, these suddenly blue-blood Rams are
pumped over the thought of having a chance to even the score with
the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to play a team twice,'' Faulk said. ``We lost,
what, three games all season? To get an opportunity to play a team
that gave you one of those defeats is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans did not arrive here until late last night after they
opted to return to Nashville on Sunday following their 33-14
victory over the Jaguars in Jacksonville to share the moment with
their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil left his assistant coaches in St. Louis to formulate the
game plan. With only one week between the conference championship
games and the Super Bowl this year, time is of the essence. Vermeil
wants to make sure every second counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I rather have the extra week? Absolutely no question,''
he said. ``We would definitely like to have had a week's bye. But
this is when show business takes over.''

<P>
   RATCHABURI, Thailand _ Thai security forces stormed a hospital
here early on Tuesday, ending a 22-hour standoff in which a handful
of guerrillas from neighboring Myanmar, whose group is led by
12-year-old twin boys, took about 800 patients and staff members
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   A regional military commander said his men had freed all the
hostages in this border town and killed nine rebels. Two police
officers were wounded. The commander said several other gunmen were
still being pursued. It was not immediately known whether the twins
had been with the hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hostages are safe,'' said the commander, Lt. Gen.
Thaweep Suwannasingha. Earlier, he said about 450 hostages remained
in the hospital after hundreds fled during the night.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the black-masked gunmen, from a splinter
group of ethnic Karen rebels that calls itself God's Army, had
burst into the hospital compound, 75 miles west of Bangkok, riding
a hijacked blue public bus and firing automatic rifles into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The group's chain-smoking twin leaders, Johnny and Luther Htoo,
are fundamentalist Christians who claim to have mystical powers
that make them immune to bullets and land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen said they did not intend to hurt anyone, but the
strangeness of the group and its leaders added an element of
unpredictability to the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kuwat Suntrajarn, an official at the Ministry of Public
Health, said 200 staff members and 600 patients were inside the
750-bed hospital when the siege began at about 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, and the hospital staff was apparently
able to continue treating some patients. But perhaps 40 people were
released during the day _ some on stretchers, one on a
post-operative gurney, one in labor _ suggesting that their care in
the hospital was not adequate.
</P>
<P>
   A number of hostages managed to flee, despite reports that the
rebels had attached a bomb to the main gate and placed mines around
the perimeter. One of the escapees said the hostages were unfed and
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials said the gunmen, wearing military fatigues,
demanded that Thailand stop shelling their hilltop base inside
Myanmar, that it provide medical care to wounded rebels, and that
it give sanctuary to their ``army,'' which has no more than 200
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tense,'' a nurse inside the hospital said, speaking
by mobile telephone to Thai television. ``Most of the attackers are
in general and emergency wards. We have the patients lying down on
the floor so they can't be seen, and we have locked the door. I saw
them walk by. They tried to come in but couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hospital employee, trapped in her car in the compound,
called a television station to say: ``I'm here with my husband. If
we get out of the car, they'll see us. They fired so many shots
before the police got here.''
</P>
<P>
   God's Army is one of dozens of ethnic insurgent bands that have
been fighting the central government in Myanmar, the former Burma,
for half a century. In recent years most of the main fighting
groups have reached cease-fire or peace agreements with the
Myanmar's military government, but the Karen have continued to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, the Htoo twins rallied their village in
1997 to avenge a government offensive in which _ as in many similar
reported incidents _ the soldiers raped women, killed men in front
of their families and set fire to thatched homes.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that time that God's Army was formed, breaking off
from the main Karen guerrilla force, the Karen National Union.
Burmese military attacks on that group have driven tens of
thousands of civilians into border encampments just inside
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The boys appear to have instilled a special fanaticism among
their followers, setting a severe regimen in which liquor, drugs,
fighting and swearing are banned. ``I have never cried,'' Luther
Htoo told the Associated Press in an interview last month. ``Why
would a man cry?'' The twins chain-smoked throughout the interview.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Htoo brothers command guerrillas who are
older than they are. But it remained unclear how the boys exercised
their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, the God's Army fighters have come under
intense attack from the army of Myanmar, and Thai troops have
shelled them from across the border to prevent them from fleeing
into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Shown on local television before the storming of the hospital,
one masked gunman who called himself Nui said: ``Do not be worried.
We will not hurt any hostages. We want to tell the world how Karen
and Burmese refugees live during the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We will go back when our demands are met, when we
reach an agreement. We still don't have any definite plan on how to
return.'' He added: ``We didn't harm anyone. We have released many
hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was an embarrassment for Thailand, which took a soft
approach to previous Karen hostage-takers who occupied the Myanmar
Embassy in Bangkok for 25 hours in October and then were given safe
passage by helicopter back to the border.
</P>
<P>
   The five embassy hostage-takers, calling themselves the Vigorous
Burmese Student Warriors, then took refuge with the God's Army
fighters. One news report said some of them took part in the
hospital takeover on Tuesday, but that could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two countries rose after the embassy siege,
as the authorities in Myanmar closed the border for two months and
strengthened their military presence on the border.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman in Myanmar issued a statement on Monday
saying: ``It is about time these armed men are treated as
terrorists by the international community. Myanmar is committed to
the elimination of armed terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials vowed to be tougher this time, calling the
takeover of a hospital ``international terrorism.''

GORE, IN CELEBRATION, LOOKS AHEAD TO NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Four months after he acknowledged that his
campaign was in serious trouble, Vice President Al Gore stood on a
stage here and, with confetti plastered to the side of his face,
claimed his first success of the 2000 presidential campaign, a
resounding 2-1 victory over Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just begun to fight,'' Gore yelled to a crowd of more
than 600 people at the Iowa State Fairgrounds as his wife, Tipper,
pranced at his side.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, he quickly turned his attention to the
race ahead in New Hampshire and signaled a ``new phase'' in his
campaign strategy. He said he would be campaigning not only on the
current economic prosperity but on the idea that the country can do
even better than its current record-breaking economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   After months of often harsh attacks against Bradley, Gore
referred to him only glancingly Monday night and seemed more
interested in talking about the Republicans. He said Bradley had
asked Iowa audiences if they were better off today than they were
seven years ago; then Gore told the crowd here that clearly they
were, but that that was not the right question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, can we do even better?'' Gore asked. ``I
believe the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Republicans _ specifically Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and Steve Forbes, the publisher _ would ruin the country with
irresponsible tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the race shifts to New Hampshire, Gore's aides said his
message would shift from the heavy focus here on agriculture to the
booming New England economy. Gore plans to tell New Hampshire
voters that while the Clinton-Gore administration has done wonders
for the economy, there is more to do.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire should be especially receptive to this message
since it was losing 10,000 jobs a year in 1992 when Clinton and
Gore first ran, and it is now gaining 16,000 jobs a year, Gore
aides said. Moreover, they said, focusing on the economy will help
Gore deliver a ``positive'' message.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shrum, a top Gore adviser, said: ``What the Clinton-Gore
administration has done over the last seven years economically
helps Al Gore a lot, and I think President Clinton will be a very
valuable asset during the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, campaign aides said it was Gore's support for farmers and
his knowledge of agricultural issues that he leveraged into his
lead here over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Jan. 8 debate in which Gore said that Bradley
did not support various issues important to Iowa and farmers, his
spokesman, Chris Lehane, said: ``That was a crystallizing moment.
Al Gore showed that he was fighting for Iowa and Bill Bradley
showed he wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that the town meetings in Iowa and New Hampshire
helped him sharpen his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total immersion in this process has been something that I
think has been very good for me,'' Gore said Monday night. ``I have
been able to communicate more effectively because of what I've
learned from the people of Iowa and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore thanked several politicians in the audience for helping
him. They included Rep. Richard Gephardt, the minority leader from
Missouri, and Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. He also thanked his top
campaign advisers by name and met with them in a cluster after his
speech. ``Great staff work,'' he told them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Des Moines, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore got a kiss and hug
from his wife, Tipper, as he arrived Monday at his Iowa campaign
headquarters hours before the state's Democratic presidential
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gores did not let the embrace linger. They immediately
entered the downtown offices and joined volunteers phoning
supporters to urge them to turn out for the precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores continued the calls up to the last minute before the
caucuses began across the state. The vice president took time out
from the calls for live local television interviews in which he
also urged Iowans to go to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews, Tipper Gore, an accomplished
photographer, snapped photos of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Gore sought to avoid raising expectations of
a huge victory over rival Bill Bradley in the first voting in the
contest for the Democratic Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win is a win,'' Gore told reporters at the headquarters.
``I'll be happy with a one-vote win over the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the Iowa campaign, polls have shown Gore
with a lead of about 20 points over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Gore campaigned in Cedar Rapids and
Davenport. At each stop, he described himself as ``a fighter,'' his
rally cry ever since last fall when Bradley caught him in some
polls and equalled him in fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   At the legendary Iowa State Fairgrounds, where Gore planned a
victory celebration with supporters, the stage of the tin-roofed
Tourism Building was decorated with a blue and white sign: ``Al
Gore Fighting For Us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore planned to shift his attention to New Hampshire's primary
as soon as the pattern of the caucus voting became apparent. Air
Force Two was gassed up and ready for a midnight flight to the
Granite State, which holds its primary in one week.

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice
President Al Gore captured clear victories in the Iowa presidential
caucuses on Monday night, affirming their positions as
front-runners for their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican race, Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher who
had pumped millions into the race, finished second, roughly
tripling the 10 percent he drew here four year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, a former State Department official who like Forbes
courted the religious right, ranked third, outpacing another
religious conservative, Gary Bauer, as well as Sen. Orrin Hatch of
Utah. Sen. John McCain of Arizona did not campaign here, preferring
to concentrate on New Hampshire, and won only a handful of votes.
</P>
<P>
   With 41 percent of the vote, Bush, a two-term governor in his
first try for national office, surpassed the 37 percent that Bob
Dole drew in a six-candidate field in 1988. Bush had set that
figure as his goal. Yet in a sign of the potency that the abortion
issue holds here, his results did not match the combined votes of
Forbes, Keyes and Bauer, all of whom harshly criticized Bush as
being soft on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic outcome was a setback for the insurgent campaign
of former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who had campaigned here
aggressively and pumped more than $2 million into the state, but
still lost to Gore by a nearly 2-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The victors hope their triumphs will embolden their campaigns in
the nation's first primary in New Hampshire in only eight days. But
both Bush and Gore face entirely different political landscapes
there _ as well as polls showing they are neck and neck with McCain
and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Some New Hampshire voters pride themselves on not following the
lead of Iowa, and Bush and Gore are no doubt mindful that the
results of the Iowa caucuses have been far from a reliable
indicator of who will end up at the White House, or even win their
parties' nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This state is hardly representative of the nation _ it is
overwhelmingly white _ and those who participated Monday night
tended to be those who are at the more conservative or liberal
wings of their parties. There are 1.8 million registered voters in
Iowa, but officials Monday night estimated that roughly 166,000
actually went to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the showings of Forbes, who drew 30 percent, and Keyes,
who captured 14 percent, underscored the potency of religious
conservative voters in these caucuses, Bush drew a substantial
proportion of their support as well, according to surveys of voters
entering the caucuses. Bauer tallied 9 percent; McCain, 5 percent;
and Hatch, 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, for more than a year, Bush has towered over the
Republican field because of his record-breaking fund-raising,
impressive poll numbers and vast endorsements. Now, the first
voters declared him the leader as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, smiling as he watched the coverage in his hotel suite
here, declared a triumph barely 45 minutes after the caucuses
opened. ``We've had a record-shattering victory,'' he said, ``and I
never dreamt I'd be able to get such a high vote total.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a rally in Des Moines, he said to cheers, ``Tonight
also marks the beginning of the end of the Clinton era.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic competition, Gore's victory marked a comeback
of sorts because for months he and his campaign had been worried
about Bradley's insurgency. But Gore benefited from the vigorous
backing of labor and much of the state's Democratic establishment.
</P>
<P>
   An ebullient Gore, at a rally late Monday night, declared,
``Thank you for the biggest victory of the contested caucuses here
in Iowa. Wow! Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from when Gore ran for president in 1988. In
that race, Gore skipped campaigning in Iowa, deriding the caucus
system as ``madness'' and calling it ``the small state of Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, Gore conceded that he faced a far different
competition in New Hampshire. ``I don't think there's any such
thing as the so-called `bounce,''' he said of the prospect that his
victory here would boost him significantly in New Hampshire. ``That
race must be won on his own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   In conceding moments before, Bradley also said he was gearing
for a hard-fought contest. ``Let me congratulate the vice president
on his strong showing tonight,'' he said. ``He's an opponent who is
tough and I know I'll be seeing a lot of him in the coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Tonight, I have a little bit more humility, but no
less confidence that I can do that job.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-place finisher on the Republican side, Forbes, also
warned that the fight had only begun. He asserted his second-place
finish ``demonstrates that ideas matter, principles matter _ and if
you have a strong conservative message, you can get broad-based
support within the conservative party.''
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes had long been viewed as Bush's toughest competitor
here, Keyes' showing was particularly striking because he has run a
low-budget campaign and many Republican had dismissed him as more a
protest candidate than a serious vote-getter. But he drew
particular attention for his stand-out role in many of the
Republican debates.
</P>
<P>
   Though Iowa has been at the epicenter of American politics, the
results are far from a reliable indicator of who will end up at the
White House _ or even win the first primary in New Hampshire next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The last candidate to win a contested caucus and be elected
president was Jimmy Carter in 1976. In 1988, the eventual nominees,
Michael S. Dukakis and George Bush, placed third in the caucuses.
The two victors, Dick Gephardt and Bob Dole, had quit the race by
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, there was no contested Democratic race. Dole won
the Republican caucuses, but he was followed closely by Pat
Buchanan, who then triumphed in New Hampshire but lost the
nomination to Dole. In recent years, the voting here has been more
important for narrowing the field.
</P>
<P>
   Early entrance polls Monday night suggested that many Republican
voters cared more about a candidate's moral values than his stance
on taxes, Social Security, abortion or education.
</P>
<P>
   Those voters heavily backed Bush followed by Keyes and Forbes.
About a third of the Republican voters said they had never attended
a caucus before.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the character issue in this campaign and
voters said they were looking for a candidate who stood up for what
he believed in rather than one who understood complex issues or
cared about the average American. Nearly 25 percent of caucus
participants said they were members of the religious right, and 75
percent described themselves as politically conservative. Sixty
percent said someone who lived in their household had served in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many other states have derided Iowa for all the attention that
it draws from the contenders and from the press. To a large
measure, the outcome reflects the organizational prowess of
candidates and interest groups in prodding people to give up a
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the caucuses have become high profile events because the
national press covers them heavily, which in turn prompts the
candidates to spend more time here.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses started at 7 p.m., when residents went to schools,
church basements, meeting halls and private homes across the state.
The voting marked only the beginning of a months-long process of
selecting delegates to the Republican and Democratic conventions,
where the nominees would actually be chosen. The Republican vote
was merely a straw poll and would have little impact on the
selection of actual delegates to the convention, who will be chosen
at county conventions, congressional district conventions and state
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, the voting Monday night will have more
influence on the selection of actual delegates. Iowa would
eventually account for 56 of the party's 4,337 convention
delegates. The state will send 25 of the 2,169 delegates to the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   For months _ years in some cases _ Iowa has served as a second
home for many candidates. They poured millions of dollars into
television commercials, and they campaigned from hog farms to high
schools, making their pitches to a relatively tiny number of
voters. Even before the intense campaigning of the past month,
Forbes had ben here 69 days; Bradley, 62 days; Bauer, 54 days;
Keyes, 51 days; Gore, 35 days; and Bush, 19 days. This was the
first time since 1988 that both parties had competitive contests.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before Iowans voted, the contenders devoted one last day to
trying to persuade and cajole the undecided and the uncommitted.
Bush got an early start, striding into a restaurant here at 7:45
Monday morning and competing with eggs and pastries for the
attention of the scattered diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rest for a while,'' he told a diner. ``It's like running a
marathon. I ran a marathon in 1993, and it just requires patience
and discipline and focus, and this is mile six.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent stop in Ames, where he delivered a speech at
Iowa State University, Bush was upbeat and folksy, offering a
homespun riff on how hard it has been to spend so many days on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the cats,'' he said. ``They don't miss me. I miss the
dog. She does miss me.'' But his playfulness had its limits. When
the documentary filmmaker, Michael Moore _ who has been traveling
through Iowa with a ``mosh pit'' in which people roll around _
asked Bush to participate, the governor said, ``Behave yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent his last day pretty much as always _ with a heavy
dose of radio interviews on conservative programs. By 3 p.m., he
had appeared on 20 radio programs and 14 television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters as he campaigned with two of his five
daughters, Forbes asserted that he was the leading conservative in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Monday played down reports that he used marijuana more
extensively in his mid-20s than he has admitted. Asked whether he
had smoked marijuana almost daily in the early 1970s, Gore told the
NBC affiliate here, KWQC, ``No, when I came back from Vietnam, yes,
but not to that extent. This is something I dealt with a longtime
ago _ it's old news.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who is 51, added: ``When I was young, I did
things young people do. When I grew up, I put away childish
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley held his only public event at Iowa State University,
where he told several hundred students and faculty members that
politics in America had lost touch with the needs of ``real''
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics to too many young people, to too many Americans, has
become nothing other than tactics,'' Bradley said. ``It's become
tactics and not belief. It's become spin and not truth. It's become
fund-raising and not reaching out to people where they live their
lives. It has become all of the things that are artificial in our
country.''

 &HT;    Gore rallies supporters down to wire

<TEXT>
<P>
   Des Moines, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore got a kiss and hug
from his wife, Tipper, as he arrived Monday at his Iowa campaign
headquarters hours before the state's Democratic presidential
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gores did not let the embrace linger. They immediately
entered the downtown offices and joined volunteers phoning
supporters to urge them to turn out for the precinct caucuses.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ When the Tennessee Titans arrived in Atlanta on Monday
for Super Bowl XXXIV, coach Jeff Fisher made it clear they had put
their 33-14 AFC Championship Game victory over Jacksonville behind
them to concentrate on the St. Louis Rams.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We celebrated the win over Jacksonville, but we went to work
this morning and followed our regular Monday routine,'' Fisher
said. ``We're still not finished. Our goal is to win the
championship. This is an awfully short week, and we've got to get
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who has one more year left on his contract, is the first
coach to win his first three playoff games since San Francisco's
George Seifert in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds have been against us every week, but we kept finding
ways to win,'' Fisher said. ``I told the players and the coaching
staff how proud I am of their sheer will to win, their high
expectation level and their capacity to fight through any
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are playing a familiar role in their first Super
Bowl: They are the underdogs for the third consecutive playoff
game. St. Louis is favored by seven, even though the Rams lost to
Tennessee 24-21 in the regular season and struggled to defeat Tampa
Bay 11-6 in the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, who went 3-0 against the Jaguars this season and
improved their record to 5-0 in games against teams with at least
13 wins, want everyone to know they're not just glad to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the only thing better than reaching the Super Bowl is
to win it,'' Titans outside linebacker Eddie Robinson said. ``Your
whole mindset has got to be winning. This is the game where you
don't even want to consider losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in a Super Bowl is every kid's dream. We're so
fortunate to be here. It's too bad that so many guys have NFL
careers and never get a chance to play in this game. I just thank
God every day that I've gotten this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   First-time Super Bowl teams have a 6-15 record in the title
game. The last first-time winner was the 1986 New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing for us to be here, but we earned the right,''
said receiver Derrick Mason, who returned a free kick 80 yards for
a touchdown against the Jaguars on Sunday. ``After (just) my third
year, I never thought I'd have a chance to play in the Super Bowl,
but here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   After a courageous AFC Championship Game performance in which he
ran for two touchdowns and threw for another despite a severe case
of turf toe, quarterback Steve McNair is getting most of the
attention as the Titans prepare for today's Media Day at the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to surround the quarterback with good people,''
Fisher said. ``There's not a quarterback in this league who can win
by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started up front with our offensive line, moved to the
tight ends, wide receivers and running backs. We've surrounded
Steve with good players, and we try to take maximum advantage of
his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't realize this is just Steve's third year
as the starter. For him to reach the Super Bowl in his third season
should make people give him a little more respect.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conservative style of Fisher and offensive coordinator
Les Steckel, McNair hasn't thrown for more than 112 yards in any of
the Titans' playoff victories, which came over Buffalo,
Indianapolis and Jacksonville, who brought a combined record of
38-10 into the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   McNair combines with Eddie George to give the Titans two
outstanding runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play smash-mouth football,'' Titans tight end Frank Wycheck
said. ``That style of play is our bread and butter. We set our
minds to it, and that's just what we do. A lot of people didn't
think we could use that style and make the Super Bowl, but we stuck
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their 22-16 first-round victory over Buffalo, many of the
Titans have been saying they are a team of destiny. It was the
Music City Miracle that produced the incredible come-from-behind
win over the Bills, but Tennessee seems to benefit from a big call
or an unusual blown play by an opponent in every game.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans hope Lady Luck doesn't abandon them before they play
the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been going our way, but I can't say enough
about how hard we've worked for things to go our way,'' defensive
end Kenny Holmes said. ``We create luck. It isn't just something
that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But something special is happening to a team that is becoming a
sentimental favorite around the country because of the hardships it
suffered in Houston and the adversity it overcame after moving to
Tennessee in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised at all that we beat Jacksonville a third
time,'' Titans middle linebacker Barron Wortham said. ``There's not
that many people around the country that really seem to believe in
us, and I don't know what else we have to do to show people that
we're a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wortham then hesitated, smiled and said, ``Well, I do know what
we have to do. Now we just have to make sure we stay focused and go
on out and do it.''

From Jeppesen Stadium to Rice Stadium to the Astrodome.

<P>
   From George Blanda to Dan Pastorini to Warren Moon.
</P>
<P>
   From Billy Cannon to Earl Campbell to Mike Rozier.
</P>
<P>
   From Lou Rymkus to Bum Phillips to Jack Pardee.
</P>
<P>
   From AFL champion to NFL laughingstock to perennial AFC
bridesmaid.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Oilers are no more, having moved to Tennessee at the
start of the 1997 season and changed their nickname to Titans prior
to this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But many associated with the franchise's past have no problem
embracing its present. To them, there is little hesitation in
adding Adelphia Coliseum, Steve McNair, Eddie George and Jeff
Fisher to the franchise's historical time line.
</P>
<P>
   And they are pleased that now, 40 years into its history, you
can finally include Super Bowl participant on the team's resume
after the Tennessee Titans beat Jacksonville 33-14 in Sunday's AFC
Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, I'm glad that at least the Houston team got there,''
former Oilers coach Phillips said. ``They're not in Houston
anymore, but I'm still glad they got there. It's not the same as if
Houston was there, but you're glad that the kids from Houston are
there.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Phillips' squads got Houston closest to a Super Bowl
appearance, coming up short to Pittsburgh in AFC title games in the
1978 and '79 seasons. Phillips did not make good on a promise to
kick in the door to the Super Bowl, but he is happy to see former
Oilers walking through that door this week in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the Titans were there when I was there, of course, but
many of them were there when I did (the Oilers') radio
(broadcasts), and they're good kids,'' Phillips said Monday from
his ranch in Goliad. ``They deserve what they got, and they worked
hard for it. I'm definitely happy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   As is Pastorini, although the former Oilers quarterback said he
feels no connection to the team now that it is no longer in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name just doesn't have any zip to it anymore,'' Pastorini
said. ``It's a new team, a new generation and a new environment.
It's been 30 years since I was a rookie, so my time has come and
gone. Personally, I don't feel any connection to them at all. But
you have to be happy for the few former Oilers left on that team,
especially Bruce Matthews.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Biles, another former Oilers coach who spent 10 years with
the organization, including seven as an assistant, echoed the
sentiment for Matthews, who will play in his first Super Bowl in
his 17th season. Biles was head coach when the Oilers took Matthews
with the ninth pick of the first round in the 1983 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have some strong feelings about the organization,
and I am very pleased with their success,'' Biles said. ``And I'm
especially happy to see Bruce get to play in a Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   What is missing, Biles said, is the joy fans would have felt had
the team reached this level of success while in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is a difference since they are not here, and
you don't have the true excitement,'' he said. ``I can remember the
excitement of the Luv Ya Blue days, when we would all say if we
ever won a Super Bowl here, how wild and crazy the Houston fans
would be. I don't have that feeling, but I still have the fact that
I was with the team for so long and have good feelings about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest aspect of it is the loyal Houston people and loyal
Houston fans deserve to be a part of what's happening to the
organization right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro Football Hall of Famer Kenny Houston, who played for the
Oilers from 1967-72, said that although he played less than half
his career here before being traded, he still considers himself an
Oiler and Oilers fan and that he is therefore a Tennessee Titans
fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participating in professional football is a gift from God and
a once-in-a-lifetime thing and something I have grown to learn to
appreciate. And with that understanding, I'm so happy for 'em I
don't know what to do,'' Houston said. ``I pulled for 'em. When I
left coaching there, I continued to pull for the team, and I feel
pretty close to 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you're an Oilers fan _ and there are a lot of
them _ you would pull just as hard for them now,'' added Houston,
who is a counselor at Terrell Alternative School. ``The stadium
only holds some 60,000 people, so you've always had a lot of fans
that didn't go to the games. A lot of people don't associate
rooting for a team with going to the games, so not having games
here makes it different, but fans remain fans.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SO the Tennessee Titans are Super Bowl bound, and a strange kind of
withdrawal has spread over Houston, as if the whole city had
suddenly given up smoking.
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer a custody case. The only remaining question is
whether we retain any visiting rights to The Artists Formerly Known
as the Oilers, as we love to refer to them. The answer is yes. Just
because they won three playoff games in a row, two against heavily
favored foes, and just walked all over poor Jacksonville, doesn't
mean they can escape the eyes of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   You earned this trip, too, those of you who gave the old Oilers,
and the new Titans, the best years of your lives. And for those who
can't choke down the fact Bud Adams still owns the team, and that
he has out-ownered the opposition 16 times this season, we have
this heartfelt advice: Learn to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one believed the Oilers held the patent on despair and
misery, how can you not admire this born-again team, these Titans,
these spoilers of the form chart, these unsinkable underdogs?
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, we can assure you it was never a goal of the
franchise to torture its fans or test your patience. It just worked
out that way. The Titans are impressive not because they are
capable of winning every game they play, including the next one,
but because they are capable of overcoming their mistakes. As a
bonus, they punish people. We love that in a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to hit them in the face and see how they react,''
said coach Jeff Fisher before the Titans hung a 33-14 haymaker on
the Jaguars, who were unbeaten against the rest of the league. The
Jags reacted by jumping out to leads of 7-0 and 14-7, then
cratering in the second half under Tennessee's relentless pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans have toughness and grit. Yancey Thigpen catches a
touchdown pass and leaves the game with a broken foot. Marcus
Robertson makes a huge interception in the end zone and goes out
with a broken ankle. And the Titans never blinked.
</P>
<P>
   Why should they? Their quarterback missed five games after back
surgery, played through that pain and the exquisite hurt of a turf
toe, and never uttered a word of complaint. Deion Sanders missed
almost half of Dallas' 1998 season with a turf toe, and
quarterbacks don't stand around nearly as much as cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McNair passed for a touchdown and ran for two, and you
won't see a prettier run than his 51-yarder, right up Main Street,
setting up the Titans' last touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But you know a team has qualified as Destiny's Darlings when it
fumbles the ball on the one-yard line and turns the miscue into
nine points. Frank Wycheck's fumble led to a safety and an 80-yard
kick return by Derrick Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, in the Super Bowl's opening line, the Titans were
eight-point underdogs against a Rams team they beat in Nashville on
Halloween. The Rams, rising from the debris of a 4-12 finish a year
ago, are this season's feel-good story. The transplanted _ or
displaced, depending on your bias _ Oilers are the History
Channel's team.
</P>
<P>
   Your old friend Jerry Glanville, of all people, pointed out that
this was Jeff Fisher's fifth full season as the coach and his first
with a winning record. ``And he's still there!'' exulted Glanville,
who is amazing at picking up an obscure point. He was, in fact,
giving Bud Adams credit for having stayed with his coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Adams showed some sensitivity by refusing to blame Fisher for
three 8-8 seasons while the team found itself in no man's land. Not
all coaches or managers are treated with compassion. The Rockets
didn't stick with Del Harris after they tore up the team so they
could clean up in the draft. The Astros didn't stand by Art Howe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owner, coach, general manager, quarterback _ now they have
stability,'' said Sunday's color analyst, Phil Simms, the ex-Giant.
``And finally they got to play in their own stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The other quality that so clearly stamps this squad is the total
confidence and the swagger. The Bum Phillips teams had a good dose
of it in the late 1970s, but those Luv Ya Blue Oilers never felt
invincible. But there is this in common: The Titans, as did the old
Oilers, control the line of scrimmage and run the clock, chewing up
yardage like a threshing machine.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that the Titans have an extra running back in
McNair. He sets an example with his heart and toughness, just as
Dan Pastorini did when he played with broken ribs, wearing the
original flak jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering question for lifelong Houston fans is, simply,
``Why now, God?''
</P>
<P>
   There is no answer, of course. Art Rooney waited 42 years in
Pittsburgh before the Steelers gave him his first championship. The
Steelers became a dynasty, and Rooney, a sweet, sentimental
Irishman, became a saint.
</P>
<P>
   And in Jacksonville on Sunday, the Titans took 40 years of
frustration and ended it in four minutes, scoring 16 points. OK,
maybe not the whole 40 years, but most of the really low spots.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
A little quick math seems in order. If the Rockets can extend their
six-game winning streak to 48, they can match the record of their
first championship season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And who would have thought that was within range two weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not really in range now, either. But a six-game
winning streak seemed almost as unlikely two weeks ago. And as the
Rockets complete the season's first half with tonight's home game
against the Timberwolves, most other possibilities technically
within their reach no longer seem so outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets still might be digging their way out of the wreckage
of the season's first half. But they might have proved they were
right all those times they insisted they were better than their
record.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a long climb to a playoff spot. Minnesota, itself
on a phenomenal roll, is eighth in the Western Conference with a
seven-game lead on the Rockets. But the notion no longer seems as
ludicrous as it might have when first kicked around as a New Year's
resolution or a desperate grab at something to make the rest of the
season worth playing.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this was a team Hakeem Olajuwon had called the most
talented of his Rockets career. That was before an incredible run
of injuries put almost every big man on the injured list at some
point, and Olajuwon could not have been that bad a talent scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the preseason, even before the camp, I was so
excited about our team,'' Olajuwon said. ``The players on this
team, this is what I expected. Even when we were losing, it was a
big blow, but it was unbelievable. It was, `No, this team is too
good to have this record.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was just going to have to take time. I guess that's
what happened. Steve (Francis), for example, is so much more
comfortable now. Shandon (Anderson) feels comfortable. Cuttino
(Mobley) is playing well. Now Kenny Thomas is getting a chance to
play and is making contributions. Everybody is coming together. I
guess you just have to take that time to get to this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the beginning when we were losing, there was
not a team that really beat us. It was decisions, maturity, feeling
comfortable. We were losing on points, not that they were much
better. That was tough for me to believe and accept _ that this was
a losing team.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was. Yes, a squadron of frontcourt players _ Olajuwon,
Charles Barkley, Tony Massenburg, Kelvin Cato and Carlos Rogers _
has spent long stretches on the injured list. But before the
Rockets' big bodies began to fall apart, the team collapsed late in
games.
</P>
<P>
   At 16-24, the Rockets are as close to .500 as they were when
Olajuwon was hurt. An overtime loss in Portland dropped the Rockets
to 3-11 that night. The loss was typical. By the time they fell to
4-12 with a double-overtime defeat in Phoenix, they had lost 10
games they had led in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They could not deny frustration was setting in. But Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich repeated as often as necessary that if they
could play well for three quarters, they could for four, hoping to
make his team keep that faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always a battle,'' he said. ``We do our work, come in
here, and to overcome a disappointing loss, we have our tape work
where we're accenting positive deals and talking about the good
things we're doing while trying to correct the bad things to get
those guys to understand how close we were to getting the wins and
being a good team. But they've got to believe that we could win,
that we could get some wins against the lower teams and believe it
could happen against anybody. Now we've seen that belief come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get up in the fourth quarter without doing something
right. It's not always absolutes. It's not always bad. It's not
always good just because you got a certain result. Even when we
were losing those games, there was a lot that went into losing
those games. We were doing good things. We're just doing it more
now and especially late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets seemed to have taken that step several times before,
however. They won three consecutive games before heading on the
road for a less than daunting three-game trip to Philadelphia,
Boston and New Jersey. But with the echoes of a pre-game tribute to
him still ringing, Barkley went down. The team immediately knew the
injury, a ruptured quadriceps tendon, was serious. The Rockets were
sent reeling to a five-game losing streak and a 7-17 record.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets split the next six games and had begun showing
signs of coming together in their drastically retooled offense.
Then Cato went down, and four more losses followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like once we started clicking, it would be tough to
stop us,'' forward Walt Williams said. ``At the same time, after
you come in after every game and you're talking about, `We're
almost there, almost there,' that's frustrating. You don't want to
keep hearing that. We were thinking we had a lot of talent here, a
lot of guys who can hurt you in a lot of different ways, so it was
just a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has happened for sure. It seems like a long season. When
you lose, it always seems long. This first half, we're ending it
off right, but our goal is to definitely make the second half much
better than our first half.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rockets can contend they were not as bad as their record
for two months, can they really know if they are as good as they
have been in the last week and a half? If bad results can be
misleading, good results would seem to have that same potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Tomjanovich had argued since Barkley's injury Dec. 8 that
the emphasis would have to be on improvement, that next season had
arrived early. With that in mind, ignoring how the Rockets got here
and even the record, they can claim to have improved to the degree
they might have hoped by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Francis has become the focal point of the offense, winning NBA
Rookie of the Month honors for December and the NBA's most recent
Player of the Week award. Thomas has gone from barely able to get
on the court to a horrible shooting slump to an average of 14.7
points and 9.5 rebounds during the winning streak. Olajuwon and
Cato have returned. Anderson and Williams are in the midst of their
most consistent stretch of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say, yeah, I expected to improve, but at what level?''
Tomjanovich said. ``I thought we were improving when we were still
losing. We just weren't getting that concrete reward of that `W' in
the paper in the standings. I felt at times we had made some great
strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the job's all about. It's to win. But you can't
cheat it, either. You might luck out or steal a win here or there.
But we're looking for consistency. That's what's so rewarding about
this last game (against Miami). We're not sneaking up on anybody.
We have a nice streak going. We had beaten Portland. To play a
great team like that we hadn't beaten in a long time when we had
everybody healthy, and not to have it come down to one or two
possessions, that was really impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season might have to wait.

 &HT;    Eds: Adds quotes from Gore
 &HT;    `Just begun,' Gore vows after big win
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Des Moines, Iowa - Vice President Al Gore came to Iowa's
legendary State Fairgrounds to celebrate his decisive victory over
Bill Bradley in the Iowa Demcoratic presidential caucuses Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just begun to fight,'' an almost breathless Gore growled
into the microphone from a stage crowded with family and friends.
And the crowed picked up the theme, chanting: ``Stay and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   With Air Force Two waiting for his midnight flight to New
Hampshire, the vice president vowed to resume his ``fight for you''
in the Granite State ``at the crack of dawn'' Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He called Bradley ``a good person'' and ``a tough competitor.''
And he thanked his supporters for the ``biggest victory in the
history of the contested caucuses here in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the cinder-block building with his wife Tipper at
his side, Gore immediately dashed into the crowd to hug supporters
and shake hands, all the while pumping his own clenched fist in the
air to punctuate his victory.
</P>
<P>
   One the stage, he hugged many of the dignitaries there. He gave
a huge bear hug to Sen. Tom Harkin, Iowa's Democratic senator, who
ran for the Democratic nomination in 1992 and won, with almost no
opposition, the caucus of his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore kicked off the celebration, thanking the cheering
audience for ``placing your faith'' in her husband.
</P>
<P>
   For the victory celebration, Gore wore a suit and tie, the
political ``uniform'' that he had shed in favor of casual wardrobe
in order to remake his button-down image.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores arrived at the snow-covered Fairgrounds after watching
the returns from their downtown hotel, where the vice president
also received a congratulatory telephone call from President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The huge blue-and-white sign above the stage echoed the
``fighter'' theme Gore has used over the last few months to
resurrect his once-sagging campaign: ``Al Gore Fighting For Us.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was heavily laced with union members, one of the major
sources of support for Gore in the caucus. It also included Bowman
Lee of Nashville, who drove from the vice president's home state of
Tennessee for the celebration.

DESPITE HIS CRITICS, McNAIR IS A WINNER 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As darkness fell upon Alltel Stadium Sunday, so did a steady and
unrelenting rain.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't seem to matter to the Tennessee Titans, the newly
crowned AFC champs.
</P>
<P>
   Up ahead in the tunnel beneath the Jacksonville stadium's seats,
quarterback Steve McNair could hear the cheering and celebrating.
The team bus was waiting. But McNair, his left foot in a protective
boot, walked alone, step by patient step.
</P>
<P>
   Only his smile betrayed him. For the fifth-year quarterback,
whose season began on a surgeon's table, it had to themost
satisfying walk of his young life.
</P>
<P>
   The world is about to find out all about Steve McNair. The media
is about to surround him at Super Bowl XXXIV and ask him all about
his back surgery, about his roller-coaster career, and about where
on God's green earth is Alcorn State.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, he will be spared the acknowledged lamest Super Bowl
question of all time, asked of Doug Williams in 1988: How long,
exactly, have you been a black quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, McNair will embrace the newfound attention and run
with it, dodging trouble and impressing bystanders just as he did
against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to get to the Super Bowl in only his third year as a
starter,'' Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher said, ``maybe some people
will now give him more respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, he was Air McNair, a throw-from-the-hip
gunslinger from small-time Alcorn State. But first the Houston
Oilers, later to become the Titans, had no plans of putting McNair
in the shotgun and staging an air show.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher summed it best Sunday when he said the Titans' philosophy
was to run the football and throw high-percentage passes behind a
quarterback with mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in that set of instructions, Fisher and offensive
coordinator Les Steckel were able to piece together what McNair is
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dare McNair,'' the critics still call him, because McNair has
never been afraid to bolt from the pocket. Most of his best runs,
it seems, have come on third down or in a game's final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who criticize him,'' Fisher said, ``don't really
understand what we're asking him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice against the Jaguars on Sunday, he was flushed from the
pocket and launched a dubious pass on the run. But during the
regular season, McNair threw only eight interceptions. In lieu of
vast, Marino-sized chunks of passing yardage, McNair has been asked
to more or less find the soonest open receiver.
</P>
<P>
   He had, by all sensible accounts, an outstanding season. He
began the year with a ruptured disc, yet was back starting again
after only missing five games. As the Titans won, McNair continued
to patiently abide by Fisher's system.
</P>
<P>
   In the three playoff victories to date, McNair has yet to pass
for more than 200 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, I threw for more than 4,000 yards,'' McNair said
Sunday. ``Mentally, I had to get used to (the philsophy) here. But
I understood. We have a great running back in Eddie George here,
and we had to get the running game started.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, it seems, McNair needs to stop being judged on
style points. The Titans have only lost twice since he returned
from the back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Jacksonville last weekend nursing a severe case of
turf toe, yet he played and ran and, in the end, the Jaguars never
could catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's a winner,'' guard Bruce Matthews said. ``What more
do you want?''
</P>
<P>
   It will be written this week that McNair is only the second
quarterback of his race to start a Super Bowl. If the questions
stop there, they will miss a grand story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about being a black quarterback,'' McNair said.
``We're just like anybody else. This is something we all dream
of.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Air McNair never landed in Houston or in
Tennessee. The makeover has left McNair vulnerable to criticism,
but the harvest came Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In owner Bud Adams' 40 years with the franchise, neither George
Blanda nor Dan Pastorini, neither Ken Stabler nor Warren Moon, was
able to do what McNair has done.
</P>
<P>
   With his sore foot Sunday, 26-year-old McNair walked to the bus
that would take him to the plane that would take him to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the yardage. It was the walk of his life. nn

PLACING THIRD IN IOWA, KEYES VOWS TO KEEP ON FIGHTING
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ For months, Alan Keyes was the silver-tongued
also-ran who, it was assumed, would fight it out for last place in
the Iowa's Republican caucuses. But in one of the biggest surprises
of Monday night's vote, Keyes placed third, beating two U.S.
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting ``thanks to Almighty God,'' Keyes vowed to hundreds of
supporters in a ballroom of a suburban motel on Monday night that
he would take his campaign for moral renewal and against abortion
``all across America and on until victory is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just the beginning,'' said Keyes, a conservative radio
commentator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let anyone convince you that the decent heart of America
is dead,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a wry smile, he gloated a bit by observing that his
strong finish had come as a big surprise to his critics and
detractors, who, as he put it, ``always say, yes, Alan Keyes, but
....''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he went on, ``our goal in the months ahead is to turn
all those buts into keye-sters.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes touched only briefly in his speech on the role of the
abortion issue in his victory _ he was as outspoken in his
opposition to abortion as any candidate in a state where 40 percent
of all Republican voters hold themselves to be members of the
Christian right. Rather he contended that his espousal of the need
for the nation to turn its eyes once again toward God was the main
driving force behind his strong finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two words that explain what has happened, what is
happening and what will happen,'' he said, ``are Almighty God _
attribute this victory to Almighty God.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who had predicted that he would fail here because he had
neither the message nor the money to run well, he said, had best
prepare for other surprises and victories. Starting Tuesday, he
said, he would again begin campaigning in New hampshire and then
would move on to ``South Carolina and Michigan and Arizona and all
those places all the way to California and victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we come in first, second, or last,'' he declared, ``so
long as we walk the walk that God wants us to walk, we will win a

WITHOUT PAYTON, SONICS FALL SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sonics point guard Gary Payton is the first to admit
that his racy mouth can cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But this had even Payton speechless. An ejection with 1:28 left
in the first quarter? For laughing?
</P>
<P>
   That is what Payton contends he did in order to get silenced
Monday night in the Sonics' 112-106 loss to the New York Knicks at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Ted Bernhardt tagged Payton with two quick technical
fouls, leaving the Sonics without their emotional and statistical
leader for three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, playing without Payton was too much to
overcome as the Sonics lost their third game in a row on the road.
</P>
<P>
   However, the team never lost its fight. The players rebounded
from back-to-back lethargic performances against Toronto and Boston
with a gutsy game that only slipped away in the final moments.
</P>
<P>
   Poor free-throw shooting overshadowed a night when Vin Baker was
dominant in the post, reserve guard Shammond Williams electrified
the Garden with a career-high 22 points and the Sonics retrieved
the ball as if it were stuffed with $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of all-around effort that Payton and center
Horace Grant demanded a day earlier. The irony is that Payton
wasn't on the court to witness the team's turn-around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what caliber of player Gary is, and I can't
imagine what he said to get ejected from a game in New York City,''
said Baker, who finished with 21 points, 12 rebounds and a block.
``We still should have won the game. This is a good basketball
team, and guys wanted to step up and show that.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton watched the game on a television in the visitors' locker
room. Afterward, he expressed an array of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   He was proud of his teammates. He was still upset and mostly
confused by the ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I get a technical,'' Payton said. ``But the
second one, I don't know what happened. He's been giving me a lot
of technicals this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The commotion began when Payton argued a non-call with Bernhardt
after New York's Chris Childs stole the ball. When Payton
questioned the play, Bernhardt immediately whistled the first
technical. Then, Payton said he asked Bernhardt ``What? You have a
problem with me?'' as he turned and started walking away.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was at least 15 feet away when Bernhardt whistled the
second technical foul. Payton then charged Bernhardt and had to be
restrained by teammate Emanual Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that because it was a shock to me to get thrown out,''
Payton said. ``I didn't come to New York to sit in the locker room.
I came to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton insisted he wasn't going to strike Bernhardt despite
being so animated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that stupid,'' Payton said. ``I'm not going to hit
anybody. I'm not that ignorant. . . . After the first technical, I
laughed. I thought it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time Payton had been thrown out of a game this
season. He drew an ejection with nine seconds left in a lopsided
home loss to Philadelphia on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Sonics were formidable throughout.
</P>
<P>
   They held two leads in the fourth quarter. The Sonics last led
86-85 with 7:14 left after Baker attacked the basket and converted
a three-point play. Eventually, the Knicks took a 95-93 lead and
took advantage of Payton's absence on defense down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had no answer for Allan Houston, who scored seven of
his game-high 27 points down the stretch. Houston's 3-pointer with
1:14 left put the Knicks ahead 105-96 and sealed the Sonics' fate.
</P>
<P>
   Missing 15 of 34 free throws really hurt, considering the Sonics
outrebounded the Knicks 45-37.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was anyone's game,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.
``It's too bad we missed free throws all game. . . . But the team
responded well.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams stepped up the most.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 guard has received little playing time this season
due to injuries. He's also stuck behind Payton and Davis at point
guard. However, Williams took Payton's place and scored his 22
points on 9-for-14 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After Seattle fell behind 52-41 with 3:50 to play in the second
quarter, Williams' outside shooting and dribble penetration were
instrumental in getting the Sonics within 56-51 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics used a 20-2 run to take a 61-56 lead early in the
third. Williams had 17 points going into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, my cousin and I talked before the game and
he said, `This is going to be your break-out night,' '' said
Williams, who was born in Harlem. ``I knew I was going to play
(after Payton's ejection) so I just stayed calm and played like
Shammond Williams is capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sonics brought their `A' game _ particularly Baker.
The power forward had been criticized for playing too much on the
perimeter. But Monday night he was aggressive underneath the basket
against the Knicks' strong frontline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we need every night,'' Grant said. ``If we bring
that attitude every night, we'll win a lot of basketball games.''

NORTHRIDGE ENTERS TOUGH WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two games, two wins. Too much stress.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge men's basketball coach Bobby Braswell said
he ``sweated'' out the Matadors' 73-63 win over Montana last
weekend _ especially after CSUN was down by nine points in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, the Matadors trailed Montana State with 12
minutes left before pulling away. The CSUN band appropriately
played ``The Heat Is On'' against Montana.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it's going to be for the Matadors as they become
a force in the Big Sky Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell things have changed around here a little bit,''
Braswell said last week. ``There was a time when we could expect
people to maybe play flat against us. That's just not happening
anymore. People are looking at us now, and we're a team they want
to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (12-5 overall, 4-2 in the Big Sky) was hunted at Matador
Gym. Now, the Matadors become the hunters on the road. Northridge's
most important two-game road swing is this week: Sacramento State
on Thursday and Weber State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's going to get a little tough,'' Braswell said. ``We've
got to at least get a split on this road trip, somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge is ahead of Weber State (12-5, 3-2) in the conference
standings by a half-game. Sacramento State is 2-2, 8-7 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Weber State was upset at home by Eastern Washington on Saturday
night; the first-place Eagles' 90-78 win ended WSU's 30-game home
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our conference, there will always be a sense of urgency,''
CSUN guard Markus Carr said. ``A lot of teams are capable of
beating teams, for some reason. It's wacky out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (team) that wins this can have five or six losses,'' he
said. ``There's nobody who's going to run away with this thing.
We've got to show up every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Slick moves: Braswell has struck gold the past two games by
benching regular starters.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Larry sat at the start of the Montana State game, then
scored 17 points in the second half. Saturday, Carr didn't start
for the first time in 29 games and had 14 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The players) know how the process works,'' Braswell said.
``They know they have to show up to practice every day and work
hard in practice. If they don't, they can easily be replaced on a
whim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we're deep enough where we can keep these guys
honest and working hard every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, who had seven assists against Montana State, said: ``Not
starting made me more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting tough: Montana's Matt Williams averaged 26 points per
game against the Matadors last season. He's one of the Big Sky's
leading scorers and the top rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   So when Williams was 6 of 9 from the field and had five rebounds
in the first half Saturday, CSUN's coaching staff was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certain guys who you're not going to be able to stop
completely,'' Braswell said. ``(Williams) is a very talented
basketball player. He causes people problems. I challenged Hewitt
(Rolle) and some of our other post guys to step up in the second
half and make it a little hard on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams made just two of seven shots and had four rebounds in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Quick feet: After Jeff Parris made all six of his shots and had
a team-high 18 points _ and seven assists _ against Montana, he
bumped into Grizzlies coach Don Holst after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Holst noticed Parris was limping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you sprain your ankle or anything?'' he asked Parris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a large blister on the back of my foot,'' Parris said.
</P>
<P>
   Holst: ``It was from running by us, right?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice
President Al Gore captured clear victories in the Iowa presidential
caucuses on Monday night, affirming their positions as
front-runners for their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore outpolled former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey in the
Democratic race 63 percent to 35 percent. The outcome was a setback
for Bradley who had campaigned aggressively in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican race, Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher who
had pumped millions into the race, finished second, roughly
tripling the 10 percent he drew here four year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, a former State Department official who like Forbes
courted the religious right, ranked third, outpacing another
religious conservative, Gary Bauer, as well as Sen. Orrin Hatch of
Utah. Sen. John McCain of Arizona did not campaign here, preferring
to concentrate on New Hampshire, and won only a handful of votes.
</P>
<P>
   With 41 percent of the vote, Bush, a two-term governor in his
first try for national office, surpassed the 37 percent that Bob
Dole drew in a six-candidate field in 1988. Bush had set that
figure as his goal. Yet in a sign of the potency that the abortion
issue holds here, his results did not match the combined votes of
Forbes, Keyes and Bauer, all of whom harshly criticized Bush as
being soft on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The victors hope their triumphs will embolden their campaigns in
the nation's first primary in New Hampshire in only eight days. But
both Bush and Gore face entirely different political landscapes
there _ as well as polls showing they are neck and neck with McCain
and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Some New Hampshire voters pride themselves on not following the
lead of Iowa, and Bush and Gore are no doubt mindful that the
results of the Iowa caucuses have been far from a reliable
indicator of who will end up at the White House, or even win their
parties' nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This state is hardly representative of the nation _ it is
overwhelmingly white _ and those who participated Monday night
tended to be those who are at the more conservative or liberal
wings of their parties. There are 1.8 million registered voters in
Iowa, but officials Monday night estimated that roughly 166,000
actually went to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the showings of Forbes, who drew 30 percent, and Keyes,
who captured 14 percent, underscored the potency of religious
conservative voters in these caucuses, Bush drew a substantial
proportion of their support as well, according to surveys of voters
entering the caucuses. Bauer tallied 9 percent; McCain, 5 percent;
and Hatch, 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, for more than a year, Bush has towered over the
Republican field because of his record-breaking fund-raising,
impressive poll numbers and vast endorsements. Now, the first
voters declared him the leader as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, smiling as he watched the coverage in his hotel suite
here, declared a triumph barely 45 minutes after the caucuses
opened. ``We've had a record-shattering victory,'' he said, ``and I
never dreamt I'd be able to get such a high vote total.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a rally in Des Moines, he said to cheers, ``Tonight
also marks the beginning of the end of the Clinton era.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic competition, Gore's victory marked a comeback
of sorts because for months he and his campaign had been worried
about Bradley's insurgency. But Gore benefited from the vigorous
backing of labor and much of the state's Democratic establishment.
</P>
<P>
   An ebullient Gore, at a rally late Monday night, declared,
``Thank you for the biggest victory of the contested caucuses here
in Iowa. Wow! Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from when Gore ran for president in 1988. In
that race, Gore skipped campaigning in Iowa, deriding the caucus
system as ``madness'' and calling it ``the small state of Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, Gore conceded that he faced a far different
competition in New Hampshire. ``I don't think there's any such
thing as the so-called `bounce,''' he said of the prospect that his
victory here would boost him significantly in New Hampshire. ``That
race must be won on his own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   In conceding moments before, Bradley also said he was gearing
for a hard-fought contest. ``Let me congratulate the vice president
on his strong showing tonight,'' he said. ``He's an opponent who is
tough and I know I'll be seeing a lot of him in the coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Tonight, I have a little bit more humility, but no
less confidence that I can do that job.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-place finisher on the Republican side, Forbes, also
warned that the fight had only begun. He asserted his second-place
finish ``demonstrates that ideas matter, principles matter _ and if
you have a strong conservative message, you can get broad-based
support within the conservative party.''
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes had long been viewed as Bush's toughest competitor
here, Keyes' showing was particularly striking because he has run a
low-budget campaign and many Republican had dismissed him as more a
protest candidate than a serious vote-getter. But he drew
particular attention for his stand-out role in many of the
Republican debates.
</P>
<P>
   Though Iowa has been at the epicenter of American politics, the
results are far from a reliable indicator of who will end up at the
White House _ or even win the first primary in New Hampshire next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The last candidate to win a contested caucus and be elected
president was Jimmy Carter in 1976. In 1988, the eventual nominees,
Michael S. Dukakis and George Bush, placed third in the caucuses.
The two victors, Dick Gephardt and Bob Dole, had quit the race by
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, there was no contested Democratic race. Dole won
the Republican caucuses, but he was followed closely by Pat
Buchanan, who then triumphed in New Hampshire but lost the
nomination to Dole. In recent years, the voting here has been more
important for narrowing the field.
</P>
<P>
   Early entrance polls Monday night suggested that many Republican
voters cared more about a candidate's moral values than his stance
on taxes, Social Security, abortion or education.
</P>
<P>
   Those voters heavily backed Bush followed by Keyes and Forbes.
About a third of the Republican voters said they had never attended
a caucus before.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the character issue in this campaign and
voters said they were looking for a candidate who stood up for what
he believed in rather than one who understood complex issues or
cared about the average American. Nearly 25 percent of caucus
participants said they were members of the religious right, and 75
percent described themselves as politically conservative. Sixty
percent said someone who lived in their household had served in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many other states have derided Iowa for all the attention that
it draws from the contenders and from the press. To a large
measure, the outcome reflects the organizational prowess of
candidates and interest groups in prodding people to give up a
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the caucuses have become high profile events because the
national press covers them heavily, which in turn prompts the
candidates to spend more time here.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses started at 7 p.m., when residents went to schools,
church basements, meeting halls and private homes across the state.
The voting marked only the beginning of a months-long process of
selecting delegates to the Republican and Democratic conventions,
where the nominees would actually be chosen. The Republican vote
was merely a straw poll and would have little impact on the
selection of actual delegates to the convention, who will be chosen
at county conventions, congressional district conventions and state
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, the voting Monday night will have more
influence on the selection of actual delegates. Iowa would
eventually account for 56 of the party's 4,337 convention
delegates. The state will send 25 of the 2,169 delegates to the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   For months _ years in some cases _ Iowa has served as a second
home for many candidates. They poured millions of dollars into
television commercials, and they campaigned from hog farms to high
schools, making their pitches to a relatively tiny number of
voters. Even before the intense campaigning of the past month,
Forbes had ben here 69 days; Bradley, 62 days; Bauer, 54 days;
Keyes, 51 days; Gore, 35 days; and Bush, 19 days. This was the
first time since 1988 that both parties had competitive contests.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before Iowans voted, the contenders devoted one last day to
trying to persuade and cajole the undecided and the uncommitted.
Bush got an early start, striding into a restaurant here at 7:45
Monday morning and competing with eggs and pastries for the
attention of the scattered diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rest for a while,'' he told a diner. ``It's like running a
marathon. I ran a marathon in 1993, and it just requires patience
and discipline and focus, and this is mile six.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent stop in Ames, where he delivered a speech at
Iowa State University, Bush was upbeat and folksy, offering a
homespun riff on how hard it has been to spend so many days on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the cats,'' he said. ``They don't miss me. I miss the
dog. She does miss me.'' But his playfulness had its limits. When
the documentary filmmaker, Michael Moore _ who has been traveling
through Iowa with a ``mosh pit'' in which people roll around _
asked Bush to participate, the governor said, ``Behave yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent his last day pretty much as always _ with a heavy
dose of radio interviews on conservative programs. By 3 p.m., he
had appeared on 20 radio programs and 14 television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters as he campaigned with two of his five
daughters, Forbes asserted that he was the leading conservative in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Monday played down reports that he used marijuana more
extensively in his mid-20s than he has admitted. Asked whether he
had smoked marijuana almost daily in the early 1970s, Gore told the
NBC affiliate here, KWQC, ``No, when I came back from Vietnam, yes,
but not to that extent. This is something I dealt with a longtime
ago _ it's old news.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who is 51, added: ``When I was young, I did
things young people do. When I grew up, I put away childish
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley held his only public event at Iowa State University,
where he told several hundred students and faculty members that
politics in America had lost touch with the needs of ``real''
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics to too many young people, to too many Americans, has
become nothing other than tactics,'' Bradley said. ``It's become
tactics and not belief. It's become spin and not truth. It's become
fund-raising and not reaching out to people where they live their
lives. It has become all of the things that are artificial in our
country.''

RAMS' DEFENSE SEEKS RESPECT AT SUPER BOWL (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The high-scoring St. Louis Rams arrived here Monday
with a point to make: They wouldn't be in Super Bowl XXXIV if not
for their defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who outscored opponents by 284 points, the
second-highest point differential in NFL history, rarely had to
count on their defense this season.
</P>
<P>
   But after Sunday, the Rams are counting their blessings for a
unit that ranked sixth in the NFL in yards allowed and fourth in
points allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In its 11-6 victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC
Championship Game, St. Louis discovered just how good its defense
is. While the Rams offense managed only one touchdown, the St.
Louis defense scored style points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of poetic justice,'' Rams defensive end Kevin Carter
said Monday. ``It's kind of ironic. I think all year long our
offense has gotten a lot of praise, which is fine. It's been very
characteristic of our team. We're very unselfish. We don't care who
gets the glory. But it's fitting to where it should come down to
needing the defense, which is kind of been the unsung hero the
whole season, to make the play stand up and do something to allow
us to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense wins championships. The coin phrase definitely held
true'' Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rams defenders have become a tad defensive about a perceived
lack of respect. First, they felt slighted by the Rams' offense.
Then, it was the Tampa Bay defense, which ranked third overall,
that overshadowed them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Rams had two interceptions, five sacks and seven
stops behind the line of scrimmage in limiting the Bucs to 203
yards, 12 first downs and two field goals. One of Tampa Bay's field
goals came on a 13-yard drive that was set up by a Steve White
interception.
</P>
<P>
   Score this one for the Rams' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got sick of hearing about Tampa Bay's defense all week,''
Rams free safety Devin Bush said. ``It was all right to talk about
it, but that's all you heard. To just talk about their defense and
nothing else, not even mention ours, that was like a slap in the
face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who had trailed for a total of 7 minutes, 48 seconds
in their first nine games at the Trans World Dome, faced a deficit
most of Sunday. After St. Louis finally got ahead, 11-6, with 4:44
remaining, the defense had the Rams' season in its hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt like we were going to win that football game,''
Rams linebacker London Fletcher said. ``I was extremely confident
that we would stop them. I always believed in us.''
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, the Rams held eight teams to fewer
than 300 yards. Only four times did teams score more than two
touchdowns against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rams had one more defensive touchdown than the Bucs had
rushing touchdowns (7) this season.
</P>
<P>
   So how could the Rams not like their chances against an offense
that ranked 28th overall, including 30th passing?
</P>
<P>
   Still, rookie Shaun King took the Bucs from their 23 to the
Rams' 22 before defensive end Grant Wistrom had a 13-yard sack.
Three incompletions later, the Rams had defended their home turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're good,'' Rams cornerback Todd Lyght said. ``I
think we're one of the better defenses in the league, and I think
we showed that Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (15-3) will face a bigger challenge Sunday against the
Tennessee Titans, who ranked 13th in total offense. On Oct. 31, the
Titans gained 281 yards in a 24-21 victory against St. Louis. But
the Rams are ready to stand their ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the No. 1 rush defense in the league, which I don't
think anyone gives us much credit for,'' Fletcher said. ``You look
at our yards average per (pass) attempt against us, it is right up
there with the tops. We are tied for No. 1 in sacks in the NFL, as
well and second in interceptions. You look at all those things, and
how can you overlook our defense? We definitely will be out to
showcase our defense.'' nn

   RATCHABURI, Thailand _ Thai security forces stormed a hospital
here early on Tuesday, ending a 22-hour standoff in which a handful
of guerrillas from neighboring Myanmar, whose group is led by
12-year-old twin boys, took about 800 patients and staff members
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   A regional military commander said his men had freed all the
hostages in this border town and killed 10 rebels. Their bodies,
wrapped in blood-stained sheets, were put on display at the
hospital. Two police officers were wounded It was not immediately
known whether the twins had been with the hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hostages are safe,'' said the commander, Lt. Gen.
Thaweep Suwannasingha. Earlier, he said about 450 hostages remained
in the hospital after hundreds fled during the night.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the black-masked gunmen, from a splinter
group of ethnic Karen rebels that calls itself God's Army, had
burst into the hospital compound, 75 miles west of Bangkok, riding
a hijacked blue public bus and firing automatic rifles into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The group's chain-smoking twin leaders, Johnny and Luther Htoo,
are fundamentalist Christians who claim to have mystical powers
that make them immune to bullets and land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen said they did not intend to hurt anyone, but the
strangeness of the group and its leaders added an element of
unpredictability to the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kuwat Suntrajarn, an official at the Ministry of Public
Health, said 200 staff members and 600 patients were inside the
750-bed hospital when the siege began at about 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, and the hospital staff was apparently
able to continue treating some patients. But perhaps 40 people were
released during the day _ some on stretchers, one on a
post-operative gurney, one in labor _ suggesting that their care in
the hospital was not adequate.
</P>
<P>
   A number of hostages managed to flee, despite reports that the
rebels had attached a bomb to the main gate and placed mines around
the perimeter. One of the escapees said the hostages were unfed and
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials said the gunmen, wearing military fatigues,
demanded that Thailand stop shelling their hilltop base inside
Myanmar, that it provide medical care to wounded rebels, and that
it give sanctuary to their ``army,'' which has no more than 200
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Piroon Kongkachai, a nurse who spent the night with 31 patients
in the neurosurgery ward, said on Tuesday that she and her
colleagues changed out of their uniforms for fear of being seized
by the rebels to provide the medical care they were seeking inside
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   They spent the night trying to comfort the patients in the
intensive care unit, some of them on respirators. Three hours
before security forces stormed the hospital, she said, one of the
Thai soldiers, dressed like a patient, entered her ward and told
her to turn off the lights, lock the door and lie on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody just lay there silently watching the attack on
television with the sound turned off,'' she said. ``Nobody
screamed. We were all ready for what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   God's Army is one of dozens of ethnic insurgent bands that have
been fighting the central government in Myanmar, the former Burma,
for half a century. In recent years most of the main fighting
groups have reached cease-fire or peace agreements with the
Myanmar's military government, but the Karen have continued to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, the Htoo twins rallied their village in
1997 to avenge a government offensive in which _ as in many similar
reported incidents _ the soldiers raped women, killed men in front
of their families and set fire to thatched homes.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that time that God's Army was formed, breaking off
from the main Karen guerrilla force, the Karen National Union.
Burmese military attacks on that group have driven tens of
thousands of civilians into border encampments just inside
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The boys appear to have instilled a special fanaticism among
their followers, setting a severe regimen in which liquor, drugs,
fighting and swearing are banned. ``I have never cried,'' Luther
Htoo told the Associated Press in an interview last month. ``Why
would a man cry?'' The twins chain-smoked throughout the interview.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Htoo brothers command guerrillas who are
older than they are. But it remained unclear how the boys exercised
their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, the God's Army fighters have come under
intense attack from the army of Myanmar, and Thai troops have
shelled them from across the border to prevent them from fleeing
into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Shown on local television before the storming of the hospital,
one masked gunman who called himself Nui said: ``Do not be worried.
We will not hurt any hostages. We want to tell the world how Karen
and Burmese refugees live during the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We will go back when our demands are met, when we
reach an agreement. We still don't have any definite plan on how to
return.'' He added: ``We didn't harm anyone. We have released many
hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was an embarrassment for Thailand, which took a soft
approach to previous Karen hostage-takers who occupied the Myanmar
Embassy in Bangkok for 25 hours in October and then were given safe
passage by helicopter back to the border.
</P>
<P>
   The five embassy hostage-takers, calling themselves the Vigorous
Burmese Student Warriors, then took refuge with the God's Army
fighters. One news report said some of them took part in the
hospital takeover on Tuesday, but that could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two countries rose after the embassy siege,
as the authorities in Myanmar closed the border for two months and
strengthened their military presence on the border.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman in Myanmar issued a statement on Monday
saying: ``It is about time these armed men are treated as
terrorists by the international community. Myanmar is committed to
the elimination of armed terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials vowed to be tougher this time, calling the
takeover of a hospital ``international terrorism.''

LAKERS LOSE TO JAZZ IN DOUBLE OT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ A gradual downward spiral that had seen the Los
Angeles Lakers lose more games in a week than they had in all of
December came to a near halt Monday. Came within a missed bank shot
and two overtimes of stopping dead and reversing itself, actually.
</P>
<P>
   They were that close to a major victory and a momentum turn. But
the spiral spun on.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers clawed and scrapped with renewed vigor as a
playoff-like atmosphere built around them at the Delta Center, but
they eventually succumbed to the Utah Jazz in a thrilling 105-101
double-overtime loss.
</P>
<P>
   A win might have reversed recent ill trends and would have given
the Lakers a rare season sweep in Utah. Instead, they suffered
consecutive losses for the first time this season, and their fourth
defeat in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, they were always close enough to win but not yet
disciplined enough to pull it out, as the second overtime saw the
Lakers' offense sputter into a 3-for-10 collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard,'' coach Phil Jackson said, ``but I don't think
we played as smart as we could tonight. They were able to sustain
the energy and win this game, especially in that second overtime. I
felt we had a great chance in regulation, a great chance in the
(first overtime), and we just couldn't find the combination of
things to do right.''
</P>
<P>
   They fell to a Jazz team led by the usual veteran suspects _
Karl Malone went for 31 points and 13 rebounds but also by youth,
as rookie Quincy Lewis scored six points in the second overtime,
when Utah outscored the Lakers 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal carried the Lakers as long as he could (36
points) but was outworked on the boards (nine rebounds to Greg
Ostertag's 14) and out of energy by the final buzzer, having played
a career-high 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was just 2 for 6, with no trips to the foul line and one
rebound, in the two overtime periods _ and had just two rebounds
after halftime. But then, his teammates also failed him as they
often settled for quick jumpshots instead of working the ball
inside first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard, I have no complaints about that,'' O'Neal
said, ``but we just need to play smarter down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Did his teammates look to go inside enough? ``Probably not.''
Frustrated? ``Of course I am. ... We can't always look for the
jumper, especially when it's not going.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was perturbed about a pair of missed 3-pointers by
Robert Horry in the second overtime, when O'Neal was 1 for 4. Kobe
Bryant, who finished with 26 points on 9-of-24 shooting, was 1 for
3 in the final period, in which the Lakers never led.
</P>
<P>
   A Derek Fisher 3-pointer pulled them within a point, 95-94, but
the offense stalled after that and the Jazz pushed the lead to
101-96 in the final minute. A Bryant desperation 3-pointer from 38
feet out made it 103-101 with 1.2 seconds left. But Lewis hit two
free throws to push the lead to four again, and Bryant was unable
to get off a 3-point try at the buzzer and didn't draw the
necessary foul from Jeff Hornacek for the potential 4-point play
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with Glen and Kobe shooting the
basketball,'' Fisher said, ``but I think we all understand that
everything starts with the big fella in the middle and kind of
allowing us to play off of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice tried his best to avoid overtime altogether. He hit a long
jumper late in the fourth that he thought was a 3-pointer but was
ruled a 2, with 56.6 seconds left, leaving the Lakers down 81-79. A
Bryant jumper tied it at 81 with 27.7 seconds to go and the Lakers
got a final chance when Malone was called for traveling.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice's short bankshot at the buzzer bounced off the iron,
leaving the Lakers again just short of victory. But not short on
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a learning process for us,'' Bryant said. ``We
absolutely have to take this in stride, because we have to learn
the X's and O's, we have to learn certain things to do throughout
the ballgame to get us going. Even though we're 2-4 (over the last
six games), I'd probably say it's a positive because we have so
much to learn from it.''

JACKSON CRITICIZES SHOT SELECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Robert Horry had plenty of trouble trying to
defend against Karl Malone on Monday, but it was his offensive
decision-making that got him in trouble with coach Phil Jackson
during the Los Angeles Lakers' 105-101 double-overtime loss to the
Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers made just 3 of 10 shots in the second overtime, and
two of those misses were wide-open 3-point tries from Horry. With
every possession precious, and the Lakers failing to work the ball
inside, Jackson could only shake his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not happy at all,'' Jackson said of the Lakers' shot
selection. And of Horry, he said, ``I think he had a brain flap or
something going out there, just a little mind-slip or something
went on.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry, a 3-point ace earlier in his career, but 6 for 29 from
the arc this season, felt no shame in the two misses. The first
came with the Lakers down 95-94, but after the rebound to Utah, the
Jazz extended the lead by two on a Quincy Lewis jumper. The second
miss came with less than a minute to go and the Lakers down 99-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed them. I just missed them,'' said Horry, who said both
were good shots to take. ``There wasn't nobody on me. That's a good
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me. I'm that wide open, I'm tired of people dropping
off me, so I was going to take a shot. Most people, they're scared
to take the shot in that situation, but I ain't scared. I was going
to take it. If I missed, I missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry also had a brief spat with Jackson during a fourth-quarter
timeout. He responded to a harsh lecture by throwing his protective
face mask to the floor. A.C. Green talked him down for the rest of
the timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a philosophy thing, about just hustling and
getting into our offense, being part of what we're doing,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't nothing,'' Horry said. ``I was just mad at myself.
There wasn't nothing between me and him. It just looked like it was
a tit-for-tat. I was just mad at myself. I throw that thing (the
mask) around all the time. Give me something to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Not ready: The Lakers' triangle offense has bogged down at key
moments recently, but Jackson said he's not going to add any new
wrinkles to the scheme yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Not until) they show more execution with what we've got,'' he
said. ``They're just not executing very well.''

KINGS TRADE TSYPLAKOV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vladimir Tsyplakov, who filled in on the Los
Angeles Kings' first line during injuries to Luc Robitaille and
Ziggy Palffy, was traded Monday to the Buffalo Sabres for future
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplakov, 30, a native Russian, was a third-round draft choice
of the Kings in 1995. He rarely played this season until Robitaille
broke his left foot in early November. Three games later, he had
two goals and an assist in a victory over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   This season he has six goals and 13 points, but when Robitaille
returned, Tsyplakov's playing time diminished. He played some when
Palffy missed four games with a bad back last month but was out of
the lineup the past four games.

NOT A PRIMEAU TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Keith Primeau is not a King today for a very big
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   When general manager Dave Taylor asked Carolina Hurricanes GM
Rutherford last week what it would take to get the All-Star center
who was involved in a five-month holdout, Blake was the answer
before the phone went dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford sifted through the offers, including a three-team
deal involving the New York Rangers, Phoenix Coyotes and their top
player Keith Tkuchuk, before trading Primeau to the Philadelphia
Flyers for Rod Brind'Amour.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau then signed a five-year, $22.5 million extension with
the Flyers, almost the same contract he rejected from the
Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau would have been perfect in L.A. The Los Angeles Kings
need a top-line center and have to rethink their future with
talented, but oft-injured Jozef Stumpel. At 28, Primeau is in the
prime of his career. At 6-foot-5 he could handle the intimidation
of the other team's checking line that has bothered the Kings
during their struggles the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He played on the Canadian Olympic team for Kings coach Andy
Murray, who dreamed of seeing Primeau with Luc Robitaille and Ziggy
Palffy even before Stumpel went down Nov. 6 with abdominal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Primeau's sparkling resume, there is one King that
will not be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Blake is more than the captain of the team and a year removed
from being named the NHL's top defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   He is the biggest reason the Kings have not fallen right out
ofthe Western Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Blake is the Kings big shot from the point on the power play,
but he also is the big hip check that two weeks ago sent St. Louis'
PavolDemitra into the boards and back to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   There were stretches in the last two weeks where coaches said
Blake pitched perfect games, drawing the top score on the team's
complicated evaluation system.
</P>
<P>
   He has 13 goals and 33 points and has missed just two games
despite an often painful groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   And on Feb. 6, he will be making his first start and third
overall appearance in the NHL All-Star, which will be held in
Toronto where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   But it's so much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Blake sets the tone for the Kings. He is a quiet man with the
loudest voice in the locker room. He got Murray, his old Team
Canada coach, the Kings job when the team was debating whether it
wanted a big name or a career assistant with an exhaustive work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone, Blake kept the untested Kings from turning on
themselves during a month when they went 2-10-1. They now are
better equipped to handle the stretch, even though they face Dallas
on Wednesday and have not beaten the Stars in the last 21 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, he kept his words in the dressing room and demanded his
teammates to do the same. When names started popping up in the
trade rumors for Primeau, Blake would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is happening will stay inside the team,'' he said
after Sunday's 3-2 victory over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said for the rest of the carnival that
surrounded Primeau. He was the Hurricanes captain last year, but
this season alienated his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Players understand that the rules of restricted free agency
offer a great chance to make big money. But early in the season
when Carolina played in Primeau's hometown of Toronto, he never
visited them and constantly reminded anyone who would listen that
he wasn't going back.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau has done this before in his career, forcing Detroit to
trade him to the then Hartford Whalers. The Red Wings got Brendan
Shanahan in return and two Stanley Cups. Primeau got a reputation
for being selfish.
</P>
<P>
   The latest situation deteriorated further last month when it
appeared the Hurricanes and Coyotes were close to a deal involving
Primeaufor Tkachuk. Talks went on behind the scenes until Carolina
owner Peter Karmanos said that Tkachuk, a two-time 50-goal scorer,
was part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk is probably the Coyotes' most popular player and was
building a dream in nearby Scottsdale. But he also is scheduled to
make $8.3 million next year. Phoenix has lost $15 million each of
the last two years and a new arena scheduled for 2001-02 might not
come in time to lose a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotionally charged situation that grew even more
desperate when the Hurricanes started sliding out of the playoff
picture. The Rangers reportedly got involved in the talks, sending
Petr Nedved to Carolina with Primeau going to Phoenix and Tkachuk
to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The mess is over. Brind'Amour, 29, is an excellent two-way
center, who played with Primeau and Blake on the Canadian Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody wins when you get in these situations,''
Carolina's new captain Ron Francis said. ``Unfortunately, this
happensin sports. But from an organization standpoint you want to
have everybody on the ice that you can to help you win and be
successful. Now, we can all move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Including the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Primeau is a great player. But he's no Rob Blake.

TRAIL BLAZERS FINALLY OVERCOME UPSTART NETS, 101-87 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ For three quarters Monday night, the New Jersey
Nets defied logic. With Stephon Marbury putting on a scoring clinic
and his teammates coming up with big plays when necessary, they
quieted the roof-raising fans at the Rose Garden and nearly played
one of the best teams in basketball even.
</P>
<P>
   But ugly reality set in for the Nets at the outset of the fourth
quarter, as the Portland Trail Blazers turned a tight game into a
rout. With a blistering 19-8 run over the opening six minutes of
the quarter, the Blazers took control and ran to their 14th home
victory in 17 games, winning by 101-87.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Anthony, Portland's reserve point guard, led the defining
charge by making three 3-pointers in four and half minutes. The
most damaging one came with 9 minutes 24 seconds remaining and gave
the Blazers an 81-74 lead, forcing the Nets to call a timeout. But
the pause did little as Portland scored 9 of the next 11 points,
including Anthony's final 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who trailed by just 71-68 entering the fourth quarter,
dropped to 17-24 and face the Seattle Supersonics on Wednesday in
the second contest of their four-game West Coast trip. The Blazers,
who defeated the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday, improved to 31-10
in defeating the Nets for the 12th time in the teams' last 13
meetings in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury led the Nets with 21 points on 9-of-21 shooting. He
scored 18 in the first half, torching the Blazers' Damon Stoudamire
as the Nets took a surprising lead. But for the first time in a
month, Marbury had a subpar game dishing the ball, finishing with
just four assists. Keith Van Horn followed Marbury with 17 points
but collected just five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Arvydas Sabonis led Portland with 21 points and matched a season
high with 13 rebounds. Rasheed Wallace added 17 points and Steve
Smith, 16.
</P>
<P>
   After shocking their sellout crowd by falling behind at
halftime, 50-43, the Blazers came out for the third quarter as if
offended by the Nets' audacity. Portland's defense, largely passive
over the first two quarters, became a swarm of long, active arms
and legs, and its offense was just as aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Having raised its energy level, Portland regained the lead in
less than three minutes. Damon Stoudamire, who was embarrassed by
Marbury throughout the first half, picked Kerry Kittles off his
dribble at midcourt and sped in for a layup that put the Blazers
up, 51-50, with 9:13 left. But Kittles responded with a quick
3-pointer that put the Nets back on top.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs traded leads for a few minutes, and then Portland
seemed ready to pull away, increasing the margin to 5 points on a
reverse layup by Steve Smith with 2:06 left. But rather than fall
apart, the Nets showed mettle by answering immediately with a
3-pointer by Van Horn. Smith hit two free throws, but in another
display of resilience, Lucious Harris canned a 3-pointer to cut the
deficit to 1, at 69-68. Rasheed Wallace scored the final basket of
the quarter, giving the Blazers a 71-69 lead heading into the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury lugged the Nets on his back through a first period that
could have easily gotten out of hand. With Arvydas Sabonis doing as
he pleased against Jim McIlvaine and Jamie Feick, the Blazers had
complete control midway through the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-3-inch Sabonis looked well on his way to setting
season-highs in both categories. He scored 14 points and grabbed
eight rebounds over the first 12 minutes and gave Portland a
6-point lead three times. With Sabonis in command of the
backboards, the Blazers had an early 14-4 rebounding advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its seeming dominance, Portland could never push the
lead past 6, and the Nets owed their ability to hang around to
Marbury, their dazzling point guard. Marbury made four of six shots
in the first to keep the Nets in contention. All 8 of his points
came over the last six minutes of the quarter, as he recognized the
sluggishness of his teammates and took over the scoring duties. Too
much for the overmatched Stoudamire, he twice cut the Blazers' lead
to 4 points, scoring on a 23-footer and later on a running jumper
from 8 feet.
</P>
<P>
   As if inspired by Marbury's play, the Nets arrived in total for
the second quarter. Down by just 4 points, at 26-22, despite being
outrebounded and outshot, the Nets dominated the second. While
Marbury again led the way with 10 points and two assists, the rest
of the Nets chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn scored 6 of his 10 first-half points, two of them
coming on a swooping finger-roll layup around Rasheed Wallace, and
the other Nets buckled down on defense to force seven Blazers'
turnovers during the quarter. Kendall Gill gave the Nets their
first lead of the quarter on a spinning fast-break layup that
baffled Sabonis, who stood motionless in the lane as Gill whirled
around him, with 9:55 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newman increased the lead to 8 points four minutes later
with consecutive baskets, and with 1:51 left, Marbury pushed the
lead to 13 by hitting two free throws and then a 21-foot jumper.
The Blazers, who pulled within 7 at intermission, left the court a
bit bewildered by their upstart opponent.

2 GREATEST ACTS IN THE UNIVERSE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I was hangin' with the Bangheads on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure if that's what the devoted followers of Dr. Stephen
Hawking call themselves, but they should.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, Mr. Big Bang Theory, has devoted his life to solving
the mystery of how the universe started and where it's headed.
</P>
<P>
   He contracted Lou Gehrig's disease at 21 (he's now 57) and lives
in a wheelchair, his movements confined to twitches of a couple of
fingers. Hooked up to a computer, he uses those twitches to speak
in an electronic voice, and to write.
</P>
<P>
   Footnote: The mechanism that allows the world's smartest man's
thoughts to reach the outside world was created by a company in
Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the Hawk was speaking at the Flint Center in Cupertino,
the 2,500 house was sold out, and from the desperate pleas of the
ticketless outside, you'd think Santana or the Foo Fighters was the
opening act.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about something that a frail, paralyzed man in
a wheelchair has people actually weeping and wailing when they find
out they can't buy a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me what Hawking said. I'm no cosmologist, though I do
style my own hair.
</P>
<P>
   He did say that at the time his disease was diagnosed and he was
given two years to live, he was bored with life. ``The prospect of
an early death concentrated my mind wonderfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Einstein once said, ``The human mind is not capable of grasping
the universe.'' But the 'Stein never met the Hawk.

 GORE, BUSH WIN IN IOWA CAUCUSES  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Vice President Al Gore won a convincing victory
over former senator Bill Bradley while Texas Gov. George W. Bush
survived a surprising showing by publisher Steve Forbes in Monday
night's Iowa caucuses, the official start of the 2000 presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   For Democratic challenger Bradley, who had spent two months and
nearly $2 million in the Hawkeye State, hoping to deliver an ``Iowa
surprise,'' the 35 to 63 percent loss to Gore came as a
disappointment and increased pressure to deliver a strong
performance _ and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Bush's 41 to 30 percent victory over Forbes
was substantially narrower than late polls and top Bush supporters
had predicted. GOP upstart Alan Keyes, who fired up Iowans with his
entreaties for a moral renewal of the nation, came in third with 14
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses culminated months and in some cases years of
campaigning by candidates who hoped a strong showing would validate
their presidential aspirations to a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   But for at least one candidate _ Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who
finished last among Republicans _ the caucuses may spell the end of
the line. Hatch had said he would drop out if he finished fourth or
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now shifts to New Hampshire, where voters go to the
polls next week and both races are too close to call. A convincing
victory by either front-runner could doom rivals' campaigns, though
never before have both winners of the Iowa caucuses gone on to win
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, clearly energized Monday night by what he called ``the
biggest victory in the history of the caucuses,'' promised
supporters, ``We've just begun to fight.'' The vice president,
whose campaign caught fire in Iowa, promised supporters he would
take the battle ``on to New York ... and California.''
</P>
<P>
   But a feisty Bradley also vowed to keep running hard. ``Tonight,
I have a little more humility, but no less confidence that I can
win,'' he told cheering Iowans. Of Gore, Bradley said, ``He's an
opponent that's tough, and I know I'll be seeing a lot of him in
the coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called his 11-point win over Forbes ``a record-shattering
victory,'' telling supporters the first official tally of the
presidential race ``marks the beginning of the end of the Clinton
era.''
</P>
<P>
   But a clearly elated Forbes promised campaign workers that his
battle against Bush was just beginning. ``This is not a good night
for the power brokers in Washington,'' said Forbes. ``Thanks to
you, they've finally met their match.''
</P>
<P>
   Most surprised undoubtedly was Bradley, who spent 60 days and
nearly $2 million in Iowa, more than any Democratic candidate in
history. He nabbed the influential endorsement of the Des Moines
Register, but even as he argued against what he called Gore's
``entrenched power,'' the former New Jersey senator watched his
poll numbers soften as he failed in recent days to beat back
attacks by Gore. He now faces heightened pressure to win _ or at
least come in a close second _ in New Hampshire or face daunting
odds in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's robust showing Monday, combined with his growing lead in
the polls, is likely to provide momentum for his campaign in New
Hampshire, where he has  &LR; pulled ahead in nine polls this week.
Political insiders say Iowa may be remembered as the place where
Gore found his voice and fired up his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now goes to battle against Arizona Sen. John McCain, who
didn't campaign in Iowa, finishing a distant fifth, but who has
waged nonstop war in New Hampshire and leads there in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's lackluster showing in Iowa could potentially have an
impact on the GOP presidential race in New Hampshire. Should
independents' confidence in Bradley begin to collapse, McCain, also
making a play for their vote, could be the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   And Forbes' supporters argued that the Texas governor's showing
in Iowa shows he has work to do among conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined conservative vote here was 55 percent to Bush's
41 percent,'' noted John Herrington, Forbes' California campaign
chair.
</P>
<P>
   For all the candidates, meeting _ or beating _ political
expectations in Iowa sometimes proved a tricky task. They were
forced to beg voters to go to caucuses in deep-freezer
temperatures. Just under 200,000 of the registered voters, less
than 10 percent, went to the homes, schools, and auditoriums to
attend the caucuses. They tended to be older, whiter and more
educated than voters as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush goes on to New Hampshire bolstered as the GOP front-runner,
but clearly rattled on the issue of abortion, thanks to
increasingly scathing attacks by his GOP opponents. Pressed by
reporters, he stepped to the right, claiming his support for a
constitutional amendment to ban abortion and for the anti-abortion
Republican platform.
</P>
<P>
   And in a move that could only serve to underscore his discomfort
on the issue, Bush campaign officials announced that the candidate
would now cut back his regular campaign news conferences because
they are ``not in our best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the campaign, told reporters
Sunday, ``We have a message of the day, and we're going to stick to
it. We're not going to have one big fat news conference on our
schedule when you come and ask about what you think is the news of
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush's chief campaign spokeswoman, Karen Hughes,
insisted that the governor will continue to make his case to
Americans ``on the television and in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Forbes heads into New Hampshire coming off his strong
Iowa showing and bearing a crucial endorsement from the Manchester
Union Leader.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher's big money provided a clear contrast throughout
the campaign in Iowa. He picked up the tab for a televised
half-hour staged ``Town Hall'' meeting _ packed with his own
supporters _ and Iowans were deluged with free T-shirts, hats,
videos, even `flat tax'' cookies at his stops. Monday night, his
staffers offered free rides to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes' blend of social conservatism and supply-side
economics has been slow to catch on in New Hampshire, where many
voters remember with distaste the onslaught of negative ads he ran
against Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley, dogged by questions about health and
flagging momentum, insisted until his last campaign events that he
could deliver a surprise to voters. His impressive staff of 400
campaign volunteers said they reached 150,000 voters by phone _
three and four times, some voters said. He campaigned heavily on
college campuses in the last days, even though caucus voters tend
to be older, nearly half of them 45 and up.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the conservative Keyes, campaigning with a bare-bones
staff and scant funding, who most appeared to electrify Iowans in
the last days of the campaign with fiery oration. He drew 1,000 to
the Val Air Ballroom in West Des Moines on Sunday, appealing to
conservative voters to discard the polls and vote their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of folks around the country who believe in the
message of moral priority that I carry,'' Keyes said Monday night.
``As times goes by, more Americans are going to realize that the
purpose of these elections is to vote our conscience and our
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the conservative commentator who appealed to the
Iowa's Christian right by hammering the issue of abortion, insisted
he would go all the way, despite his fourth-place finish.

 CANDIDATES OUT OF THE CLOSET ON GAY ISSUES  &HT;     By ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until not so long ago, open discussion of gay issues in a
presidential race was unthinkable. It wasn't until Ronald Reagan
was into his second term that he uttered the word ``AIDS'' in
public.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all in the past. This year, the two Democrats are
aggressively courting gay and lesbian voters. And the two
Republican front-runners are at least trying not to offend them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats are pursuing us vigorously, I think the
Republican candidates are trying assiduously to not have to say
anything about us,'' said Virginia Apuzzo, who holds a public
policy chair at the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and served
for two years as assistant to President Clinton for administration
and management.
</P>
<P>
   This new strategy is the result of 30 years of good
old-fashioned political organizing, gay leaders say. And one more
important factor:
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians learned how to count,'' said Apuzzo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, exit polls showed that 5 percent of voters identified
themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual. That's larger than the
Latino vote, at 4.5 percent, and the Jewish vote, at 3.4 percent.
In California and New York, lesbians and gays constitute as much as
9 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   It only makes sense, Apuzzo said, for the candidates to do the
numbers _ and to note that Democrats don't have a lock on gay and
lesbian voters. In fact, in the 1998 midterm elections, a third of
gay and lesbian voters supported Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gay issues are all over the political landscape this year, and
the candidates can't avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that gay and lesbian
couples should be given the same benefits and protections as people
in heterosexual marriages. Shortly before then, President Clinton
admitted that his ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy on gays in the
military isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley both say lesbians and gays
should be able to serve openly in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a gay American can serve openly in the White House, in
Congress, in the courts, in the Treasury Department, why can't they
serve openly in the military? It doesn't make sense,'' Bradley
recently told the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic rivals have met often with gay groups during
the campaign. Both support anti-discrimination laws and equal
benefits. Both say same-sex couples deserve the benefits marriage
bestows. Both oppose California's Proposition 22, a measure on the
March 7 ballot that would ban gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Gore nor Bradley _ nor any other candidate for
president _ believes that the institution of marriage should be
available to gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, gay political veterans like Apuzzo _ who was shut out of
a Democratic platform committee meeting and called an
``embarrassment'' to then-candidate Jimmy Carter in 1976 _ marvel
at what they are hearing from some of the candidates, particularly
the Democrats, competing to become America's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the candidates for the GOP presidential
nomination have been considerably less receptive to gay and lesbian
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain have
taken positions that promise gays nothing _ but at least the two
front-runners aren't attacking gays, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refers to his stance as ``compassionate conservatism,'' but
it was McCain who held out an olive branch. He met with the gay Log
Cabin Republicans and accepted $40,000 in campaign contributions
from them. Bush refused to talk to the group, saying that kind of
chat would create ``a huge political nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain are against gays serving openly in the
armed forces and oppose domestic-partner protections and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   McCain blasted Bradley and Gore for declaring that they would
allow openly gay people in the military without consulting the top
brass, saying it is part of a ``social agenda'' that undermines the
military.
</P>
<P>
   But even Steve Forbes _ who opposes all gay civil rights
measures and whose late father, publisher Malcolm Forbes, was
bisexual _ has been restrained in his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of gay rights, I don't believe we should have special
rights. And also, too, we shouldn't pander and we shouldn't bash,''
Forbes said in a 1998 interview.
</P>
<P>
   But lesbian and gay advocates argue that bashing is exactly what
Forbes and three other Republican candidates did last year when
they signed the Iowa Pledge, a public statement of principles
sponsored by far-right organizations including the Coral Ridge
Ministries and Concerned Women for America.
</P>
<P>
   In the pledge, Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyes
committed themselves to opposing same-sex marriage, gays and
lesbians adopting or foster parenting, the ``promotion of
homosexuality as normative'' in public schools, and the inclusion
of gays in civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Family Research Council, Bauer has made a
career of opposing gay rights. His organization was a primary
sponsor of the national ``Truth in Love'' ad campaign in 1998
asserting that gay people can leave homosexuality through faith and
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a conservative, Washington, D.C., radio personality and
former Reagan staffer, also rails against gays, calling
homosexuality ``an abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Utah senator, Hatch supported including anti-gay hate
crimes in the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, saying no one
should be brutalized because of his or her sexual orientation. But
he's staunchly opposed to laws protecting gays, and he went so far
as to tell Utah Republicans last year that they should be proud
``because we don't have the gays and lesbians with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the progress, Apuzzo and other gay leaders say most
candidates are still out of step with the public. Polls
consistently show that the majority of Americans don't like
discriminating against anyone _ including gays.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, 58 percent of those polled by the Gallup organization
supported gays in the military. Last year, the number increased to
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There remains a disconnect between the American electorate and
the views of a majority of presidential candidates,'' Apuzzo said,
``which is why we remain unable to say we have entered the
political mainstream.''

 CALIFORNIA SCHOOL RANKINGS OUT TUESDAY  &HT;     By NANETTE ASIMOV 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   California announces its first-ever school-by-school rankings
Tuesday, dangling financial rewards to schools for improvements the
way some parents promise a car to kids who earn straight A's.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 other states use money to entice academic progress from
their public schools _ and even among this small club, California's
new system of ranking schools on a scale of 1 to 10 is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to this system is growth,'' said Bill Padia, who runs
the new Academic Performance Index for the state Department of
Education. ``No matter where you are (in the rankings), you can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that even a school with a score of 1 _ the bottom of
the barrel _ could still win as much as $150 per student if it
manages to improve in one year at the rate prescribed under the new
program.
</P>
<P>
   Credentialed teachers and principals working in low-performing
schools that improve on this year's numbers will be eligible for a
one-time bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, who promoted the Academic Performance Index
before the Legislature and the state Board of Education, sees the
new system as a way to improve education from the bottom up.
Delaine Eastin, the state schools chief, called it a ``very
important step for California schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including leaders of the California Teachers
Association, say the new system is flawed for relying on scores
from a multiple-choice test that many believe is not academically
rigorous. Others predict that the high-stakes ranking will give
principals less reason to try to prevent lousy students from
dropping out and will turn classrooms into ``big test-coaching
sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, only the test scores of students enrolled in a
district two years in a row were counted. That means that no scores
for high school freshmen enrolled in one of California's many high
school-only districts were tabulated. Legislation is in the works
to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   For good or ill, the Academic Performance Index marks the first
time California schools will be judged by how much they improve
from year to year, instead of only how well they do compared with
other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it works:
</P>
<P>
   Say your daughter goes to High School X, where scores on the
Stanford 9 achievement test are just under the statewide average.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1999 test scores, your daughter's school receives a
ranking of 4, or just below average.
</P>
<P>
   Now the principal and teachers at High School X _ and you, the
parent _ want to know how to win the extra money. For that, you
need to look at the Academic Performance Index, which is a set of
numbers from 200 to 1,000. They are the raw numbers behind the
1-to-10 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   On the Academic Performance Index, High School X got 555 points,
which is just below the state's median of about 630 points.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Education has decided that 800 represents
excellent performance. So to win the money, schools must improve by
5 percent of the difference between their score and 800 points.
</P>
<P>
   That means the students at High School X have to perform well
enough on the Stanford 9 exam in April to raise their Academic
Performance Index to at least 567 points next year.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all. For the school to win the money, certain
groups of students must also raise their performance by 80 percent
of what the entire school must achieve. The groups are low-income
children, as well as American Indians, Asian Americans, blacks,
Filipino Americans, Latinos, whites and those of Pacific Island
descent. Each of these must show improvements, except those with
too few members to form a representative sample.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Padia said, is to ensure that all students are brought
up to speed _ not just the highest performers.
</P>
<P>
   If money is the carrot, then school closures or takeovers are
the stick _ at least for some schools. About 430 schools will
volunteer each year to subject themselves to a possible takeover in
exchange for a great deal of help trying to improve. Those in the
first group of 430 have already begun developing school-improvement
plans with the help of state-paid consultants. These schools are
also eligible for rewards.
</P>
<P>
   All school rankings are based only on the results of the state's
Stanford 9 achievement test, an exam that does not reflect the
academic standards established by the state Board of Education for
each grade in a variety of subjects. This has led to fears that
teachers will focus more on teaching to the test rather than to the
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The state says that in a few years _ no one is willing to be
specific _ the rankings will also reflect test questions that do
match the academic standards, as well as other measures of school
quality, such as graduation rate and attendance.
</P>
<P>
   But the promise of improvement is not enough to win the support
of the California Teachers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rankings are going to come out, and they are going to
become the bible of schools,'' said Barbara Kerr, the union's vice
president. ``Everyone is going to look at these and believe the
numbers. But we know they are not really accurate and that they
don't reflect schools or achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty Neill, executive director of the Boston firm Fair Test,
which monitors exams for bias and reliability, said that in Texas,
many low-performing students dropped out after the state adopted a
rewards system. Most of the dropouts were black and Latino, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Neill said, ``the test is questionable because it
does not reflect state (academic) standards. But you'll still turn
classrooms into big test-coaching sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastin called the critics ``grump-heads'' and said, ``The Model
T didn't become the Mustang overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a new system that didn't start with some
bugs,'' she said. ``But it's change or die for California schools.
We either make improvements, or we'll be destroyed by those who
would privatize the system and impose vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Academic Performance Index isn't perfect, and it isn't
pretty,'' Eastin said. ``But it's a step in the right direction.''

   Holding what looks like a giant eyedropper, Brian Hefner
carefully releases tiny drops of an unidentified drug onto a
wafer-thin glass plate coated with silica gel.
</P>
<P>
   The associate chemist at Midwest Research Institute studies the
plate in search of tiny bands that indicate impurities in the clear
drug solution. The painstaking task is part of what it takes to
determine whether drugs will retain their viability until it is
time for patients to take them.
</P>
<P>
   The results will be forwarded to the pharmaceutical company that
has contracted with Midwest Research Institute to do the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm doing something worthwhile,'' Hefner said. ``I
don't know what the drugs are, but I'd like to think they'll help
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner is one of hundreds of scientists and engineers at Midwest
Research Institute who work on a wide variety of applied research

low profile to guard their work and protect their clients.
</P>
<P>
   But today, with a new senior officer, MRI is pursuing more
contracts with private business and is joining in a communitywide
effort to make Kansas City a top national center for biomedical
research.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish those goals, Midwest Research Institute wants to
boost its community profile and link up with other organizations
that do research, including the Stowers Institute for Medical
Research that's due to start work late this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is awakening to the fact that if you work
together, you can build your technology base and make a gain,''
said James L. Spigarelli, who became MRI's president and chief
executive officer in December. ``I think we can help lure other
high-tech companies to Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, area institutions can attract more federal research
money to Kansas City if they work together, Spigarelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic development officials applaud MRI's new stance, which
comes at a time when a life sciences task force has recommended
that the Kansas City area raise $300 million for communitywide
research and development over 10 years. Meeting that goal may be
viewed as the city's answer to recent losses of corporate and
organizational headquarters, task force members say.
</P>
<P>
   ``MRI's participation, and more importantly their leadership, is
crucial to our success'' said Bob Marcusse, chief executive of the
Kansas City Area Development Council.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Research Institute is not a household name among many
Kansas Citians, but it has drawn the attention of the city's
business and civic leadership since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Nichols, developer of the Country Club Plaza, was a founder
of the institute, which was launched in 1944. It was a time when
thousands of Kansas City workers earned good pay at area defense
plants. Nichols and other local leaders wanted to build an economic
development engine that would keep running after the Allied
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's charter emphasized regional development through
science, which at that time was a new direction for such
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's mission attracted national attention. President
Harry S. Truman, who served on MRI's board of trustees, wrote in a
1947 telegram that ``there must be no retrogression in the march
forward of the Midwest Research Institute in its determination to
develop the resources of the midwestern states.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the organization's first homes was a picturesque 19th
century building that formerly housed Westport's city hall and fire
station.
</P>
<P>
   Early development successes at the institute included palatable
instant coffee. MRI also perfected the application process for the
coating on M&AMP;M's candies.
</P>
<P>
   Government projects in MRI's early years involved work on
aircraft stability, high-frequency electronics and recoilless
rifles. More recent government work has included work on hazardous
waste disposal, the causes of Gulf War Syndrome and studies related
to the Agent Orange defoliant.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit institute attained financial viability in the
1950s and established itself in new quarters on Volker Boulevard,
in an area now known as the Brush Creek corridor. There it remains,
a beehive of laboratories populated by white-coated scientists and
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   MRI takes in about $50 million in annual revenues and has about
1,400 employees, including about 400 in Kansas City. Approximately
900 employees work at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in
Golden, Colo., which the institute has managed since 1977 for the
U.S. Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Spigarelli said government work still accounts for about 70
percent of the institute's portfolio, but the trend has been toward
more work for business and industry. The change is partly due to
less federal research funding, but the primary factor is global
competition in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the mergers in the pharmaceutical industry, it's
in order to get more resources to do more research, to discover
more products,'' he said. ``The drug discovery process needs to be
made more efficient in order to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where MRI comes in, working with pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Aurora Biosciences Inc. For the past two
years, MRI has helped the San Diego-based company build machines
that test the effectiveness of chemical compounds in battling
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Stylli, Aurora's senior vice president of commercial
development, said MRI has a ``breadth of capabilities that we
leveraged to help achieve our goals. They brought to bear
automation expertise, and they had an understanding of the
biological applications. That makes the going easier.''

<P>
   Peter Connors, the Lee's Summit company's director of business
development, said the partnership with MRI has helped his company
more than double its level of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our being affiliated with them, with their reputation, has
brought us along,'' Connors said.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported in November that MRI and the University of
Kansas had formed an alliance to promote joint research projects
and other collaborative efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the words partnership and alliance are virtual mantras
in the offices of MRI today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can tell the community of our value, and we can work
together and we know what our neighbor is doing, we can have a lot
more impact for our institution and for the community,'' Spigarelli
said.
</P>
<P>
   Research work in the Kansas City area has received heightened
attention in recent months from the Stowers Institutefor Medical
Research, which was founded by mutual fund executive James E.
Stowers Jr. and his wife, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowers Institute, which is being built on the site of the
old Menorah Medical Center at 4949 Rockhill Road, will do research
into some of the fundamental questions of the life sciences.
</P>
<P>
   David Welte, general counsel for the Stowers Institute, said
Stowers wants to form a partnership with MRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an excellent organization,'' Welte said. ``They have a
lot of scientific instrumentation there that is of the type that
will be used by the Stowers Institute.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcusse of the Area Development Council said Spigarelli
recently pitched in on a mission to recruit a high-tech company to
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely helpful in speaking the language of the
client and helping them understand the resources of Kansas City
that were available to them,'' Marcusse said.
</P>
<P>
   Spigarelli wants everyone one to know that one of those
resources is Midwest Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, work continues back at MRI. Mathi Prakasam, the
institute's principal adviser for engineering, spends most of his
days there working on thermoelectric cooling projects. MRI's work
in this area has included the development of more efficient cooling
systems for use in space shuttles and by private industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very exciting and promising technology that can find
more and more applications in the future,'' Prakasam said.

TRUMAN MEDICAL CENTER SETTLES MEDICAID CASE 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office said Monday that it had reached a
settlement with Truman Medical Center and a related company in a
case involving allegations of substandard prenatal care to poor
women and billings to the government for services that never were
provided.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which received final approval Monday afternoon
from U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert E. Larsen, requires Truman and
Hospital Hill Health Services Corp. to pay the federal government
$330,000.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants also agreed to correct the hospital's Medicaid
billing procedures and improve its quality of service.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action represents the second time in less than a year
that the two defendants settled allegations of health-care fraud.
Last March, Truman and the Hospital Hill group agreed to pay the
federal government $242,500 to settle allegations of Medicare
fraud. That settlement involved allegations of fraudulent billings
for tests performed on elderly and low-income patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very satisfied by the terms of this agreement, which we
believe provides not just a fair resolution of the legal
allegations, but also a guided path toward meaningful improvement
in the way TMC treats low-income women and their children in this
community,'' said Stephen L. Hill Jr., U.S. attorney for the
Western District of Missouri, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The government presented its case in a civil suit filed last May
against Truman, which serves as Kansas City's and Jackson County's
public hospital system. The other defendant, Hospital Hill Health
Services Corp., is a nonprofit company that hires the hospital's
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleged that Truman and the Hospital Hill group
requested and received reimbursement from Medicaid for prenatal
care that was not provided to low-income mothers or that was
provided but should have been paid at much lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The government also alleged that the defendants billed Medicaid
for delivery services that purportedly were performed by
Medicaid-approved physicians, when the deliveries were performed by
medical students, nurses or others not eligible under Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. attorney's office, Truman and the Hospital
Hill group admitted that in each of the 200 claims covered by the
lawsuit, the physician listed on the billing form was not the
physician who performed the service.
</P>
<P>
   Truman and the Hospital Hill group otherwise denied the
allegations of the government's complaint, the U.S. attorney's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   Truman Medical Center said in a news release that while it and
the Hospital Hill group ``deny any violation of the law,'' they had
agreed to the $330,000 settlement and to enact a ``quality
improvement program designed to further improve obstetrical care at
TMC. The settlement reflects a strong desire of all parties to
settle the dispute and get on with the business of providing
high-quality health care for all _ regardless of ability to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the quality improvement program, Truman and the
Hospital Hill group must enhance the staffing of doctors and nurses
who provide care to pregnant women and newborns.

DEMOCRATS IN IOWA GIVE BRADLEY A SETBACK  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE and RICK MONTGOMERY   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ He had his game face on, but Bill Bradley was
clearly disappointed Monday night by Vice President Al Gore's
nearly 2-to-1 victory in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an opponent who is tough, and I know I'll be seeing a
lot of him in the coming weeks,'' Bradley said in a speech to
supporters. ``Tonight I have a little more humility, but no less
confidence that I can win and do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   For the former senator from New Jersey, the question now is
whether he can protect his lead in New Hampshire, where the
nation's first primary will be held a week from today.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Bradley told supporters, ``What I'm trying to do
takes time. I'm trying to do politics in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, citing his agenda of improving access to health care,
hiring more teachers and registering all handguns, he said, ``These
are fundamental changes that will improve the lives of millions of
Americans, and that takes time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll move on from Iowa and continue the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Gore, boosted by his 63 percent tally, gave a
rousing victory speech. With a hand-held microphone, he paced a
stage after he was introduced by his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is very simple,'' he said. ``We've just begun to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president called Bradley a good person and a tough
competitor. He took aim at two of his potential general-election
rivals, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Steve Forbes, and said their
``risky tax giveaways'' would be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his campaign staff were preparing to leave Iowa shortly
after midnight and arrive in New Hampshire about 3 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the crack of dawn, I'm going to hit the ground running,''
he said. ``I don't think there's such a thing as a bounce'' from
the Iowa win in New Hampshire. ``That race must be won on its own
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had said that in Iowa he would be satisfied with a 31
percent tally. Although he ended up with more, 35 percent,
reporters have begun asking if he will drop out if he loses in New
Hampshire. He has led in the polls there for months.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's response: He'll stay in the race at least through
``Titanic Tuesday'' on March 7 when some of the nation's biggest
states, including New York and California, hold primaries.
Bradley's native Missouri also will conduct its primary that day.
</P>
<P>
   New York looms as a key battleground because Bradley is counting
on a triumph in the state where he played on two championship teams
with the NBA's Knicks in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University in
Des Moines, said that if Bradley loses Iowa and New Hampshire and
then New York, ``the corpse may keep twitching, but it's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Bradley outspent Gore heavily. He also invested more
time here than Gore did _ time that cost him the opportunity to
campaign in other crucial states.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's loss also raises doubts about whether a low-key
candidate who has insisted on running a positive campaign can
overcome a fierce competitor like Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``His natural low-key style is not suited to a comeback
effort,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to go after Gore,'' Buchanan said, ``and he has good
reason to, including Gore's electability problems in the fall
against Bush,'' who stands firmly as the GOP front-runner following
his victory Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would face fierce criticism from Republicans, Buchanan
said, ``for his involvement in questionable fund-raising practices
in the 1996 campaign and for his Impeachment Day proclamation that
Bill Clinton ranks as one of the nation's greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Reveling in the Iowa victory Monday, Gore's backers ignored
those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who campaigned exhaustively for Gore, said
it was the largest margin of victory in a contested caucus race in
the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Crawford, a Des Moines lawyer, said, ``I don't care what
the expectations were, (the outcome) is a drubbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore often joked that the primary battle against Bradley had
made him a better candidate _ and he was right, his backers said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Iowa attorney Tom Miller: ``He saw the challenge, and that
competitive spirit of his just kicked in....I don't think he'll be
shifting back into vice presidential mode'' even if Bradley drops
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, a St. Louis Democrat and Gore supporter,
said the vice president showed a remarkable ability to turn himself
around. Only a few months ago, many Democrats had been counting him
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking about issues that people care about,'' Gephardt
said. ``I think he's doing a much better job.''
</P>
<P>
   By proclaiming himself a fighter for the working person, Gore
was able to contrast himself with Bradley's laid-back demeanor. By
appropriating some of Bradley's own rhetoric in TV ads about
expanding health care coverage at a time of national prosperity,
Gore was able to loosen Bradley's grip on that pivotal issue.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore also made skillful use of Bradley's comment that Iowa
is a ``state that rewards entrenched power.'' Gore made the comment
sound as if Bradley was suggesting that Iowans can't think for
themselves.

BUSH RACKS UP RECORD 41 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON and OSCAR AVILA   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush won the first
real-voter test of the 2000 dash to the Republican presidential
nomination Monday, as the other candidates scrapped over the
party's right wing in Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the field bashed the big-money, big-state governor
in the weeks leading up to the caucuses as a symbol of the monied
political establishment and for refusing to guarantee his vice
president would oppose abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hawkeye State's voters responded to his ``compassionate
conservatism'' campaign by giving him 41 percent of the vote, with
97 percent of precincts reporting. That total marked the type of
win that, at least traditionally, translates to improved prospects
for next-up New Hampshire and the avalanche of primaries in early
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long way to go,'' Bush said. ``I know this is just
the beginning. We have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire magazine publisher Steve Forbes, meantime,
fashioned a strong second place at 30.5 percent. That showing came
after weeks of ubiquitous advertising _ much of it labeling Bush a
tax-raiser _ combined with a precinct-by-precinct organization that
experts say topped anything the state had seen.
</P>
<P>
   And Alan Keyes, a one-time diplomat and radio show host, used
his fiery anti-abortion speeches and a cable television blitz _
``stop the killing, vote your conscience'' _ to finish far better
in the caucuses than he has in any poll. Keyes has repeatedly
spoken of polls, which never showed him at better than 9 percent,
as a tool manipulated to block outsiders from success in politics.
He took 14.3 percent in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said he could explain his gain in two words, ``Almighty
God.'' He led supporters in a prayer of thanks for the vote total.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we come in first, second, third or last, so long as we
walk the path that God wants us to walk,'' Keyes said, ``we will
win a victory every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona holds second place behind Bush in
most national polls. But he essentially wrote off Iowa, coming to
the state in recent months only for nationally televised debates.
The little-to-lose strategy left him out of the money, with just
about 5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The low-budget campaigns of conservative activist Gary Bauer and
Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch lived down to low expectations, garnering 8.5
and 1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bauer insisted before Monday's caucuses no result would
elbow him from the race, the Associated Press said he later
expressed deep disappointment. He would assess the future of his
candidacy, he told supporters, but would forge on to New Hampshire.
``I wasn't raised to be a quitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who drew fewer than 900 votes, has said he might
reconsider the race if he did poorly. Monday night he promised a
``more complete statement'' from Washington today.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's win catapults him ahead to New Hampshire's primary next
week, with his lead more than just a creation of the polls and
fund-raising. His plurality was greater than any other in any
previous multi-candidate race to run through Iowa, although his
margin over Forbes was narrower than polls had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush supporter who came from Texas to Des Moines for caucus
night said his man scored a clear win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that expectations would be so high that even a
good win wouldn't be considered a success,'' said Jim Jackson, a
Dallas County commissioner. ``It seems to me that tonight was a
success.''
</P>
<P>
   A jubilant Forbes, who has pushed to stop abortion and institute
a lower and more uniform tax rate, characterized his second-place
finish as a blow to the political status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good night for the power brokers of Washington,
D.C. Thanks to you,'' he told a room of giddy supporters, ``they
have finally met their match and they will get their ultimate
comeupance in the days and weeks ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   He later characterized the coming primary battles as ``a
conservative versus two moderates,'' that is Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said Bush can not articulate conservative values, and that
Forbes was getting by mostly on an overwhelming amount of campaign
cash. Keyes said he would stay in the race until the primaries are
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pockets may not be filled with lucre, but our hearts are
filled with faith. We will prevail,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   While many candidates have won Iowa and folded up their
campaigns before spring's end, winning in Iowa usually improves the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush winning here in Iowa means he can close the deal by
dispensing with McCain in New Hampshire,'' said Rich Galen, a
Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Steffen Schmidt, an Iowa State University professor, said that
while in past years religious conservatives rallied behind Pat
Robertson and Pat Buchanan, this year their approach has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some Christian conservatives say they don't want to
back somebody who's just going to lose and then go on the lecture
circuit,'' Schmidt said. ``They became pragmatic this time and said
Bush is close enough to their beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   In New England, the Associated Press said McCain was declaring
himself ready for the next phase. ``We are in for a history-making
seven days,'' he told supporters. ``We really can do this.''

   SIDON _ The night before he set off on his doomed mission to
attack the Russian embassy in Beirut, Ahmed abou Kharoub walked
into his brother's home and asked to watch the news on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed he only really paid attention when the news from
Chechnya came on,'' Salam abou Khaled says in the damp old hut in
which he lives at the edge of Sidon's Ein el-Helwe Palestinian
refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he sat still and watched the film of the Russian
bombardment on Grozny. I felt he was taking a greater interest than
usual.``
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Ahmed abou Kharoub would be lying dead in a Beirut
apartment building with twenty bullet holes in his body, a dead
traffic cop on a street corner and the staff of the Russian embassy
cowering in terror beneath their desks. ``I am doing this for
Grozny,'' a letter on his body announced.
</P>
<P>
   Salam abou Khaled is almost sightless _ his eyes have been
diseased for more than a decade _ and he stares above my head as he
speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before all this happened,'' Salam says, ``Ahmed talked
constantly about martyrdom and dying for God's cause. You know we
Arabs talk a lot about fighting and `holy wars' and I thought that
when Ahmed said these things it was just talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last night, I suggested we went (sic) to Nabatea to break
the Ramadan fast with our family but he said he had flu symptoms.
Then he went home, just like normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, on Jan. 3, the 31-year-old electrical
technician kissed his children on the cheek _ something he never
did at that time of day _ and said goodbye to his young wife,
Khairiyeh. He left home in civilian clothes, chatting to a neighbor
on the way up the muddy camp street outside his home. The family
think he caught a bus to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   It was at midday that Salam realized something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was late waking up and I heard Khairiyeh making a lot of
noise and I thought she was playing with the children. But when I
listened more carefully, I heard she was screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went next door because I thought she had gone crazy and she
just said to me `Ahmed is dead _ he's just attacked the Russian
embassy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just talked to her on the phone and when I asked how
Khairiyeh knew he was dead, she said: `I heard the shooting at the
other end of the telephone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed abou Kharoub had already fired his rocket-propelled
grenades into the embassy and was now being cornered in an
apartment building by hundreds of armed Lebanese policemen as he
spoke down the phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Khairiyeh told her brother-in law that the dying man said to
her: ``Look after the children and let me speak to my son
Abdullah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems,'' Salam says, ``that he did talk to Abdullah but the
boy now doesn't remember what his father said to him. Abdullah is
the eldest child. He is seven.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did a 31-year-old Palestinian _ who because he was born
in a village that once belonged to Lebanon could have claimed
Lebanese nationality had he wished _ leave his wife and children to
die, pointlessly and alone, in a suicide attack on the Russians in
Beirut?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us Muslims have conviction but there are differences in
how we understand the world,'' Salam says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that we leave one wife and God promises us 40 in
heaven. This is a factor that motivates people _ not to think about
those they leave behind, including their wives, children and
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why, at the moment of death, did Ahmed abou Kharoub call
his wife? Salam smiles and shakes his head. ``Yes, why? And I am
still asking myself this question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since these convictions motivated him to `jihad' (holy war)
and he could, he thought, see eternity and heaven, what brought him
back to the domain of this world, to his present wife and children?
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the real world tug at him? Or was his conversation with
his wife on the phone part of writing a last testament? If he was
giving her his will, telling her to look after his children, it
would not be against his convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Abou Kharoub was one of five brothers and was always ``the
most religiously minded,'' as Salam puts it, attending mosque for
prayers five times a day, seeing all the earth as God's land
corrupted by man's frontiers and border posts.
</P>
<P>
   Beaten and tortured by Amal gunmen during the Lebanese war, the
would-be martyr became obsessed with attacks on Muslims in Bosnia
and Kosovo and then Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been to Sarajevo before the war and told him the people
there were secular,'' Salam says. ``I told him that things other
than religion were at stake in Chechnya _ oil and gas, for example.
But he didn't see things like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to keep him away from the religious organizations but
this was the way he wanted to follow and in the mosques they always
talked about the big conflicts as attacks on Muslims, nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the preachers failed to mention Kosovo in the Sidon
mosques, he attacked them and demanded that they talk about the
Albanian Muslims being killed by the Serbs.'' &QL;

   DENPASAR, INDONESIA _ Almost always it happens at night, when
the watch is dozing and visibility is poor. The first sign might be
the muffled buzz of an outboard motor, or the sound of grappling
hooks on a ship's rails. By the time the alarm is raised, it is too
late.
</P>
<P>
   A band of men, armed with guns and machetes, are already on
board, tying up the captain and going through his cargo.
</P>
<P>
   If the crew are lucky, the strangers will take what they want
and flee. If not, they will seize the ship, and cast its sailors
adrift in leaky boats. And more than once in the last few years,
they have gone further still, executing entire crews, and dumping
their bodies into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates, commonly regarded as the stuff of black-and-white
movies and children's stories, are more active than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Monday by the International Maritime Bureau's
Piracy Reporting Center in Malaysia revealed that pirate attacks
increased by 40 percent last year, and two thirds of them took
place in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Economic crisis, corruption, ever-larger volumes of shipping,
and weak maritime policing have made Southeast Asia the pirate
center of the world.
</P>
<P>
   As Lua Cheng Eng, of the Asian Shipowners' Forum, says: ``Piracy
is arguably the single greatest menace to modern shipping today.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical 21st-century buccaneer is not a one-legged parrot
fancier, but a young Indonesian working for a well-organized
international syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Of the record 285 acts of piracy recorded last year, 113 took
place in Indonesian waters, and a further 31 in neighboring
Malaysia or in the strait which divides Singapore from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent big case was that of the Alondra Rainbow, a
9,000-ton ship carrying a cargo of aluminium ingots worth more than
$8 million U.S. dollars. After leaving the Indonesian port of Kuala
Tanjung en route for Japan it was boarded by ten men armed with
swords and pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to many maritime hijacks, the tale of the Alondra
Rainbow had a relatively happy ending. The crew of 17 Japanese and
Filipinos were bound, blindfolded and cast adrift on a rubber life
raft in which they drifted for 11 days before being picked up by
Thai fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian pirates were captured a month later off Goa. But
the 9,000-ton ship, and its $10 million cargo of aluminium ingots
has evaporated, almost certainly in the country notorious for its
tolerance of suspicious ships and their cargoes, China.
</P>
<P>
   The numerous anchorages in southern China, along with the
corruption of its customs officials, and the lackadaisical attitude
of its courts, have made it the favored destination for marine
hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   In a notorious case in 1998, an oil tanker, the Petro-Ranger,
was seized by a dozen pirates who kidnapped its crew and siphoned
off their cargo into two other tankers.
</P>
<P>
   After a Chinese patrol boat intercepted the tanker, the crew and
its Australian captain found themselves detained for a month on
Hainan Island, while the pirates were sent home to Indonesia, scot
free.
</P>
<P>
   Less lucky were the 13 hijackers of the MV Cheung Son, who posed
as Chinese police and boarded the ship just outside Hong Kong
waters. The bodies of some of the 23 crewmen were found by
fishermen, gagged, bullet-ridden and tied with weights.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates, all Chinese but for one Indonesian, were all
sentenced to death last month.
</P>
<P>
   But even when such murderers are brought to justice, no one is
under the illusion that they are the men ultimately responsible for
the pirating industry _ shadowy figures with ready capital and
well-oiled organizations capable of re-registering stolen ships and
quickly selling on their cargoes. &QL;

<P>
   A new restaurant in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, themed on
famous prisons from around the world and featuring artifacts from
and pictures of the Nazi death camps has caused outrage among
Jewish and German groups.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons of ``Jail'' can order stir-fried clams and other local
delicacies while the emaciated faces of Jews incarcerated in
Auschwitz, Dachau and other concentration camps stare out from
black-and-white framed photographs on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   A huge wooden sign over the door leading to the toilets is
carved with the words ``Gas chamber.'' As if to ram the point home
a huge gas cylinder dating from the period is displayed prominently
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The 192-seat restaurant is not entirely dedicated to the
Holocaust but nor is this the first time a Taiwanese venture has
chosen to exploit Germany's Nazi past in what many would view as a
tasteless and offensive way.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a company importing German-made electric heaters
caused an international outcry when its advertisements depicting
cartoon pictures of Adolf Hitler began to appear on billboards
around Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Nazi symbols have been used to market other products from
athletic training shoes to motorcycle helmets.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is all the more shocking to foreigners because
many Taiwanese have travelled or studied in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
   The new restaurant is part owned by Jacky Wu, a Taiwanese
television comedian who insists it never occurred to him that
diners or anybody else might be offended by the insensitive
juxtaposition.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the restaurant was quoted as saying that the
history of the Nazis simply did not strike the same chord in Taiwan
as in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwanese just aren't that aware of this history and aren't as
sensitive about it as foreigners are,'' said Stone Cheng.
</P>
<P>
   He said Taiwanese people were more aware of the atrocities
committed by Japanese soldiers in Taiwan and other parts of China
during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   A director of the German trade office in Taipei said he was
shocked. ``We deplore this kind of business'' said Hilmar Kaht.
``If such things happened in Germany, they would be banned
immediately.'' &QL;

<P>
   The campaign for the American presidency is a paradox.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000 as in 1996, 1992 and every other election since the
Second World War, foreign policy scarcely registers as an issue.
But in foreign affairs, far more than at home in the United States,
the man in the White House can change things.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments rage between Republicans George W. Bush and John
McCain, between Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley, on tax, health
care, campaign-finance reform and the like _ ignoring the fact
that, in shaping his country's domestic policy, an American
president is constitutionally one of the weaker heads of government
in the West.
</P>
<P>
   He may have what Teddy Roosevelt called the ``power of the bully
pulpit.'' But he lacks the authority that accrues to a British
prime minister or a German chancellor by dint of a majority in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as with President Bill Clinton, he does not even have
a majority in Congress. More important, the legislature is a
separate branch of the Constitution, conceived as a check and
balance on the executive.
</P>
<P>
   But if it makes little difference in Des Moines or Albuquerque,
the identity of a U.S. leader matters enormously in Jerusalem,
Berlin, Moscow and Peking.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Clinton may be the lamest of ducks. But abroad he still
has latitude and power to act. He remains, incontestably, the most
powerful man in the world, and not merely because his finger is on
the nuclear button.
</P>
<P>
   Entering his final 12 months in the White House, Clinton may yet
nudge Israel and Syria into a deal on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   His influence has been central to the revival of the Northern
Ireland peace process. By reappointing Alan Greenspan as chairman
of the Federal Reserve, he has reassured markets everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   This summer he will take another decision, on a national missile
defense system, that will crucially influence relations with Moscow
and Peking.
</P>
<P>
   All that from a man who in domestic terms is history. For a new
president, with the prospect of eight years in office ahead of him,
the scope is huge.
</P>
<P>
   From Iraq to Serbia, from the future of NATO to hopes of a new
trade round, world affairs march to Washington's tune.
</P>
<P>
   The policies are the president's, devised with his national
security staff, the State Department, the Pentagon, the Treasury
and the Commerce Department. Though he will consult trusted
Congressional leaders, they cannot stay his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond a Boston reporter's ambush on George Bush, Jr.,
revealing the Republican front-runner's difficulty in naming the
leaders of India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan, the problems
beyond the shores of a contented and complacent America have not
featured this primary season.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the policies of the four main contenders are
little different from those of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The next president will do nothing to rock the financial boat.
All are internationalist rather than isolationist, supporting U.S.
engagement abroad. But engagement where and how? As usual, the
world has heard few answers. &QL;

   PARK CITY, UTAH _ When Mika Salmi went to the Sundance Film
Festival last year to advertise his modest new Internet company,
atomfilms.com, all he brought with him from his shoebox-sized
office in Seattle was a backpack stuffed with leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   This year is a very different story.
</P>
<P>
   He has 10 staff members with him, a roster of 600 films to show
off, a battle bus-cum-mobile screening facility doing the rounds of
Park City, the ski resort hosting the festival, and tens of
millions of dollars in capital investment with which to make new
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The computer geeks have come to town, and film festivals may
never be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Having been no more than a marginal curiosity at previous
festivals, Internet companies have flooded into Sundance this year
and discovered _ to their delight and everyone else's slight
consternation _ that they are the stars of the show.
</P>
<P>
   They are screening films, buying films, and hosting seminars on
how to make films.
</P>
<P>
   One company, ShowBizData, is even hosting online ``pitch''
sessions, in which filmmakers can send a short video through
cyberspace to a panel of industry development executives.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the presence of the brand-new generation of cinematic
dot.coms, with their promise of an instant showcase for easily
downloadable live action or animated features, the number of short
films submitted for official inclusion in the festival has
skyrocketed this year to a record 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Only 65 were selected by Sundance's organizers, but no matter.
What the festival won't absorb, the Internet always can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is looking to this field,'' said Andrew Hindes of the
San Francisco-based iFilm, one of the first Web sites to offer an
unrestricted haven for young filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios might see the Internet as just another outlet for
their product, but looking at all these 25-year-old millionaires
running around, Hollywood suddenly seems pretty dinosaurish.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the atmosphere at Sundance, by tradition a cozy 10 days
in the mountains for the in-crowd of the American independent film
sector, has been transformed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Film is dead!'' pronounces an ominous sticker attached to a
parking meter on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   The fine print reveals the name of yet another Web site,
filmisdead.com, but the point is made: in a world where, thanks to
digital technology, anybody with a spare $10,000 can make a movie
and distribute it online, the film industry is in for a few
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The Net-heads, it turns out, are rather far from the earnest,
socially awkward stereotype. Many of them, in fact, worked in
conventional entertainment companies before making the switch _ in
some cases as recently as a few weeks ago _ to take advantage of
the burgeoning revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are here to meet the filmmakers and to network; after
all, if it weren't for the need for human contact, they could have
stayed in cyberspace and talked to each other there.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is one thing the Internet companies have learned
from the ferocious competition that exists between themselves, it
is that attention-grabbing publicity stunts are the best way of
forging ahead. Hence the number of eye-catching, often startling
film titles being touted around.
</P>
<P>
   Atomfilms, notoriously, has one called ``Micro Gerbil 2001,'' an
interactive cartoon in which a gerbil ends up being fried in a
microwave, and another entitled, somewhat cumbersomely, ``I Killed
My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her On A Meathook, And Now I Have A
Three-Picture Deal With Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   Ifilm has one called ``Black People Hate Me And They Hate My
Glasses Too.'' MediaTrip.com has one of many spoofs in circulation
entitled ``George Lucas In Love,'' a brief explanation of how the
creator of ``Star Wars'' suffered from terrible writer's block
until a Princess Leia-like woman unlocked his heart and his
creative spirit. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the films themselves that are generating
gossip. Atomfilms has decked out the back of its hospitality bus
with a double bed draped in leopard-skin covers. (This is where
Salmi and his colleagues are conducting interviews and meetings
with filmmakers.)
</P>
<P>
   The company has also sponsored a free trip to the festival for
its users, which it has dubbed the ``cheap bastards' trip to
Sundance.''
</P>
<P>
   ShowBizData, meanwhile, has rented out a nightclub and turned it
into a computer game arcade as well as a showcase for new media. At
night the computers are switched off and the dancing begins _ or a
weird approximation of dancing that, to judge by the opening night
of the festival at least, appeared to confirm certain stereotypes
about the social skills of computer nerds. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quite what all this adds up to is less than clear. Mika Salmi
talks about the ``digital watercooler'' effect _ in other words,
creating a market in which office workers can choose to use their
breaks to download and watch shorts off a film Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Others talk enthusiastically about the possibilities of getting
short films out to a wide audience for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do people need to trek to an arthouse cinema or a film
festival; they can watch online, and if they like what they see
they can e-mail it to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the films are modest in both length and
quality. The real moment of truth will be the ``big bang,'' the
point expected in the next decade or so when enough users have
sufficiently high-speed Internet links to be able to download
full-length feature films and other video material with speed and
ease.
</P>
<P>
   What that transformation will do to the industry is anybody's
guess. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the meantime, there is clearly a strong affinity between the
fledgling Internet companies and the independents who have made
Sundance their own over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all celebrate the filmmaker and the film, not the purely
commercial aspect of the business,'' said Salmi. ``We're all going
against the Hollywood grain.''
</P>
<P>
   As another company, Tranz-Send, recalls, Orson Welles once
described filmmaking as ``the best toy train set a kid ever had.''
The Internet only makes that train set seem all the more
beguiling. &QL;

<P>
   Couples who had two or more live-in relationships before they
settled down to have a baby are nearly three times more likely to
split up before the child is two than those who have cohabited only
once before.
</P>
<P>
   A study in The Journal of Family Psychology shows the likelihood
of new parents parting can also be assessed by the way the couple
manage conflict and disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   Academics examining marriage and relationships said the high
breakup rate after a baby was born reflected an increasingly casual
attitude towards commitment as well as an inability or lack of
desire to sustain intimate and trusting relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry in London, and the
University of Bristol, followed the lives of nearly 10,000 women
aged 16 to 40 from the West of England who had a baby in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Couples who had more than two previous relationships were 2.7
times more likely to break up within two years of the birth than
those who had never cohabited or had lived with only one person
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more live-in relationships people had before having a
child, the more likely they were to split up within 21 months of
the birth,'' said Dr. Thomas O'Connor, a lecturer in developmental
psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry and co-author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the more relationships someone has the lower the
threshold they have about disbanding it,'' he added. ``But it could
also indicate somebody has an irritable personality and has
difficulty in maintaining intimate personal relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The research also showed the type of family made a large
difference. Forty percent of couples who had their first child
together, but also lived with children from previous relationships,
were not together 21 months after the birth, compared with only 5
percent of families where everyone was related to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Stepmother families, where the new mother also lived with her
partner's children, were the least likely to stay together, 57
percent, compared with 81 percent for stepfather families and 95
percent for biological families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming increasingly normal for couples to live
together in their twenties or early thirties and many people have
lived with one person prior to having a relationship where they
might choose to have children,'' said Dr. Janet Reibstein, an
expert on relationships, and author of ``Families through
Divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But having two or more live-in relationships before having a
family is a lot and shows a disregard for the great commitment of
choosing to live and build a home together.'' &QL;

   MINGO, IOWA _ It is a perfect winter's morning _ the sun
sparkling off the snowy fields, the sky a perfect blue with just a
brush stroke of cloud across the horizon. Out in the woods, the
deer are scudding through the snow, and two red-tailed hawks are
circling lazily through the oak and hickory trees.
</P>
<P>
   But John Parsons has no time to watch the wildlife today. He is
clearing the snow from his drive in his bright green John Deere
tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight (Monday), Parsons and his wife, Jenifer, will welcome a
dozen or so of their neighbors to help choose the next president of
the United States in the first electoral event of the 2000
election.

   DES MOINES _ When Bill Bradley admitted last week that he had
experienced recurrences of a heart problem, the contender for the
Democratic presidential nomination sought to minimize it, blaming
the irregular heartbeat on too many cream sodas.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Bradley, as the electoral season opens,
has bigger issues to deal with. Like those sodas, his campaign _
which once seemed so refreshing and fizzy _ is now a little flat.
</P>
<P>
   The medical questions have only added to his problems _
ironically, given that the one thing every Democrat could agree on
was that Bradley's heart was in the right place.

   DES MOINES - George W. Bush, the leading Republican candidate
for U.S. president, has built his political career on donations
from a small group of wealthy corporate donors, a new report
alleges.

received $3 million from just 100 wealthy businessmen and women for
his Texas Governor's campaigns in 1994 and 1998.

   DES MOINES _ Al Gore and George W. Bush, the front-runners for
the Democrat and Republican nominations for U.S. president, both go
into today's (Monday's) Iowa caucuses as the favorites to win.
</P>
<P>
   The first event of the U.S. electoral season will see thousands
of voters trooping along to fire stations, community halls,
churches, schools and each others' houses tonight (Monday) to vote
for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But the results are sometimes hard to interpret or measure; the
significance, in a state that is hardly representative of America
in the 21st century, is uncertain in the broader context.

   WASHINGTON _ Just 12 years ago, a certain U.S. senator by the
name of Al Gore dismissed the presidential selection process that
takes place in the Midwestern state of Iowa this evening (Monday)
as ``an arcane procedure that produces crazy results.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, he said of the small local gatherings known as the Iowa
caucuses, ``a ridiculous test'' and he ignored the whole charade,
proceeding directly to what he then regarded as the more sane and
sensible primary election in the Northeastern state of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it need hardly be said, Gore has rethought his view of
the Iowa caucuses, the first formal leg of the four-yearly race for
the White House. &QL;

   MINGO, IOWA _ It is a perfect winter's morning _ the sun
sparkling off the snowy fields, the sky a perfect blue with just a
brush stroke of cloud across the horizon. Out in the woods, the
deer are scudding through the snow, and two red-tailed hawks are
circling lazily through the oak and hickory trees.
</P>
<P>
   But John Parsons has no time to watch the wildlife today. He is
clearing the snow from his drive in his bright green John Deere
tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight (Monday), Parsons and his wife, Jenifer, will welcome a
dozen or so of their neighbors to help choose the next president of
the United States in the first electoral event of the 2000
election.

   DES MOINES _ When Bill Bradley admitted last week that he had
experienced recurrences of a heart problem, the contender for the
Democratic presidential nomination sought to minimize it, blaming
the irregular heartbeat on too many cream sodas.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Bradley, as the electoral season opens,
has bigger issues to deal with. Like those sodas, his campaign _
which once seemed so refreshing and fizzy _ is now a little flat.
</P>
<P>
   The medical questions have only added to his problems _
ironically, given that the one thing every Democrat could agree on
was that Bradley's heart was in the right place.
</P>
<P>

revitalized and re-engaged... &QL;

Dr. Jawad al-Ali, who has maps showing the rate of leukemia growth

   LONDON _ A team of scientists from Britain's Royal Society is to
carry out an independent investigation into the dangers of depleted
uranium (DU), amid growing evidence that use of the material in
shells and missiles is a cause of Gulf War Syndrome and has led to
an increase in cancers among those in close contact with the
weapons.

<P>
   The move will fuel accusations by veterans and human-rights
groups that inquiries so far undertaken by Britain's Ministry of
Defense (MoD) have been little short of a whitewash.

   The weapons were first used by British and American troops
during the Gulf War, and they have been the subject of controversy
ever since.

 &HT;    My sleepless future: A vertical nightmare
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ My mother doesn't sleep at night. She
hasn't for as long as I can remember. She tries. She brushes her
teeth and puts on her cute night shirt. She combs her hair, puts
her glasses on the night stand, takes out her hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   She crawls under the covers. She closes her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But it just doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   So, she gets up and does this weird thing that none of us kids
thinks is weird at all.
</P>
<P>
   She gets up and ``rams around.''
</P>
<P>
   I know exactly what this means. It means she puts on her glasses
and her hearing aid, goes into the kitchen, leans against the
counter and listens to country music. She loves that Vince Gill.
Sometimes she might watch a movie. Lifetime. Television for Women.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, half of Americans aged 65 and older have
trouble sleeping, and Nedra Jane Smith could surely be the poster
child. Which is why I sent her the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The SleepTime On-The-Spot Gel from the Origins catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're craving a good night's sleep, massage Origins
aromatic sleep encourager on each of your sleep points: the center
of your forehead, behind the neck and on the lower abdomen right
below the navel. It works like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think, I've spent half my life researching the G spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Resume The Position Back-To-Sleep Bedside Diffuser. ``When
you awaken with a lurch at 3 a.m., hold this diffuser horizontally
under your nose and breathe deeply several times.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess after a while you just hyperventilate and pass out.
</P>
<P>
   All this stuff is homeopathic, full of things such as chamomile
and neroli and galbanum, all of which are code words for ``boiled
tofu.'' So, if you get some, don't eat it. Snort it.
</P>
<P>
   Nedra Jane did, and she even kept a diary:
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 7: Went to bed at 12:15 a.m. Used my gel. Slept until 2:15.
Did three sniffs. Back up again at 2:45. At 4:15, went back to bed.
Slept until 9:15.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 8: Used the gel at 12:15. Up at 3 a.m. Three sniffs. Slept
until 8 a.m.!!!
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 9: Used my gel at 11:25. Up at 12:30. Sniffed my thing.
Still couldn't sleep. Went back to bed at 1:45. (That's a quarter
till 2.) Back up at 5:30.
</P>
<P>
   On and on she went, dabbing and inhaling and ramming until she
was doing way more sniffing than sleeping. It was at this point
that I pretty much had a panic attack.
</P>
<P>
   I'd seen my future, and it's a vertical nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   I already look like her, talk like her, laugh like her, dress
like her. I already cook like her. Pretty soon, I'll be not
sleeping like her. Before you know it, I'm going to be 78 years
old, ramming around the house in the dark of night, watching bad
made-for-TV movies and listening to music in the kitchen of some
condo.
</P>
<P>
   With one small twist.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to play Bruce Springsteen, crank the volume, cozy up
to the counter and think about the woman who taught me everything I
know.

 &HT;    Kia Sephia surprisingly strong
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Somewhere between ``buyer beware'' and ``you get what
you pay for,'' according to most reviewers, is the 2000 Kia Sephia,
a Korean sedan with a compact price.
</P>
<P>
   For $13,325, Kia offers the Sephia in LS trim, meaning it comes
with a full load of power and trim features that include air
conditioning, a CD-playing stereo with six speakers, cruise
control, tilt wheel and power windows, mirrors and locks.
</P>
<P>
   Other pluses include decent space for people and things. Road &AMP;
Track notes that the Sephia ``betters or matches'' the front and
rear head, shoulder and leg room of the Lexus ES 300 and
Mercedes-Benz C-Class cars.
</P>
<P>
   Those comparisons stop once the Sephia starts, however. It's
noisy and comes up short in the area of driving refinement when
compared with cars in its class, so never mind how it stacks up
against Lexus and Mercedes. But the Sephia's positive features make
it easier to accept its shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's noisy. But how surprising is that in any entry-level
car that requires winding its engine to 6,000 rpm to make its peak
power of 125 horsepower? Doing that also enables the 2,500-pound
Sephia LS to escape charges that it lacks start-up power or
acceleration for passing. The test Sephia LS moved out just fine,
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Driving refinement, too, becomes a matter of what's expected and
what's acceptable. The steering is heavy and, of course, lacks
feel, as do the brakes. But the Sephia is not a cumbersome
sport-utility or bargelike vehicle. It's a 174.4-inch long sedan
that's 66.9 inches wide, so it's capable of slicing through traffic
and is easily parked in most situations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to taking on four adults, the Sephia can handle 10.4
cubic feet of trunk cargo with a relatively low lift height and a
wide-opening trunk lid. The test LS' trunk accepted 200-plus pounds
of cat and dog food, and there was no significant drop in
driveability. In fact, the ride became comfortably solid.
</P>
<P>
   The interior does lack luxury materials, and the front seats
don't offer everyone a good driving position, but the test car's
fit and finish seemed quite good. There was a noticeable absence of
squeaks and rattles, although it's possible some were overlooked
because of the undisguised engine and road noise.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation and controls are simple and in the expected
locations. Drink holders are conveniently molded into the center
console, but there's precious little storage space and no seat-back
pockets. To its credit, the test Sephia LS has a fast-acting heater
_ about a block of driving and it's warm _ and a blower with enough
strength to quickly heat or cool rear seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   So while it's true that the Sephia is not the most mannered
compact on the road, it is one that comes with more features than
its price suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Kia Sephia LS front-drive compact sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $14,184 (base: $13,325, plus $450 delivery fee)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (125
horsepower), five-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, side-impact beams,
height-adjustable front shoulder belts
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: alloy wheels, $340; carpeted floor
mats, $69
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 23 miles per gallon regular unleaded city, 29 mpg
highway

 &HT;    If it's weird, it must be great
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I am a connoisseur of Cheap Thrills, and
my quest for Weird Snacks is unending. I might as well confess that
I'm also into Odd Sensations.
</P>
<P>
   For purposes of taxonomy, I will illustrate:
</P>
<P>
   Cheap Thrill: The first time your newly declawed cat tries to
shred the couch (no nut phone calls, please. I boast co-ownership
of the world's happiest, most indulged cat: Trouble, the 20-pound
half-Siamese couch cougar.)
</P>
<P>
   Weird Snack: My recent discovery that it doesn't get any better
than tuna salad spread on a peeled apple slice.
</P>
<P>
   Odd Sensation: You grab what you take to be a full orange juice
carton that is actually empty, and you almost hoist it into the
paddle fan when you try to pass it across the table.
</P>
<P>
   Often the distinction between a cheap thrill and an odd
sensation is a fine one. For example, when you were a kid, the
first time you tried to talk through a fan blade, the effect _ the
metallic, buzzy echo of your voice, is an odd sensation. After the
first time, it becomes a cheap thrill.
</P>
<P>
   I like odd sensations. Usually. When you sip iced tea, expecting
Pepsi, there is an unsettling moment of disorientation while your
taste buds recalibrate and your brain tries to figure out the
mix-up. You like both, but there is that peculiar moment of tastial
disorientation. On the other hand, when you sip milk that is on the
verge of going sour, there is that terrible realization that you
can't undo this bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking enthusiastically from your refilled coffee cup goes too
quickly from odd to painful for any oddness to be appreciated. I
prefer to dwell on those odd sensations that draw a chuckle after
they have been experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Sensations like those sent in by thoughtful reader some years
ago:
</P>
<P>
   _ Standing in a doorway and pressing the back of your hands
against the the door frame for 15 seconds and then stepping away.
Your arms will float, seemingly of their own accord (Odd sensation
or cheap thrill? Your call).
</P>
<P>
   _ Driving just as it starts raining when without warning, all
four tires ``float'' on the oil-water emulsion on the road and the
car has absolutely zero response to steering and brakes for the
unnerving one or two seconds before the tires grab.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching a parade from the curb and feeling the bass drum.
</P>
<P>
   _ Driving at night on a familiar road, daydreaming, when it
suddenly occurs to you that you don't recognize the thoroughfare
and have no notion whether you made a wrong turn, are going east or
west, while looking desperately for a landmark or a road sign that
will ``snap'' you back into your familiar world.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting off at the wrong floor and trying to make sense of
what your eyes are telling you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting your lips back from novocaine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raising your hand in class and asking a question that was just
answered. (How about we throw this one out along with the
realization that the note you passed two minutes ago has just been
confiscated by the teacher and is about to be read aloud in class.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Whiffing a familiar but maddeningly unidentifiable aroma that
tries to carry you back to a forgotten experience. The nostalgia is
almost unbearable, but for the life of you, you can't place it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting off a trampoline and then jumping and feeling like the
incredible lump of lead. Also _ getting off roller blades and
feeling very weird.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my own oldies include that moment of taste bewilderment
when you lick the cake batter spoon, only it's not cake batter,
it's pancake batter; sneaking a square of your mom's Baker's Dark
Chocolate and simply not understanding how it can look like a
Hershey Bar, clearly say chocolate on the wrapper, and taste like
coffee grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Parking your bubble gum in the freezer for later is a good
thing. That first crunchy chew of brittle gum coated with freezer
frost is not a bad thing, neither is it good. But it is odd and a
qualifier for my list.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite odd sensations are those rare five or six times in
my life that I half awakened from a nap, and let myself subside
back into sleep, and then at will floating up into near-wakefulness
and just hovering in that delicious, tingly in-between state. If
heaven is like that, it would be almost worthwhile to be good.
</P>
<P>
   Have I left out your favorite Odd Sensation? Your un-favorite?
Your Cheap Thrills, Weird Snacks and Odd Sensations are always
welcome.

 &HT;    Experience teaches us, even when we're unaware
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Come on over here and sit with us,
Lizzie,'' Cal calls to me from where he and Amos are kicked back at
a corner table in the local cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about old people.'' I stop on the mat long
enough to dump the snow out of my boots before it has a chance to
melt all over my socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not young, like us,'' Amos says with a sly grin, waving me
over. ``We're talking really old here. Older even than you.'' I
shoot him a dirty look because that's what he's expecting. Cal and
Amos are both retired farmers well into their 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``So whose not here that we're talking about this morning?'' I
ask. They say it was me, but since I showed up they'll have to talk
about someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Benny comes in right behind me, picks up his decaf from Ruth,
and pulls up a chair. ``You boys talking about me? Is that what I
heard?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You ain't heard anything in 15 years,'' Amos reminds Benny.
``Besides, your hearing aid is whistling again.'' Benny says he
doesn't hear any whistling but fiddles with it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation settles back in and Cal picks up where he left
off. ``My mother's driving me nuts,'' he says with a good-natured
smile. His mother is 96 and still living on her own in the family
home. ``There I am,'' he grumbles, ``all the way up under the sink
trying to find the leak when she walks into the kitchen, says 'You
using this anymore?' and turns off the light.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal says when he hollered for her to turn it back on so he could
see ``what in blazes'' he was doing, she whomped him on the butt
with a wooden spoon for raising his voice to her. ``It reminded me
of the time my brother and me got into a fight in front of the
barn. Mother picked up the cider hose and started wailing the
daylights out of whichever backside was up at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The light thing is beginning to embarrass Cal, or so he says.
``A while back, Toledo Edison sent a man out to check the meter.
They thought it had to be busted for anybody to use THAT little
electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it, Cal,'' Amos reminds him, ``your mom was
teaching in a one-room school house during the Depression and
many's the month she went without a paycheck. The school board was
flat broke because the farmers couldn't pay their taxes. It's no
wonder the light bill scares her.''
</P>
<P>
   Benny nods understanding. His father's 94, he says, and every
time he takes him to a restaurant the old gentleman unloads all the
sugars and creamers from the table and stuffs it in his pockets.
Benny says he tried frisking him for a while but that got
embarrassing so now he just plays like he doesn't see
</P>
<P>
   it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he laughs, ``it isn't much different from old
Lizzie Jenkins who goes to the all-you-can-eat fish fry every year
at the fire house and stuffs more food into her purse than she puts
on her plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos tells us how a couple of years ago his mother wanted a new
dress for Jenny Fairchild's funeral, so Lucy (Amos's wife) took her
shopping. She tried on a navy blue number she liked and asked the
price _ ``$14.95,'' Lucy answered without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   The next day at the funeral, cousin Libby told Amos's mom she
really liked her dress and had even tried it on but just couldn't
swing the $89.95 price tag. ``I thought for a minute there we were
going to have to bury Mom in the same box with Jenny. Mother always
said the dress wasn't made that was worth more than 15 bucks, so
we've been lying to her for years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what they lived through,'' Benny says. ``I keep trying to
tell my grandkids about the Depression but all they know about is
the kind folks take Prozac for. They just think I'm old and
cranky.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal and Amos wistfully agree. Benny adds, ``Boy, what kids don't
know.''

   UNWED-MOTHER-HOME _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They are not called
homes for unwed mothers anymore because there are more options
today and less shame. Once upon a time, when young women got ``in
the family way'' they would simply pack up and disappear. Today,
there are more than 15,000 mothers and children in day-care and
parenting classes in public high schools and middle schools across
Florida. The classes have been state-mandated since 1986. But not
everyone has a home to go to or parents who will support them. For
those women, places like Daybreak Maternity Home in West Palm Beach
are critical. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   PRACTICAL-MAN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Just for the heck of it,
the practical man went to church last week. And was struck by a
bolt of lightning. (Man, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SUNDANCE _ From the Sundance Film Festival: movies from the
woman's point of view. More women filmmakers are participating at
Sundance this year than ever before. Mary Harron is debuting
``American Psycho'' (it debuts in theaters in April) based on the
controversial Bret Easton Ellis book. Lisa Krueger (``Manny &AMP; Lo'')
has ``Committed,'' with Heather Graham. Karyn Kusama has
``Girlfight,'' about a ferocious teen. In documentaries, there is
Anne Makepeace with an in-depth look at Edward S. Curtis, Deann
Borshay Liem with a first-person tale of Korean adoption gone awry;
and Frances Reid and Deborah Hoffman's view of South Africa's Truth
and Reconciliation Commission. We interview women filmmakers,
executives like CNN's Pat Mitchell and others about the growing
role of women in independent filmmaking and the subtle and not-so
subtle bias they find in the industry. (Longino, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 40.

   WOMEN-FILMS _ A bulleted rundown of upcoming independent movies
made by women that moviegoers will either see soon or likely in the
year ahead. (BLongino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

<P>
   ATLANTA-CHILDREN _ ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?'' The
Showtime cable movie coming this spring doesnt answer that
question, but it implies that the Klan may have been involved,
validating a rumor in the black community and a Spin magazine
story. The writer-director says he's not trying to exonerate Wayne
Williams, but to raise questions about the investigation. We havent
seen the movie yet, but a long talk with the writer-director.

   GARDENING-LIFE _ A gardening column by Lee May. This week: Lee
May finds woman's waddles are worthy of display. Eight of them
grace Renee Hopf 's lovingly landscaped 2-acre space in Stone
Mountain. Like gardens, waddles are never done. Recent additions
include the Christmas tree, along with pruned branches from
Bradford pears. A waddle by the way is the technique of weaving
pruned twigs and branches to make walls and fences that reach
across fields, a variation on the hedgerow, which features living
plants. (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   RENOVATION _ ATLANTA _ Debra Johnston knew seven years ago she'd
found her dream home, but after three attempts at renovating the
1959 ranch house, that dream became more like a nightmare.
Johnston, a Coca Cola executive, struggled through break-ins,
costly experiences with a series of contractors, including one who
she says absconded with $52,000. Still Johnston's persistency paid
off way when her home was one of eight national winners in
Metropolitan Home magazine's Home of the Year contest. (Flanders,

<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Jan. 1, a small Chicago firm added six mutual funds
to its 401(k) retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   Only 425 workers got those new choices, which might not seem
very important.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is Morningstar Inc., probably the best-known
research and analysis firm in the overcrowded world of mutual
funds. When you see an advertisement bragging about a ``five-star
rating,'' it was Morningstar's analysts who awarded the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a look at what those analysts picked to cover their own
retirement is about the same as borrowing the buy list of Peter
Lynch or the recipes of Emeril Lagasse.
</P>
<P>
   These are the newest favorites of Morningstar's brain trust:
Harbor Capital Appreciation, MSDW Institutional US Real Estate A,
Oakmark Select I, PIMCO High-Yield Institutional, Vanguard 500
Index and Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth. Three others went on the
select list in mid-1999: MAS Mid Cap Growth Institutional, PIMCO
Total Return Institutional and T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet that the selection committee studied long and hard
before it picked the newbies. Not only was it a personal thing, it
also was a chance to get second-guessed by dozens of other very
smart analysts.
</P>
<P>
   There are lessons to learn from peeking over the Morningstar
analysts' shoulders. Here's what they and other advisers have to
say:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep down your investment costs. Four of the 16 Morningstar
selections are ``institutional'' funds, which are aimed at big time
investors and have very low expenses. The minimum investment is
very high _ typically $500,000 or more. But Russ Kinnel, a senior
analyst at Morningstar, noted that individuals often can buy these
shares through mutual fund supermarkets, such as those run by
Fidelity and Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard 500 Index fund also was a cost-saving selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every dollar that doesn't go for expenses goes into the pocket
of investors,'' said Michael Smith, a certified financial planner
with Financial Vision Associates in Atlanta. That's particularly
important for long-term investments, such as those in retirement
plans, because compounding will magnify the growth of saved and
reinvested dollars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for good managers. The chief of the PIMCO fund family,
Bill Gross, was Morningstar's fixed-income manager of the year in
1998. ``He has just done a great job,'' said Kinnel. Even in the
High Yield fund, he added, ``PIMCO won't take unnecessary risks and
blow up your portfolio. It's probably the best bond shop around.''
</P>
<P>
   The MSDW real estate fund is run by a ``very experienced, savvy
team'' at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Kinnel added. At Harbor
Capital, manager Sig Segelas is ``a legend among large-growth
managers,'' Kinnel said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to look for managers who have run their
funds for at least a few years. ``An old fund with a new manager
can essentially be a new fund, since the new manager may reposition
the holdings and may have a very different style,'' said Deena
Katz, certified financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   _ Build a core investment. That is one reason why Vanguard 500
is in the mix. ``It's a very dependable way to invest, with low
cost and diversity,'' said Kinnel. ``It also allows you to go and
take some chances with other funds, because you have this bedrock
fund in your portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Spread your bets. Tricia Rothschild, another Morningstar
analyst, noted that the T. Rowe Price Small Cap fund is the first
in the 401(k) that specializes in small-cap growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification is important because it lowers risk in a
portfolio. ``If you owned an island in the South Seas, where it
rained 50 percent of the time, what two industries would you like
to be in?'' asked planner Smith. ``One would be a resort and the
other an umbrella factory. You're making money in all types of
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Take some risks but carefully. The Oakmark Select fund holds
only about 20 stocks _ the very best ones that the manager can
find. But Kinnel has a warning: ``With a fund like this, it's pure
stock picking. A concentrated fund in the wrong hands is deadly. A
mediocre or bad manager can get you into a world of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If you won't take risks, or don't want to take the time to
study your choices, take the easy way out. The Vanguard
LifeStrategy Growth fund invests in four other Vanguard mutual
funds, both stocks and bonds. ``This is a recognition that we have
newer employes who might not have the inclination to make their own
asset allocations and pick their funds,'' Kinnel said. ``You can
just pick this fund, and that's it. It's not going to crash and
burn when the market goes down; it's not going to make anyone give
up on investing.''
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: Morningstar does not pretend that its choices
are the best for everyone. ``These are good funds that a lot of
people can use,'' Kinnel advised. ``But you still have to see
what's appropriate for any particular investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the same line, Morningstar always urges people to look
beyond the star ratings, no matter how much bragging they hear.
Note that only five of the Morningstar selections have five stars.
Five have only three or two stars, which means average or a little
lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The star rating is a very basic look at past performance,''
Kinnel said. ``I don't know of any single data point that can tell
you everything you need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that picking your own mutual funds is always
an individual choice.

 &HT;    Button thy cardigan, sayeth Proverbial Man
 &HT;    By Practical Man

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Just for the heck of it, the practical
man went to church last week.
</P>
<P>
   And was struck by a bolt of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The preacher had just begun his holy treatise. The practical
man, desperate for diversion, had whipped out ``The Pocket Guide to
Gear Ratios.'' And then BAM! Revelation thundered in his ear:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Mr. Practically Guaranteed to Go to Hell. Why not peek in
the real Bible for a change?''
</P>
<P>
   Or something like that. The practical man doesn't remember the
exact words _ or even if there were any words. But he does remember
dropping the Guide and picking up the good book. He peeked in at
random.
</P>
<P>
   POW!
</P>
<P>
   Proverbs 14:4: ``Where there are no oxen, there is no grain.''
</P>
<P>
   Great God in heaven! Words wise, true and best of all _
practical! The practical man read on _ but not for long, because it
gave him an idea.
</P>
<P>
   20 Proverbs of Practicality
</P>
<P>
   1. Where there is no chicken, there are no McNuggets.
</P>
<P>
   2. Better to drive a battered boat you can fix yourself than a
Mitsubishi Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   3. The wise man respects the router. The fool thinks it's a post
office job.
</P>
<P>
   4. The road of reason leads to the palace of practicality, but
the twisted trail of emotion leads to a landfill out west of
Clewiston.
</P>
<P>
   5. He who watches the shopping channel is a sinner, but happy is
he who buys Dockers.
</P>
<P>
   6. Romance is a bubble blown by the wind, chased by children and
burst by a busy bee.
</P>
<P>
   7. The logger shakes the hand of the lumberman, and the
lumberman shakes the hand of the carpenter. But the carpenter
leaves the job site before the painter arrives.
</P>
<P>
   8. The roar of the sports fan is the bleat of the fool, and his
coat is a wool blazer from Armani that set him back $1,750.
</P>
<P>
   9. A cardigan keeps the practical man warm.
</P>
<P>
   10. 20 practical men crossing a bridge are 20 men who get to the
other side. But 20 artists crossing the same bridge are 20 artists
trapped on 20 bridges, moping about how the world will wince when
they jump.
</P>
<P>
   11. Need instills; hammers brings forth.
</P>
<P>
   12. Want poisons; waste destroys.
</P>
<P>
   13. Think in the morning; work in the afternoon; eat in the
evening; then hunker down and study up on the Chilton's manual for
your make and model car.
</P>
<P>
   14. The fathers of wrath are wiser than the dads who talk on
cell phones outside Fun Depot.
</P>
<P>
   15. You never know how much is enough until you construct a
mathematical model and crunch some numbers.
</P>
<P>
   16. When you see an F-16 fighter jet, you are seeing a portion
of genius; lift up your head!
</P>
<P>
   17. As wood to a fire and amps to a fog horn, so is the shadow
of a lizard skittering across the front porch to that filthy,
barking beast in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   18. Better a quiet dinner of dry toast than filet mignon in
front of the TV.
</P>
<P>
   19. The bird a nest, the groundhog a hole, man Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   20. Efficiency is Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Practical Man Shares His Mail:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man,
</P>
<P>
   I usually find your answers practical and useful so I was
particularly disappointed with your response to the question about
Trump for president. You don't vote? The vote is just too damn
important to be wasted and much too important to be neglected. Let
this old vet offer some practical advice to all voters. When
considering any candidate for public office at any level, beware of
the man or women who offers simplistic solutions to complex
problems. They are seldom right. Reject the candidate who has a
personal ax to grind, they are always shortsighted. Support the man
or women who is thoughtfully challenging the status quo. From their
efforts progress is achieved. Remember that citizenship is a
privilege that has its inherent obligations, primary among these is
to be an informed participant. If you neglect your responsibilities
in this regard do not despair about government, you are only
getting what you deserve.
</P>

 &HT;    Deconstructing the myths about hypnosis
 &HT;    (EDS: Embargoed until Sunday, Jan. 30.)
 &HT;    By Dr. Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Hypnosis has a long history of usefulness in
treating human ailments. Accounts in the literature include its use
in ancient Egypt and by early Greek physicians. The explanation of
hypnosis as a cscientific phenomenon varies from those who believe
it is an altered state of consciousness to those who feel it is
simply another form of communication, with the hypnotized
individual responding to a role that has been given by the
hypnotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   There are many misconceptions about hypnosis including the
folowing:
</P>
<P>
   _ The belief that hypnosis is a form of sleep and that the
hypnotized person may not ``wake up `` at the end of the
hypnotherapy session. This , along, with the the belief that the
person will lose control and be under the total influence of the
hypnotherapist has dissuaded many individuals from pursuing help
fron this very effective form of therapy. Hypnosis is often
described as a different state of awareness or consciousness where
the individual is generally in a very deep and relaxed state. The
attention of the patient is focused on the suggestions of the
hypnotherapist but the patient is in control and can only be
influenced by suggestion if they so choose.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another frequent misconception is that people will not
remember what was said the them by the hypnotherapist during the
hypnotic session. On the contrary, most hypnosis relies on the fact
that the person will remember what has been said to them, sug has
suggestions for losing weight, stopping smoking, etc. A technique
called post-hypnotic amnesia is occasionally used to encourage the
patient to selectively not recall certain parts of the hypnotic
session, but this is used infrequently and does not work well in
all cases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hypnosis produces weird, out-of-body experiences that are
often frightening and unpleasant. The fact is, while in the
hypnotic trance, the individual feels very pleasant and free from
tension.
</P>
<P>
   _ When hypnotized, a person can be made to bark like a dog,
undress in public against their weill or perform criminal acts. In
stage hypnosis, a popular form of entertainment, the ``hypnotized''
individual often becomes part of the act because of a desire to
entertain those in the audience with his or her unusual behaviour.
Or they may simply be part of the act, planted in the audience, and
``volunteering'' for a well-practiced role in the act.

 &HT;    Maternity home shines light of rescue, not stigma
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They are not called homes for unwed
mothers anymore. It's a little too '50s, a little too ``Father
Knows Best.'' But that's what this refurbished six-bedroom refuge
is: a sanctuary for women whose boyfriends are no longer in the
picture. A nesting ground for expectant moms to catch their breath
before they give birth. A place to think and plan and try to figure
out what comes next.
</P>
<P>
   They are not called homes for unwed mothers anymore because
there are more options today and less shame. Once upon a time, when
young women got ``in the family way'' they would simply pack up and
disappear. Today, there are more than 15,000 mothers and children
in day-care and parenting classes in public high schools and middle
schools across Florida. The classes have been state-mandated since
1986.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has a home to go to or parents who will support
them. For those women, places like Daybreak Maternity Home in West
Palm Beach are critical.
</P>
<P>
   The women who walk through the green front door into this world
don't know what to expect or what is expected of them. They don't
know Mike or Katie, the house parents who would be missionaries in
Vietnam if they hadn't been asked to move in here four years ago.
They don't know what's coming next.
</P>
<P>
   What most of them do know is that they are pregnant and
unprepared and have no other place to go.
</P>
<P>
   And they are almost always scared. Scared because their parents
have pressured them to have abortions, and they have refused.
Scared because the boyfriends who made them promises have suddenly
dropped out of their lives. Scared because they ran out of money or
``aged out'' of homeless shelters for juveniles or realized the
people they thought they could count on are suddenly judgmental and
cruel.
</P>
<P>
   They come because even though abortions in the United States are
legal and accessible and relatively cheap, they are invasive and
irreversible _ and for some women, immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never considered it,'' said Jessie, a 21-year-old resident
who delivered a baby boy via Caesarean section last week. ``When I
was a kid, my mother told me that when she found out I was a girl
she wanted to abort me but it was already too late. When something
like that happens, I mean, I couldn't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the 27th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme
Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. Since
that decision, an estimated 40 million pregnancies have been
terminated by abortion. An additional 1.2 million are projected
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sue (not her real name) didn't have to wrestle with whether she
would abort. She was Born Again a few years ago. ``I believe all
life is sacred,'' she said simply. She is less sure about what will
happen once her child is born. Due in March, the 23-year-old
Daybreak resident with dark gray eyes and light brown hair is still
deciding whether she will keep her child or put the baby up for
adoption. ``I'm praying on it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years since the First Baptist Church of West Palm
Beach opened Daybreak, 25 of the 28 women who have come here have
decided to keep their children. The other three have opted for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Sue is typical of the women who come here in that she never
thought she would end up pregnant and alone. Not long after she
realized she was carrying a child, she found a gun among her
boyfriend's possessions. ``He told me it was for Y2K,'' she said,
rolling her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with his increasing use of drugs and alcohol, she felt
she had no choice but to leave.
</P>
<P>
   She found Daybreak through a Christian counseling center. She
said she was never condemned for her decision to have premarital
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was really angry with me when he found out I was
pregnant,'' she said. ``But these people are the most real people I
know. It wasn't like I wanted to get pregnant and ruin my life, but
I did and now I have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the focus of Daybreak is self-improvement. While the
women live at Daybreak, they either work or study. They take
classes in budgeting and household management. They learn how to
shop for groceries and how to put together a resume to help them
get back in the job market after they give birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a chance for a new beginning,'' said Mike, who
was Born Again after surviving Vietnam and then a heroin addiction.
``One of the worst things that can happen is that a girl will be
forced into a dead-end job and she will get together with a guy who
will abuse her. A guy can smell that vulnerability, and they start
saying, `You can't make it without me,' and soon they'll start to
believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The women at Daybreak range in age from 18 to 25. They typically
stay at the well-appointed West Palm Beach home for three to six
months. (The church asked that the location not be disclosed).
While they live here, they are expected to take part in evening
prayer sessions and to obey the rules of the house. They pay no
rent or fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do this because we believe in the sanctity of life,'' says
the Rev. Ken Winter, who oversees the program for the church. ``We
decided that if we believe, then we need to put our feet to our
beliefs and we need to assist women who have made that decision for
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vehemence of the anti-abortion movement, homes like
Daybreak are increasingly rare. Part of that reason is money. It
cost $300,000 to purchase and renovate the home and about $5,000 a
month for maintenance, Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   While homes for unwed mothers used to dot the landscape, ``they
closed down right and left when we closed,'' said Madeleine Schutz,
the executive director of Catholic Charities who helped run the
Maurawood home for unwed mothers before it closed in 1992.
``Society changed, it just became more acceptable to have children
without being married. In the last few years we were open, we would
have girls that would go home every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   For Veronica (also not her real name), a 19-year-old Daybreak
resident, that is definitely not an option. She said she was thrown
out of her Hollywood home when she refused to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother gave me a week to decide, and I just couldn't do
it,'' she said. ``I felt this life inside of me. When I said no,
she told me to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, she went to her church and was directed here. She
said she will keep her child and probably take advantage of the
follow-up program the church runs that gives women a place to stay
for a year after they give birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a place to get started,'' Mike said. ``They need a
second chance, and that's what we're here for.''

 &HT;    Kia Sephia surprisingly strong
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Somewhere between ``buyer beware'' and ``you get what
you pay for,'' according to most reviewers, is the 2000 Kia Sephia,
a Korean sedan with a compact price.
</P>
<P>
   For $13,325, Kia offers the Sephia in LS trim, meaning it comes
with a full load of power and trim features that include air
conditioning, a CD-playing stereo with six speakers, cruise
control, tilt wheel and power windows, mirrors and locks.
</P>
<P>
   Other pluses include decent space for people and things. Road &AMP;
Track notes that the Sephia ``betters or matches'' the front and
rear head, shoulder and leg room of the Lexus ES 300 and
Mercedes-Benz C-Class cars.
</P>
<P>
   Those comparisons stop once the Sephia starts, however. It's
noisy and comes up short in the area of driving refinement when
compared with cars in its class, so never mind how it stacks up
against Lexus and Mercedes. But the Sephia's positive features make
it easier to accept its shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's noisy. But how surprising is that in any entry-level
car that requires winding its engine to 6,000 rpm to make its peak
power of 125 horsepower? Doing that also enables the 2,500-pound
Sephia LS to escape charges that it lacks start-up power or
acceleration for passing. The test Sephia LS moved out just fine,
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Driving refinement, too, becomes a matter of what's expected and
what's acceptable. The steering is heavy and, of course, lacks
feel, as do the brakes. But the Sephia is not a cumbersome
sport-utility or bargelike vehicle. It's a 174.4-inch long sedan
that's 66.9 inches wide, so it's capable of slicing through traffic
and is easily parked in most situations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to taking on four adults, the Sephia can handle 10.4
cubic feet of trunk cargo with a relatively low lift height and a
wide-opening trunk lid. The test LS' trunk accepted 200-plus pounds
of cat and dog food, and there was no significant drop in
driveability. In fact, the ride became comfortably solid.
</P>
<P>
   The interior does lack luxury materials, and the front seats
don't offer everyone a good driving position, but the test car's
fit and finish seemed quite good. There was a noticeable absence of
squeaks and rattles, although it's possible some were overlooked
because of the undisguised engine and road noise.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation and controls are simple and in the expected
locations. Drink holders are conveniently molded into the center
console, but there's precious little storage space and no seat-back
pockets. To its credit, the test Sephia LS has a fast-acting heater
_ about a block of driving and it's warm _ and a blower with enough
strength to quickly heat or cool rear seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   So while it's true that the Sephia is not the most mannered
compact on the road, it is one that comes with more features than
its price suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Kia Sephia LS front-drive compact sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $14,184 (base: $13,325, plus $450 delivery fee)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (125
horsepower), five-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, side-impact beams,
height-adjustable front shoulder belts
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: alloy wheels, $340; carpeted floor
mats, $69
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 23 miles per gallon regular unleaded city, 29 mpg
highway

CRITICISM OF NATIONAL MONUMENTS LACKS CREDIBILITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   No sooner had President Clinton announced the creation of three
new national monuments and the expansion of another on Jan. 11,
than a chorus of naysayers began to bray.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming's Republican U.S. senators, Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi,
complained that the president had designated these new national
monuments without congressional input. Precisely. The language of
the Antiquities Act as passed by Congress back in June 1906
purposely omitted the need to get approval from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The act reads, in part: ``That the president of the United
States is hereby authorized, in his discretion, to declare ...
lands owned or controlled by the government of the United States to
be national monuments....'' The idea behind giving a president the
sole authority was to allow these designations to be made quickly
to save historic and prehistoric structures and objects of
antiquity or scientific interest from destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton could act alone, the criticism that he has
isn't fair.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Jan. 19, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt
said that the congressional delegations of every state affected by
these national monuments were contacted, ''absolutely and without
exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in light of the Thomas and Enzi criticism, Devils
Tower National Monument in northeast Wyoming was the first national
monument to be created in this nation. President Theodore
Roosevelt, a Republican, issued the proclamation in 1906, soon
after the passage of the Antiquities Act.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new national monuments expands the Grand Canyon
National Park, which Theodore Roosevelt designated as a national
monument in 1908. The monument was converted into a national park
by Congress in 1919. Lands adjacent to the Grand Canyon National
Park were designated national monuments in 1932 and in 1969. And in
1975, Congress enlarged the park to include those monuments.
</P>
<P>
   The newly created Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument in
Arizona borders Grand Canyon National Park to the south and the
state of Nevada to the west. When Congress enlarged the national
park in 1975, it directed the secretary of the interior to study
several drainages north of the park to determine whether they
should also be protected. The studies were done and most of the
lands in those studies are included in the new national monument.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Enzi and several other critics in Congress claim that
the new national monuments were created without public
participation. Enzi was quoted in an Associated Press story Jan.
12, denouncing Clinton for ``blatantly ignoring the people closest
to these areas and the democratic process in order to create his
own legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it isn't Clinton's legacy, it's ours. In less than
a decade, visitors to these new national monuments won't remember
who designated them, and they won't care. They'll be there to enjoy
the beauty that has been preserved for the American public. It's
the public's land and now it will be fully protected for them.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the proposal for the Grand Canyon-Parashant National
Monument has been front-page news in the Arizona press for more
than a year. And, according to Babbitt, he personally conducted
public meetings on the issue in two Arizona communities: Colorado
City and Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rep. Jim Hansen (R-Utah) of the House Resources Committee held
a public hearing in St. George, Utah. In addition to that, there
were probably about two dozen meetings around the area with county
officials, with state officials, with the ranchers and other
stakeholders,'' Babbitt added.
</P>
<P>
   The other new Arizona site, the Aqua Fria National Monument, is
approximately 40 miles north of Phoenix, a rapidly expanding city.
This monument preserves ancient ruins, at least 450 prehistoric
sites, petroglyphs and prehistoric agricultural features like
terracing. The area has already suffered from vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding public meetings about the Aqua Fria National Monument,
Babbitt said, ``The BLM (Bureau of Land Management) conducted a
series of public workshops. I attended one of those workshops. I
actually had a couple of public sessions about that site. And
again, meetings were held with all the stakeholders.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Babbitt, nearly 80 percent of the people of Arizona
support these new national monuments: ''Those figures were almost
uniform between Republicans and Democrats and between urban and
rural residents.''
</P>
<P>
   In answer to the criticism that public use and public access
will be curtailed at these monuments, Babbitt stated, ``It's
precisely the opposite. I've been on the phone today with local
officials in Phoenix to talk about how we can provide some enhanced
access and visitation. And the local officials in Phoenix are
formulating a request for support from the Arizona delegation to
provide some interpretive and access facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   California is the home of the other two Clinton proclamations
regarding national monuments _ the Pinnacles National Monument
expansion and the creation of the California Coastal National
Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinnacles National Monument was created by Theodore
Roosevelt in 1908 to protect the spires of rock formations that
rise from 500 to 1,200 feet, the caves that lie below them and
other dramatic volcanic features. The monument, which is 65 miles
south of San Jose, has been expanded five times by later presidents
and once by Congress. This new expansion is seen to be necessary to
the continued preservation of the monument's resources and
geological features.
</P>
<P>
   This expansion was proposed twice by Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif.,
but no committee hearings were held on his bill. It's hypocritical
of members of Congress to criticize the president for not seeking
congressional input, when Congress neglects to hold committee
hearings on this kind of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The California Coastal National Monument runs the entire 840
miles of the state's coastline and extends out for 12 miles. The
monument begins just offshore and was created to protect the
coastal ecosystem. The monument designation does not affect valid
existing oil and gas leases, nor does it enlarge federal regulatory
authority over fishing or other uses.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, Farr introduced, for the second time, legislation
to protect the offshore ecosystem as a wilderness area. Again, no
hearings were held on his bill.
</P>
<P>
   The designation of federal public lands as national monuments
not only protects those valuable sites from vandalism, speculative
mining claims and uncontrolled use of off-road vehicles, but from
the loss of those lands altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt underscored the administration's concern: ``It's not
commonly understood that the secretary of the interior, under the
existing land laws, has some substantial discretion to sell public
land. Obviously, that's not a problem while I'm here, but we do
have precedents from other secretaries whose declared objective was
to get rid of these lands. What these proclamations do is make the
clear statement that these are to be reserved in perpetuity for
public use.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, let there be more proclamations creating national
monuments.

<P>
   Relax! Get settled in for the Super Bowl XXXIV game Sunday. But
before you get too comfortable, whip up some dips for snacking
throughout the game. The selections included today are so easy
anyone can tackle them.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be a slave in the kitchen. Make them up before the opening
kickoff, or the night before, and stash them in the fridge. Then
serve with an array of dippers. Depending on the nature of the dip,
choices might include the usual tortilla chips, crackers, pita
chips and assorted fresh cut-up vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include baby back ribs, pretzels, cut-up
chunks of bread, frozen won tons or dumplings and even cubes of
salami, cooked chicken, turkey or miniature franks. For those with
a sweet tooth, offer an array of colorful cut-up fresh fruits with
a sweet dip or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's appetite for dips is as patriotic as its love of
potato chips, but much more recent,'' writes Jane Kirby, in her
book ``50 Best Salsas &AMP; Dips'' (Broadway Books). ``Potato chips are
almost 150 years old, but dips are a young 40-something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until 1954 that Lipton's dry onion soup was blended
with sour cream to create the ultimate instant party pleasure,
California Dip. The recipe became a culinary icon that launched an
entertaining trend and inspired a generation of cooks.''
</P>
<P>
   But we've come a long way since those days due in large part to
the availability of so many more interesting ingredients, such as
sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, chutneys, fresh basil and
other herbs, salsas of all kinds, chilis, goat and feta cheeses and
Mediterranean olives, which are now commonplace in our pantries _
and encourage dip experimentation and exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Dips and chips have become a mainstay of casual entertaining _
and for good reason. ``The combinations are endless, the
preparation time fits into our schedules, and we never seem to run
out of new ideas,'' says Claudia McQuillan, author of ``Chips and
Dips'' (Chronicle Books). Also recipes for dips and chips can
easily be increased to feed the masses or reduced for a few.
</P>
<P>
   For variety on Super Bowl Sunday, one of the biggest snack
occasions of the year, choose dips with different colors, flavors
and textures _ a fusion of taste experiences. Offer an assortment
if you're expecting a large crowd. Include something familiar, a
spicy dip and something more unusual. You might even toss in one or
two dips with ethnic and global overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Since a party of chips (and other dippers) and dips means finger
foods, have a stack of plates and napkins handy. That way, guests
can enjoy the appetizers leisurely without hanging over the serving
dish.
</P>
<P>
   Just because these dips are casual fare doesn't mean they can't
be presented with style. Be creative and make them festive and
appealing by serving the dip in a hollowed-out crusty round loaf of
bread, or in a large colorful red or green pepper, for instance. A
large-handled basket piled high with vegetables or chips and tied
with ribbons in the colors of the favored team would be attractive,
too. You might even use a football helmet lined with plastic wrap
and then balanced on the serving table, or pails or buckets from
the toy store for serving chips or vegetables. Search for other
interesting baskets and containers at discount stores. You're bound
to turn up some interesting shapes and fun ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Also you might line the buffet table with something green such
as a new piece of indoor-outdoor carpet or AstroTurf to simulate a
football field. Decorate with glitter sprinkles or confetti in the
color of the teams and streamers or pompons.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to keep cold dips in ice, replenishing as necessary.
Serve hot dips with Sterno underneath, or in a slow cooker.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert fans, pick up cookies (unless you feel inclined to
bake) or a cake. Don't stress yourself out. With these ideas, you
can enjoy the day's festivities, too. &QL;

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Jan. 15 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

&HT;     PROPONENTS SAY LASERS MAKE GOING TO THE DENTIST EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Already commonplace in most areas of medicine,
laser technology is making new inroads in dentistry, where it has
the potential to deliver pain-free treatment of cavities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the wave of the future,'' said Dr. Kurt
Froehlich, of Cairo Family Dentistry in Greene County.
</P>
<P>
   Froehlich is believed to be one of only a few hundred dentists
in the country to purchase one of the newest lasers on the market,
a $45,000 model that uses energized water molecules to cut through
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no pain, no needle. You didn't hear the high whining
sound of the drill,'' said Douglas Stein, 29, an Albany lawyer who
had a cavity filled last week. ``I'll never have a drill again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that kind of enthusiasm from patients, most dentists
aren't rushing to buy laser technology, claiming that it doesn't
offer enough benefits, and in the wrong hands, may even pose some
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another way of doing what we are currently doing,'' said
Dr. Davis Garlapo, chairman of the restorative dentistry department
at the University of Buffalo. ``It doesn't open up any new
avenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasers have most commonly been used in dentistry over the past
decade for periodontal or gum work. The device can help eliminate
bleeding, swelling and stitches by cauterizing soft tissues.
</P>
<P>
   But manufacturers had been struggling to come up with a device
that would work on the hard surface of teeth. One of the biggest
hurdles has been dealing with the heat generated by the laser and
the potential for damage of the tooth's underlying dentin and pulp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of limitations when dealing with tooth
structure,'' said Dr. Gerard Kugel, the dean for research at Tufts
University School of Dental Medicine in Boston. ``At this point in
time, I wouldn't go out and buy a laser.''
</P>
<P>
   Froehlich purchased his laser from Biolase Technology in San
Clemente, Calif., one of three companies that currently have
approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration to market
lasers.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Bateman, the vice president of global sales at Biolase,
said he believes laser technology will become more mainstream in
another three to five years as more of the nation's 140,000
dentists learn about it, and as the price comes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have it love it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Biolase laser can be used to cut both soft and hard
tissue in the mouth, it cannot be used to remove old metal
fillings, because no one knows the effects that escaping gases or
particles from the amalgam may have on the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   And while the laser can eliminate the need for Novocain in most
cases, deep cavities may still require the use of some anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, Kugel believes that most dentists will
continue to opt for their reliable and versatile hand drills, at a
much lower cost of $500 each. ``I think we're still a long way off
from dentists routinely cutting teeth with lasers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Froehlich, however, believes his investment was worth it. Since
installing the laser a month ago, he said, he has gotten only
positive feedback from patients. And he's charging the same amount
as with the conventional drill. ``The biggest advantage is people
don't have the numbness when they leave the office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Praemassing, 64, of Greene County said he was ``pleasantly
surprised'' when he got a cavity filled three weeks ago at
Froehlich's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel a thing,'' he said.

&HT;     LAID-OFF WORKERS FIND JOBS QUICKLY IN ROBUST ECONOMY

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It started as a catastrophe: National Finance
Corp. shut its doors just days before Christmas, tossing some 350
people out of work and leaving many to wonder how they would buy
gifts for their children or pay credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say the National Finance debacle has a happy
ending. But in the month since its closing, one-third of its former
employees probably have jobs, estimated Tony Fisher, who is now
acting as president of the failed mortgage company and is arranging
to sell assets and shut down. Many others are considering offers or
are near landing another job.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the economics lessons drawn from Mr. Potter in ``It's a
Wonderful Life.'' Workers these days often have more power than
bosses. In one of the strongest economies in recent memory, most
workers don't have to face long months of joblessness and
bankruptcy when a company closes its doors. Former National Finance
workers were pursued by a number of companies hungry to fill a
range of positions. At job fairs former National Finance workers
browsed among employers, considering other opportunities. It's
still a psychological shock to lose the stability and comfort that
comes with a job, but the economic catastrophe can often be staved
off.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Robideau, a customer service supervisor at National
Finance, landed on her feet. Last week she started a new job as
sales assistant at First Albany, the investment banking and
brokerage company. Though the break from National Finance came as a
shock, the 22-year-old Robideau is grateful for her shift to First
Albany because she sees stability and room for career advancement.
``It's more of a solid career move,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A consistent demand for workers and an unemployment rate of only
3.4 percent in December is helping many workers with strong
credentials and training attract offers. Companies that have
already hired workers are looking to take on more, and some
companies, including Progressive Insurance and State Farm, are
still hoping to land some of the National Finance employees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the former National Finance employees are finding
it tougher to land good-paying jobs because they don't have
particularly specialized job skills, and are facing pay cuts. And
health insurance problems and medical bills are confounding some
people.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was also the first day on a new job for Ann Luse, a
Clifton Park woman who had worked for four years tracking
collateral at National Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is doing a different kind of finance work, as an
assistant in the department at Cohoes Savings Bank that makes
commercial loans. ``I had to take a $3,000 pay cut, but that's not
that bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, companies came in and swooped up entire groups of
former National Finance workers.
</P>
<P>
   A band of 24 former employees going to work at lender Tri-City
Funding in Halfmoon are hoping to improve their earnings potential
quickly, said Mike Breslin, now a Tri-City vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're highly motivated about the situation,'' Breslin said.
``I'm seeing that our people should be getting a pay raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Loan officers can probably make $50,000 at Tri City, compared to
$35,000 to $40,000 at National Finance, he said. Telemarketers
should be able to earn $30,000 to $40,000, he said, compared to
earning $26,000 to $30,000 at National Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Loan processors will start at about the same base pay of $25,000
annually, he said, but will be able to have other financial
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Breslin's crew will expand the Tri-City work force from 10 to
34, and, given the skills they acquired at National Finance, should
realistically be able to help the company double its annual loan
volume to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In return, employees are going to get profit sharing at their
new jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Computer specialists also seem to be doing well. A ``core
group'' of about 10 software developers are working together on
projects and evaluating their options, said Chris Coulthrust, who
had been a senior vice president of technology.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 former National Finance employees signed up for
computer training courses at Ikon Office Solutions, said Mike
McGovern, senior educational consultant at the training school.
``None of them want to go back into banking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But they can gain skills in specialties such as computer network
administration, or upgrade their desktop application capabilities,
in four months to 10 months, McGovern said. Then the former
National Finance workers will soon be hearing prospective employers
woo them: ``We'll give you this, we'll give you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained network administrators are in particular demand, he
said, and can command starting annual salaries of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lower range salaries should start at $25,000 for people with
more widely available computer skills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A new job isn't necessarily the end of all the financial
troubles for laid off workers, though. The mass dismissal at
National Finance caused some cash shortfalls that may dog people
for months.
</P>
<P>
   The company still owes employees another week's worth of back
pay, and Fisher is not sure when the money will be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the workers' health insurance isn't clear, either.
Some former employees are now getting bills for medical services
they received when they thought they were covered by insurance.
They're not sure if they'll be stuck with the bills.

&HT;     REPORT CHALLENGES NEED FOR PRIVACY LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As politicians throughout the country clamor for
new privacy-protection laws, advocates of open government in New
York are warning that too much confidentiality can be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report to the Legislature, the state Committee on
Open Government says New York already has enough laws protecting
privacy and there's little need for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blanket protection of privacy may be contrary to the public
interest,'' states the new report, written by Robert J. Freeman,
the open government committee's executive director. ``There is a
need to ensure that the desire to protect privacy does not diminish
the accountability of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno is
preparing recommendations to bolster state privacy laws. Bruno, a
Republican from Brunswick, formed a privacy task force last year,
saying too much personal information is being released without
people's consent.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said his report is not a response to Bruno's initiative.
The Committee on Open Government always addresses privacy issues,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures across the country are now focusing on
privacy matters, said Lucy C. Dalglish, executive director of the
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in Arlington, Va.
``This year, it's just going crazy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The push for privacy comes as government computerizes more data,
making information more accessible than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that someone can actually use the records, they want to
shut them down,'' Dalglish said. ``I find that profoundly ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   The momentum is bound to mount following the recent U.S. Supreme
Court decision that allows Congress to stop states from selling
home addresses, vehicle descriptions and other information compiled
by motor vehicle departments. ``The Supreme Court has given the
state legislatures the green light'' to limit access to records,
Dalglish said.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, motor vehicle records should be public, the
Committee on Open Government argued. ``If a person has committed a
violation of law, such as speeding or driving while intoxicated,
the public should clearly have the right to know,'' Freeman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And the government collects lots of other information that
should remain accessible, Dalglish said. For example, Freeman said
people would have no way of knowing if their homes are overassessed
if they couldn't look at the values of their neighbors' homes.
</P>
<P>
   There's no direct reference to privacy in the U.S. Constitution.
Dalglish said many of those who talk about a right to privacy
actually are arguing for a right not to be annoyed. ``I think it's
a backlash against direct mail and telemarketers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bruno, Mark Hansen, declined to say what
recommendations the senator would make to the Legislature. But, he
said, ``The important thing is to take a look at our laws, which
might not be effective when you look at all the information out
there on people.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates say they are not looking for blanket
protection of privacy _ just reasonable restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't think it's fair that you have to give
(personal information) to vote or to drive, and any Tom, Dick or
Harry can get it for any purpose,'' said Evan Hendricks, editor and
publisher of the Privacy Times, based in Washington, D.C. Hendricks
said he is a strong supporter of the Freedom of Information Act,
but he believes public records should only be used for the purposes
for which they were collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public records,'' Hendricks said, ``are the toughest issue to
deal with when it comes to balancing privacy versus public rights
of access.''

HURTADO IS REVVED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After four difficult Major League Soccer
seasons, the Revolution realized they needed help in a big way.
They were fortunate that Eduardo Hurtado Roa needed a change of
scene at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, big things are expected of Hurtado, whose nickname,
``El Tanque'' (The Tank), does not reflect his nimbleness afoot and
refined technique.
</P>
<P>
   In MLS's first season, Hurtado scored 21 goals for the Los
Angeles Galaxy, then added three in the playoffs. He has converted
27 MLS goals since then but had a frustrating time with the
MetroStars, who won only three games in regulation last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great guy and a great addition to the team,'' said
Revolution defender Dan Calichman, who was Hurtado's teammate in
Los Angeles. ``I'm not talking just about talent, but also
personality. He is excited to be here. He has friends on the team,
he likes the coach. And if he is motivated, he will be in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``In LA, Eduardo scored a lot of goals because he was stronger
and faster than everyone, and that is what we want him to do
here.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 3 inches, 210 pounds, Hurtado will certainly draw the
attention of opposing defenders in a way the striker he is
replacing, Joe-Max Moore, did not. And, though Hurtado is 10 pounds
overweight, he was performing at top speed as recently as last
month when he scored the winning goal as Liga Deportiva
Universitaria won the Ecuadoran championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been well-received, and training is going well,''
Hurtado said as the Revolution began spring training Monday.
``There is a lot of energy and we have a new goal this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in the past is in the past. We have a new team,
new coach, new players, and I am looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, coach Fernando Clavijo plans to build the Revolution
around Leonel Alvarez, Mauricio Ramos, and Hurtado. John Harkes,
who is with the US national team training for Saturday's visit to
Chile, and Alvarez will take on defensive roles in midfield,
linking the back line to Ramos and the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   If the Revolution can solve their defensive problems _ Clavijo
is still seeking a central defender and goalkeeper _ they should
have enough offensive firepower to improve. They have the league's
Nos. 3 and 5 all-time scorers: Giovanni Savarese (51 goals) and
Hurtado (47).
</P>
<P>
   But even though Hurtado and Savarese had success together in New
York, the MetroStars struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were not good in New York and we didn't accomplish
anything,'' Hurtado said. ``When things go the wrong way, nobody
gets anything out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are all in this together here and I know the players
are looking forward to a good year for the Revolution. We can't
know the style of play until we get on the field, but all the
players are at the disposition of the coach. What I would like is
to have the combination we had in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado, 30, has long been among the bright hopes of his
country's soccer revival. The current generation has brought
Ecuador up a notch, and Hurtado will likely be called by coach
Francisco Maturana to World Cup qualifying matches.
</P>
<P>
   But this will likely be Hurtado's last thrust into the
international scene. He has been rejuvenated by his success with
LDU in Ecuador, the change of scene to Boston, and the birth of his
third child, Ian, a month ago.

<P>

   Bora Milutinovic, formerly with the US national team and coach
of the MetroStars last year, had a successful start to his coaching
career with China's national team. China took an 8-0 victory over
the Philippines in an Asian Cup qualifier in Ho Chi Minh City
Sunday. China will have a tougher test against Vietnam for the
final qualifying place.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jacksonville Jaguars defensive coordinator Dom Capers,
whose name is being mentioned in the Patriots coaching mix, says
``I talked with Bob (Kraft Monday) morning and I'm going to fly up
there to talk with him about the Patriots job and look around.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Orleans has also called and expressed some interest in me
as the head coach. I had six years there (as an assistant in New
Orleans), so I know what that is like, which is why I am visting
New England first. I'll also visit with the New Orleans folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, coaching this year in Jacksonville has been one of the
most enjoyable experiences of my coaching career. I thoroughly
enjoyed it. Tom (Coughlin) is a great guy to work for. I have a lot
of time left on my contract here, and I don't want to take a (head
coaching) job unless I feel it is absolutely right for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A coach who is close to Capers said: ``I talked to Dom recently
and he likes it in Jacksonville and he isn't going to rush into a
head-coaching job unless it is perfect for him. He had his one shot
in Carolina and he knows the next one could be his last. So he
won't take anything unless he's absolutely sure it's right for
him.''

   The National Football League Coaches Association is preparing to
file a multimillion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL
owners, possibly the first move in an intensifying confrontation
between the league's assistant coaches and the owners. The NFLCA,
headed by former New England offensive coordinator Larry Kennan,
has been trying to get the owners to address some major issues the
assistants have. Jeffrey Kessler of New York, who has been the lead
attorney for the NFL Players Association in its court battles with
the league, reportedly has been retained by the NFLCA. The NFLPA,
headed by Gene Upshaw, has been very sympathetic to the cause of
the assistant coaches, and has even provided office space for
Kennan in its Washington headquarters. The coaches' case against
the league will revolve around apparel they have to wear on the
sidelines _ apparel for which the owners get millions and the
coaches get nothing. The same thing happens with the headsets . . .
Marv Levy says he was never offered a job by Kraft. ``I called Bob
to recommend someone else as head coach,'' said Levy. ``I like Bob
and I enjoyed his company when I met him at league meetings. He
asked me to come in for a visit. I did. We talked about football.
He told me he wasn't sure who his head coach would be, that he was
going to take his time working thorugh the process. He never talked
to me about coaching the Patriots, and I'm not interested in taking
a front office job.'' . . . Marty Schottenheimer, who is on hand
for the Super Bowl working for ESPN, said, ``I've never been
contacted by the Patriots. Looking at it from a distance, (Bill)
Belichick has to be their man. They have to figure out a way to go
get him. I keep thinking that Paul (Tagliabue) might step in here
and direct some kind of settlement between the Jets and Patriots to
get that thing over with.'' . . . Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves
said he doesn't know where the story came from that he fired
offensive line coach Art Shell. ``Art is still with us,'' said
Reeves, ``and, in fact, New Orleans called up this morning to get
permission to talk to him about being their next coach.''

IF CONNOLLY IS SO GUILTY, CAN THE FBI BE SO INNOCENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Afew years ago, I had dinner with John Connolly, the former FBI
agent who was recently indicted for allegedly getting too close to
the mob. No kidding _ he ordered Steak Mafia, a Tecce's special,
and spun stories about a world the rest of us know only from the
movies. The stories were funny, fascinating and frightening. On the
drive home, I remember wondering: is this Connolly a good guy, a
bad guy, or both?
</P>
<P>
   Today, the government is doing its best to eliminate all
ambiguity from what we think of John Connolly. The FBI agent who
retired as a hero in 1990 is now being portrayed as a rogue cop, so
evil he would let his informants get away with murder _ and so
petty, he would hit them up for a free refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly may be as bad as he now looks. But if he is so guilty,
can the people for whom he worked really be so innocent? I doubt
it.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly testified under oath that the FBI signed up two prized
informants, James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, in order to
destroy the Italian mob. He testified that in return for their
information, the FBI authorized Bulger and Flemmi to continue
illegal activities that included loansharking and gambling.
Connolly was their official FBI handler.
</P>
<P>
   Did Bulger and Flemmi go beyond the parameters of their deal and
commit murder? Three bodies dug up in Dorchester this month make
what was always very possible, very real.
</P>
<P>
   Did Connolly know about these murders? Did he, in fact, reveal
to Bulger and Flemmi the names of other informants who might
implicate them in crimes, leading to at least two murders? Then _
five years after Connolly left the bureau _ did he tip off his
ex-informants to their impending indictments, allowing Whitey to
flee Boston on Jan. 10, 1995?
</P>
<P>
   Connolly denies all such allegations. At any trial, the
government would have to prove he crossed a line into criminality.
Maybe it will. In the meantime, it is exploiting the hardly secret
conflicts in Connolly's life to make the possibility seem as real
as those recently unearthed bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-agent grew up in the same South Boston housing project as
Whitey Bulger, the criminal, and his brother, Bill, the former
Senate president. Whitey grew up to control Boston's organized
crime scene and Bill grew up to control Boston's political scene.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bulger was Connolly's mentor. He encouraged Connolly to
think, read and go beyond Southie to Boston College and the FBI.
Whitey Bulger bought Connolly a now-famous ice cream cone and
rescued him from a neighborhood beating when he was a boy. Years
later, he became Connolly's most valuable informant, helping
Connolly make his own reputation, as he broke down the Italian
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Are we to believe that the FBI didn't know all that, when it
made Connolly the go-between for Whitey and Flemmi?
</P>
<P>
   Connolly's superiors made a deal with the devil; they cherished
Connolly's connections to the devil when it suited their purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In their hearts, Connolly and his superiors knew enough of the
truth about their informants, even if they did not literally know
where they were burying bodies. They knew they were bad guys, used
to get other bad guys. Everyone _ including much of the city's
business and political elite _ understood that Whitey was a special
bad guy, with a brother who reigned on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   So why should Connolly alone pay the price for the FBI's deal?
</P>
<P>
   The same FBI that brought us Waco and Ruby Ridge now wants us to
believe the corruption starts and stops with one cop. It will do
anything to advance that mantra. Everything _ from Connolly's
arrest before Christmas in front of his children, to the dredging
up of human bones from the frozen Dorchester dirt _ is designed to
shred his reputation and break him psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as his former colleagues work in concert to destroy his
credibility, they raise troubling questions about their own. The
Bulger-Flemmi arrangement they endorsed was incestuous enough to
make anyone wonder where Connolly's loyalties began and where they
ended.
</P>
<P>
   If it made me wonder after one meal in the North End _ how could
it not do the same for our crack FBI?
</P>

THE JUDGMENT OF PLATO IN OUR TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE PLATO PAPERS 
By Peter Ackroyd 
Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, 160 pp., $21.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Plato Papers'' is a serious divertissement, a brilliant
fabulation that is the product of a playful, engaged, and
well-stocked mind.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ackroyd, biographer of Charles Dickens, T. S. Eliot,
William Blake, and Sir Thomas More, and the author of nine vigorous
novels, has written ``The Plato Papers'' as a dialogue, or a
conversation. Plato appears not in his own time, but circa 3700 AD.
His personality is as we know it; his manner of thinking and his
characteristic metaphorical cast of mind are familiar. But he is
working on different materials.
</P>
<P>
   In this future London, after the sun has gone out, Plato is the
orator of a civilization that is as free in its way as his own was,
and as ours is _ but also as repressive. He is the official orator
of the civilization, and he is very interested in a past about
which very little is known, and in which the other citizens take
very little interest, beyond repeating received opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The most entertaining parts of the book contain Plato's
ruminations about the artifacts of earlier eras. There is ``The
Origin of the Species,'' a few torn pages of which remain. Some of
the author's name has been eradicated _ Plato knows only Charles D.
and assumes these pages come from a comic novel by Charles Dickens,
whose name is known but whose works have not survived. Later he
analyzes America from the sole remaining evidence of this vanished
civilization, ``Tales and Histories'' of E. A. Poe (``Eminent
American Poet?'' Plato conjectures). Some pages of Freud survive,
and Plato tells us the name was no doubt pronounced ``Fraud'' and
analyzes the Oedipus myth in terms of pantomime comedy. ``He also
adopted a peculiarily rapid and sliding walk known to devotees as
`the Freudian slip.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and most revealing of all, Plato studies ``a long strip
of images, embossed upon some pliable material'' which was found
among the ruins of the south bank. ``Two words have been
reconstructed:`Hitchcock' and `Frenzy' and five diverting pages of
analysis of the images follow. ``He must be the only inhabitant of
this bottle-chamber, since his name is inscribed upon a frosted
glass exterior; he is called Nell Gwyn. Immediately opposite him
dwells Henrietta Street, who cannot be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Plato is not orating, or engaging in dialogue with his
friends, playmates from his childhood, even his kittenish soul, he
is engaged withcompiling a glossary of the old language:
``Economics: an ancient science, devoted to reducing all phenomena
to their smallest and most niggardly point. Hence `to practise
economy' was synonymous with `miserliness.' '' ``Literature: a word
of unknown provenance, generally attributed to `litter' or waste.''
</P>
<P>
   In the later parts of the book, Plato makes his journey to the
underworld, his cave, where he learns how little he knows and how
little his own society wants to know. Then there is a trial; Plato
is ``charged with corrupting the young by spinning lies and
fables.'' In the end there is ``the judgment upon Plato,'' which is
a much less serious matter than Plato's judgment upon himself.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ackroyd's book is intricately amusing because the satire
cuts in so many different directions, simultaneously; some of it is
piercingly sad because in the crazed glass of the mirror Ackroyd
holds up, we see ourselves _ and not just our temporal follies, but
our permanent ones. ``The Plato Papers'' is a little book, like
Samuel Johnson's ``Rasselas'' or Voltaire's ``Candide''; like those
precursors, not to mention the Dialogues of Plato themselves, it
unleashes large, tolling resonances that laughter can't quite cover
up.

AH, ROMANCE! AH, ISRAEL! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Israel has no shortage of romantic spots. Here are a few
suggestions from Janet Kaplan, the coauthor of ``The Underground
Jerusalem Guide'' and ``The Underground Tel Aviv Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   --Jerusalem's Haas Promenade at sunset. It will hardly be just
the two of you, but, says Kaplan, the view of the old and new city
combined ``is so sweepingly beautiful that whoever else is around
won't matter.'' And the nearby Taverna Restaurant has a fireplace
and fine food. Call 02-671-9766.
</P>
<P>
   --Ein Soreq, about 13 miles from Jerusalem, is a huge cave
inside the Avshalom Nature Reserve. The stalactites and stalagmites
are about 20 million years old and ``form a great big natural
Rorshach onto which it's easy to project!''
</P>
<P>
   --It's slow and inconvenient, but one train a day ``meanders
through picturesque hillscapes between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.'' Be
sure to phone ahead: 02-673-3764.
</P>
<P>
   --The cool wine cellar of Tel Aviv's Prego Restaurant is
accessed by climbing down a ladder. It features a dining room for
two ``where you can be blissfully alone (except for the waiter).''
The restaurant is at 9 Rothschild Boulevard; call 03-566-093.
</P>
<P>
   --Israel's beaches are at their most romantic in winter, with
their great cliffs, sand dunes, and grassy slopes. Says Kaplan:
``Even in the heart of Tel Aviv, you can walk arm-in-arm, hearing
only the waves.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: In Hebrew it is called the Sea of Salt. What do we
know it as? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Go through Zion, walk around her country, counting her
towers, admiring her walls, reviewing her palaces; then tell the
next generation that God is here'' _ Psalms 48:12-13. &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: The Canada Center is in Metulla, known as Israel's north
pole. The center features an ice-skating rink _ with real ice. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cash in the air: El Al Israel Airlines is providing a new on-board
currency exchange service, using an Aero-Cash machine, developed in
Ireland. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Time Travel: Jerusalem's 4,000-year-old history is told with a
twist _ and a turn or two _ in a 30-minute simulator ride at Beit
Agron in the heart of the city. Participants sit in high-backed
seats and plunge and bounce and ricochet through the city's
history, shown on gaint panoramic screens. ``Time Elevator:
Jerusalem'' is shown every half-hour at Beit Agron, 37 Hillel St.
But if you can't make it to Jerusalem right away, the progam is
also shown at the Israel exhibit in Millennium Village at Walt
Disney World's Epcot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Off duty: Golf balls purchased by US travelers overseas are duty
free only if they're from Israel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? The Dead Sea. (With thanks to Atmosphere, the El
Al in-flight magazine, via frequent contributor Dave Smith of El Al
New England, who notes that the airline may well be the only one
with a name inspired by a biblical passage (``And they shall call
them to the skies.'').

A PILGRIM'S PATH 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Religious pilgrims have journeyed through the Holy
Land since the beginning of history.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place of hope and faith for the world's three
monotheistic religions, and to this day believers of Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam ascend its rocky, terraced hillsides to see
the sites of the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   From the earliest days, Jews went to Jerusalem to stand before
God. By the year 300 BC, huge crowds from all over the
Mediterranean and the Near East would gather for the feasts of
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus himself was a pilgrim in some ways. He traveled from the
Galilee to Jerusalem during the feast of Passover. At the time
Jesus would have been in Jerusalem, historians estimate that
pilgrimages for feast days tripled the population of the city from
40,000 to 120,000 as believers of the Jewish faith flocked to the
Temple Mount to pray and make sacrificial offerings to God. This is
why tradition holds Jesus stayed over the Mount of Olives in
Bethany, before he was arrested and crucified.
</P>
<P>
   The first known Christian pilgrim to arrive just after
Constantine recognized Christianity within the Roman Empire in the
early fourth century was known as the Anonymous Pilgrim from
Bordeaux who arrived in AD 333. He left the first known pilgrimage
diary but his name was lost to history.
</P>
<P>
   There were other legendary pilgrims in the Byzantine era, such
as the monk John Moschos who set off on a journey from the shores
of the Bosphorus through the Judean wilderness and the sand dunes
of Egypt in AD 587.
</P>
<P>
   In the Golden Age of Islam in the 10th century, Muslims would
gather here from around the Arab world to see the Dome of the Rock,
the third holiest site in Islam where it is believed the Prophet
Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer's Canterbury Tales speak of how the Christian ideal was
life led as a pilgrimage, the ``glorious pilgrimage to the
celestial Jerusalem'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has found pilgrimage to the Holy Land celestial.
Mark Twain certainly didn't when he traveled here in 1867 and
mocked what he saw as filth and false piety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lepers, cripples, the blind, and the idiotic assail you on
every hand. . . . Jerusalem is mournful, dreary, lifeless. I would
not desire to live here,'' he wrote in ``The Innocents Abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether you're a curious cynic or a faithful pilgrim, if you
are looking into booking flights and find yourself reading travel
guides about Israel, you should know you are part of a continuum of
history.
</P>
<P>
   And you should know you will not be alone.
</P>
<P>
   This year is expected to bring numbers of pilgrims that even the
Holy Land has never seen before. As Christianity celebrates the
2000th anniversary of the faith, more than 3 million tourists
largely from Europe and America are expected to come to the Holy
Land over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the projections prove true, it would be a 50 percent increase
over the highest year of tourism ever in Israel, which was at the
height of good feeling about the Middle East peace process in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials here had been expecting big numbers for New
Year's 2000 but they didn't pan out. Tourism officials say that
hotel occupancy was at about 60 percent over Christmas and New
Year's Day. It seems the hype and hysteria of millennial fears of
violence or chaos left travelers shying from the Holy Land. But if
Israel's Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak is correct, the flood
of tourists will begin in spring and continue steadily until the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   So you will need to plan ahead. And you should be realistic.
Because the Holy Land exists in many minds as an idealized image of
beauty and peace, traveling here can be disappointing. It can be
crowded and litter-strewn and the injustices of a place where you
see the Israeli-Arab conflict with your own eyes can be jarring. It
is not dangerous, certainly not any more than, say, New York City.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of package tours available, but you may find it
more rewarding to do some research and set up your own journey.
</P>
<P>
   This article is intended to be give you one planned journey
through the Holy Land that would trace the footsteps of Jesus.
There are some suggestions that include expensive hotels, but also
offer a few budget alternatives as well. Because this year marks
the 2,000th anniversary of the Christian faith, this is for
Christian travelers or any one else interested in exploring the
life of Jesus and where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not explore the beautiful Muslim shrine of the Dome
of the Rock or the massive Herodian stones of the Western Wall, the
most sacred site of Judaism. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Planning &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Land will be crowded this year, and booking flights and
hotels well in advance is advisable. Keep in mind that the pope is
expected to visit during the Feast of the Annunciation on March 26,
and in and around that time hotels likely will be packed with
Catholic pilgrims from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Having a tour guide who knows Christian sites well or attending
a Bible study during your stay can make a world of difference in
your experience. The Bible College in Bethlehem is a good resource
for finding out about both. The Christian Information Center,
located inside Jaffa Gate in the Old City, is also a good place to
start. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting situated &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After surviving the exasperating security delays at Israel's Ben
Gurion International Airport, head to Jerusalem and set up base.
There are scores of hotels _ from low budget to fantastically
expensive _ from which to choose. If you can afford it, one of the
greatest hotels of the Middle East is the American Colony Hotel in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The American Colony is legendary for its hospitality and warmth,
and a favorite of foreign correspondents and diplomats. The
courtyard with its Arab architecture and serene setting is paradise
amid the often tiring buzz of Jerusalem. Relax to the sound of the
fountains and birds chirping in the beautiful gardens as you sip
strong Turkish coffee or mint tea, or an excellent
Palestinian-brewed beer called Taybeh and get steeped in the
history of Jerusalem and how this hotel figures into it. There is a
museum in the lobby that tells the history of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   With rooms at $250 a night, you may need to just enjoy a Taybeh
in the American Colony's courtyard and perhaps have dinner there,
and then look for a more affordable accommodation. One very
interesting and reasonably priced option can be found in the
variety of hospices and hostels run by various Christian
denominations in Jerusalem. The hospices are from the days when
pilgrims would need to convalesce from their long journeys, and
they were a kind of mix of hospitals and hotels. My favorite is the
Austrian Hospice, where a double room costs about $40 a night, and
is run by the Austrian Catholics. It is inside the Old City. The
first part of the hotel you see is a battered, wooden door along
the Via Dolorosa, the path that tradition holds Jesus carried the
cross.
</P>
<P>
   But once inside the grounds, you are embraced by the quiet
garden entrance, the elegant architecture of the hallways, the
Viennese coffee shop, and the small but beautiful Catholic chapel.
The rooms are spartan with only single beds, but they are
meticulously clean. The view from the rooftop is among the best in
the city, and at sunset the sites and sounds of the three faiths
mingle before you on the cobblestone pathways. The Muslim call to
prayer flows into the church bells as groups of Orthodox Jews rush
to sunset prayers at the Western Wall. &QL;

A CHILLY RECEPTION IN ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here we are again in the sports capital of America.
Sad, but true. In the last decade, Peachtree/Coca-Cola City has
played host to one Olympics, five World Series, and two Super
Bowls. Good thing Atlanta didn't get the Ryder Cup. Think of the
abuse local hurler John Rocker might have heaped on those sensitive
European duffers.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Billy Payne brought the Summer Games and where
Michael Johnson and America's women (softball, soccer, basketball)
dominated the world. It's where Kerri Strug landed the vault, where
Michelle Smith cheated in the pool, and where the bomb went off in
Centennial Park. It's where Richard Jewell may someday own the
local newspaper. It's where Ted and Jane (now splitsville) led the
moronic Tomahawk Chop and where Jim Leyritz hit the home run that
started the Yankee dominance of the Braves. It's where the Cowboys
beat the Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII and where the Tennessee Titans
and St. Louis Rams will joust in America's 34th festival of
corporate and professional sports gluttony Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Olympics were snarled by bad planning, but this time
an act of God has intervened. They're calling it IceJam 2000.
Schools were closed in most of the area Monday and crews were
working to restore electricity to a half-million locals who were
blacked out by a Sunday morning ice storm.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's massive airport was a mess most of the weekend. Small
wonder. It's tough to de-ice 400 aircraft with two space heaters
and a squirt gun filled with hot water. A local radio nitwit told
listeners that he was attempting to heat his powerless home with
charcoal briquettes. Snow fell in Atlanta early Monday afternoon.
The city is paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The ice eventually will melt, and when it does, the Super Bowl
will still be in Atlanta and the matchup will still feature the
nameless, faceless, tradition-starved Titans and Rams. Think those
zillion dot-com companies will be glad they paid millions in TV ads
for this dog? Local authorities have been instructed to keep ABC
executives away from all bridges and sharp objects.
</P>
<P>
   The local economy figures to enjoy the normal bounce. The
general manager of the Cheetah strip club in Midtown told the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he's hired 100 extra dancers for
Super Bowl week. ``We've got some fine talent coming in from all
over the country,'' said the confident GM.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine how this game is playing in Houston and Los Angeles
_ the true homes of the Titans and Rams. It's got to hurt. Until
now, the Houston Oilers franchise was the only one of the original
AFL eight that hadn't made it to a Super Bowl. The Oilers won the
first two AFL titles but had to leave Texas to make it to a Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Houston owner Bud Adams co-founded the AFL (with Lamar Hunt) and
has hair that only Donald Trump could envy. He's finally in the the
Big Game, but he had to go through Memphis and Vanderbilt Stadium
first. Meanwhile, urban cowboys back in the land of Roger Clemens
must be frustrated. They suffered through some disappointing
playoff moments, including Mike Renfro's disallowed TD catch in the
'79 AFC championship, John Elway's dramatic comeback in the '91
playoffs, and the blown 35-3 lead over Buffalo a year later. They
survived Jerry Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nashville gets to reap the reward. Tennessee has had a pro
football team for three years, Nashville for two. Nashville winning
a Super Bowl would be like the Florida Marlins winning the World
Series in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)We've waited so long.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to feel sorry for alleged sports fans in Los Angeles.
The city did lose both of its football teams, but LA is still more
worthy of a Super Bowl trophy than St. Louis. The Rams played in
Los Angeles for half a century. They had George Allen, Deacon
Jones, Merlin Olsen, and Roman Gabriel. They had Warren Beatty in
``Heaven Can Wait.'' They represented Los Angeles in the 1980 Super
Bowl, losing to the Steelers in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis paid its grid dues with the woeful Cardinals, but the
city never won a home football playoff game until the Rams came to
town. And remember six years ago when the city was bidding for NFL
teams? They wanted the Patriots, and it might have happened if not
for Bob ``Here I Come To Save The Day'' Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis Rams'' just doesn't sound right. Teams should change
names when they change cities. The Colts should have become the
Indy Autoracers when they left Baltimore. That's why the Titans did
the right thing dumping ``Oilers,'' just as the Browns were wise to
become the Ravens when they left Cleveland for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is no Game Interrupted. For only the second time
in 16 years, the Super Bowl will be played one week after the
conference championships. For Tennessee Titans vs. St. Louis Rams,
one week of hype is plenty.

VETERAN WR PROEHL WISTFUL ABOUT RAM SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Snow and cold _ strange weather for a Super Bowl _
beat the St. Louis Rams to Dixie by a few hours, but St. Louis wide
receiver Ricky Proehl was still basking in the warmth of Sunday
evening, when his clutch touchdown catch enabled the Rams to head
South.
</P>
<P>
   Only a veteran could appreciate the true warmth of this
unexpected visit by the Rams to the Super Bowl. Only a man who had
labored year after year for a mediocre team, the Arizona Cardinals,
and spent the last Sunday of every January watching others play in
the Super Bowl could appreciate the meaning of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want it any other way,'' said Proehl, his eyes
almost glazed with the amazement of finally making a Super Bowl
trip. ``You play for nine years and the best you do is 8-8 and then
you have a year like this that is so confounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Proehl is the epitome of the ``possession'' receiver _ Troy
Brown of the Patriots and Wayne Chrebet of the Jets are two
familiar names in the same role _ and his job is to make the catch
that has to be made on third downs.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Rams so explosive on offense, Proehl had been moved
down on the ``passing tree'' that marks the Rams' attack.
Quarterback Kurt Warner looks first at the top limb _ wide receiver
Isaac Bruce _ and then the next limbs down, Torry Holt and Az-Zahir
Hakim, and then to those stout middle limbs of running back
Marshall Faulk and tight end Roland Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Proehl, down there on the bottom limb, had not caught a
touchdown pass this season until Sunday's NFC Championship game.
And it wasn't until the fourth quarter of the game _ with the Rams
trailing, 6-5, and less than five minutes left _ that Proehl made
an acrobatic catch in the end zone over Tampa Bay cornerback Brian
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is always there when you most need him,'' marveled
Bruce, ``and when that ball was in the air, I was praying, `Ricky
come down with that ball.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Proehl did, as he has done for years and years. On a day when
all the flash of the Rams' offense _ Warner, Bruce, Faulk, and Holt
_ was sandpapered dull by a physical Tampa Bay defense, it was
Proehl who rose from the mists of obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that you appreciate it more when you've put in all
the years I have,'' said Proehl, who left New Jersey for Wake
Forest and is now in his 10th year in the NFL. ``These young guys
you see all around here, they don't realize how hard it is to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, they don't. In the locker room after the game, rookie
cornerback Dre Bly was chattering away about his fourth-quarter
interception of a Shaun King pass, as if he'll be making those
plays every year to propel the Rams into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Same with Holt, another rookie, but it was the veterans such as
safety Keith Lyle and cornerback Todd Lyght who seemed overcome by
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   And Proehl seemed the most moved of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is with these rookies, and the second- and
third-year guys,'' said Proehl. ``They think it'll be like this
every year. But it's so hard to get to this point. I'm so
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Proehl, ``If I was going to do it any way, I'd rather
do it in my 10th year than in my first year. Now you know what it
means and how much you've put in to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Missouri east of Columbia and that huge chunk of central
and southern Illinois just across that huge muddy river from the
Trans World Dome now have jumped on the Rams bandwagon, and Proehl
sees himself as symbolic of these Midwestern folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think of myself as a symbol of what St. Louis is all
about,'' said Proehl. ``Blue-collar people, you know, people who
work hard. I try to be consistent and just go out there every day.
Bring my lunch box out of the house every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the old saying? Good things come to people who work
hard. And that's the way I see myself and this pro football team.''
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time Sunday evening, Proehl stood by his locker,
his eyes glazed over in wonder and his words carefully chosen, not
wanting to move. Not wanting to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to savor every sweet moment.

ABC SAYS SIZE DOESN'T MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC officials are unfazed by the unlikely emergence of two teams
from relatively small media markets to play in Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis ranks 21st among the nation's markets, while Nashville
comes in at 30. Not since the first Super Bowl, when Green Bay
played Kansas City, have the teams hailed from smaller markets.
</P>
<P>
   ABC officials are banking on viewers being drawn in even though
the teams are relative unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many fresh faces and stories, this Super Bowl could be
one of the most interesting in recent memory,'' said ABC spokesman
Mark Mandel. ``The fact that the two teams are not marquee names
won't be a factor at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandel is not just whistling Dixie. The Super Bowl is virtually
a national holiday, and most Americans will watch at least part of
the game. Tennessee? St. Louis? Doesn't matter. It likely will be
the most-watched television event of the year, as it has been for
more than a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sports president Sean McManus said television ratings for
the Super Bowl won't suffer because lesser-known teams are playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is relatively immune from big swings in
ratings,'' McManus said. ``Without national marquee teams in the
game, the ratings will be much more subject to the quality of the
game. It could mean a ratings point or two, but that won't make or
break the Super Bowl. It'll still be in the upper 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Tampa Bay-St. Louis NFC Championship game on Fox drew a
27.9 rating and 46 share nationally, a slight increase from last
year's championship game in the 4 p.m. slot (Jets-Broncos earned a
27.2 rating and 47 share).
</P>
<P>
   Numbers for the early game were a little down. The
Tennessee-Jacksonville AFC game on CBS earned a 24.2 rating and 47
share, down from last year's game between Minnesota and Atlanta,
which pulled a 26.1 rating and 52 share.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-rated Super Bowl was in 1982 when San Francisco beat
Cincinnati, 26-21. The game, on CBS, earned a 49.1 rating and
staggering 73 share. The lowest-rated game was the first Super
Bowl, which earned a 23.

</P>
<P>
   Well-covered
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ABC and its sister networks, ESPN and ESPN2, have already
blanketed Atlanta for coverage of Sunday's game. Al Michaels and
Boomer Esiason will call the game, which is scheduled to start at
6:18 p.m. Lesley Visser will work the sidelines. Chris Berman hosts
ABC's pregame, halftime, and postgame shows. The pregame show
starts at 2 p.m., which actually exhibits a bit of restraint from
years past. Berman will be joined by an array of folks, including
Steve Young, Brent Musburger, Jim McKay, Bob Griese, Dan Fouts,
Lynn Swann, Robin Roberts, Mike Tirico, Jimmy Roberts, Andrea
Kremer, Chris Mortensen, Beano Cook and ``Good Morning, America''
host Charles Gibson.

<P>
   The nitpicking call overturning a catch by Bert Emanuel at the
Rams' 22-yard line on Tampa Bay's final drive prompted a complaint
about instant replay from CNN/SI's Trev Alberts. ``It changed the
momentum of the game,'' Alberts said. ``Tampa Bay was on a roll.
They had the Rams on their heels and then the call. I thought
instant replay was supposed to take away the human element. But
overturning the play was not insignificant. It was ridiculous,
horrible, and unfair.'' . . . HBO Sports has begun production on
``Bill Russell: My Life, My Way,'' a documentary on arguably the
greatest basketball player in the history of the game. HBO Sports
senior vice president Ross Greenburg said the hourlong feature will
debut April 17 at 10 p.m. and include interviews with Red Auerbach,
Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Jim Brown, Jerry West, K.C. Jones, Tommy
Heinsohn, John Thompson, and Satch Sanders . . . HBO Sports airs
the Oscar De La Hoya-Derrell Coley fight Feb. 26. Jim Lampley,
Larry Merchant, and George Foreman call the fight from Madison
Square Garden . . . The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters
Association voted ESPN's Dan Patrick sportscaster of the year.

MAINE SEEKS WAY OUT OF VOICE-MAIL MAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his waning days as a legislator in Maine, Leo Kieffer of
Caribou was looking forward to spending his seventh decade in
private life, but not without asserting one thing once and for all:
that the citizens of Maine who make telephone calls to government
have the inalienable right to speak to a human being.
</P>
<P>
   With LD 2176 _ ``An Act to Prohibit State Government from Using
Automated Telephone Answering Equipment During Business Hours'' _
Kieffer staked out radical territory, proposing to curb the
state-of-the-art ``auto-attendants'' that, many complain, send
callers into a maddening maze of recorded greetings and voice-mail
cul-de-sacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing that when you get up to testify about
it, just about everyone on the committee started nodding their
heads,'' said Jim McGregor of the Maine Merchants' Association, who
testified for the bill. ``I can't think of any better expenditure
of government money than to have a live person answering the
phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Carried over from the last legislative session, Kieffer's bill
last week prompted a compromise agreement, in which the state
Department of Administrative and Financial Services will work with
government agencies to make sure, among other things, that callers
always have the option of pressing ``O'' and conversing with a
human.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 10 years after automated answering services began edging
out the busy signal, grumbling over ``voice mail hell'' has erupted
into legislation in several spots. Before the State Government
Committee of the Kentucky House is House Bill 57, ``An Act Relating
to Telephone Communications with State Government Entities,'' which
would ensure that all incoming calls are initially answered by an
employee.
</P>
<P>
   A paragraph in the federal budget bill that President Clinton
signed in November laid down the law to the National Park Service,
the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the
Indian Health Service, among other agencies: No answering machines
without the ready option of human contact.
</P>
<P>
   In the office of US Representative Ralph Regula, Republican of
Ohio, where the answering machine provision originated, staff
members didn't think they were doing anything sensational.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told my colleagues I was going to put this in, they
thought I was crazy,'' said one staff member, who asked not to be
identified. But the complaints kept coming in from constituents,
``saying we can't get through to the people at the Department of
the Interior, and I know that's true, because we can't get through,
and we're doing their doggone budget. The world's just gotten
totally impersonal.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rosen, a University of California psychologist and author
of ``Technostress: Coping with Technology (at)Work (at)Home
(at)Play,'' sees voice-mail frustration as a typical reaction to
new technology, and recalls many instances when recorded messages
worked perfectly for him. He recommends that people keep a ready
supply of reading material when they think they might be stuck in
voice mail. But he also ``wouldn't be surprised if it became a
national issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is people showing their technostress _
they're saying, `No technology here. I'm willing to have my house
run by technology, I'm willing to have this and this and this, but
not here,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to complaints like these, both state and federal
agencies are faced with the fact that the people who used to answer
the phones have already disappeared from America's offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personnel costs would be enormous'' if the state of Maine
were to guarantee that every ringing phone were answered by a
person, said Charlie Jacobs, deputy commissioner of Maine's
Department of Administrative and Financial Services. And it might
not improve customer service, he added. ``There certainly was a
time when answering machines weren't there, and much more
traditionally, you would call up and get a lot of busy signals.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three months, Jacobs will work with individual
departments to guard against ``layered systems,'' in which a caller
chooses among numerous options only to be faced with even more
options. In addition, he will make sure that callers always have
the option of talking to a live person by pressing ``O.''
</P>
<P>
   But those changes are not likely to satisfy McGregor, chief of
staff to Governor James Longley Sr. in the late 1970s. When he left
government work, McGregor said, he was asked what one thing he
would do differently, given the chance. He said, ``I think I'd find
me 25 very good listeners and put them in a phone bank.''
</P>
<P>
   When people called executive offices, he said, ``they mainly
wanted someone to listen to them. A lot of their problems, there
was really nothing to be done . . . it was clear they were very
frustrated and wanted someone to talk to, even if they couldn't do
anything.''

A WARNING TO BATTLING SPOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the annals of bitter divorces, Basel v. Basel was ugly enough
to inspire Holocaust metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 1/2-year court battle that Teren Basel endured during her
divorce from her husband, Peter _ who tried, unsuccessfully, to
paint her as a drunk, a drug addict, and a child abuser _ is
described by her lawyer, Gerald Nissenbaum, as ``a trip to a
concentration camp that she survived by the skin of her teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, the lengthy litigation had cost more
than $600,000 in legal fees, half of which was paid by Peter's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the end, he lost almost everything, including his
Bolton, Mass. home and custody of his two young children. But it
was a one-sentence ruling by the Worcester probate judge who
oversaw the case that has stunned lawyers across the state: Saying
Peter Basel had waged a ``calculated campaign of outrageous
behavior to destroy (his) wife's credibility,'' the judge ordered
him to pay $100,000 of his ex-wife's attorney's fees.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the order _ which appears to be unprecedented in
Massachusetts _ has many divorce attorneys wondering if Basel v.
Basel is a cautionary tale for battling spouses everywhere, a
signal that no-holds-barred custody fights can cost them not only
the children, but lots of cash as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the judge definitely wanted to send a message,'' said
Elaine Epstein, a family law practitioner in Boston, ``and that
message is that if you wage this kind of frivolous campaign and
have unlimited funds to do it, you run the risk of paying the
freight for the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   The viciousness of Peter and Teren Basel's legal struggle is far
from rare. Nasty allegations are routinely tossed around in bitter
divorce cases, particularly those where children are involved. As a
result, lawyers and legal specialists predict reverberations far
beyond the circumstances of the Basels' collapsed marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for courts to assess attorneys' fees. It is
often done when one spouse's assets vastly outweigh the other's,
and the wealthier spouse is ordered to help pay the other's legal
bills.
</P>
<P>
   But probate court judges have historically been reluctant to
assess hefty fees in cases like Basel v. Basel, where litigation is
found to be frivolous, because they have often been reversed on
appeal, according to Boston divorce lawyer Monroe Inker, who
originally represented Peter Basel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Basel case and others like it _ including the recent
Krock v. Krock, in which a probate judge awarded $81,000 in
attorney fees when a wife was found to have engaged in frivolous
litigation _ signal that the tide may be turning, Inker said.
</P>
<P>
   It may take the sort of heavy penalty imposed in the Basel case
to persuade some estranged husbands and wives not to use their
divorce case ``to go on some sort of bizarre crusade to destroy the
other side,'' said Peter Zupcofska, vice chairman of the Boston Bar
Association's family law section.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joseph Lian Jr.'s ruling on attorney fees seems to signal
that ``if the litigation that's waged is clearly done to harass,
harangue, and intimidate the other party, and to create a kind of
economic slavery by utilizing vast amounts of marital funds in a
really destructive way,'' Zupcofska said, ``then the judge is going
to do something to redress that imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some family law practitioners say that the outcome of the Basel
case may also be intended as a wake-up call to them, a reminder to
evaluate the merits of a client's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Basel case, voluminous court records tell the depressing
tale of the unraveling of a marriage seemingly doomed from its
inception in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Peter and his parents frequently
humiliated and denigrated Teren in front of the couple's two sons,
now 8 and 5, calling her a ``bad mother'' and ``ill-bred.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Teren received an abuse protection order from
Bolton police and asked that she be placed in a safe house because
she feared living with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Peter, in turn, charged Teren with drinking heavily, using
marijuana, and abusing their children. He accused her of frequent
``raging,'' which he cited as evidence of mental instability.
</P>
<P>
   But in his findings, Lian wrote that ``Peter's controlling
behavior . . . substantially contributed to the breakdown of this
marriage'' and that ``(e)very step of this divorce was complicated
by the husband's attempts to destroy the wife's credibility, and
his actions substantially prolonged this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lian also concluded that Teren did not abuse alcohol or
marijuana, did not abuse her children, and was not ``emotionally
unfit to care for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   When the divorce was finalized, Peter and Teren Basel together
had run up more than $600,000 in attorneys' fees. Peter Basel paid
his bill with substantial help from his parents, a Connecticut
couple estimated to have a net worth of $4.6 million, according to
court documents.
</P>
<P>
   To pay her legal bills, Teren Basel borrowed $50,000 from a bank
and $10,000 from her brother-in-law, according to Nissenbaum, but
still owed $200,000, some of which is still outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his decision to assess Peter Basel $100,000 of his
wife's attorney's fees, Lian wrote that Teren's legal bills were
``a direct result of the husband's manipulative, nefarious conduct
as it relates to his fraudulent portrayal of his wife as an unfit
parent.''
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of language from a judge, family law practitioners
say, sends a clear message. ``You can no longer assume that having
money gives you the right to wage these frivolous, scorched-earth
campaigns without risking paying the price for the other side,''
said Epstein. ``And if you do, you do so at your own peril.''

NEW HAMPSHIRE FEVER

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; DES MOINES &UR;  &LR;  _ At first George W. Bush _ front-runner and
president-in-waiting _ planned to sleep in this morning, savor his
Iowa rewards, chat with the press a bit, and then head toward New
Hampshire around noon for a triumphal arrival in time for the early
evening news in Boston and Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   But then his people learned that the other front-runner, Al
Gore, understood days ago that the only chance a front-runner has
down the stretch in New Hampshire is to behave as if he were
trailing badly and facing humiliation. It's not just a convenient
pose; it's more likely to be a fact.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushies were also reminded, by their own as well as the
media's relentless polling, that one tough hombre named John McCain
awaits.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is a big battleship _ powerful, but very slow
to turn _ but on short notice it changed course as if it were a PT
boat, in deference to what ought to be the first rule of Iowa
Caucuses Night: say thank you politely and then sprint for the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and now Bush accordingly slipped into New Hampshire in
the middle of the night, having already preened for the late local
news, so that when day broke this morning their flags were clearly
planted. They won't slow down until after nightfall, and neither
will their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The smart ones who have dough will have fresh ads on Boston and
Manchester television by the evening news, and all of them will
dash around the state _ their motorcades literally passing each
other on Routes 3 and 101 and the interstates _ in the company of
hordes of newspeople who will give new meaning to the word
intrusive _ in a desperate scramble to make a strong first
impression.
</P>
<P>
   When today mercifully ends, you might ask yourself two
questions: Who was heard clearly over the din? And can you remember
the essence of what anybody had to say?
</P>
<P>
   If what you heard was mostly about Iowa or a candidate's
political standing, chances are you were hearing a loser. If what
you heard bore some passing relevance to you, chances are the guy
understands what's ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   All this frenetic activity is in deference to what is arguably
the weirdest and wildest of all the weird and wild days in
presidential politics. To use a theater analogy, it's as if a major
production struck its set in London one night and opened on
Broadway the next. The difference is that this is more like the
circus than Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   It's been like this since 1984, when the Iowa caucusing and the
New Hampshire voting were first compressed by sadists into an
eight-day period that offers the storied winnowing of the field on
the front end and the prospect of public deaths on the back end.
</P>
<P>
   With time out for 1992 _ when Pat Buchanan's brigades
(foreshadowing McCain) decided to punt in Iowa and take on
President George Bush in New Hampshire, and when an Iowan (Senator
Tom Harkin) was running in the Democratic race _ this is the fourth
spin around the track and only the second after 1988 with
legitimate races in each party.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, it will be even weirder and wilder.
</P>
<P>
   After today's assault on the senses, some super-sadist has
arranged for the candidates in both parties to hold their final
debate before the primary on the same evening. Call it
Debate-O-Rama, worthy (if that's the right word) of the World
Wrestling Federation, but keep your seat belt fastened for this
one. If you find yourself comparing Bill Bradley's health care plan
with Alan Keyes's, you may not be alone.
</P>
<P>
   And then, on Thursday, President Clinton will again confound the
people in politics and my racket who have been declaring him
irrelevant off and on with five years of monotonous inaccuracy. His
final State of the Union address, with this guy named Gore seated
above and to his right, will not only set most of the national
policy agenda for this year; it will also set much of the table for
the presidential campaign to succeed him, as will the response this
week and in the months to come of the Republican congressional
leadership (there's a contradiction in terms).
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the nationally televised address will both
dominate and confuse another news cycle in New Hampshire. Everybody
running will ignore it at his peril, but each candidate will once
again face the challenge of being heard above the din.
</P>
<P>
   And then, the final weekend will be upon them.
</P>
<P>
   The days of long, almost leisurely New Hampshire campaigns are
long gone. In their place are two phases: one, like Iowa, when you
can put together an organization and make a decent impression; and
the final week's sprint, dominated by quick bursts of media
messaging, when almost anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   The post-1980 winners of the contested races (Gary Hart, Mike
Dukakis, George Bush pere, and Pat Buchanan), forgetting '92, all
had established themselves ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   But woe unto those who start the final week too slowly, too
confidently or both. The ghosts of Fritz Mondale and Bob Dole
(twice), of Pat Robertson and Lamar Alexander and Dick Gephardt and
Paul Simon are as eloquent as Bobby Burns on what can happen to
best laid plans.
</P>
<P>
   The key is the transition game. Until yesterday Iowa seemed like
everything; today it is nothing. Yesterday, the action was retail;
today, it is irretrievably wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   The setting may be New England, but it might as well be
California.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy.
</P>

THE MIGHT OF MORPHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some verbs, like personalize and impact, spend decades hacking
their way into the lexicon; others, like snuck, sneak in behind our
backs. But a handful come right through the front door and make
themselves at home, and morph, which arrived a mere decade ago, is
one of those fortunate few.
</P>
<P>
   Morph rode in with the ``Terminator 2'' generation of movie
special effects, and so natural did it seem that even its early
users rarely put the word in quotation marks. It's everywhere now,
both in its original, technical sense of a seamless visual
transformation (``The Bush campaign . . . runs an ad showing
McCain's face morphing into that of President Clinton'') and in
figurative senses (``They watch in horror as Swift's once-positive
image as the state's most powerful working mother morphs into that
of an arrogant politician'').
</P>
<P>
   Morph was probably helped along by its computer pedigree: It
looks like a new word for a new digital process. But functionally,
it's just an abbreviation of metamorphose _ and a welcome one,
considering how that verb was mangled (metaphorphize?
metamorphosize?) in the hands of amateurs. Metaphorphose's roots
are the Greek for ``change'' and ``shape''; thus the god of dreams
_ wherein your mother and your cat can inhabit the same body, and
your house can grow new rooms _ was Morpheus.
</P>
<P>
   But morph may already be blurring its boundaries. A while back,
Jim Acton of Newton e-mailed to ask about a news story in which a
school ``morphed from a building of low morale to a place where a
passion for learning was never higher.'' Aside from the objection
that morph wasn't in his dictionary, Acton wondered if the verb was
appropriate when the building hadn't changed its shape.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of physical form, after all, remains strong in morph
and metamorphose (see morpheme, morphology, and amorphous). Zeus
morphed, obviously and promiscuously, when he turned into a bull, a
swan, or a cuckoo in pursuit of female prey; and the kissed frog
truly morphs into a prince. But Cinderella doesn't morph _ at the
end of the story, she's the same adorable ingenue as before, in a
better dress. The Incredible Hulk morphed, but the Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers, despite their name, kept their human shapes. And
Superman certainly didn't morph; he just slipped into that Spandex
he somehow got hold of decades before anyone else was wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if morph wants to morph into pallid metaphor, there's
no stopping it. Keep insisting on the literal meaning once the
consensus has moved on, and you'll be called a victim of the
etymological fallacy _ the belief that some past meaning is the
only proper meaning of a word. EF victims are the people who say
that since shambles was once a slaughterhouse, it's inappropriate
as a description of a teenager's room. (Never mind that long before
that, a shamble was just a footstool.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if morph is stretched too thin by figurative overuse, we
can just coin another sturdy verb _ say, by snatching mog from the
middle of transmogrify, meaning ``to transform . . . especially in
a strange or grotesque manner.'' There are no etymological fences
around this one: Nobody, it seems, knows the origins of the strange
transmogrify.

PORTRAIT OF A REAL VILLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a determined rescue attempt perhaps only a few days away,
I'm not going to dwell any longer on the past at the Harvard
Pilgrim health plan _ not much, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I trust I've said enough to make the case that the state's
largest health maintainence organization had irregular management
and governance for the better part of a decade. Once the situation
is stable, a high priority should be assigned to developing
satisfying accounts of what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I did have a chance to talk by phone last week to a retired
hotel industry executive in sunny Arizona, Manuel Ferris. He says
that while serving as chief executive of Harvard Pilgrim, between
1991 and 1996, he paid Massachusetts taxes, voted here, and did
jury duty _ even though most Thursday afternoons he locked his Four
Seasons condo and went home to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to admire his citizenship and still doubt his
competence to manage an HMO in a period of rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   A fine specimen of the kind of going-over that the Harvard
Pilgrim case deserves is ``The Fall of the House of AHERF: The
Allegheny Bankrupty'' in the January-February issue of the journal
Health Affairs. It tells the story of nation's largest nonprofit
health care failure.
</P>
<P>
   It relates how a prosperous little Pittsburgh hospital mutated
into Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation in 1983
and, during the next 15 years, grew into a statewide chain of
hospitals and physicians' practices, complete with a bustling
medical school _ before going broke in July 1998, with $1.3 billion
in debt and 65,000 creditors.
</P>
<P>
   It was subsequently broken into halves, east and west, and sold
or merged.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Affairs account isn't as colorful as the six-part
series published a year ago by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette or the
two-part story by the Philadelphia Inquirer. It doesn't offer as
much insight into the motivations of the major players. But coming
later in the proceedings and pitched for a higher-level audience,
it's more authoritative.
</P>
<P>
   It was undertaken on behalf of the Association of Professors of
Medicine by a Wharton School professor (Lawton R. Burns), a fellow
of the University of Pennsylvania Medical School (John Cacciamani),
an Arthur Andersen consultant (James Clement), and a nurse manager
(Welman Aquino.)
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The CEO and his financial aide were to blame. True,
it was a strategically challenging time. The chain zigged when it
should have zagged, embarking on an ambitious strategy of rolling
up other hospitals and the physicians associated with them, just as
reimbursement from major payers dramatically contracted.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions increased the system's debt and competed for
capital, which sapped the stronger institutions and led to massive
cash transfers. Tricky accounting procedures _ internal subsidies,
hidden internal cash transfers, raids on hospital endowments, and
enormous debt _ facilitated the growth.
</P>
<P>
   The chief financial officer was of questionable integrity, the
authors say. The board failed to do its duty, permitting its
chairman _ a leading critic of the expansion _ to be run off by a
newly discovered ``three year term limit'' when he raised
objections.
</P>
<P>
   The accountants, the Coopers and Lybrand office in Pittsburgh,
gave AHERF a clean opinion in 1997, even though a large loan later
had to be restated. The hospital chain then fired Coopers just
before the next audit could be completed, slyly citing concerns
about its reliability. (Coopers had been found guilty of negligence
in 1996 in the Phar-Mor pharmacy fraud and embezzlement case.)
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem of all at AHERF was the chief executive,
Sherif Abdelhak, and the degree of protection Abdelhak enjoyed from
the aging William Penn Snyder III, the patriarch of the hospital
from which the chain grew.
</P>
<P>
   When the board finally awakened to the extent of their
empire-builder's machinations, in April 1998, they established a
board-level loan committee; when Abdelhak went behind their backs
again, they fired him.
</P>
<P>
   The problems at Harvard Pilgrim look to be pretty milk-toast
stuff, compared to this. At least so far, it seems mainly a tragedy
of hoping the problems would go away.

PENTAGON'S GANSLER SEEN KEY TO REVIVAL OF RAYTHEON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ One man who could revive Raytheon Co. hasn't
worked there fr 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques S. Gansler since then has done policy consulting for the
military and taught at Harvard University. Now he works in the
Pentagon as undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology,
and logistics.
</P>
<P>
   The job makes him, in effect, the single largest customer for
Raytheon, the struggling Lexington, Mass. defense contractor where
Gansler once designed Hawk ground-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes him a key salesman for Raytheon, which relies
heavily on federal help to market its weapons overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, such overseas military sales have slowed, sending
Raytheon's shares and profits into a tailspin that will be apparent
when the company announces its fourth-quarter earnings. Competitors
like Lockheed Martin Corp. face crises of their own, ruining what
was supposed to be a glorious era for military contractors
following a round of defense industry mergers.
</P>
<P>
   That period ended in 1998, a year into Gansler's tenure, when he
determined industry consolidation had gone far enough and helped
block a planned takeover of Northrop Grumman Corp. Now, continued
restructuring and perhaps some new procurement policies from the
government should restore the industry's financial health, Gansler
said. Last week, in response to defense companies' travails, he
appointed a panel to study steps the government might take to shore
up the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need better performance at lower cost,'' Gansler said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what regulatory changes might help Raytheon and others
is still unclear, however.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the idea of special treatment for defense companies
might be in tension with a chief aim of Gansler's career _ making
the defense industry more competitive by exposing it to market
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The notion, which Gansler dubs ``civil-military integration,''
calls for making more use of commercial products in weapons
systems. Using commercial technology is meant to improve the
military arsenal while lowering weapons costs overall, making
contractors more competitive and less dependent on foreign military
sales.
</P>
<P>
   But until that payoff arrives, Raytheon and other defense firms
are taking a beating.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's stock has plunged to less than a third of its value
since July as investors worry the company hasn't managed to
integrate new units and that it faces continued pressure from the
Pentagon. The troubles have also led to thousands of job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Such problems have provoked gripes from executives who regard
Gansler as a policy wonk who doesn't appreciate business
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a widespread perception among the people managing this
industry that he's too far removed from their world to understand
the consequences of his policies,'' said Loren Thompson, of the
Lexington Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kelman, a Harvard professor who once oversaw federal
procurement policies from the White House, said Gansler lacks
support from traditional defense-industry critics, like Senator
Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican. Grassley said Gansler hasn't
stressed accounting oversight enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said competition will reduce the need for oversight, and
that he can take the heat as a regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler's views are spelled out in three books he has written,
most recently ``Defense Conversion'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of opening up defense companies to competition runs
throughout much of his career, the bulk of which he spent at TASC
Inc., a government-consulting firm with offices in Reading that
specializes in intelligence and policy reviews.
</P>
<P>
   At TASC, Gansler tried to put his ideas into practice, serving
on a military procurement-review board during the Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's succeeded in crossing the boundary from pure theological
speculation to boring in to the policy work,'' said Bert Concklin,
head of the Professional Services Council, a trade group for
government consulting firms.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview at his office in the Pentagon, surrounded
by two aides and a press minder, Gansler used language that
recalled the ``reinventing government'' motto of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change the way we do business,'' he said, referring
to the government's procurement practices.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a directive Gansler signed last July made cost a
greater part of contracting requirements. Another success, he said,
was persuading the Army to outsource some of its computerized
logistics work.
</P>
<P>
   In the year left in the Clinton adminstration, Gansler said, he
intends to renew his campaign to streamline operations at military
bases. Finally, Gansler said, he has the military support to enact
this old idea, which could bring more pressure on Raytheon and
other contractors that run bases for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon and others must continue their campaigns to cut costs
as well, he said. For instance, he said, Raytheon has saved between
3 percent to 35 percent on some of its production costs by moving
certain missile-production work from Massachusetts to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The US military might turn to European suppliers more often, he
said, but such purchases must be reciprocated by foreign
governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard for them to do, and it's hard for us to do,'' he
said. If Europeans begin buying from their own companies, he said,
``they could potentially drift away from a real emphasis on NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   One test of Europe's intentions is a pending decision by the
British government on whose missiles it will buy to arm its new
Eurofighter warplane. With Gansler's help, Raytheon has been
pitching what it calls its ``beyond visual range air-to-air
missile.'' It would cost the British nearly $1.6 billion and
possibly set up Raytheon to supply the missile to France, Spain,
and Germany as well.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is a rival European consortium, jointly owned by
Britain's BAE Systems and by a French-controlled group,
Aerospatiale Matra. While Gansler has halted American mergers, the
link of these two groups represents a powerful European rival. A
British newspaper, The Guardian, has reported the European group
has already won the missile contract.
</P>
<P>
   British government officials didn't return phone calls, though
Raytheon still believes it has an inside track on the sale. One
sign: A review panel asked only one question of Raytheon but asked
many of the BAE-Aerospatiale, said Peter McKee, Raytheon's top
executive in London.
</P>
<P>
   A win at least would reassure investors that Raytheon's support
from Washington policymakers still matters, said Jim McAleese, a
McLean, Va., lawyer specializing in defense issues. That in turn
could make it easier for Gansler to insist on more cost-cutting at
home without spooking Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole industry is telling Jacques, `We're having to take
enormous risks, and you should eliminate some of that risk,' ''
McAleese said. ``What he should be saying back is, when you truly
become world-class in terms of facility closures, mid-level
management RIFs (`reductions-in-force,' or layoffs) and hard
program management, I'll meet you halfway'' by easing off demands
for more competition at home.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said it's not his place to speak about individual
companies, except to describe Raytheon's new chief executive,
Daniel Burnham, as ``a very confident manager.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he hopes investors will take account of the
industry's growing revenue and advanced technology to boost share
prices to levels of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a view expressed by his boss, Deputy Secretary of
Defense John Hamre, Gansler said he is baffled at the declining
value of defense stocks relative to shares in Internet companies.
Gansler called the start-ups ``things with no sales, minus profits,
and potential explosive growth, but most likely zero. If we said
`defense.com,' that probably would make us much more attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at that comparison and you say, something is really
wrong here,'' he said.

D'ANGELO RETURNS WITH SOULFUL `VOODOO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He came along like a soul savior with a sound straight out of
that dusty stack of 45s on the back shelf. The year was 1995, but
it could have been 1965 or 1975 for this was a voice from back in
the day, as smooth as Marvin Gaye, as subtle as Curtis Mayfield, as
love-drenched as Al Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you about this girl,'' he sang in the first line
of ``Brown Sugar,'' the title song of his debut album, and
immediately this was a voice that could convincingly tell you
anything. His music was sex and candy, secular and spiritual,
warmly familiar yet startlingly fresh. Some of the songs were so
good, they just seemed like they had to be covers, although there
was only one: Smokey Robinson's ``Crusin' .'' And like Smokey's,
this was a voice that could make you do things, make you desire
things you didn't even know you needed.
</P>
<P>
   At the impossibly young age of 20, Michael Archer, who the world
came to know as D'Angelo (his middle name), was anointed a messiah
of the 1990s neo-soul movement which has included Dionne Farris,
Maxwell, Erykah Badu, Tony Toni Tone, Me'Shell Ndegeocello, and
now, Angie Stone, and the wonderful Macy Gray. While fueled by
modern sensibilities, their music harkens back to the sweet soul
harmonies and arrangements of a time gone by, when R&AMP;B singers
could actually sing, and weren't reliant on cookie-cutter
production curlicues to mask underwhelming ability.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia son of preacher man, D'Angelo wrote, produced, and
arranged his album _ in addition to performing all vocals, and
playing most of the instruments. There hadn't been an artist this
young, and this talented since a 19-year-old Prince came out of
Minneapolis in the late 1970s. Rolling Stone called D'Angelo's
music, ``a reminder of where R&AMP;B has been and, if the genre is to
resurrect its creative relevance like a phoenix rising from the
ashes, where it needs to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Save for the occasional benefit performance, soundtrack
contributions, and guest spots on someone else's CD, most notably
``Nothing Even Matters,'' his duet with Lauryn Hill on her multiple
Grammy-winning album, little was heard from the singer-songwriter,
and contemporary R&AMP;B was sorely lacking in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   But at last, after nearly five years, D'Angelo has returned with
``Voodoo,'' his hotly-awaited sophomore CD.
</P>
<P>
   Although album arrives in stores this week, much has already
been said about the video for the first single, ``Untitled (How
Does It Feel)'' which has been in heavy rotation on BET and MTV for
several weeks. It features a very naked D'Angelo, standing in front
of a plain black backdrop, singing (well, lip-synching) directly
into the camera. That's it _ there's no Fatima Robinson
choreography, no eye-popping Hype Williams visuals. It's just
D'Angelo, and an elegant, gospel-tinged ballad, which could sit
comfortably alongside Prince's ``Adore'' and ``How Come U Don't
Call Me Anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clip, the camera drops as far southward as the cable
channels' Standards and Practices departments will allow, and
clearly D'Angelo has spent perhaps as much time in the gym as he
has in the recording studio. But there is more to this video, other
than the proof-positive affects of increased ab crunches. It's
gimmick-free without the seemingly requisite scantily clad women,
luxury cars, and enough bejeweled ice to sink the Titanic. D'Angelo
simply does what he does very, very well _ sing a gorgeous love
song. He still possesses the confidence to give a song a chance
without pummeling it into submission with the shaky swoops and
whoops which characterize much of what's sadly passing for R&AMP;B
these days.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Voodoo,'' D'Angelo again rejects the big-playa cliches and
the money-cash-hoes ethic. Commenting on such images in a recent
Spin interview, he said, ``It shows a lack of respect not only for
the music we're doing and the changes we can make, but for those
who came before.''
</P>
<P>
   And D'Angelo is nothing if not reverent of those who came
before. Yet there remains a spanking newness to his music. He
doesn't use the musical past so much a blueprint as a foundation
upon which to be can build his own sound and forge his own paths.
Even when there's a misstep _ such as inviting knuckleheads Method
Man and Redman to perform a tasteless rap on ``Left &AMP; Right,'' _ it
isn't enough to disturb the overall groove.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this is an important album for D'Angelo, but it is
also one of consequence for the so-called soul revival. Dionne
Farris hasn't had a CD since her 1994 breakthrough, ``Wild Seed-
Wild Flower''; Tony Toni Tone disbanded in 1997, although lead
singer Raphael Saadiq is due to drop with his new band Lucy Pearl
come spring; Maxwell's sophomore effort ``Embyra,'' failed to
garner attention of his 1996 debut, ``Urban Hang Suite''; it's been
nearly three years since Erykah Badu released a new studio album;
critics loved Ndegeocello's ``Bitter,'' but its blue moods left
just about everyone else cold; and Macy Gray, also a critic
darling, as yet to receive the commercial success her 1999 debut,
``On How Life Is,'' so richly deserves.
</P>
<P>
   So it has come again to D'Angelo to turn the lights down low and
deliver us from the dregs of unchallenging corporate R&AMP;B. If
``Voodoo'' is any indication, there may be hope for the creative
future of black music, and reason to believe that for years to
come, we'll still be, to paraphrase Me'Shell, digging D'Angelo like
an old soul record.

&HT;     PROPONENTS SAY LASERS MAKE GOING TO THE DENTIST EASY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Already commonplace in most areas of medicine,
laser technology is making new inroads in dentistry, where it has
the potential to deliver pain-free treatment of cavities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the wave of the future,'' said Dr. Kurt
Froehlich, of Cairo Family Dentistry in Greene County.
</P>
<P>
   Froehlich is believed to be one of only a few hundred dentists
in the country to purchase one of the newest lasers on the market,
a $45,000 model that uses energized water molecules to cut through
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no pain, no needle. You didn't hear the high whining
sound of the drill,'' said Douglas Stein, 29, an Albany lawyer who
had a cavity filled last week. ``I'll never have a drill again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that kind of enthusiasm from patients, most dentists
aren't rushing to buy laser technology, claiming that it doesn't
offer enough benefits, and in the wrong hands, may even pose some
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another way of doing what we are currently doing,'' said
Dr. Davis Garlapo, chairman of the restorative dentistry department
at the University of Buffalo. ``It doesn't open up any new
avenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasers have most commonly been used in dentistry over the past
decade for periodontal or gum work. The device can help eliminate
bleeding, swelling and stitches by cauterizing soft tissues.
</P>
<P>
   But manufacturers had been struggling to come up with a device
that would work on the hard surface of teeth. One of the biggest
hurdles has been dealing with the heat generated by the laser and
the potential for damage of the tooth's underlying dentin and pulp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of limitations when dealing with tooth
structure,'' said Dr. Gerard Kugel, the dean for research at Tufts
University School of Dental Medicine in Boston. ``At this point in
time, I wouldn't go out and buy a laser.''
</P>
<P>
   Froehlich purchased his laser from Biolase Technology in San
Clemente, Calif., one of three companies that currently have
approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration to market
lasers.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Bateman, the vice president of global sales at Biolase,
said he believes laser technology will become more mainstream in
another three to five years as more of the nation's 140,000
dentists learn about it, and as the price comes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have it love it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Biolase laser can be used to cut both soft and hard
tissue in the mouth, it cannot be used to remove old metal
fillings, because no one knows the effects that escaping gases or
particles from the amalgam may have on the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   And while the laser can eliminate the need for Novocain in most
cases, deep cavities may still require the use of some anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, Kugel believes that most dentists will
continue to opt for their reliable and versatile hand drills, at a
much lower cost of $500 each. ``I think we're still a long way off
from dentists routinely cutting teeth with lasers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Froehlich, however, believes his investment was worth it. Since
installing the laser a month ago, he said, he has gotten only
positive feedback from patients. And he's charging the same amount
as with the conventional drill. ``The biggest advantage is people
don't have the numbness when they leave the office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Praemassing, 64, of Greene County said he was ``pleasantly
surprised'' when he got a cavity filled three weeks ago at
Froehlich's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel a thing,'' he said.

&HT;     LAID-OFF WORKERS FIND JOBS QUICKLY IN ROBUST ECONOMY

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It started as a catastrophe: National Finance
Corp. shut its doors just days before Christmas, tossing some 350
people out of work and leaving many to wonder how they would buy
gifts for their children or pay credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say the National Finance debacle has a happy
ending. But in the month since its closing, one-third of its former
employees probably have jobs, estimated Tony Fisher, who is now
acting as president of the failed mortgage company and is arranging
to sell assets and shut down. Many others are considering offers or
are near landing another job.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the economics lessons drawn from Mr. Potter in ``It's a
Wonderful Life.'' Workers these days often have more power than
bosses. In one of the strongest economies in recent memory, most
workers don't have to face long months of joblessness and
bankruptcy when a company closes its doors. Former National Finance
workers were pursued by a number of companies hungry to fill a
range of positions. At job fairs former National Finance workers
browsed among employers, considering other opportunities. It's
still a psychological shock to lose the stability and comfort that
comes with a job, but the economic catastrophe can often be staved
off.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Robideau, a customer service supervisor at National
Finance, landed on her feet. Last week she started a new job as
sales assistant at First Albany, the investment banking and
brokerage company. Though the break from National Finance came as a
shock, the 22-year-old Robideau is grateful for her shift to First
Albany because she sees stability and room for career advancement.
``It's more of a solid career move,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A consistent demand for workers and an unemployment rate of only
3.4 percent in December is helping many workers with strong
credentials and training attract offers. Companies that have
already hired workers are looking to take on more, and some
companies, including Progressive Insurance and State Farm, are
still hoping to land some of the National Finance employees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the former National Finance employees are finding
it tougher to land good-paying jobs because they don't have
particularly specialized job skills, and are facing pay cuts. And
health insurance problems and medical bills are confounding some
people.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was also the first day on a new job for Ann Luse, a
Clifton Park woman who had worked for four years tracking
collateral at National Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is doing a different kind of finance work, as an
assistant in the department at Cohoes Savings Bank that makes
commercial loans. ``I had to take a $3,000 pay cut, but that's not
that bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, companies came in and swooped up entire groups of
former National Finance workers.
</P>
<P>
   A band of 24 former employees going to work at lender Tri-City
Funding in Halfmoon are hoping to improve their earnings potential
quickly, said Mike Breslin, now a Tri-City vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're highly motivated about the situation,'' Breslin said.
``I'm seeing that our people should be getting a pay raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Loan officers can probably make $50,000 at Tri City, compared to
$35,000 to $40,000 at National Finance, he said. Telemarketers
should be able to earn $30,000 to $40,000, he said, compared to
earning $26,000 to $30,000 at National Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Loan processors will start at about the same base pay of $25,000
annually, he said, but will be able to have other financial
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Breslin's crew will expand the Tri-City work force from 10 to
34, and, given the skills they acquired at National Finance, should
realistically be able to help the company double its annual loan
volume to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In return, employees are going to get profit sharing at their
new jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Computer specialists also seem to be doing well. A ``core
group'' of about 10 software developers are working together on
projects and evaluating their options, said Chris Coulthrust, who
had been a senior vice president of technology.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 former National Finance employees signed up for
computer training courses at Ikon Office Solutions, said Mike
McGovern, senior educational consultant at the training school.
``None of them want to go back into banking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But they can gain skills in specialties such as computer network
administration, or upgrade their desktop application capabilities,
in four months to 10 months, McGovern said. Then the former
National Finance workers will soon be hearing prospective employers
woo them: ``We'll give you this, we'll give you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained network administrators are in particular demand, he
said, and can command starting annual salaries of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lower range salaries should start at $25,000 for people with
more widely available computer skills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A new job isn't necessarily the end of all the financial
troubles for laid off workers, though. The mass dismissal at
National Finance caused some cash shortfalls that may dog people
for months.
</P>
<P>
   The company still owes employees another week's worth of back
pay, and Fisher is not sure when the money will be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the workers' health insurance isn't clear, either.
Some former employees are now getting bills for medical services
they received when they thought they were covered by insurance.
They're not sure if they'll be stuck with the bills.

&HT;     REPORT CHALLENGES NEED FOR PRIVACY LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As politicians throughout the country clamor for
new privacy-protection laws, advocates of open government in New
York are warning that too much confidentiality can be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report to the Legislature, the state Committee on
Open Government says New York already has enough laws protecting
privacy and there's little need for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blanket protection of privacy may be contrary to the public
interest,'' states the new report, written by Robert J. Freeman,
the open government committee's executive director. ``There is a
need to ensure that the desire to protect privacy does not diminish
the accountability of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno is
preparing recommendations to bolster state privacy laws. Bruno, a
Republican from Brunswick, formed a privacy task force last year,
saying too much personal information is being released without
people's consent.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said his report is not a response to Bruno's initiative.
The Committee on Open Government always addresses privacy issues,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures across the country are now focusing on
privacy matters, said Lucy C. Dalglish, executive director of the
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in Arlington, Va.
``This year, it's just going crazy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The push for privacy comes as government computerizes more data,
making information more accessible than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that someone can actually use the records, they want to
shut them down,'' Dalglish said. ``I find that profoundly ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   The momentum is bound to mount following the recent U.S. Supreme
Court decision that allows Congress to stop states from selling
home addresses, vehicle descriptions and other information compiled
by motor vehicle departments. ``The Supreme Court has given the
state legislatures the green light'' to limit access to records,
Dalglish said.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, motor vehicle records should be public, the
Committee on Open Government argued. ``If a person has committed a
violation of law, such as speeding or driving while intoxicated,
the public should clearly have the right to know,'' Freeman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And the government collects lots of other information that
should remain accessible, Dalglish said. For example, Freeman said
people would have no way of knowing if their homes are overassessed
if they couldn't look at the values of their neighbors' homes.
</P>
<P>
   There's no direct reference to privacy in the U.S. Constitution.
Dalglish said many of those who talk about a right to privacy
actually are arguing for a right not to be annoyed. ``I think it's
a backlash against direct mail and telemarketers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bruno, Mark Hansen, declined to say what
recommendations the senator would make to the Legislature. But, he
said, ``The important thing is to take a look at our laws, which
might not be effective when you look at all the information out
there on people.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates say they are not looking for blanket
protection of privacy _ just reasonable restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't think it's fair that you have to give
(personal information) to vote or to drive, and any Tom, Dick or
Harry can get it for any purpose,'' said Evan Hendricks, editor and
publisher of the Privacy Times, based in Washington, D.C. Hendricks
said he is a strong supporter of the Freedom of Information Act,
but he believes public records should only be used for the purposes
for which they were collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public records,'' Hendricks said, ``are the toughest issue to
deal with when it comes to balancing privacy versus public rights
of access.''

<P>
   MIDLAND, Mich. _ I never knew about the Canned Food Alliance
before Jan. 7, 2000, but because of our glitch-free new year, I do
now.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I know this is because I was doing some research on
what people are doing with all the food they bought in anticipation
of a nightmare Y2K, and I ran across an Associated Press article
that had a recipe from the Canned Food Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you not in the know, the Canned Food Alliance is a
partnership of the American Iron and Steel Institute's Steel
Packaging Council, the Can Manufactures Institute and the National
Food Processors Association's Canned Food Information Council. The
alliance says its primary mission is to serve as a resource for
information.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than enough information for me in one day but I
can't help but wonder how people's lives are going to be changed by
the tragic miscalculation made by mere mortals.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what all those unemployed computer consultants are
going to do now. I didn't even know anyone who was a Y2K consultant
until about mid-1999, and now I know at least half a dozen. What
are they going to do, now that no one wants Y2K advice? Can there
be post-Y2K consultants?
</P>
<P>
   What about all those books that were printed warning us of the
Armageddon that would be Jan. 1, 2000? I wonder how many didn't
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Would they even sell in the markdown bin now? And of those that
sold, how many now will be peddled this spring at rummage sales,
like so many copies of ``Catcher in the Rye,'' for a nickel apiece?
</P>
<P>
   What about the people who sold MREs and other survivalist
supplies like there was no tomorrow? What are they going to do
tomorrow? And the day after tomorrow? It's too bad they didn't
think about that.
</P>
<P>
   As I listened to National Public Radio the other morning, there
was a gentleman being interviewed who had many, many MREs (meals
ready to eat _ k-rations or c-rations in military talk) and was
willing to share his advice on getting rid of them. ``Make a big
pot of spaghetti sauce and throw in an MRE. They taste pretty good
that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder exactly how many batteries the battery companies sold
in December, no, just the last week in December. If I use what
happened in my house as a comparison, I would estimate six times
the normal amount people buy in a year.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how many people are out there who had an experience
like this one: This man was going to stay up until the new year and
new century hit, and he decided since he was going to do that he'd
better fill up the bathtub so he'd have some water to flush the
toilets with if anything went wrong. After starting the water, he
promptly fell asleep in his chair.
</P>
<P>
   The man awoke at 2:30 a.m. to the sound of water overrunning the
bathtub. The water went through the bathroom doorway, down a
hallway to a stairway to the basement not far away. About three
inches of water covered the floor of his basement, he said. ``Y2K
cost me a lot of money,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'm wondering about these things, I do not have the
``postpartum Y2K depression'' a Grandville psychologist described
in an article just before the old year ended.
</P>
<P>
   And a social worker said, ``I believe we are going to see some
people who are going to feel disheartened if nothing big goes
wrong.'
</P>
<P>
   Well, if it makes people feel any better, I'll give them this
advice: According to the Canned Food Alliance, ``Canned food is
nutritious, convenient and typically can last two years in
storage.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at that _ I'm a post-Y2K consultant already.

WARY NETWORKS REVIEW ANTISMOKING ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE BUTTERFIELD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A huge antismoking campaign scheduled to air soon on major
television networks apparently has gotten off to a rocky start,
with some networks unhappy with early versions of the ads and
looking for changes.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints appear to center around the edgy content of some
of the government-funded antismoking spots. At least one network
also reportedly is concerned that some of the ads may unfairly link
nontobacco products featured in the spots with the harmful effects
connected to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are part of a planned $150 million to $200 million
national advertising blitz paid for from a settlement between the
tobacco industry and the states.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Communications of Boston, which is heading a team of
advertising agencies that have been given the account, refused to
comment on the trouble Monday, but one official conceded there were
differing ``views'' to be resolved with the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time, we run into situations where we have to
work our views of how a thing should be presented with their
views,'' John Gaffney, media director at Arnold, said of the
networks. He claimed the differences were minor, and part of the
normal give and take of a major advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at NBC and CBS confirmed they were reviewing some of
the ads, however, and indicated they may require changes. ``To some
degree, that is a concern,'' Rick Gitter, NBC vice president of
advertising standards and program compliance, said of some of the
ad proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to discuss details of the ads in question, although
he did say the network was close to accepting at least one of them.
</P>
<P>
   An official at CBS indicated his network felt the content of
some of the antismoking spots might be too grim and offending.
Other sources, meanwhile, indicated the ads at times unfairly link
nontobacco products with smoking's negative effects in a dramatic
effort to bring an antitobacco message home to teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the trade publication Adweek quoted network sources as
saying one ad asks a teenager to imagine applying a zit cream to
his face that causes his skin to fall off, and leaves him with only
burn marks and exposed bone.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Unsworth, the executive at Arnold heading up the
advertising account, refused comment on the report. She said her
agency's contract with the American Legacy Foundation _ the
organization created in the tobacco settlement to administer ad and
education funds _ prohibits her from discussing details of the
advertising campaign before it begins.
</P>
<P>
   But Beverly Kastens, marketing director of the foundation,
insisted the advertising campaign was on time and relatively
trouble-free. ``We're very excited about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Network Monday appeared to be the only one that generally
agreed. It pronounced itself satisfied with the advertisements it
had reviewed so far with only one exception: the depiction of a
teenager smoking a cigarette. Jeff DeRome, vice president of
corporate communications, said Fox is asking for that spot to be
modified. Otherwise, he concluded: ``We do not have a problem.
We're fairly enthusiastic about this campaign.''

   MCCAIN-NH (Manchester, N.H.) _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., moved
to collect more independent voters Tuesday as he hammered away at
the kind of issues once showcased former independent presidential
candidate Ross Perot. Polls show independent voters could represent
almost 30 percent of the vote in the GOP presidential primary.
Perot captured 23 percent of the presidential vote in New Hampshire
in 1992. Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College
Polling Institute, said independent voters' support for McCain
explains his lead in the survey released Tuesday. McCain led Texas
Gov. George W. Bush 39 percent to 28 percent . ``If only
Republicans voted in their party's primary, Bush and McCain would
be neck and neck,'' Carroll said. ``But the independent voters love
McCain.'' By STEWART M. POWELL.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ It's popular to knock the Iowa
caucuses now that the results are in and everything went pretty
much as predicted. Without any earth-shattering surprises, did the
much-hyped exercise matter? Actually, yes. Forget all that stuff
about the unfairness of letting a largely rural state set the tone
for the national political debate that will determine the next
president of the United States. It has to begin somewhere, and Iowa
is as good as any place else. Besides, the fellows who win there
don't always go on to win over New Hampshire and the rest of the
country. By MARIANNE MEANS.

WARNER EMI SEEN AS NET MUSIC LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The $163 billion marriage of America Online Inc. and Time Warner
Inc. has taken on added significance thanks to the merger proposal
between Time Warner and Britain's largest recorded music company.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner will pay stock worth $1.3 billion to shareholders of
EMI Group PLC, to create a 50-50 joint venture called Warner EMI
Music. If regulators approve, the new company will control about
one-fifth of the recorded music market worldwide, making it the
largest of all record companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new firm will also be in a position to leverage the merged
assets of AOL, to make Warner EMI a leader in Internet music
marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music, of all our businesses, is the one that will benefit the
most from the Internet and the digital revolution,'' said Time
Warner chairman and chief executive Gerald Levin. ``Our partners at
AOL are extremely excited about this joint venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said his company is preparing for a day when consumers
will download music recordings over high-speed Internet
connections, rather than buy a plastic disk at a retail store. But
in the short term, he sees the Internet as a powerful new way to
market traditional music recordings, and to hunt down undiscovered
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it enables us to do is first of all, have a worldwide
vehicle for promotion, without having any gatekeeper tending to the
playlist,'' said Levin. Today, record companies rely mainly on
radio and music video broadcasts to generate interest in a
recording artist. Time Warner hopes to use the Internet to whip up
audience interest, in the same way that the horror film, ``The
Blair Witch Project,'' became a hit through aggressive Internet
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Levin also said Time Warner will aggressively seek out new
musical acts that publish their music on the Internet. ``Instead of
having to visit physical clubs, there's now an opportunity to see
new talent emerging in this new medium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But these plans don't impress Dan O'Brien, an analyst at
Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. He thinks Levin's
Internet talk is merely spin to lend some high-tech glamor to a
rather mundane merger of two struggling record companies. ``These
are two weaker companies that are trying to join forces,'' he said,
noting that both companies are striving to keep up with the
industry-leading Universal Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   As for Time Warner and the Internet, O'Brien pointed out that
the company is a member of the Recording Industry Association of
America, which recently filed a lawsuit against MP3.com, a Web site
that distributes popular music over the Internet. The suit charges
MP3.com is violating the copyrights of thousands of music
recordings by distributing them over the Internet for free.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien sees the lawsuit as proof that Time Warner and others in
the industry aren't really interested in making the Internet an
important part of their business strategies. ``There's a lot of lip
service to the Internet,'' he said, ``but they act like they're
afraid of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Aram Sinnreich, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in
New York, took a more positive view. Sinnreich said that record
companies are busily digitizing their thousands of recordings, and
preparing for the day when consumers will routinely listen to music
broadcast over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Warner EMI, with the help of AOL, could sell a new
kind of CD that would also entitle the purchaser to listen to the
recording over the Internet at no extra cost. A traveler could log
on in his hotel room to listen to his record collection, without
having to carry along his CDs. Or the music could be downloaded
into a digital playback device in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really about the delivery mechanism, it's about
consumers buying access to the music, the right to listen to the
music,'' said Sinnreich.

AILING PIERCE WON'T BE ABLE TO SWING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The price of America Online's stock has dropped quite a bit
since the company announced its intentions to buy Time Warner. So
far, the drop isn't much to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility of a steep decline got us thinking: What
would happen to the all-stock deal _ and others just like it _ if
investors suddenly lost faith in the new economy and decided the
incredible multiples accorded to companies like AOL weren't really
justified?
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, that very scenario played itself out on Wall
Street. And while history may not repeat itself, a trip back in
time still can provide some interesting perspective on today's
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Set the way-back machine for the 1960s, Sherman. We're going
back to what the writer John Brooks called ``The Go-Go Years'' on
Wall Street. It was a time of great excitement. The American
economy was booming and so were stock prices _ especially for brand
new companies that caught the fancy of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Conglomerates were hot back then. Companies like
Ling-Temco-Vought, Litton Industries, and Textron got huge by
acquiring companies in a hodge-podge of industries. Between 1965
and 1967, Ling-Temco-Vought's stock price went up tenfold, which
made it easy for LTV to buy up practically anyone it wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The root theory of conglomeration might simply be wrong,''
Brooks wrote somewhat dourly, ``its temporary success founded
chiefly on the gullibility of the stock buying public and its
professional advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   What the comglomerates realized was simple: that a high stock
price gives you incredible power. Like Superman, you can use it to
leap tall buildings or take over companies that are much bigger
than you are.
</P>
<P>
   No one grasped that lesson better than Saul Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20s, the precocious Steinberg created a company called
Leasco, which bought computers from IBM and leased them to business
customers. It was a sexy high-tech business for its time, and
Leasco's stock price soared.
</P>
<P>
   Which gave Steinberg an idea. Why not use that high stock price
to buy a big traditional company, one with far greater assets than
Leasco had?
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's first target was Reliance Insurance Co., a big but
boring Philadelphia insurer. Reliance was 10 times bigger than
Leasco _ a minnow trying to swallow a whale, Brooks said. But the
minnow had a much greater market value. By way of comparison, Time
Warner is only four times bigger than AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Leasco resisted for a time, but eventually gave in. Wall Street
loved the deal. By the end of 1968, Leasco's stock had climbed
5,400 percent in five years, and Steinberg was worth $50 million.
In the pre-Bill Gates era, that made him the richest self-made man
in America under 30, according to Forbes Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's next target was even bolder: Chemical Bank, one of
America's oldest and biggest banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brazen challenge to the long established and mighty by the
newly arrived and aggressive,'' Brooks wrote, ``were made possible
by a vast, if temporary, popularity in the stock market of the
shares of young and fast-growing companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal never came to pass. Chemical fought back hard, using
political and market connections to knock down Reliance's stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   If the bank had waited a little longer, it probably would not
have had to fight back at all. Starting in 1968, the stock market
began a massive correction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell
36 percent in 18 months. The correction in the sexier stocks was
much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Over that same 18-month period, conglomerate stocks fell an
average of 86 percent; computer stocks fell 80 percent; technology
stocks fell 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who sold a company to one of these former high-fliers now
had a piece of paper with very little value. The sellers learned an
important but expensive lesson: stocks are a volatile currency, and
accepting stock as payment is not necessarily the same as getting
real money.
</P>
<P>
   We can hear the objections already. Those sexy companies of the
1960s were mostly smoke-and-mirrors creations. They did not really
have the kind of revolutionary technology the new-economy companies
have today. And America Online is among the best of the new
companies. It earned $271 million in the latest quarter, an
impressive performance.
</P>
<P>
   All true. But AOL also boasts a sky-high price-earnings ratio of
175. Wall Street is expecting it to keep doing great things in the
future. If it doesn't, and it slips, its stock price could correct
an awfully long way.
</P>
<P>
   Were that to happen, anyone who sold his company to AOL for
stock might learn the same lesson that the go-go years taught:
Stocks can go down as well as up, and the value of a deal can
change very fast.
</P>
<P>
   We're not saying that will happen. It's just something to think
about.
</P>

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Jan. 15 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; AUBURN, Maine _ Leaning into the final turn on Squirrel Run,
fresh snow kicks up and snow-capped mountains come into view in the
distance. It's actually a cutting-edge moment. For slicing the snow
on the slope at the Lost Valley Ski Area is not the edge of a ski,
or a snowboard, but the hard plastic runners of a racing sled.
</P>
<P>
   Along with another location in New Hampshire, Lost Valley for
the first time is allowing the wooden racing sleds _ known as
cresta _ to course down one of its established trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sledding renaissance,'' hails Mike Glenn as he pulls
off his goggles at the foot of the trail to welcome some newcomers
after their first run.
</P>
<P>
   You have to allow Glenn his moment of giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and a friend, Rick Hartford, are cresta devotees,
enchanted with a type of sledding found mainly in Europe. You lie
flat on the sled, face forward, and then, if you're a seasoned
sledder, fly down the mountain at speeds that can reach 50 to 60
miles an hour. Glenn and Hartford founded a cresta association,
hold cresta races, build sleds they designed in a backyard barn,
and for several years now have been urging New England ski resorts
to try offering the exotic version of sledding to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``cresta,'' says Glenn, is technically a term for a
gouge in the side of a mountain where a seasonal stream might flow.
When frozen, such streams made for natural sled runs. ``We've
adopted the term to mean head-first sledding, to differentiate it
from the luge, where you're on your back, feet first.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when sledding was the major winter sport,''
says Glenn about the long-ago winters before ski lifts and ski
resorts. ``It came ahead of skating, of skiing, and we're
rejuvenating it with equipment you never could have imagined
before.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Lost Valley and Bretton Woods in New Hampshire said OK
to cresta, a decision intended to expand their winter ski business.
As for the sledding itself, it's a user-friendly way for nonskiers
to make their way onto the slopes, the ultimate in sled rides that
lasts a whole lot longer than any neighborhood hill.
</P>
<P>
   At Lost Valley, you buy a lift ticket and rent a sled that comes
equipped with a helmet. Twenty sleds built by Glenn and Hartford
are on hand. Ten more sleds are at Bretton Woods, available for
guests of the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort. Starting this
week, according to a hotel spokesperson, the sleds can be used on a
hill near the hotel that has been groomed for sledding, and other
cresta events are in the works for later in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   That the inaugural year for cresta is taking place at Lost
Valley seems fitting. A little more than a two-hour drive from
Boston, it's low-key and family oriented. ``Our whole thing is
we're a teaching ski slope, a family place,'' says Linc Hayes, one
of Lost Valley's managers. ``We know eventually we'll lose kids to
the big resorts _ the Sunday Rivers and the Sugarloafs. But we're a
good place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost Valley is where we headed to get a taste of the new new
thing on the slopes _ two nonskiing preteen boys and a parent whose
nostalgic monologue about boyhood winters spent on Flexible Flyers
was met with a stony silence. American what? Theirs is the tubing
generation and, for them, the draw was not a look backward but the
prospect of speed sledding at a place they've hardly ever been to,
a ski slope.
</P>
<P>
   That sounded fun and possibly cool enough for a short trip to
the north.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the boys' eagerness flattened as we walked out of the
lodge and past skiers and snowboarders at the base of the mountain
and approached the ski lift. For people who don't ski, a lift can,
at first, seem imposing, especially when trying to hold onto a sled
under one arm. The ballyhooed ``friendly'' seemed to have drained
out of the user-friendly billing.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this moment that the trip's subplot also came to a
climax. Call it the city/country boy phenomenon, which had begun
soon after we headed north from Boston, directly into Maine's first
snowstorm of the season. The blinding snow meant driving on
Interstate 95 in single file, well below the posted speed limit.
Every once in a while we would pass a car that had skidded off the
highway and was left stuck at an odd angle on the side of the road.
It was hard to see anything but blank white. The nervous back-seat
talk began: Where is this place? It's nowhere. Why would anyone go
to the country? The country stinks. We're gonna die!
</P>
<P>
   The pretrip exuberance ebbed further the moment we pulled into
the parking lot of a motel buried in unplowed snow and that, in the
whiteout, seemed mostly bereft of the human race. No one in their
right mind would stay here, would they? To a couple of city-styled
kids, the snowed-in country had turned barren and unwelcoming in an
eerie sort of way. Someone asked rhetorically: Isn't Maine Stephen
King country? Pushing on, we'd now reached the raison d'etre for
what was supposed to be a fun family trip _ cresta sledding. Isn't
everybody having fun? But with a ski lift in view for the first
time, there suddenly seemed no enthusiasm left on the boys' faces
for this particular outing.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround that followed came quickly. Lift lines have a way
of moving and, caught in a steady tide of people, you can't really
think _ or grumble _ anymore. Before you know it you're actually on
the lift riding up the mountain. Even better, the snow had stopped.
It not only stopped _ the skies had cleared and the sun broke out.
You could see for miles, and for miles snow blanketed the
mountains. We're talking a picture-postcard moment. Minutes later,
we were on our sleds riding down the trail that the ski area had
set aside just for cresta. Without a break, we spent the rest of
the  &UR; afternoon &LR;  on the slopes; the pause at the lift was history.
Fallen looks were replaced by wide-open eyes, big smiles, and the
fast talk of joy rides.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Glenn and Hartford and a dozen or so other
experienced sledders had spent the afternoon racing and
demonstrating the sleds. The trail's man-made snow was hard-packed
and icy. The sledders had hit the higher speeds of up to 60 miles
an hour. There were times when Glenn and the others actually lifted
off a few inches. ``Yeah, we got some good air,'' Glenn says, using
the term for the space between the bottom of the sled and the
ground after hitting a bump or a sharp turn. ``It was icy and
everybody was waxed, and I was happy because I haven't won a race
in a while, and I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and the others have used their sleds mostly on mountain
roads and trails and, on occasion, at a ski slope where they've
organized a race or demonstration. They've raced on mountains in
New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and New York. Lost Valley is the
first area to allow sledding daily _ during the afternoons on
weekdays and all day on weekends. If the sledders come, says Glenn,
more ski resorts will do it.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the sleds are made of native ash and reinforced
fiberglass tubing. The runners, about 2 inches wide, are made of a
high-impact plastic that can be waxed to add to the sled's speed.
The runners curl upward in front and to steer riders push or pull
each tip, depending on the direction of the turn. For example, to
steer right you pull down on the left tip, up on the right tip. The
more experienced the rider and the higher the speed, the subtler
the steering action. The sled tends to follow the mountain's
terrain, meaning at times only a subtle move is necessary to
reposition its flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about torque,'' says Glenn. ``Leaning from back to
front, from side to side. It takes concentration and body English.
You can't just go down these trails in a snow tube.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and Hartford, both in their mid-40s and from southern
Maine, formed the American Mountain Cresta Association five years
ago. But cresta has been in the Swiss lexicon at least since 1884,
when Cresta Run, a course in St. Moritz named after a steel sled,
opened.
</P>
<P>
   The sleds that Glenn and Hartford build come in two sizes, 1.5
meters and 1.25 meters long. And kids have to be as tall as the
sled is long to be allowed onto the ski slope. This seemed to be
about the only drawback for families with younger children, since
it takes about a 10-year-old to manage one of these sleds.
</P>
<P>
   During our afternoon on the slope, the fresh-fallen snow meant
we were never able to top about 25 miles an hour descending Lost
Valley's Squirrel Run, which, at about two-thirds of a mile, is one
of the ski area's longer but also easier trails. It takes a little
while to get used to steering, and on a couple of runs the boys
headed harmlessly off the trail _ not by choice. But there's no
question that the appetite for higher speeds grows quickly, for
that feeling of flying into a turn and then racing down a
straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the wax?'' one of the boys asked after just a few
runs. The big talk was back.

A GRAND TIME TO VISIT ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There never has been a better time to visit Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 is perceived by many people around the world as
a year of unity and reconciliation between people and religions,''
said Moshe Katzav, deputy prime minister and minister of tourism.
And, he notes, the Holy Land, as the birthplace of Jesus and three
monotheistic religions, is expected to be the chosen place for
millions of pilgrims to celebrate the beginning of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the year, there will be many special events and new and
activities. And while Israel will be a religious pilgrimage for
many, the country is filled with activities to interest all. One of
the classic lines heard is ``Jerusalem prays while Tel Aviv
plays.'' Tel Aviv, set along one of the finest beaches in the
Mediterranean, is said to never sleep. That city, though, is not
the only place to play _ at Eilat, along the Red Sea, there are
some lavish resorts, many with health spas.
</P>
<P>
   So go, explore, and discover all that this vibrant land has to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Among activities and sights for this year are walking tours in
``the land where time began.'' The Jubillenium March, walks of five
to eight hours along the very roads and paths trod by Jesus and the
first Christians, will be offered throughout the year. The walks
are just $15 a person. For information, call 800-323-0035 or visit
www.jubillenium.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel Museum, where the Dead Sea Scrolls are on view, will
offer special exhibits such as the Cradle of Christianity, telling
the story of Christianity in the ancient Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, an ancient village has been re-created. The village
allows visitors to feel as if they were residents from the first
century. The Nazareth Village is on the last remaining field farmed
by Nazareth villagers at the time of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   There will be Christian-oriented pageants, passion plays, and
more: ``Jesus the Galilean'' will be performed along the shores of
the Sea of Galilee; ``The Promise'' and ``The Last Supper,''
adaptations of traditional passion plays, will be performed in
Jerusalem; ``Redeemed,'' the love story of Ruth and Boaz, will be
performed in the wheat fields of Judea; and ``Tabernacle in the
Desert,'' a re-building of the ancient tabernacle, is set in Qumran
where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be missed, especially for first-time visitors, is Israel
in Miniature. For more than 35 years, tourists have headed to the
Holyland Hotel in Jerusalem where there is a scale model of the
Second Temple Jerusalem as it was at the time of Jesus.
</P>

<P>
   Can't decide where to go this year? Consider San Francisco _
it's the best, according to a number of sources. For 11 out of the
last 12 years, readers of Conde Nast Traveler's Readers Choice
Awards have given it the Best City award. It also scored tops in
the Restaurants and Fun/Energy categories. San Francisco topped
Paris, Rome, Florence, Venice, Vancouver, London, New Orleans, and
Charleston. And, for the fourth consecutive year, Travel &AMP; Leisure
magazine voted it. Money magazine named it the Best Big City in its
annual survey of The Best Places to Live. National Geographic
Traveler included San Francisco as one of 10 Urban Spaces in a list
of 50 places of a lifetime. San Francisco also placed in the top
three on the Sexiest USA Destinations list from Recommend Magazine.

KIBBUTZ: A DIFFERENT ISRAEL EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN CLEGG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAAGAN, Israel _ Still the wiry kibbutznik at age 50, Eli Kedem
is providing a tour of this compact resort village on the southern
shore of the Sea of Galilee. But he is not looking at the manicured
lawns, swaying date palms, or clear light pouring down from the
sun-baked hills of the Jordan Valley. Instead, he is sliding open a
metal gate, offering a peek at Israel's past and a prayer for its
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kibbutz is a dream not quite fulfilled,'' he says, as two
visitors look in on the kibbutz senior center, where a group of men
wearing shorts, T-shirts, and leathery tans sit behind looms,
weaving. A small sign that says ``Esperanto'' is tacked to the
wall, remnant of an era when idealists thought one language would
unite the world. ``During Israel's golden age, in the '30s and
'40s, the spirit was for pioneering and contributing to the land.
Now, you have to tend your career, get a good job at a good salary.
Many kibbutzim have economic problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded as agricultural collectives, the kibbutzim (plural for
kibbutz) have played a central role in the settlement of Israel:
Kibbutz farmers set down roots in hostile areas, often within sight
of the Jordanian and Syrian border. They made the desert bloom,
cultivating dates, apples, pears, peaches, nectarines, and avocados
and raising cattle and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   But the kibbutz movement is under pressure, Kedem and others
say, and must reinvent itself if it is to survive. That can
translate into a boon for travelers who want a sampling of Israel's
history and an offbeat (and sometimes cheaper) place to stay. A
stay at a kibbutz guesthouse can also offer a ground-level glimpse
at the region's geopolitics and the strategic importance of
boundaries and borders.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with soaring interest rates and stagnant growth in the
'80s, many kibbutzim took on private investment partners and began
to dabble in tourism. ``When we decided to start our bed and
breakfast in 1991, we realized much of the infrastructure was
already there _ pool, dining room, catering services,'' said Marc
Miller, economic director of Kibbutz Afik.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-member kibbutz, perched in the Golan Heights, partnered
with three other kibbutzim and now owns 25 percent of Hamat Gader,
a hot springs park. In the Dead Sea region, Kibbutz Almog owns a
highway rest stop, reaping profits from parched drivers who stop
for a cold drink, ice cream bar, or a snapshot of a bedouin and his
camel. Farther down the highway, Kibbutz En Gedi owns 50 percent of
the Ein Gedi Spa, where tourists come from Europe, Russia, and the
United States for a float in the salty Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kedem and Miller acknowledge that tourism involves more
than laying out a few towels and soaps in the kibbutz dormitories.
Both have tinkered with the marketing formula, adding a Web site
and brochures advertising attractions designed to appeal to Israeli
families on holiday as well as Christian pilgrims and American Jews
in search of history.
</P>
<P>
   Each guest house offers clean but spartan rooms (think Club Med
crossed with overnight camp) and one or two meals a day in a
communal dining area. Most have swimming pools, and many offer
tours, hikes, lectures, and sports activities. Visitors often
mingle with kibbutzniks who are rotating through their weekly
duties in the dining hall or guard shack. The food is plain but
fresh and plentiful (``Breakfast is the best meal in Israel,'' says
one seasoned traveler). Breads are baked locally, and platters of
fruits, vegetables, and olives come from irrigated land nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The geographic setting is often stunning, since many of Israel's
269 kibbutzim were settled before the days of real estate
investment trusts or seaside development. Kibbutz Ein Gedi, started
in 1956 by members of an agricultural military unit, is just north
of Ein Bokek, where the beach bristles with glitzy resort hotels.
Once cut off by the Jordanian border, it is near a modern two-lane
highway, and runs a shuttle bus to its spa on the Dead Sea. Guests
at the kibbutz get free admission to the spa, where they can
slather themselves with mineral-rich black mud or bob like a cork
in the viscous warm water.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala Gil'ad, a member of Ein Gedi for 39 years, is rightfully
proud of the region's history _ both recent and ancient. Taking a
break from cafeteria duty, she pulls out a sheet of quotes from the
Bible. (``And David went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds
at En-Gedi.'' 1 Samuel 24:1.) The kibbutz is famous for its
botanical garden, planted sprig by sprig and nourished with water
piped from a gushing mountain spring. More than 900 species of
plants flourish along pathways and in courtyards. Ein Gedi is worth
a stay of several days. Besides the spa, it is only two miles from
Masada, the mountain fortress where 900 Zealots committed suicide
rather than surrender to a Roman siege in 74 AD. The Nahal David
Nature Reserve to the north offers spectacular hikes amid herds of
ibex and sparkling waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Gil'ad shows off a scrapbook, lovingly compiled for a kibbutz
anniversary. The desert setting is stark, and the sweat equity
being applied by kibbutz members in the photos is readily apparent.
She sighs, says, ``It's over,'' and then amends her comments
slightly. ``The future of the kibbutz is less and less with
community. People want their own lives, want to make their own
decisions,'' she says. ``We're on a one-way train, from the
collective to the individual. I don't know when we stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the privatization _ Ein Gedi has partnered with a Tel
Aviv bank in order to obtain money to expand _ some of the old
safety net remains. ``Here, at least, health insurance and
education will remain communal,'' Gil'ad says. Plans call for 80
new rooms and a spa-side hotel to cater to European tourists used
to taking the waters at Baden-Baden. It seems worlds away from the
founders' motto: ``He whose innocence is young and bold, come join
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the kibbutz movement's roots are more Zionist than
religious, guesthouses cater to Christians and Jews alike, offering
maps to the land where Jesus walked and serving kosher meals in
their dining rooms. Like many tourist venues in Israel, they are
expecting an influx of travelers for the millennium. Many Web sites
post rates and travelers would do well to lock in reservations
early. Asked if Ma'agan Holiday Village has a synagogue, Eli Kedem
says, ``We have a place to pray, for those who want it.'' At Ein
Gedi, the synagogue is a small room that doubles as a luggage
storage area.
</P>
<P>
   Older kibbutzim like Ma'agan Holiday Village have been at it
long enough to have developed a service culture, a concept that
sometimes seems foreign in Israel. The private beach on Lake
Kinneret (the Israeli name for the Sea of Galilee) has a lifeguard,
and guests can take out a canoe, raft, or windsurfer. A disco and
``Bedouin Tent'' restaurant offer a semblance of night life, and
counselors help children of guests put on a show, much like at a
Club Med. The 150-member kibbutz is discretely tucked away next to
the Holiday Village complex.
</P>
<P>
   Glimpses of the kibbutz life persist, however. A burly
60-something kibbutznik offers diners some locally fermented wine,
and then carefully collects table scraps to take out for compost. A
dusty red tractor chugs through the motel parking lot.
Kindergartners run along a dirt path, heading for school.
(Kibbutzim abandoned round-the-clock communal child care in the
1970s; these days children attend school during the day and return
to their homes at night.)
</P>
<P>
   Newer kibbutz guesthouses, like those at Ortal and Afik in the
Golan, founded after the Six-Day War in 1967, have more of a
frontier flavor. The road to Ortal is posted with signs that say
``Danger, Land Mines'' and burned-out buses and a bombed-out mosque
are visible. All kibbutzim have armed guards, but the Uzi-toting
gentleman at the gate of Almog, near the West Bank, was
disconcerting. Visitors should have a rental car, and take
precautions when venturing outside the kibbutz to sight-see. A full
tank of gas, some bottled water, and a good map are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   But the Golan has its own stark beauty, and Israel's cultural
dissonance is a constant presence: Plopped along the roadside, amid
the remnants of war, were scores of mysterious white boxes, each
with a rock on its lid. Some kind of memorial to dead soldiers? No,
hives full of bees, trucked in to pollinate the patchwork quilt of
irrigated crop land. Marc Miller, of Kibbutz Afik, sweeps his arm
toward the Jordanian border and vows to hang on as long as
possible, peace agreement notwithstanding. ``The reasons you come
and the reasons you stay aren't necessarily the same,'' says
Miller, who made aliyah (immigrated to Israel) in the 1960s from
Roslyn, N.Y. ``You come because you have a certain idea of what it
might be like. But the reality is different. There are 17,000 Jews
in the Golan. When the land goes back, that's 17,000 personal
tragedies. But that's small potatoes, I guess, compared to big
geopolitical questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, tucked along the coastline of Lake Kinneret,
Kedem also surmises that the kibbutz's brand of ``practical
idealism'' will be able to weather economic, demographic, and
political changes into the new millennium. He adds a caveat: ``No
matter what happens (in the peace process,) this will be Israel,
but Jordan may be only two kilometers away.''

AN ADVENTUROUS LOOK AT THE PATH OF JESUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ If you really want to retrace the path of
Jesus, get some good hiking boots and a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   A new mix of spiritual and adventure travel has been launched in
the Holy Land, a 12-day journey that combines serious hiking,
biblical history, archeology, camping in Bedouin tents, and a few
overnights at bed-and-breakfasts in rural villages with Palestinian
families.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``The Nativity Trail: The Journey of the
Millennium'' and it is a partnership between the well-respected,
Jerusalem-based travel agency Guiding Star and Bethlehem 2000,
which is the Palestinian Authority's organization coordinating
agency for the year of festivities surrounding what is being
observed as the 2,000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The trail begins in Nazareth, through picturesque hills
surrounding the Sea of Galilee where Jesus carried out most of his
ministry, through villages of the West Bank, down into the Jordan
Valley's vast wilderness, and finally along the shepherd trails of
the Judean desert that lead to Bethlehem where Jesus was born and
the Christian faith began.
</P>
<P>
   The trail is 160 kilometers (nearly 100 miles) and traverses
through beautiful but sometimes rough terrain, climbing up and down
steep, rocky hillsides and crossing the trickling streams of desert
``wadis,'' or valleys. Figure on nine hours a day on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   This journey is not for the faint-hearted nor the out of shape.
But it well may be the most interesting and exciting travel
experience today in a land whose tourism industry has catered to
pilgrims through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely not for package-tour fans. It lures the kind of
traveler who doesn't mind not showering for a few days and hates
air-conditioned buses with tour guides speaking on microphones. The
kind who prefers munching gorp on a trail to eating the buffet in a
restaurant with a view. The kind who prefers seeing the Bible's
desert terrain over waiting on line to see an ancient fresco in the
basement of a dark, Crusades-era cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Khano, the managing director of Guiding Star and an
experienced guide who accompanies the groups, says, ``This is
travel with many layers, environmental, political, spiritual,
ecological. Whatever your motivation, this will be an enriching
experience, an opportunity to meet the people who live in these
biblical lands in the context of their daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Khano, who hails from a prominent Palestinian family that has
been in the tourism industry through several generations, has a
great breadth of knowledge on the history, the geography, the
archeology, the politics, and the legends of the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, travelers gain a deeper understanding of the
intertwined roots of the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish faith. You
will be walking the land familiar to the Jewish patriarch Abraham.
And as you make your way through the chalky, terraced hillsides,
you will hear the Muslim call to prayer from minarets in small
Palestinian villages. You will hear church bells in the Christian
Palestinian communities and learn how their community traces its
roots to the earliest followers of the faith.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Carse, a biblical scholar at St. George's College in
Jerusalem, is a consultant to the group and participates in key
legs of the journey, said, ``What I like about it is that it shows
that pilgrimage is not an old-fashioned devotion. It is a very
moral endeavor, a kind of fearless journey into what is happening
in the Holy Land today.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers meet a diverse group of people: Christian monks in the
remote, desert monasteries; Muslim clerics in the small towns;
Bedouin shepherds tending their flocks around ancient cisterns; and
women who make the crafts in rural villages.
</P>
<P>
   As a brochure that traces the 12-day journey puts it, ``Most
probably you will come away with your stereotypes challenged and
your perspectives changed, and with new insights into issues of
justice and peace in this ancient and modern land.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested, be sure to get the brochure. Guiding Star
has arranged a tentative schedule of 12-day journeys beginning in
March 2000 and extending through April 2001. But Khano says the
agency is more than willing to accommodate a group wishing to set
up its own private pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>

 JERUSALEM: ... Western Wall.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bethlehem. Bethlehem can be navigated easily from a hotel in
Jerusalem since it is only a 15-minute drive away. To get there you
will be leaving Jerusalem and heading into the Palestinian-ruled,
West Bank town where tradition holds that Jesus was born in a stone
grotto, now enshrined by the fourth-century Church of Nativity in
Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   You will journey through an Israeli checkpoint as you leave
Jerusalem and get a feel for the conflict that still simmers here
as the Israelis and Palestinians continue to negotiate the arduous
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority has made great strides in improving
the infrastructure of Bethlehem, and the government has gone out of
its way to make tourists feel welcome. There is great hospitality
among the people, the restaurant owners, and the gift shops. But
Bethlehem still has the feel of a construction site. It is dusty
and crowded and chaotic but absolutely worth seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth. After Jesus' birth, the Holy Family returned to
Nazareth near the Sea of Galilee and this is where Jesus came of
age. In the time of Jesus, Nazareth was a small, poor backwater
town. Today it is a crowded, poor city of narrow cobblestone
streets, with the clatter of traffic and buses.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the Basilica of the Annunciation, built on the site
believed to be where Mary lived and where the Angel Gabriel
announced to Mary that she would have a son and his name would be
Jesus. It is one of the Christian world's holiest shrines, but for
such a sacred space its architecture is not necessarily inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   The Galilee. More inspiring are the gentle hills looking out
over the Sea of Galilee. Stand on the Mount of Beatitudes where it
is believed Jesus delivered his Sermon on the Mount. Very near here
is a great horse ranch where you can stay in private cottages that
look out over the Sea of Galilee. Vered HaGalil (Rose of the
Galilee) is a great place to stay, especially for a family. The
warm hospitality of the owners is, frankly, rare in Israel. There
are horse trails that lead down the rocky hillsides to the Galilee.
And there is a restaurant with great steaks and burgers and cold
beer.
</P>
<P>
   From here, it is a short drive to the ancient village of
Capernaum where Jesus lived and began his ministry among his
disciples. Here you can look through the shadow of palm trees onto
the serene waters of the Galilee and imagine what life was like in
this small fishing village in the time of Jesus. These spots in the
Galilee often seem to capture the spirituality of the land of Jesus
more than the crowded, tourist sites in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Jordan River &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you are adventurous enough, journey across the storied
Allenby Bridge to Jordan. You need to arrange a bridge pass to
travel this route over the Allenby, or take the northern bridge
where a bridge pass and visa can be purchased on site. Heading to
Jordan brings you along the path where Jesus met John the Baptist
and was baptized in ``Bethany beyond the Jordan,'' as it is
referred to in the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   There is a battle for tourism dollars going on between Israel
and Jordan these days over which side of the Jordan River Jesus was
really baptized in. Israel captured the West Bank in 1967 and its
tourism officials say the Christian shrines along the western banks
mark the spot where Jesus was baptized. Jordan is on the East Bank
and has in recent years broken ground on an archeological
excavation that biblical scholars say may very well be the original
``Bethany beyond the Jordan'' of John the Baptist's ministry.
Biblical scholars lean toward Jordan's claim that John the
Baptist's ministry would have been based on the East Bank, but make
the more spiritual observation that the actual baptism took place
in the water, not on either bank.
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on Jordan's archeological find, the MovenPick
hotel chain has built a massive and beautiful Dead Sea Spa very
close to the baptism site. It rises like a storybook castle out of
the arid, fly-infested, desert wilderness. Perhaps because it is so
new, the service can be spotty, but the grounds are spectacular.
Relax in the saunas and hot baths before having a massage or a
facial treatment. The pool has a real sand beach and a biblical
view out over the Jordan River Valley to the Dead Sea, the lowest
spot on earth. But from the spa you can walk into the salty,
mineral-rich waters of the Dead Sea and be wrapped in its healing
mud.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem. It is a half-day journey back to Jerusalem if you
factor in the sometimes long security delays at the Jordan-Israel
border.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get an overview of Jerusalem's Old City is to
take the Rampart's Walk around the top of the Ottoman-era walls
that surround it. It allows you to make some sense of the layout of
the Muslim, Christian, Armenian, and Jewish quarters, and the views
provide a fascinating glimpse into the daily lives of the people
who live in the Old City and move to the ancient rhythm's of their
respective faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is where Jesus' life ended when he was crucified by
the Romans on Golgotha, which is today the site of the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre. Because of the famous infighting of the
Christian denominations that share ownership of the site, the keys
to the huge bronze locks in the massive doors of the church rest in
the hands of a local Muslim family, and seeing family members open
the doors in the predawn darkness is one of the more obscure but
interesting interfaith experiences of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The church is the most sacred and somber shrine in Christendom,
but it is also dark, cramped, and noisy, and a visit on a busy day
can lack the spirituality that it should hold. But outside the
walls of the Old City on the base of the Mount of Olives is the
Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus prayed in the hours before his
arrest. Here, in the groves of gnarled olive trees whose roots date
to the time of Jesus, there is a unique calm and quietude for
believers to reflect on the life and death and rebirth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever I get too cynical about the more crowded Christian
shrines and their distinct lack of spirituality, I think of this
reminder from Father Murphy-O'Connor, the biblical scholar, who has
lived in Jerusalem for 30 years: ``There are plenty of places that
are tawdry, and that can make you feel like you paid a lot of money
for this holy experience and you don't want it cheapened.
</P>
<P>
   ``But go to these sites if they are on pilgrimage routes, and
remember many people better than you have been to them. Remember
that pilgrimage was very difficult. As recently as the end of the
19th cenutry, the odds were two-to-one that you would not make it
home. . . . So don't be so cynical about it, and remember that what
is important is the story that these sites tell of the life of
Jesus.''

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The other day I asked my wife if she knew how
the Iowa caucuses worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run to different sides of the room and see which way the
barn tilts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Something like that. And every four years, reporters,
politicians and spinmeisters flock to drugstore lunch counters in
Iowa and meet allegedly real Americans and interpret the deeper
meanings of the tilting barns.
</P>
<P>
   The barns tilted toward George W. Bush and Al Gore. Big
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think people can't be real if their drugstores
still have lunch counters. Wake up and smell the scalding
McDonald's coffee, guys. Real America has Walgreen's and Rite Aid.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as if the first two showdowns between the
presidential candidates, Iowa and New Hampshire, were chosen not
for how well they represent America, but for how well they
represent a Norman Rockwell painting of America.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the other day there was a photograph on the front page
of the New York Times of Bush standing behind an Iowa drugstore
lunch counter. All around him Iowans were caught in wholesome
Norman Rockwell-ish poses with white-bread sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was leaning over, his tie in the butter, and his hands
planted unsanitarily on the cutting board. This is a guy who didn't
have to work in a restaurant or dining hall when he was in college.
</P>
<P>
   But then, we knew that.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates strike folksy poses for cameramen and
reporters (who outnumber the actual folks in Iowa and New
Hampshire), ordinary Americans break their wrists grabbing for the
remote to turn off primary coverage. Meanwhile, the amount of money
politicians are spending is obscene.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months of 1999, Bush alone spent a total of
$20 million. That's a lot of money to communicate a message of,
``Hey, he's a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts have estimated that the 2000
presidential and congressional election will cost $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, you will not be getting better public servants than
you got in 1996, when the cost of the election was $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt you'll get entertainment like you got in the last four
years, either. And entertainment, apparently, is what it's all
about.
</P>
<P>
   Something very odd is happening in America. While polls report
that less than 20 percent of Americans give a hoot about the 2000
presidential race, every late-night show in the land opens with 15
minutes of jokes about Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought those guys were useless.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy shows also desperately hang onto Bill Clinton,
sometimes by means of his senatorial candidate wife, not wanting to
lose the man who launched a million jokes.
</P>
<P>
   What we have is a $3 billion process to choose the butts of our
jokes, not our leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Politician consultants can live with their candidates having
love lives exposed. What they're really frightened of is their
candidates being mocked by Jay Leno and David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   They point to Dan Quayle as an example of a man whose political
career died because he became a joke. I say great, whatever it
takes, and Quayle came up with the funniest lines on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The race for president, and honor of being monologue butt for
four years, will arrive in California and 14 other states on March
7. People without barns finally will get a chance to have a say in
things.
</P>
<P>
   But first the primary contestants have to battle in New
Hampshire and South Carolina, not what you'd call states
representative of America in 2000. The former is a conservative
state that's almost lily-white. The latter is a conservative state
that waves the flag of lily-white rights.
</P>
<P>
   The whole nominating process could be over in the middle of
March, before most Americans have paid any attention.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than that, Letterman has been sick and running repeat
shows. We're missing our single most important source of
information on politics, and our most powerful check and balance on
American politicians.
</P>
<P>
   If by some quirk of fate, Steve Forbes should spend his way into
the Republican lead, Leno might be able to stop this nerd from
hell. But it'll take Leno and Letterman together to stop Bush.
</P>
<P>
   By now we're all thoroughly sick of the word ``caucus,'' if not
Iowa itself _ a wonderful state, by the way, despite its boring
barn-tilting every four years.
</P>
<P>
   While reading Garry Wills' new book, ``A Necessary Evil: A
History of American Distrust of Government,'' I learned where the
word ``caucus'' comes from.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds so democratic and all-American, the way those staged
political events look in Iowa and New Hampshire. In fact, the word
(originally American Indian) comes from Boston's Caucus Club, a
pre-Revolutionary smoke-filled room of wealthy Bostonians who
usurped the functions of town meetings.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with a lot less money than the $3 billion that will
be spent in our modern system of caucuses, primaries and general
elections. Rich special interests are richer than they used to be,
and it costs a lot to elect a mediagenic mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   The people are out of the loop, and seemingly happy about it, as
long as they get the political loopiness on the late-night shows.
</P>
<P>
   When is Letterman coming back?
</P>

PBS DOCUMENTARY SHOWS THAT CENSORS NEVER PROSPER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who says, ``I'm not advocating censorship'' almost
invariably is _ why else would he or she be in a position to have
to make such a statement? Censorship remains a pastime popular
among the self-appointed moral watchdogs of society, usually under
the guise of ``protecting our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking seems to be that, in our culture, adults don't rate
any sophisticated works of art or entertainment for their own
amusement or edification that kids can't likewise appreciate or sit
in on. With those minds at the helm, Jonathan Lipnicki and Barney
the Dinosaur would be handing out sloppy hugs as Tony and Paulie on
``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who seek to squelch free speech should note that history
has rarely been on their side _ they usually end up looking like
fatuous, timorous fools incapable of appreciating ground-breaking
works of art. Sometimes, would-be censors don't even need history
to indict their behavior: They look like idiots while they're
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding point of ``Culture Shock,'' a four-part, 4
1/2-hour series airing Wednesday and Feb. 2 on PBS, is that
ill-informed social supervision always has been and likely will
continue to be with us.
</P>
<P>
   Each of ``Culture Shock's'' four segments examines a work or
genre that came under fire: author Mark Twain's ``Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn,'' artist Edouard Manet's ``Olympia,'' films made
before the Hays Code was enforced, and jazz during the 1920s. Each
episode provides a historical sketch of the time and conditions
that provoked the work or genre and then examines how it
subsequently provoked others.
</P>
<P>
   The segment on Manet's ``Olympia,'' airing Wednesday, offers the
most amusing tale of misplaced rage. Manet's painting was a cagey
reaction to the prissy salon culture of the day, in which
courtesans traversed freely in proper society and paintings
depicted women as demure. Even though many were finding
salon-sanctioned art a bore, ``Olympia'' apparently wasn't the
tonic needed at the time. Parodying the styles of the time, it
presented a coarse, vaguely confrontational prostitute in repose
and was, of course, immediately considered vulgar. It is considered
a masterpiece today. Rudy Giuliani, who apparently lists `art
critic' among his list of duties as mayor of New York and recently
got into a hissing match with a Brooklyn art museum, might want to
take note.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Hays Code, airing next week, is a familiar one:
To stave off outside interference, the studios allowed good
Catholic boy Joseph Breem to regulate film content for a full two
decades. Beyond the no egregious sex/violence/language edicts was a
mandate that good always triumph over evil, just like in real life.
</P>
<P>
   This is cited as a rare case in which censorship, albeit of a
self-imposed nature, had a hand in creating lasting works boasting
a measure of subtlety. On the other hand, it's specious to argue
that film quality suffered significantly because of the lifting of
the Code _ there were plenty of lousy clean-cut movies, too. And
1999 seemed to be a watershed year for movies, mainly because the
best films pushed boundaries in one fashion or other.
</P>
<P>
   This installment includes the astonishing fact that a 1915
Supreme Court ruling decreed that movies were objects of commerce,
not speech, and therefore not protected by the First Amendment; it
took 37 years for the ruling to be overturned. (I wonder what
they'd rule today.) Some of the footage of pre-Code movies is
pretty entertaining and revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on jazz, the subject of the final episode, were fairly
clear-cut examples of racism _ one newspaper headline of the time
declared the music ``harkens back to the African jungle,'' while
another fretted that it ``put the `sin' in syncopation.'' Simply
put, it was thought that jazz made people _ particularly
impressionable young women _ want to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz wasn't accepted until whites began enjoying the music _ not
performing it, mind you; white musicians' early stabs at jazz
steamrolled the soul and swing clean out of the music _ that it
garnered some respectability. Even then, whites mingling and
dancing with blacks was, to some minds, scandalous. Eventually, of
course, the music became acknowledged as an art form, and that
which was born in the bordellos of New Orleans is now equally at
home at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Racism also figures in Wednesday's first segment, on
``Huckleberry Finn.'' It's the most troubling and complicated of
the series, charting the travails the acclaimed novel has
experienced over the years, routinely getting banned for its racial
content (originally, the book was dismissed as simply crude and
anti-literate). It's always a tragedy when people, in ignorance,
reject their champion, and it's a grievous fact of life that there
are individuals who refuse to see Twain's point. There are those
who persist to this day in finding the book racist when it is
precisely the opposite (the NAACP condemned it in the '50s).
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, those who aren't African-American can't
possibly understand the hurt one might feel when Twain, who was
using the word not that differently than a rapper might today,
drops the n-bomb, which Huck does copiously throughout the book. A
clumsy teacher who can't get his or her students to understand the
subtlety of Twain's work, mixed with students raised in racially
confused households, could lead to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But a teacher who can communicate the book's themes and humor
can get his or her students to really mull over important issues _
the episode concludes with high school students of various
ethnicities discussing the book with an insight that has eluded
some adults for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   In Manet's case, the man died before his efforts were finally
acknowledged as works of genius. These sagas are told
authoritatively and stirringly. Colorful, passionate interviewees
enliven and contextualize the material, patiently explaining why
meddling and forcing others to get in lockstep with one's own mores
is always an unsatisfactory solution compared to tolerance and an
open mind. Even, I suppose, when applied to that infernal Britney
Spears racket my stepdaughters blare through the house. &QL;

   WINTER _ A powerful winter storm churned up the East Coast today
after battering the Southeast with ice and more than a foot of
snow, leaving tens of thousands of people without power. Snow began
falling in New York City before the morning commute and up to 8
inches were forecast to fall across New England by tonight. The
storm arrived with winds gusting to 30 mph, making it feel well
below zero from New Jersey to New England. As much as 7 inches of
snow were predicted for Virginia and the Washington suburbs.
Schools and businesses were closed from the Carolinas to New
England, and flights were delayed or canceled across the region.
Some airports, including New York's LaGuardia and Washington Reagan
National Airport, were closed. (Manuel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

weather problems on the Super Bowl host city. With some people
trying to hold onto hotel rooms because the power's out, others
stuck here because they can't get to NY, others trying to get here
early for the Bowl so the weather doesn't delay them, is being a
hotel reservation agent a worse job than a Ga. Power lineman?
(Kempner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

<P>
   WINTER-NC _ GREENSBORO, N.C. _ A paralyzing winter storm pounded
the Tar Heel state with record amounts of up to 18 inches of new
snow, creating treacherous road conditions, knocking out power for
thousands and causing at least one death. Snow was expected to fall
until the late hours of the morning in many areas, closing schools
and businesses and leaving in its wake wind gusts of more than 30
mph. The state Highway Patrol urged drivers to stay off roads,
warning that many of their own vehicles have been stranded in snow
drifts. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   CLINTON-UNION _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's final State of
the Union address Thursday night is shaping up as a showcase of
seven years of accomplishments and an ambitious agenda for the
remaining months of his term. Amid familiar proposals for paying
off the debt, shoring up the Social Security and Medicare trust
funds and creating targeted tax breaks for the poor, Clinton has
promised new ideas, perhaps in such areas as crime fighting, gun
control and technology. Even before he lays out his plans, though,
there are questions about whether the Republican-controlled
Congress will be receptive _ particularly House members fighting
for their political lives in an election year. (Deans, Cox News

   DISABLED-KIDS _ WASHINGTON _ Advocates and officials react
Tuesday at the official release of the detailed report by the

education. Main results, but not details, were leaked over the

&HT;     TICKETS FOR JAYWALKING? DON'T POLICE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT
TASKS? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JEFF PLUDE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I was walking along Polk Street under a full
moon, about to cross California Street. The pedestrian signal was
red, but I looked both ways and it was clear except for one car in
the far lane. So I started to cross, the car went by and I reached
the other side.
</P>
<P>
   I heard a gruff voice say,``Hey, sir, you were jaywalking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is that?'' I thought. ``Is he talking to me?''
</P>
<P>
   I looked around and saw a police van across the street and a
big, burly cop in the driver's seat. I kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear me, sir?'' he said. I stopped and looked at him.
He said I was jaywalking and that was a $100 fine. Then he asked me
why I crossed the street when the light was red.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't believe it. I lied and said I didn't even notice the
signal was red. Then he said not to do it again. I felt like I was
in the principal's office. I said ``Yup'' _ he seemed to want an
answer _ and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   And as I walked, I got mad. I wished I'd said, ``Just give me
the ticket,'' and then laughed in the cop's face. But I didn't feel
like paying a hundred bucks _ a hundred bucks! _ for something as
ridiculous as jaywalking.
</P>
<P>
   And it IS ridiculous. Comedian George Carlin once got a ticket
for jaywalking in L.A. At least he says so in his book, ``Brain
Droppings.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't understand people who don't jaywalk: ``They are willing
to stand, passive and inert, on a curb, when absolutely no traffic
is coming, or maybe just a little traffic that could easily be
dodged.''
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't jaywalk? San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown was taking
a campaign stroll down Polk Street and he reportedly hustled to
beat a light and a tow-truck driver yelled: ``Watch the jaywalking,
Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like this: You're on foot, facing a red light and waiting
to cross. If you're a big boy or girl, you look both ways. When
there are no cars coming, you walk.
</P>
<P>
   But if there are cars coming, it's in your self-interest to wait
so you don't get hit. If you do get hit, it's your fault.
</P>
<P>
   So why the sudden jaywalking sting? Maybe the yuppies barreling
through the city's streets in their Senseless Ugly Vehicles _ you
know, the ones with one hand on the wheel and one hand on their
cell phone _ have complained about us pesky pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Those SUV dive bombers are the ones I'd like to see get a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ones who speed through an intersection after the
light has turned red and you're halfway across the street.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ones who round corners when you're crossing with a
green light and jerk to a stop a foot in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   Who's more dangerous on the road _ drivers like them or walkers
like me?
</P>
<P>
   I walked through Russian Hill and wondered: Don't the cops in
this city, a city of almost a million people, have anything better
to do? You know, like looking for bad guys, like the muggers who
killed that young tourist from Maine a few blocks from where I was
walking?
</P>
<P>
   I jaywalked so many times on my way home I lost count. And I've
jaywalked every day since. I guess all it took was a full moon and
a big-shot cop to bring out my inner criminal.

 &HT;     THE New York SENATE RACE IS GETTING READY TO RUMBLE  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ At precisely 6:05 Monday evening, Hillary Clinton
strode into a richly paneled conference room on the third floor of
New York's Capitol and took her place before the microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by the Legislature's Democratic leaders, the First Lady
gazed out serenely on the Albany press corps, which was gleefully
poised for attack. She smiled broadly. The legislative leaders
muttered a few platitudes to the assembled assassins. Then Hillary
Rodham Clinton was ready to rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   For precisely 20 minutes, the New York Democratic party's
soon-to-be U.S. Senate
</P>
<P>
   candidate fielded questions, dodged traps, ducked blind-side
hits and escaped with a close decision. She said nothing new. She
made no unintended news. Her foot came nowhere near her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of some of this town's toughest
reporters Monday night, Hillary maintained her poise and slid
artfully off questions designed to make her sweat. She then
departed to address the Legislature's joint Democratic conference _
and, no doubt, to brag that the crowd from the Legislative
Correspondents Association lair didn't strike her as so scary.
</P>
<P>
   For somebody who hasn't done this much _ not until her standing
in the polls began to dip rather conspicuously _ Mrs. Clinton did
rather well.
</P>
<P>
   She did better, in fact, than Rudy Giuliani had done a few hours
earlier and one floor below, in the executive chamber's Red Room.
</P>
<P>
   There, the New York City mayor, Mrs. Clinton's soon-to-be
Republican opponent in this year's election, had engaged in a
display of mutual affection with Gov. George Pataki. Despite their
bitter political warfare over the years _ and neither guy turned
his back on the other Monday afternoon _ the governor and the mayor
nonetheless lauded one another's genius and character with such
unrestrained rapture that seeing the session end with an
open-mouthed kiss didn't seem entirely out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy got off a shot at the First Lady by recounting his
education history. (A hint: All the schools he attended are in New
York.) And Hillary jabbed an elbow into the mayor's ribs with a
comment on the evils of divisiveness. It was merely a preview of
things to come. Before it wraps up, this thing is bound to get down
and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   It has to. Despite Giuliani's narrow lead in most polls, this
remains a 5-3 Democratic state. Moreover, this is a presidential
year, when independents come out to vote. And they tend to be more
likely to vote for Democrats. Also, November is a long way off.
Every likely voter has heard of each candidate, and most have
already picked sides. In virtually every poll, the undecided vote
is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   When you're a candidate locked into a close race with a tiny
undecided vote so early in the contest, then you have no choice but
to try to attract your opponent's weaker supporters _ the ones who
essentially tell pollsters, ``I don't like either of these people
very much, but I'll hold my nose and vote for this one.'' You move
those voters from your opponent's column to yours only by
convincing them that your opponent is more objectionable than you
are.
</P>
<P>
   That means running a campaign based, in no small part, on the
premise that your opponent is a vile human being. There are many
ways to make this point, none of them pretty, and each candidate is
likely to employ every imaginable technique to accomplish that
crucial goal.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Rudy brought up the carpetbagging issue Monday. It's
also why Hillary made her crack on David Letterman's show about
Rudy arresting homeless people. It's why the word ``divisive'' has
become a key part of her campaign vocabulary. Tough stuff, but be
patient.
</P>
<P>
   It'll get meaner.
</P>

   COKE-JAPAN (Walnut Creek, Calif.) _ For years, Japanese
consumers have had two Coca-Colas to choose from _ identical except
for their packaging, but at vastly different prices. There is the
locally bottled brand, labeled Coca-Cola, and ``American Coke,''
labeled Coca-Cola Classic _ bottled in America and shipped abroad.
Despite the thousands of miles American Coke has to travel, it is
usually cheaper than Japanese-made Coke, which typically sells for
120 yen (about $1.15) from vending machines. American Coke costs as
little as 70 yen, or 40 percent less. That price gap is at the
heart of a complex legal confrontation between Coca-Cola and two
small California exporter now nearing trial. The stakes are high.
Coke makes more money per can in Japan than it does anywhere else
in the world. And the lawsuit could have vast implications for the
way Coca-Cola does business with bottlers around the world. By

&HT;     NUANCE IS AN IMPORTANT SKILL ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ NBC television reporter Jim Gray interviewed
retired baseball star Pete Rose just before the second game of the
World Series last October, he outraged millions of viewers by
asking a series of hard-nosed questions about Rose's gambling
problems. His questions were legitimate, but so was the outrage,
because Gray had missed something that a lot of workers overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Until that night, Rose had not been allowed to appear at any
Major League Baseball function since receiving a lifetime ban in
1989 because of his gambling. But when fans selected Rose for the
All-Century Team, baseball's leaders relented for one night and let
him appear at the ceremonies in Atlanta. Fans gave him a thunderous
ovation, cheering even louder than they did for hometown hero Henry
Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rose's moment, and Gray looked like the Grinch when he
tried to steal it.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with an anecdote from ````All the President's
Men,'' the book about Watergate by then-Washington Post reporters
Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. Just before the 1972 presidential
election, Henry Kissinger declared that ````peace is at hand'' in
Southeast Asia. On the same day, Clark MacGregor confirmed that his
Committee for the Re-election of the President had a fund for
clandestine activities, and named five people who had authorized or
received payments. The authors wrote about their deliberations over
the MacGregor story that day with Post Executive Editor Ben
Bradlee:
</P>
<P>
   ````Bradlee ruled it off page one, which already had another
Watergate story. ``That would look like we're grinding it in on
their day of peace-at-hand,' Bradlee told Woodward, who had been
lobbying for the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Woodward had a legitimate argument, just as Gray had a
legitimate defense for asking his questions. But Bradlee understood
the nuance: Even famous people have few special triumphs in life.
If you ruin one of them, you will look evil.
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller scale, bosses can make the same sort of mistake.
</P>
<P>
   They will start to praise an employee, then ruin it all with a
single word: ````but.'' In the employee's mind, the praise will be
discarded and the criticism remembered.
</P>
<P>
   When employees have triumphs (even personal ones), let them
savor the moment for as long as they can. There will be plenty of
opportunities to find fault in the future.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, of course, if a problem is urgent and
important. But we live in such a look-at-me, in-your-face,
just-can't-wait society that nuance often gets trampled by a sense
of artificial urgency, when nothing all that important is really
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Gray fell victim to this, trying to add a phony sense of
importance to the same questions Rose had been asked for a decade.
Gray certainly could have asked nicely whether all the celebration
had made Rose change his mind about admitting that he gambled on
baseball, but he turned it into such an inquisition that he ruined
the moment _ for Rose and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything, a nuance that employers sometimes miss
when they have to lay people off. Dismissals are always going to
cause hurt feelings, of course, but you add a layer of
heartlessness if you dump people on their birthdays or on Take Our
Daughters to Work Day or anytime between about Nov. 15 and Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   For workers, nuance can often mean the difference between moving
up and getting stuck. If you think you're doing everything right,
but you're not getting rewarded for it, consider these nuances:
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your audience.
</P>
<P>
   Effective job hunters target specific companies; they don't send
out hundreds of resumes and start cover letters with ````to whom it
may concern.'' They stand out from everyone else, often by having a
great network and knowing what the prospective employer needs.
</P>
<P>
   On the job, don't complain about how busy you are to someone
who's even busier. If, say, your technical support people are
installing a program on 1,000 computers, they probably won't want
to hear how inconvenient it is for you to be interrupted for 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even politeness can backfire if you don't pay attention to
nuance. Some well-intentioned young people will call a 40-year-old
woman ````ma'am,'' which might make her feel like a 400-year-old
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Always do whatever you can to see things from other people's
perspectives. Web designers with no appreciation for nuance can
unwittingly sabotage a company's on-line efforts if they are so
concerned with having a beautiful page that they overlook the
customers' need for speed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your company.
</P>
<P>
   At one business, a young person with lots of ideas for improving
the organization could be seen as an up-and-comer.
</P>
<P>
   At another company, that person could be seen as either a
know-it-all or a whiner.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies encourage the exchange of ideas, while others
value blind obedience. Don't underestimate the importance of
````fit'' in your career success.
</P>
<P>
   Also look at what sort of people your company promotes. Look
beyond obvious factors like age and race and sex, and find out what
characteristics those people share. Could you be more like them? If
you could, but don't want to, you're at the wrong company. And, of
course, if you're in the minority and your company is ageist or
racist or sexist, that's your cue to either fight or move on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Help people help you.
</P>
<P>
   Some nuances are just common courtesy, like returning favors and
thanking people for their time. Yet many job applicants don't take
the time to write thank you notes to those who interviewed them or
otherwise offered help.
</P>
<P>
   Make it as convenient as possible for others to help you.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it's urgent, try to call or meet at a time that works
best for them, even if it's not ideal for you. Think about what
kind of work they do. The most hectic days in a lot of jobs are
Monday and Friday _ Monday because work has piled up from the
weekend, and Friday because so many people catch a 24-hour illness
that day.
</P>
<P>
   In those jobs, if you can ask for help in the middle of the
week, you'll probably be better off.
</P>
<P>
   Voice mail is another place where nuance gets missed. People may
get impatient and not listen to your entire three-minute message,
so give the crucial information up front: your name, phone number
and how to reach you.
</P>
<P>
   And when co-workers do help, make sure you pay attention. Once
in a great while, it's all right to ask someone a second or third
time how to do something, but if you do it too often, it shows that
you don't value their time _ or your own.

&HT;     IOWA'S OVER: SO WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's popular to knock the Iowa caucuses now that
the results are in and everything went pretty much as predicted.
Without any earth-shattering surprises, did the much-hyped exercise
matter?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Forget all that stuff about the unfairness of letting a largely
rural state set the tone for the national political debate that
will determine the next president of the United States. It has to
begin somewhere, and Iowa is as good as any place else.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the fellows who win there don't always go on to win
over New Hampshire and the rest of the country so it's not as
though Iowa automatically dictates the ultimate outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The results this time were important because the character and
personalities of the winning candidates, Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, began to emerge for all to see. Gore,
who won an impressive 63 per cent of the Democratic vote, was
forced by ex-Sen. Bill Bradley's unexpectedly strong challenge to
get down off his pedestal and demonstrate that he knew how to
fight. And Bush was forced by conservative rivals to drop the
pretense of bland moderation and move to the right, which is the
heart of the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's personality transplant, for all the ridicule it produced,
has been good for his candidacy. He is a much better campaigner for
it. Sometimes he seems to be trying too hard, but he gets his
message across. We don't hear as many complaints about his wooden
manner as in the past. Compared to Bradley's flat, laid-back style,
Gore has become a regular firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   His huge victory doesn't solve all his problems, particularly
the necessity of separating himself from the long shadow of
President Clinton. But it bolsters the polls that show him far
ahead of Bradley nationally and revives the aura of a winner which
had not so long ago seemed to be slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will now have more trouble rallying supporters and
raising money. And if Gore also carries New Hampshire, where he is
running even with Bradley, he should finally gain some breathing
room to look beyond the Democratic primaries and go after Bush, his
presumed general election foe.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory, by contrast, cost him dearly. Pressed by Steve
Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer from the right, he was forced to
downplay the ``compassion'' part of the ``compassionate
conservatism'' with which he had hoped to sell himself as a
moderate who could appeal beyond the traditional GOP right-wing
base. He found that running as a pragmatic leader who could unite
the party wasn't enough. Ideology kept raising its naughty head.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attempted to duck the contentious subject of abortion,
sticking to the familiar GOP anti-abortion position but trying to
reassure moderates and independents on the issue by suggesting he
wouldn't make a big deal of it. Forbes and the others wouldn't let
him get away with that. They think it IS a big deal. They
repeatedly trapped him into making harsher and harsher statements,
until he finally said he would keep the 1996 GOP platform plank
that endorses a constitutional amendment to criminalize abortion,
with no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   That position went down well with the religious right in Iowa
but will not be popular across the country, where a majority of
voters tell the pollsters they approve some limitations on abortion
but do not want the procedure banned. Bush had previously said he
would not fight for a constitutional amendment and that he favored
exceptions for rape, incest and protecting the life of the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also began wearing his own deep religious faith on his
sleeve, pleasing the purists of the Christian right but making many
less church-oriented voters uncomfortable. Even so, Forbes, Keyes
and Bauer collectively got more votes than Bush's 41 percent. But
there are fewer social conservatives in New Hampshire than in Iowa,
giving Bush a little wriggle room there.
</P>
<P>
   He will need it. Sen. John McCain, who skipped Iowa, is waiting
there to press him from the left, criticizing the Bush tax cut plan
as a giveaway for the rich and making a fuss about Bush's failure
to support campaign finance reforms.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was asked recently if he were really a ``liberal in
Republican clothing''. He stressed his conservative voting record
during 17 years in Congress, but also pleaded for his party to pay
more attention to the needs of the poor and the weak. He contends
that the Bush tax cut ignores the economic gap between the haves
and the have nots and that is ``not healthy for America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you call me a liberal because of those positions
that I have, then I would gladly accept that label,' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will undoubtedly try to see that this label sticks to
McCain, placing himself back in the philosophical middle by
comparison. If that works, Bush ought to do just fine in New
Hampshire.

&HT;     NUANCE IS AN IMPORTANT SKILL ON THE JOB

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ NBC television reporter Jim Gray interviewed
retired baseball star Pete Rose just before the second game of the
World Series last October, he outraged millions of viewers by
asking a series of hard-nosed questions about Rose's gambling
problems. His questions were legitimate, but so was the outrage,
because Gray had missed something that a lot of workers overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Until that night, Rose had not been allowed to appear at any
Major League Baseball function since receiving a lifetime ban in
1989 because of his gambling. But when fans selected Rose for the
All-Century Team, baseball's leaders relented for one night and let
him appear at the ceremonies in Atlanta. Fans gave him a thunderous
ovation, cheering even louder than they did for hometown hero Henry
Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rose's moment, and Gray looked like the Grinch when he
tried to steal it.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with an anecdote from ``All the President's Men,''
the book about Watergate by then-Washington Post reporters Carl
Bernstein and Bob Woodward. Just before the 1972 presidential
election, Henry Kissinger declared that ``peace is at hand'' in
Southeast Asia. On the same day, Clark MacGregor confirmed that his
Committee for the Re-election of the President had a fund for
clandestine activities, and named five people who had authorized or
received payments. The authors wrote about their deliberations over
the MacGregor story that day with Post Executive Editor Ben
Bradlee:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradlee ruled it off page one, which already had another
Watergate story. ``That would look like we're grinding it in on
their day of peace-at-hand,' Bradlee told Woodward, who had been
lobbying for the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Woodward had a legitimate argument, just as Gray had a
legitimate defense for asking his questions. But Bradlee understood
the nuance: Even famous people have few special triumphs in life.
If you ruin one of them, you will look evil.
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller scale, bosses can make the same sort of mistake.
</P>
<P>
   They will start to praise an employee, then ruin it all with a
single word: ``but.'' In the employee's mind, the praise will be
discarded and the criticism remembered.
</P>
<P>
   When employees have triumphs (even personal ones), let them
savor the moment for as long as they can. There will be plenty of
opportunities to find fault in the future.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, of course, if a problem is urgent and
important. But we live in such a look-at-me, in-your-face,
just-can't-wait society that nuance often gets trampled by a sense
of artificial urgency, when nothing all that important is really
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Gray fell victim to this, trying to add a phony sense of
importance to the same questions Rose had been asked for a decade.
Gray certainly could have asked nicely whether all the celebration
had made Rose change his mind about admitting that he gambled on
baseball, but he turned it into such an inquisition that he ruined
the moment _ for Rose and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything, a nuance that employers sometimes miss
when they have to lay people off. Dismissals are always going to
cause hurt feelings, of course, but you add a layer of
heartlessness if you dump people on their birthdays or on Take Our
Daughters to Work Day or anytime between about Nov. 15 and Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   For workers, nuance can often mean the difference between moving
up and getting stuck. If you think you're doing everything right,
but you're not getting rewarded for it, consider these nuances:
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your audience.
</P>
<P>
   Effective job hunters target specific companies; they don't send
out hundreds of resumes and start cover letters with ``to whom it
may concern.'' They stand out from everyone else, often by having a
great network and knowing what the prospective employer needs.
</P>
<P>
   On the job, don't complain about how busy you are to someone
who's even busier. If, say, your technical support people are
installing a program on 1,000 computers, they probably won't want
to hear how inconvenient it is for you to be interrupted for 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even politeness can backfire if you don't pay attention to
nuance. Some well-intentioned young people will call a 40-year-old
woman ``ma'am,'' which might make her feel like a 400-year-old
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Always do whatever you can to see things from other people's
perspectives. Web designers with no appreciation for nuance can
unwittingly sabotage a company's on-line efforts if they are so
concerned with having a beautiful page that they overlook the
customers' need for speed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your company.
</P>
<P>
   At one business, a young person with lots of ideas for improving
the organization could be seen as an up-and-comer.
</P>
<P>
   At another company, that person could be seen as either a
know-it-all or a whiner.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies encourage the exchange of ideas, while others
value blind obedience. Don't underestimate the importance of
``fit'' in your career success.
</P>
<P>
   Also look at what sort of people your company promotes. Look
beyond obvious factors like age and race and sex, and find out what
characteristics those people share. Could you be more like them? If
you could, but don't want to, you're at the wrong company. And, of
course, if you're in the minority and your company is ageist or
racist or sexist, that's your cue to either fight or move on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Help people help you.
</P>
<P>
   Some nuances are just common courtesy, like returning favors and
thanking people for their time. Yet many job applicants don't take
the time to write thank you notes to those who interviewed them or
otherwise offered help.
</P>
<P>
   Make it as convenient as possible for others to help you.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it's urgent, try to call or meet at a time that works
best for them, even if it's not ideal for you. Think about what
kind of work they do. The most hectic days in a lot of jobs are
Monday and Friday _ Monday because work has piled up from the
weekend, and Friday because so many people catch a 24-hour illness
that day.
</P>
<P>
   In those jobs, if you can ask for help in the middle of the
week, you'll probably be better off.
</P>
<P>
   Voice mail is another place where nuance gets missed. People may
get impatient and not listen to your entire three-minute message,
so give the crucial information up front: your name, phone number
and how to reach you.
</P>
<P>
   And when co-workers do help, make sure you pay attention. Once
in a great while, it's all right to ask someone a second or third
time how to do something, but if you do it too often, it shows that
you don't value their time _ or your own.

&HT;     NASHVILLE, ST. LOUIS: PRIME REAL ESTATE FOR THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ten years ago it would have been a laughing matter to
consider a Super Bowl featuring teams from St. Louis and Nashville.
It was simply a matter of omission. Neither town had an NFL
franchise at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had recently gone south and west to Phoenix while
the only football of note played in Tennessee was on the college
level in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   But as the thrice-removed Rams of St. Louis and the
twice-removed Titans of Tennessee gather for Super Bowl XXXIV on
Sunday, it might as well be called the Relocation Bowl. It's the
first Super Bowl in history featuring teams that relocated from
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   As with most real estate transactions, the reasons for the move
were location, location, location.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, coming from Cleveland to Los Angeles, ran into
staggering disinterest in Anaheim, where home games against the San
Francisco 49ers often played like away games. So away they went to
St. Louis, which coveted a replacement NFL team and built a
ridiculous domed stadium to prove its commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans used to be called the Oilers and played in the
dilapidated Astrodome; if this was the eighth wonder of the world,
we live on a shabby little planet indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Bud Adams, who always looks as if he's just polished off a
barbecue pork sandwich, sought a new stadium in Houston and was
rebuffed. Thus was set in motion a temporary move to Memphis and
the Liberty Bowl, followed by another temporary move to Nashville
and Vanderbilt Stadium before the Titans had a place they could
truly call home, Adelphia Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big-time success story for all owners who want to
relocate,'' Tennessee linebacker Eddie Robinson said. ``The fans in
Houston are good fans, and I'm happy to see they got a team, but we
had to move and it's worked out for the fans in Nashville. We have
great fans.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis defensive end Kevin Carter was positively lyrical when
describing the Rams' sudden transmogrification from slug to top dog
in their new town. The team that was second-worst in the league in
the 1990s is now the best in its conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great story,'' said Carter, a placid man
dressed to kill from the paper-cut pages of GQ magazine. ``A
classic assembly of a cast of characters. A quarterback who was
stocking shelves. You have an old coach who's trying to bring
another team to greatness. It has all the makings of a TV movie.
It's a very heartwarming story.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dyan Cannon as squirrelly Rams owners Georgia
Frontiere? How about Tony Randall as teary coach Dick Vermeil?
Nicholas Cage in a goatee as rags-to-riches quarterback Kurt
Warner. And that huge guy from ``The Green Mile'' as mammoth tackle
Orlando Pace. There's your cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's night and day,'' Carter said. ``This year we had the
Midas touch. Everything turned to gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches are the reasons the Rams and Titans are here
for the Super Bowl. But the stability of a place to call home and
adoring fans are part of the equation as well.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to be said about moving from a place where
everybody called you names to a place where everybody knows your
name.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Todd Lyght, whose tenure with the team dates to
apathetic Anaheim, said, ``I've been here eight years and never had
any playoff experience. There was a time I thought it would never
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyght's reaction was probably typical of the trauma of
relocation when he said, ``It took me three years to feel
comfortable in St. Louis. Anytime you have to leave your house and
get an apartment, it's difficult. The people in St. Louis are
great. It took me awhile to find out where to go. I don't cook, so
I had to know where the good places were to eat. That's key for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, the only relocated team to qualify for the
Super Bowl were the I-5 Raiders in 1983. In the first year after
their move to Los Angeles from jilted Oakland, they clobbered the
Washington Redskins, 38-9, in Super Bowl XVIII.
</P>
<P>
   While the Raiders moved to a place that eventually came to
despise them for the duplicity of their owner, the Rams and Titans
got fresh starts in their new cities. ``St. Louis Rams'' doesn't
sound so strange any more and ``Tennessee Titans'' has a nice
alliterative ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   With Houston set to rejoin the NFL in 2002 with a new team in a
new stadium, the league will have 32 teams. No further expansion is
planned for the foreseeable future. Super Bowl XXXIV will stand
alone as the first to feature two relocated teams.
</P>
<P>
   Home is where the heart is and the Rams and Titans like their
location, location, location.

&HT;     CLINTON SAYS HIS PLAN WOULD PAY OFF U.S. DEBT BY 2013 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Tuesday he will propose a
federal budget that would pay off the federal debt by the year 2013
and extend the solvency of the nation's Social Security retirement
fund until the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will outline the details of his proposed fiscal
year 2001 budget in his State of the Union address to Congress this
Thursday evening and will formally submit that budget proposal on
Feb. 1. Congress and the president will then spend the next several
months hashing out a budget for the new fiscal year, which begins
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask the Republican majority in Congress to put politics
aside and join me,'' Clinton said from the White House briefing
room. Congress returned from a three-month long recess this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the government's fiscal policies and the strong
economy have caused federal budget surpluses over the next decade
to be much larger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Congressional Budget Office will announce that
the federal budget surplus could total as much as $2 trillion over
the next 10 years _ which is double than the $1 trillion amount
previously projected.
</P>
<P>
   That surplus will allow the government to pay off the $3.6
trillion publicly held debt by the year 2013, Clinton said, rather
than the year 2015 as was previously forecast. The nation's total
debt of $5.6 trillion includes $2 billion in debt held by
government trust funds like Social Security. The Clinton plan only
deals with the $3.6 trillion public portion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton explained that paying down the nation's debt reduces
interest rates, saving consumers money on their mortgage payments,
car and other consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he would propose that the interest savings
generated by paying down the debt be plowed into the Social
Security retirement system. If Congress went along, this means
Social Security would remain solvent until the year 2050, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing is done to the current Social Security system, it is
projected to go broke in the year 2035 _ after it pays out
retirement benefits starting in 2011 to the so-called baby boom
generation born after World War II. The government currently pays
about $200 billion in interest annually on the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The pay-as-you go system is funded by payroll taxes taken from
current workers' paychecks and given to retirees, but once the bulk
of the 76 million boomers retire there will not be enough workers
paying into the system to keep it solvent for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton backed away from previous plans to shore up Social
Security until 2075 by investing part of the trust fund in the
stock market. He said he didn't think there would a strong enough
bipartisan consensus in an election year to overhaul the current
system.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill some Republican endorsed the concept of paying
down the nation's debt by allowing the projected budget surpluses
to accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will protect to the largest extent possible the surplus,''
said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee. His panel is charged with writing the 13
bills that fund the government on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case since the Republicans took over Congress in
1995 the annual budget process is expected to again be a major
battle with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have unsuccessfully pressed for $700 billion in
tax cuts the past two years. Clinton was also unable to get his
much smaller, targeted tax cut through Congress last year, but is
again expected to push for a plan that includes tax credits for
people who stay home with infants and for people who care for the
elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Republicans are expected to unveil a slightly less
expensive package plan that includes reducing the so-called
marriage penalty but it is still likely to be much larger than
plans favored by the Democrats. The marriage penalty results from
the fact that married working couples often pay more in taxes than
if they were single because the tax code takes a larger bite out of
their combined higher incomes.

LIVERMORE, Calif. _  KITCHENWENTE  _ Some people match their wall
colors to afavorite fabric or the palette of a treasured armoire.
When Carolyn Wente and her husband, Buxton L. Layton III, selected

 COOK'S BOOKS: Chic Blends With Cozy in Wente's New Book   By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; LIVERMORE, Calif. _  &LR; Livermore Valley's wine culture blends
rusticity and sophistication in a way that distinguishes it from
other California wine growing areas. That spirit is captured in
``Sharing the Vineyard Table,'' a cookbook with brief essays by
Wente Vineyards president Carolyn Wente and Kimball Jones,
executive chef of the Vineyards Restaurant Wente founded nearly 14
years ago.
<P>
   Wente's participation in the venture is no vanity effort. She is
an accomplished cook who thinks little of whipping up a dinner for
25 in the near-professional kitchen she and husband Buck Layton
designed (see Cooks' Kitchens story).
</P>
<P>
   The book's format is reminiscent of ``Julia and Jacques,'' with
his-and-hers discourses about, for examples, what makes a perfect
pantry or a great picnic. Wente's choice for a picnic is a
kite-flying outing in the Livermore Valley, fueled by salads,
cookies, simple rolled aram sandwiches for the youngsters and
sophisticated sandwiches (mint pesto on lamb) for the adults;
Jones' is a Yosemite tour de force with smoked trout toasts, duck
and asparagus and a potato gratin.
</P>
<P>
   The chatty but brief essays touch on such other issues as wine
pairings; the region's history, and the evolution of the Wente's
olive oil production from its French origins in the 1800s to
today's reliance on Tuscan methods and style.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 or so recipes from the restaurant stoves and Wente's
home kitchen are organized by seasons, varying in complexity, but
never veering beyond what a reasonably competent home cook can do.
If a luscious chocolate hazelnut souffle cake with strawberry and
raspberry compote sounds time-consuming, readers can opt for
something as simple yet delicious as apple fritters with Armagnac
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough time for braised rabbit ragout with butternut squash,
currants and spinach pappardelle? Orzo with caramelized onions and
Asiago takes no longer than the time to sip a before-dinner glass
of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Again in line with an emerging trend, many recipes are not for a
single dish but for a whole main course, like goat cheese-stuffed
chicken breasts with olive oil and lemon-mashed potatoes. (It is
one of the entrees that will be featured at a series of Sharing the
Vineyard Table theme dinners at the Wente Vineyards Restaurant
February 2, 3, 9 and 10. Call 925-456-2460 for menus and
reservations.)
</P>
<P>
   All recipes in the book are precise enough to reassure a novice
cook, yet they are often open-ended to allow room for
improvisation. That's in line with Wente's and Jones' intentions
for readers to ``try, enjoy, experiment and learn.''

&AMP; LEMON MASHED POTATOES
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Wente suggests serving this with Sauvignon Blanc or a
light, steel-fermented Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon finely chopped lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   The Chicken
</P>
<P>
   4 large chicken breast halves with wings attached
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup honey tangerine juice (or regular tangerine juice)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water.
Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook about 20 minutes, or
until the potatoes are tender and easily pierced with a sharp
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Drain and return to the pot. Add the olive oil, cream, lemon
juice and lemon zest and mash with a hand masher or heavy whisk.
Season with salt. Keep warm in a double boiler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Chicken:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. On the thick
side of each chicken breast, near the wing bone, cut a pocket in
the flesh. Fill each pocket with 1/4 cup goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large, oven-proof saute pan over high
heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to
the saute pan, skin side down. Lower the heat to medium-high. Cook
until the skin is nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken
breasts over and place in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Cook for 20 minutes. The internal temperature of the chicken
should be at least 140 degrees. Remove the chicken from the pan and
let rest on a plate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the glaze:  &LR; Pour out any fat remaining in the pan, add
the tangerine juice and stir over medium heat, scraping up the
browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour any juice that has
accumulated on the plate with the chicken back into the pan. Bring
to a boil, then strain.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, place a chicken breast on each plate. Spoon the
tangerine jus over the chicken. Serve the mashed potatoes on the
side.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Know a child? Get them a free book
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Each year, with the help of Cox Newspapers, I
send out free books to any child who writes and asks, or for that
matter, any parent or grandparent who writes and asks for a child.
</P>
<P>
   The address is Free Books for Kids, c/o Joe Murray, Cox
Newspapers, P.O. Box 151108, Lufkin, Texas 75915.
</P>
<P>
   I'll need to know the child's age or reading level, and please
make sure the return address is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you can include four first-class stamps to help with
the return postage, that helps too. But if you can't, don't worry
about it. You'll still receive your book.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Books for Kids program has been going on for several
years. But its beginning dates back more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   That's when my oldest daughter was just a toddler. Each Monday,
which was my day off at the newspaper, she and I would have a
special day, visiting the library, shopping for a toy at the
five-and-dime, sipping a cherry Coke at a corner drug store and
then stopping off at the City News Stand, a haunt of mine since I
had been a child myself.
</P>
<P>
   The City News Stand was the closest thing Lufkin had to a
bookstore when I was growing up. Mainly, the selection consisted of
paperbacks, but that's where I bought my first important book,
``The Catcher in the Rye.''
</P>
<P>
   I was 10 years old. The only reason it caught my eye was the
illustration. I thought the character was wearing a deerstalker's
cap like Sherlock Holmes. That's what appealed to me.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was a hunter's cap turned backwards like a
baseball catcher. I wouldn't say the book changed my life, but it
changed the direction of my reading.
</P>
<P>
   So it was, after all those years, I'd still stop by the City
News Stand. Now I was bringing my little girl.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Messer, who owned the City News Stand, was delighted to see
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your daughter is going to love books just like you,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I hope so,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, but she will,'' Ruth insisted. ``A child who grows up with
books in the home will always love to read.''
</P>
<P>
   That impressed me. It still does today. It's so simple, so easy
_ and so sad that not all children have access to books.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this:
</P>
<P>
   If a child can read, a child can learn.
</P>
<P>
   If a child can learn, a child can do well in school.
</P>
<P>
   If a child does well in school, that child is on the way to
becoming a success in life.
</P>
<P>
   And the flip side:
</P>
<P>
   If a child can't read, a child can't learn.
</P>
<P>
   If a child can't learn, a child can't do well in school.
</P>
<P>
   If a child can't do well in school, that child is on the way to
becoming a dropout.
</P>
<P>
   Reading can make a difference. Write for free books. The
deadline is Feb. 15.

 COOKS' KITCHENS: Wente Brings Vineyard Spirit, Palette Inside   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 LIVERMORE, Calif. _  Some people match their wall colors to a
favorite fabric or the palette of a treasured armoire. When Carolyn
Wente and her husband, Buxton L. Layton III, selected paint for
their remodeled kitchen, they chose a soft yellow to complement the
gently rolling hills of the Wente family winery. The Livermore
Valley winery forms the backdrop for their kitchen view of the
Wente golf course.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And when the fourth-generation president of Wente Vineyards (her
mother, two brothers, her husband and a cousin occupy other top
spots in the family enterprise) needs a few sage leaves for a
turkey ballotine, a touch of mint for a grilled fig appetizer, or
lemon juice and zest for lemon mashed potatoes, she can pick them
in a few minutes' stroll from her home. Her leg of lamb is bathed
in a marinade made with oil from olives grown on the estate, and
Wente wines complement meals, from starters to dessert.
</P>
<P>
   To complete this all-in-the-family picture, the Wente-Layton
pair designed their new kitchen themselves because they were not
interested in a ``designer kitchen'' that followed current
architectural and decor trends, but instead wanted a space that
would meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Their design decisions recognized the fact that both of them are
tall and therefore needed counters and sinks higher than the
standard. Their son, 4-year-old Buxton L. Layton IV _ called Bucky
to distinguish him from his dad, who is known as Buck _ spends a
lot of time in the kitchen, so they wanted counters with gentle,
rounded edges to minimize bumps. The couple also uses their kitchen
not only for cozy family dinners for three but for meals for 25 _
and sometimes more.
</P>
<P>
   Who is the cook when the numbers swell like that? ``Me,'' says
Wente, who employs a nanny but only occasional kitchen help. ``We
entertain so much, I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wente moved into the 1930s building, the residence of the
defunct Cresta Blanca Winery, in 1983 and oversaw a general
modernization. This initial kitchen remodel replaced antiquated
wiring, plumbing and appliances, but maintained the original floor
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the second remodel, which began in 1998 and was
completed early last year. The kitchen was doubled to approximately
20 by 30 feet. The new space encompasses a large pantry with a big
freezer and an adjacent bar with its own sink and refrigerator, the
location between kitchen and dining room allowing an easy flow of
food and drink during a large party.
</P>
<P>
   The redo opened the kitchen to the bucolic views and the large
deck, a frequent site for socializing and dining. Here, too, the
owners' non-glitzy style shows in such homey touches as big,
blue-speckled enameled roasters doing duty as planters.
</P>
<P>
   While the remodeling obviously wasn't done on a shoestring,
Wente kept an eye on the bottom line and analyzed her needs before
committing to a purchase. ``You have to make a decision about, do I
really need that (an appliance or other feature), based on how much
I would use it . . . versus the cost,'' she believes. Too many
kitchen redos, she says, include expensive gadgetry that's very  &LR; au
courant &LR;  _ but which the people actually cooking in that kitchen
will rarely use.
</P>
<P>
   For Wente that meant nixing such items as a garbage disposal in
the pantry/bar sink. Once in a while it might come in handy, she
admits, but not often enough to justify the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the couple's design choices that might seem extravagant
really aren't: a walk-in pantry, two dishwashers, double
side-by-side Sub-Zero refrigerators and the sheer size of the
kitchen all really serve a purpose, Wente says. With the amount of
entertaining she does, hosting business associates as well as her
large family and a circle of friends _ who like to linger in the
kitchen _ these features have proven entirely appropriate and
cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   One favorite approach in modern kitchen design that Wente has
adopted is using drawers rather than conventional cabinets. She
finds the drawers _ deep or shallow, as intended use dictates _ to
be much more practical.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband selected Douglas fir, stain for the floors
and cabinets and decided on the size and placement of the center
work island (right across from the Wolf range, which is topped by a
heavy-duty Thermador hood), the sinks and counter areas dedicated
to specific storage needs. They toured Bay Area wholesale outlets
for material for counter tops and matching back splashes that would
be attractive and easy to clean, ending up with smooth granite.
</P>
<P>
   Wente then got to work with graph paper and sketched the
intended layout. The cabinet maker and general contractor took
these plans and refined measurements before doing the actual
building.
</P>
<P>
   The owners put the finishing touches to the kitchen and the
adjoining rooms _ on one side, a comfortably furnished family room
that also houses Wente's cookbook collection; on the other, a
large, airy dining room _ by hanging bright modern paintings and
installing some antiques inherited from Laytons' New Orleans
family.
</P>
<P>
   Wente was the force behind the Wente Vineyards Restaurant, which
opened in 1986, and she still works closely with its executive
chef, Kimball Jones (see related book review). But she chooses to
entertain at home rather than in the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love to cook,'' she says with an almost sheepish
grin, ``and people love to be entertained in someone's home. It's
so much more personal; it's so comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Team Offers Advice for Kitchen Remodel &QL;  &LR; 
Carolyn Wente, president of Wente Vineyards in Livermore, and her
husband, Buck Layton, finished an extensive remodel of their
kitchen in a 1930s winery building early last year.
</P>
<P>
   They did a lot of legwork themselves, scouring building supply
houses and appliance sources, before drawing up the plans for their
kitchen which has to accommodate family needs and large-scale
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Wente says so far, she hasn't discovered any flaws in the
design, so she can't say what they might do differently were they
to do it over again (``heaven forbid!''), but she has strong
opinions _ and advice _ for would-be remodelers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Move out while the serious construction goes on, if at all
possible. Even make-shift temporary quarters will prove less
stressful than months of living in a construction site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Well in advance of beginning the job, analyze how you cook on
a daily basis and when you entertain. Make sure the new plan
accommodates your personal patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself such questions as how much refrigerator and freezer
space do you need; do you tend to have lots of people milling
around the kitchen when you entertain; and do you like to serve
meals right in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scout local suppliers to familiarize yourself with what's
available _ counter tops, flooring, cabinets, major and minor
appliances. Find out as much as you can about their performance
record, again paying attention to your own needs. If a dishwasher
is going to be near an area for entertaining or television viewing,
for example, noise levels are a major consideration.
</P>
<P>
   _ Evaluate whether the cost of added features is worth it.
Compromise is generally necessary to keep costs reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Order all materials and appliances before construction starts
so they are on site or at the suppliers'. This expedites
construction, avoiding aggravating delays that add to the final
cost.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Safeway Select's Pizza Rises to the Top of the 
 List   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Don't want to deal with carry-out pizza on Super
Bowl Sunday? Well, there's a whole new line of frozen pizzas that
just might do.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago when we tasted frozen four-cheese pizzas, only two
featured a self-rising crust. Now the freezer section is full of
pizzas with crusts that puff up when they're baked. Today's panel
tasted eight frozen pepperoni pizzas, all labeled rising crust or
self-rising crust. Interestingly, two self-rising pizzas scored
significantly better in the four-cheese category test against
non-rising crusts. When compared to the new family of pizzas, they
scored over 20 points below what they had earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The panel picked  &UR; Safeway Select &LR;  (31.33 ounces, $4.99) as its
favorite. The panel enjoyed the crispness of the crust, the
pepperoni and the cheese. Four would buy it; one might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Tombstone &LR;  (29.8 ounces, $5.99 at many
supermarkets). Panelists liked the crunchy-chewy crust. Four would
buy it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the rest was  &UR; Red Baron &LR;  (27.65 ounces, $5.89 at
Safeway). The crust's breadiness was the main problem. One panelist
liked the pepperoni flavor, but another tasted only salt and
tomatoes in the topping. One would buy it, two might buy it, and
two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DiGiorno &LR;  (31.33 ounces, $5.99-$6.99 at many supermarkets),
came in fourth place. Three panelists objected to the crust's
doughy consistency; others found the topping too sweet. One would
buy it, one might buy it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Freschetta &LR;  (28.15 ounces, $5.99-$6.49 at
many supermarkets). Four panelists did not care for the puffy crust
_ one compared it to ``eating a sponge'' _ but another liked the
``fluffy'' texture. One would buy it, one might buy it, and four
would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also sampled Tony's, Mama Celeste and A Pranzo
(Albertsons), but they ranked too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin,
culinary director, Center for Culinary Development; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Lesli Neilson,
Chronicle staff writer; and Roland Passot, chef-owner of La Folie
in San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park. All
products are tasted blind.

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: Clinton Cracks Down on Eggs   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The poor egg is getting beaten up again. This
time, by President Clinton.
<P>
   Just before Christmas, the President proposed new egg safety
procedures that could force egg producers to irradiate or
pasteurize billions of eggs each year.
</P>
<P>
   The intention is to curb Salmonella enteritidis, a strain of the
bacteria increasingly found inside eggs. Clinton says his Council
on Food Safety estimates that contaminated eggs could kill or
sicken 300,000 people each year. The cost of all that salmonella
poisoning could cost the nation from $150 million to $870 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, the federal government believes, is a set of rules
that would require farmers to either test for salmonella bacteria
and divert contaminated eggs from the market or to send eggs
through a ``kill step.'' In most cases, that would mean using new
in-shell pasteurization methods.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposal would require strict warning labels on
egg cartons akin to the federal warnings on cigarettes and alcohol.
The label, first unveiled by the Food and Drug Administration in
July, would warn people not to eat raw or lightly cooked eggs. Eggs
that have been irradiated or pasteurized would be exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Food safety experts and lawmakers began drafting the proposed
law this month. Once it's written, the public will have 90 days to
review it.
</P>
<P>
   California egg producers and some state scientists are
dismissing the federal government's get-tough-on-eggs position.
</P>
<P>
   The issue isn't so much bacterium as it is politics, says Hans
Riemann, a professor of food safety and epidemiology at the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I think this is part of the politics of food
safety,'' he says. ``There's probably some turf battles going on
among the government agencies. What's going on is there is sort of
a media scare and regulatory agencies feel compelled to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   People on all sides of the egg battle agree that no one knows
exactly how many cases of salmonella can be attributed to eggs, or
even how many cases occur each year.
</P>
<P>
   National estimates of salmonella poisoning run anywhere from
300,000 to 4 million. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
estimates that between 1985 and 1998, the years Salmonella
enteritidis was considered to be at epidemic levels, it was a
factor in 79 deaths. More often than not, the fatalities involved
infants, the elderly or people with compromised immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Because the symptoms can often be mild _ aches, nausea and
slight fever _ many cases of the illness go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   And although Riemann agrees salmonella has been on the increase
over the past decade, he argues that many of the cases can be
linked to poor food handling, not infected eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think it's necessary to pasteurize eggs. I
think the risk is very low,'' he says. ``It's really up to the
consumer to decide what to do about that risk. Consumers should be
educated so they can make a decision if they want to eat an
undercooked yolk or a cooked yolk. In either case the risk is very
small,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the California Egg Commission, president Robert
Pierre is taking a wait-and-see approach toward the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut guess is this won't even come to fruition,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre argues that testing and pasteurizing eggs would be
impractical and expensive, adding as much as 35 cents to every
carton. California, he says, sees about five cases of salmonella a
year and not all of them can be traced to bad eggs. And in a state
that consumes 7.4 billion eggs a year, that's not a bad track
record.
</P>
<P>
   Like those who enjoy homemade mayonnaise, eggs Benedict with
soft-poached eggs and a traditional Caesar salad, Pierre waves away
the FDA recommendation that people cook egg yolks until they're
hard. He offers his own diet as proof that eggs are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre eats four eggs a day, often sunny-side up, and boasts a
cholesterol level of only 166.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Barley Can Take the Place of Pasta   By Marion Cunningham 
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Hulled barley is one of the best-tasting and
nourishing grains I know, perfect for cold weather meals _ yet it
often takes some time to seek out.
<P>
   Unlike the more commonplace (and less nourishing) polished pearl
barley, which is available in most supermarkets, I have to make a
trip to my nearby health-food store to buy it, so I purchase five
or six pounds at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The barley keeps well in jars with tightly screwed-on lids. If
you have room, store the jars in your refrigerator to prevent the
natural oils in the barley from turning rancid.
</P>
<P>
   Hulled barley is robust, filling and satisfying, and tastes
pleasantly toasty. I use it as I would pasta _ cooked, flavored and
served as a main course.
</P>
<P>
   Barley takes between 45 minutes and 1 hour to cook, so you might
as well cook twice as much as you need and freeze leftovers for a
later meal. One cup uncooked hulled barley yields about 3 cups
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   While the barley cooks, cube eggplant, zucchini, onions, sweet
green or red peppers and spread them on a baking sheet. Season with
salt and lightly drizzle with olive oil, then roast them at 375 to
400 degrees until they're tender _ 30 minutes for some, an hour for
others.
</P>
<P>
   When asparagus is in season, the long green spears make a
particularly nice foil for barley.
</P>
<P>
   Or serve it simply, with sauce of brown butter and a sprinkling
of finely chopped green onions.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; HULLED BARLEY WITH BROWN BUTTER &AMP; SCALLIONS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   3 cups hulled (or whole-grain) barley
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   4 green onions
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Put the water into a large 5- or 6-quart pot. Add the salt and
stir. Bring the water to a boil and add the barley, stirring. Turn
the heat to medium so it is still boiling, but not fiercely. Cook
for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the barley is cooking, put the butter in a small saucepan.
Turn the heat to medium-high and stir the butter as it melts. When
it has melted, tilt and tip the pan so the melted butter moves all
around the bottom and doesn't burn. When the butter turns a rich
caramel color, remove from the heat. It should be brown, but not
dark brown. This only takes a couple of minutes so don't turn your
back on it. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the green onions on a cutting board and trim off the root
ends and 4 or 5 inches of the coarse green tops. Finely chop the
onions. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   When the barley has cooked for 45 minutes, check it for doneness
by scooping out a few grains with a spoon and tasting them. If the
grains are chewy and tender, the barley is done. If the grains are
still tough and firm, cook the barley for 15 minutes longer, then
test again for doneness. When done, pour the water and barley into
a strainer.
</P>
<P>
   Measure 3 cups of cooked barley and put into a serving bowl. Let
the remaining barley cool, then transfer to a container, cover
tightly and refrigerate or freeze until needed.
</P>
<P>
   Add the brown butter and scallions to the barley in the bowl,
taste and add more salt and some pepper if needed. Serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 3 cups; serves 2 or 3.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Toast Your Valentine With Blushes and Roses   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Valentine's Day is only a few heartbeats away, so
it isn't too early to be thinking about a nice wine to toast your
valentine. Pink is perfect, ros e  is right, but whatever wine you
choose, make sure it blushes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blush wines fall into a generic category for wines with some
pink-red coloring, but are not quite ros &LR; e &LR; s. White Zinfandel is
the most popular example of a blush wine, even though that name
itself is a misnomer, since few of the wines are clear or ``white''
in color. At the peak of the White Zin craze, there were all kinds
of White Zin wannabes, most of which never survived. Pale pink
wines were made from Pinot Noir, Merlot, Petite Sirah, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, during a shortage of white wine, Mill Creek
Vineyards of Sonoma County came up with a lightly tinted Cabernet
Sauvignon that became Mill Creek's Cabernet Blush. ``Blush'' caught
on as a generic name for all light ros &LR; e &LR;  wines, especially those
made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. So, Mill Creek's
owners, the Kreck family, trademarked ``blush'' and began licensing
wineries to use the name.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kreck says Mill Creek no longer licenses the name, but
blush continues to be used by the trade and the wine public.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of flavored wines _ White Zin with
berry flavors is one example _ sales for White Zinfandel have been
slipping. But there are still plenty of good choices out there such
as Sutter Home White Zinfandel, De Loach and for a slightly more
herbal flavor, the Mill Creek Cabernet Blush.
</P>
<P>
   Between blush and ros &LR; e &LR;  is another pale-pink wine, known more
in France than the United States. The name translates to ``gray
wine,'' which refers to the color of the grape used in France. Vin
Gris is most commonly seen in the Lorraine region of the Loire
Valley where winemakers make the pink wine from Gamay grapes.
California wineries producing a Vin Gris include Bonny Doon and
Sanford.
</P>
<P>
   When pink wines are too wimpy and reds are too macho, the only
choice is to turn to ros &LR; e &LR; s. Many a romantic couple can recall
gazing at each other lovingly over a glass of Lancers or Mateus
Ros &LR; e &LR; , the Portuguese pink wines that took the market by storm
back in the 1970s. For true ros &LR; e &LR;  aficionados, there were always
dry and flavorsome Tavel ros &LR; e &LR; s from Southern France, a delicate
expression of the Grenache grape that belies the bruiser reds made
today from Grenache.
</P>
<P>
   At their purest, ros &LR; e &LR; s are delicate and aromatic wines made by
lightly pressing and macerating red grapes to extract a little
color and the freshest essence of the grape.
</P>
<P>
   Ros &LR; e &LR; s never see wood in any form and after a brief settling
period, go directly to bottle. They are meant to be enjoyed while
still young and fresh. Ros &LR; e &LR; s may not be complex, but they are
delightful and easy to drink. An off-dry ros &LR; e &LR;  with baked ham is
one of my favorite wine-food matches.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ros &LR; e &LR; s on the market today, including: Joseph
Phelps Grenache Ros &LR; e &LR; , Simi Ros &LR; e &LR;  of Cabernet Sauvignon and
Sangiovese ros &LR; e &LR; s from Swanson and Iron Horse.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Toast Your Valentine &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Imagination should be enough to conjure a romantic site for
Valentine's Day, but if you need help, Gloria Ferrer has an idea.
On February 12, from 8-10 p.m., at the Gloria Ferrer Champagne
Caves, 23555 Highway 121, Sonoma, flamenco guitarist Eric Symons

Noir. The cost is $17 per person. Reserved seating may be obtained

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Crab &AMP; Wine Days &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you can't wait until Valentine's Day and would like to do
something different, try the Mendocino Crab &AMP; Wine Days, January
28-February 5, a week-long celebration that includes crab-cooking
classes, wine tastings and more, at Mendocino's favorite inns,
wineries and dining rooms. Prices and menus vary depending on the
venue. For more information, call the Mendocino County Promotional
Alliance, (877) 462-6864.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Wine Q &AMP; A &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was intrigued by your recent mention of the 1993 Louis
Roederer Brut Vintage Champagne, but am having difficulty locating
a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   A: I suggest checking out D &AMP; M Wines &AMP; Liquors, at the corner
of Fillmore and Sacramento streets in San Francisco, for one of the
best selections of Champagne and sparkling wines in the Bay Area.
Call D &AMP; M at (415) 346-1325.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an old bottle of Gundlach-Bundschu Bacchus Burgundy
and am curious about the wine's history. Also, is the winery is
still in business?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gundlach-Bundschu is going strong in Sonoma under the
ownership of the Bundschu family. Jim Bundschu doesn't know much
about the old wine, but says that if it has a black label, it
probably dates from 1900 to 1912.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is your Bacchus Burgundy is a curiosity today and
likely long dead. But the only way to know is to pull the cork and
give it a try. It could be great and you'll still have the bottle
as a keepsake.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Wine Trivia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the sherry bodegas of Spain, a  &LR; veneciador &LR;  dips a  &LR; venecia &LR; ,
a tubular silver cup on a long slender cane of bamboo or whale
bone, into the bung of a sherry butt and draws out a measure of
sherry. Then, holding the venecia above his head, he pours _ with
great flair _ a long arc of pale sherry into a cluster of sherry
glasses ( &LR; copitas &LR; ) he holds in his other hand.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Bouchon Dresses Up Cauliflower   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Vegetable gratins are great for company because
they can be assembled early in the day and baked just before you
want to serve them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bouchon's Cauliflower Gratin is a lovely dish where the
vegetable is combined with cream, garlic, shallots and horseradish.
After being topped with cheese it's cooked in the oven until brown
and bubbly. I don't know of any better way to eat this workhorse
winter vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   The gratin is also the type of dish that fits perfectly with
much of what's served in the restaurant _ rich, delicious comfort
food _ yet because of it's make-ahead quality it's just as good for
the home cook. At Bouchon in Yountville it comes to the table in an
oval casserole, the top looking looking like a bubbling browned
moonscape, with a lovely aroma permeating the air.
</P>
<P>
   The cauliflower is only one of many memorable dishes at this
popular brasserie, owned by the French Laundry's Thomas Keller and
his brother, Joseph. The restaurant feels like a real French
brasserie, complete with zinc bar and hand-painted tile floor.
</P>
<P>
   The menu is a storehouse of classics _ a great quiche, steak
frites, and onion soup, to name just three. There's also a
wonderful oyster bar stocked with all kinds of pristine shellfish.
And because the restaurant is open until 1 a.m., it's the place
where locals congregate for a late-night snack.

 &HT;    Wattles _ where the wild things go
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Jan. 27.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Renee Hopf showed me her wattle the first time we met. And what
a lovely wattle it was. I just had to have one. Now I do, and does
it ever make the wild things happy.
</P>
<P>
   It had been years since I'd even heard the word wattle _ back in
the 1970s, when I was majoring in English literature, reading
19th-century references to this traditional technique of weaving
pruned twigs and branches and such to make walls and fences that
reach across fields, a variation on the hedgerow, which features
living plants.
</P>
<P>
   Renee, who lives in Stone Mountain, Ga., with husband Denny,
began building her first wattle four years ago with help from stone
craftsman David Stevens. Now, eight of them grace the lovingly
landscaped two-acre space. When I visited last summer, Renee
proudly toured her wattles, which, like gardens, are never done.
Recent additions include the Christmas tree, along with pruned
branches from Bradford pears.
</P>
<P>
   In simplest terms, a wattle is just a lot of garden material
that you pile up a few feet high, as wide as you like: ``Another
way of composting,'' explains Renee. She goes on to note that
wattles don't just lay there rotting; they visually enrich the
landscape, prevent erosion _ and attract birds.
</P>
<P>
   But won't wattles also attract rats and snakes?
</P>
<P>
   Says Renee, ``You have to look at it this way: Snakes already
are in the garden. And would you rather have rats in the wattle _
or trying to get into your house?'' To be sure, no good garden is
free of undesirables.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the birds was what sent me wattling at the cabin in
McCaysville, Ga., where I had begun feeling bird-challenged, seeing
too few too infrequently. There's nothing like a whole lot of
flitting and fluttering to give a space movement and color.
</P>
<P>
   So, after clearing some brush and cutting a few scraggly trees
recently, my wattles began. (One friend grabbed his throat and
quipped: ``You want wattle? I got plenty, only I call it turkey
neck.'')
</P>
<P>
   My largest one, down the slope toward Fightingtown Creek,
features a foundation of trunks from little pines and oaks. On top
of that, all manner of pruned parts, including mountain laurel,
white pine, sourwood, sassafras. Like Renee, I even throw in
leaves. For carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing the structure one morning, Lyn exclaimed: ``It's a condo
wattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, she has not learned proper wattle etiquette. Late
one night, when I imagined a flock of birds bedded down, Lyn dumped
a cooler of ice onto my big wattle _ just as I was shouting,
``Don't dump there!''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, with the most insincere apology I've ever
heard, she said, ``I'm sorry I iced your wattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no harm done in the long term. As word of my wattle
circulates around the ridge, more and more birds fly in. I even
think I identified a group of titmice, along with wrens and the
more obvious cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Birding in the wattle has its uncertainties, though: As soon as
I focus my field glasses onto the condo, birds move to another
floor, protected from me and my prying eyes. From their point of
view, that's what a wattle's for. Isn't it?

 &HT;    Contest gives Atlantan's renovation saga a happy ending
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Jan. 27.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Debra Johnston knew seven years ago she'd found her
dream home _ the perfect setting for her passion for all things
modern.
</P>
<P>
   But after three attempts at renovating the 1959 ranch house,
that dream became more like The Nightmare on Ridgewood Road.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston struggled through costly experiences with a series of
contractors, including one she says absconded with her money.
Thieves stole personal belongings from the basement quarters she
shared with her four dogs during renovations. And one day she came
home to find the beautiful woodlands view that first sold her on
the northwest Atlanta house had sprouted an unsightly cell phone
tower.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad that two months short of completing the
two-year project Johnston put the place on the market. ``By then,
the house was so torn up I couldn't just throw up my hands,'' she
says. ``I'd already made the investment.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth contractor and an interior designer convinced Johnston
not to give up, and is she ever glad she didn't. The trio's
transformation of the Atlanta home has been selected one of eight
national winners in Metropolitan Home magazine's Home of the Year
contest. It's the first time in the competition's 14-year history
that a Georgia entry placed. (Another '59 ranch renovation, Atlanta
interior designer Bill Cook's home, was a runner-up.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very beautiful design by someone who went after a
dream and made it happen,'' editor in chief Donna Warner says of
Johnston's home, featured in the January/February issue.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the 40-year-old Michigan native did what many
would-be homeowners do _ clip magazine photos of her favorite
design ideas. And like most, her tastes changed over the years as
her career took her to new addresses, including New York, Dallas
and Minneapolis, where she got her first crack at renovating.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing would prepare her for the ordeal she'd encounter in
Atlanta after becoming an executive with Coca-Cola in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Made for modern
</P>
<P>
   Johnston went through five real estate agents before finding one
who would show her a nontraditional house. ``I knew I wanted open
spaces, privacy and natural materials,'' she says. ``But all they
kept showing me were '70s houses that were all chopped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a sixth agent took her by the Ridgewood Estates
ranch-style house, which sat on the market through three price
reductions. ``In 1992, people who saw this house probably said,
'What do I do with this?'''Johnston says.
</P>
<P>
   It would be several years before 20th-century design, from
architecture to furnishings, would see the revival it's enjoying
today.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Johnston had already mounted the modern bandwagon
in a complete turnaround from the 18th-century antiques she'd
collected for years. ``I went into 20th Century Antiques one day
and saw some Heywood-Wakefield furniture,'' she recalls, citing the
blond, modern pieces of the 1930s through '50s. ``I bought six
pieces of it, but none of it worked with anything I had so I put it
in storage.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even out of sight, the purchase pushed her in a new
direction. She started going to modernism shows, flea markets,
anywhere that proved a resource for vintage 20th-century pieces _
especially Knoll furniture and Russel Wright dinnerware. ``By 1996,
prices hadn't gone through the roof, so I started buying every
piece I could find,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   One uncanny purchase convinced Johnston there was a reason she
was drawn to modern design. After finding a pair of urns in a
magazine, she called the dealer to buy them. ``I asked who had
designed them, and he said Dorothy Acton,'' she recalls. ``I said,
'No way!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Acton and her husband, furniture designer Hugh Acton, were her
nextdoor neighbors while growing up in Birmingham, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   A dream diffused
</P>
<P>
   Johnston put all of her new furnishings into storage and sold
the antiques in a garage sale during the first four years she owned
the house. She used that time to get to know the place and save her
money before doing anything more than painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the house seemed pretty much the same as it must
have been in 1959,'' she says, including its salmon, gray and taupe
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling soffits had rotted, the terrazzo floors had been
damaged by carpet glue, and the mechanical systems proved
inadequate. Its small three bedrooms and two baths, designed for a
'50s suburban family, weren't suited for a '90s career woman.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnston gutted the house. ``It's amazing to watch a house
get torn all the way down and then put back together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't just watch. Her choices in contractors forced her to
get involved in every aspect of the project. ``My friends almost
left me, it became so time consuming,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The first contractor _ a friend of a friend _ left the job after
two weeks, she says, with a check for $52,000 he said he needed to
buy new windows. The second offered to secure the exposed house,
but she soon fired him when it was clear ``he didn't know know what
he was doing.'' Finally, a third contractor was forced to stop work
while Johnston and the first contractor attempted to resolve
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Then came one of those moments when most homeowners wonder
whether they made a poor investment. One draw to the property had
been the 22 acres of undeveloped property behind the house. But in
1997, Johnston came home from work to find a 180-foot cell tower
erected on the site. She and her neighbors protested, and AT&AMP;T
agreed to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the fiasco, she and her four terriers made a home in
two basement rooms. That wasn't a problem, she says, until thieves
made off with her television, computer, jewelry and stamp
collection.
</P>
<P>
   It was all enough to make her put the house up for sale for two
months, though fortunately, none of the lookers _including singer
Sinead O'Connor _ made an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a winner
</P>
<P>
   Johnston finally got her dream back on track after entrusting a
contractor that understood the house, Moon Bros. Inc., and an
interior designer to help focus her ideas, Jim Sims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house had good bones, so the goal was to respect the
original architecture as much as possible by simplifying what she
was looking for,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Johnston's lifestyle is vastly different from
that of most women of the '50s. She needed to get more out of the
4,500-square-foot space _ a kitchen efficient for entertaining, an
office practical for catching up, a luxurious master suite for
chilling out. All had to flow together within a space that
emphasized light and openness.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the house, Johnston replaced the kitchen windows
with larger ones and converted the carport to a garage. In the
center, terrazzo floors were ripped up and maple ones put down that
unify the living room, dining room and foyer. And on the other
side, the old master bedroom became a master bath and dressing
room, and a new master bedroom was added.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no standard addition. Sims designed a pavilion _ a
500-square-foot room with glass on three sides that appears to
float on stilts above a courtyard of black bamboo. By positioning
the wing on the back of the house, he maintained the facade,
blending the new with the old. ``Separating the bedroom and the
bathroom with glass created two spaces with a sexiness because each
is open to the other,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And it was one of the dramatic changes that caught the eye of
Met Home last fall as it weighed more than 300 contest entries.
``Hers was a unanimous choice,'' Warner says. ``Every single editor
thought she did a great job, and that's unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, who submitted snapshots and an essay on the project,
says she's wanted to enter the contest since first subscribing in
1985. ``When they called to notify me, I just said, 'Oh my God!' ''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The six pages of published photos are definitely keepers for
that idea file of hers _ permanent reminders that determination can
indeed make dreams happen.
</P>
<P>
   WORDS FROM THE WISE
</P>
<P>
   Here's Debra Johnston's advice for planning a renovation:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spend time upfront planning the project _ arranging financing,
getting drawings, deciding on details _ before interviewing a
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get referrals of several contractors who have done the same or
similar type project you're planning.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inspect the contractor's work before hiring to determine if
the quality meets your standards.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask to examine proof of licensing, general liability insurance
and workers' compensation insurance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask contractors to explain their cleanup practices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be willing to wait to have the work done by your choice of
contractors. ``If they're good and they're busy, they will be worth
the wait,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ignore the lowest bid and hire the best contractor you can for
your money. ``It will save you money in the long run,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the remodeling industry recommends that homeowners:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask contractors how long their companies have been in business
(it typically takes at least five years to establish a financially
sound business).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check court records to determine if the contractor has been
sued.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Insist on a written contract once you hire a contractor that
indicates the estimated start and completion dates and descriptions
of the work, materials and prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure no work is done until the contractor purchases the
necessary building permits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add at least 10 percent to the project budget to cover cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't pay cash and don't pay more than one-third of the cost
in advance, one-third midway into the project and the balance upon
completion.

PORK STAYS TENDER UNDER A PANKO BLANKET

   Crisp-fried pork is a classic Japanese dish today, but it is
actually a very early example of fusion cooking. Sometime early in
the century, Europeans brought veal Milanese to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor and style of the breaded and fried veal cutlets
became widely popular, but the dish could not be duplicated without
importing meat, since there is almost no veal in Japan. So it was
adapted, using pork and Japanese breadcrumbs, called panko, and
Worcestershire, steak sauce or ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, and in many Japanese restaurants in New York, the pork
cutlets are deep-fried and served as a lunch dish. Their appeal is
obvious, especially when the dish is done right. The meat remains
tender inside the crunchy panko coating, and the sauce offsets the
pork's mildness.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any cut of pork can be used, from the tenderloin to the
shoulder or the loin. I prefer to cut pork tenderloin into
medallions. I found that deep-frying them is unnecessary; the meat
can be fried in a skillet and just needs to be turned once. The
cooking time is only five minutes. As long as the pork is not
overcooked, it remains moist and tender, protected by the panko
coating.
</P>
<P>
   In adapting this dish for my menu, the tricky part was the
sauce. I wanted to draw from tradition but also make something that
really had great character of its own. I started with tomato paste
and chicken stock, added garlic that had been slowly cooked in
olive oil and ended with both Western and Eastern accents: Dijon
mustard and soy sauce. The result is much fresher- and
brighter-tasting than either Worcestershire sauce or ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   It is also rich enough to serve on white rice, the traditional
and perfect accompaniment. At the restaurant, I also serve the dish
with root vegetables like burdock, lotus, daikon, carrots or
turnips that have been parboiled until nearly tender, stir-fried in
light oil and finished with a little sesame oil and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is a green salad, or the kind of
``coleslaw'' often served in Japan _ shredded cabbage lightly
dressed with oil and rice vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   CRISPY PORK CUTLETS WITH SPICY TOMATO SAUCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   10 arge cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   { cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds pork tenderloin
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   \ cup Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Neutral oil (canola or grape-seed)
</P>
<P>
   Flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   About 2 cups panko
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Combine the garlic and the
olive oil in a small ovenproof dish, and cover with foil. Bake
until the garlic is very tender, about 45 minutes. Leave the oven
on. Remove the garlic, and mash with a fork. Set aside 1 tablespoon
of the olive oil; reserve the remainder in the refrigerator for
other uses like sauteing or vinaigrettes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove any gristle from the pork, and slice it an inch thick.
Put the slices between two sheets of plastic wrap, and pound gently
with a mallet, the side of a cleaver or the bottom of a pot until
the meat is \ to { inch thick. (Pork is so tender that this will
not take much effort.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Put the reserved olive oil in a small saucepan, and turn the
heat to medium-high. Add the tomato paste, and cook, stirring
constantly, until it is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the
stock, and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it
is reduced by about half and fairly thick, about 10 minutes. Stir
in the garlic, mustard and soy to thicken the sauce; keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cook the pork while the sauce is reducing or after it is
finished. Pour the neutral oil to a depth of { inch in a skillet
over medium-high heat. Dredge each piece of pork lightly in flour,
dip in milk, then press into panko. When the oil is hot (a pinch of
flour will sizzle), add a few pieces at a time to the skillet; do
not crowd. Cook 2 or 3 minutes per side, or until nicely browned.
As the medallions finish cooking, drain on paper towels, and keep
warm in the oven. When all are cooked, nap the cutlets with the
sauce, and serve, preferably with white rice.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

&HT;        TEXAS MAYOR LOBBIES FOR SPACEPORT SITE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 Special to space.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 -- Filemon ``Phil'' Esquivel, Jr., is the
mayor of a small coastal town in Texas, but like any good Texan he
is thinking big: he wants Congress to back a plan to build a space
launch site in the outskirts of his town.
</P>
<P>
   Esquivel, 36, is coming to Washington this week to persuade
legislators to support constructing a launch pad in a 258,000 acre
site in Kenedy County for re-usable vehicles to lift
commercially-owned satellites and parts for the International Space
Station into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to diversify our national economy into space
deliveries,'' he said, sounding like a presidential candidate. ``It
would be an injustice to South Texas and the entire Nation not to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Esquivel, who said he was part of a ``big team'' of local
politicians advocating the spaceport, will meet with Sen. Phil
Gramm to ask for his support.
</P>
<P>
   The launch site would surely be the biggest attraction
Kingsville, population 28,000, the second-largest city near to the
site, would ever see. About 100 miles from the Mexico border, the
city already boasts a naval base, a big pharmaceutical company, a
tourist site called the King ranch, and a wing of Texas A&AMP;M
university.
</P>
<P>
   Esquivel maintains the space port would transform the city by
employing 6,000 people just to build it, and also boost the town's
university. ``My goal is to provide a quality standard of living
and that's why I am pushing so hard for this,'' he said.
``Regionally it's very important. It will produce quality jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Esquivel, a part-time insurance agent now in his second term in
office, said the project is gaining ground. Space launch companies,
federal authorities, and his local constituents all seem to agree
that the Kenedy County site is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fired up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the project now faces a big hurdle at the federal level.
Investors have shied away from building such a space port before
Congress decides on a bill that would greatly reduce the risk of
putting money in the project.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Breaux bill, named after a Louisiana senator,
would offer $500 million in federally-backed loan guarantees to the
commercial space launch industry. But the measure is currently
suspended, and has met lukewarm support in Congress in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that gaurantee it's hard for investors to put dollars
into a re-usable launch vehicle venture,'' Esquivel said.
</P>
<P>
   Esquivel will present a resolution to U.S. Conference of Mayors
asking for support, and will be supported by San Antonio and
Houston mayors. But he will make the case that the port is of major
importance to the nation, not just the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a nation, you have China, Russia and France deploying the
majority of satellites,'' he said. ``We're seriously behind
deploying commercial geo-synchronous telecommunications
satellites.''
</P>
<P>
   Esquivel said some small, independent launch companies and FAA
authorities like the Texas site over other areas - including
Florida and California proposals - because it is easily accessible
to water, railroads and major interstate highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some it's a distant dream, and to some it's realistic. We
are a diamond in the rough,'' he said of the city.

TWO EUROPEAN PANCAKES WORTHY OF THE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD W. LANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although in many ways a stack of blueberry pancakes with maple
syrup is an unbeatable combination, America's infatuation with
pancakes has gone far beyond the traditional. Americans have
adopted the pancakes of other regions _ the crepes of France and
blini of Russia, for example.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a little surprising that two European pancakes, the
Viennese kaiser schmarrn and the Swedish ugnspannkaka, have not
made themselves at home here. Both are pancakes in the true sense
of the word, being baked in pans in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of oven pancakes know there are several good reasons for
making them. The flavor of these thick and full-bodied versions,
which fill an entire skillet in one layer, is richer than that of
their slimmer cousins, though they are often made of similar
batter.
</P>
<P>
   They are also easier to cook and take far less preparation.
Instead of the cook's standing by the stove on Sunday morning while
others are at the table waiting to be fed, he or she can whip up
the dough, pop the pancake in the oven and still get dibs on the
paper's best sections while breakfast cooks. When the pancake is
done, simply cut it into wedges and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Although pancakes are traditionally a breakfast staple in this
country, in Europe they are for dessert or even the evening meal
itself, especially when combined with meat.
</P>
<P>
   As desserts, oven pancakes offer the convenience of cooking
while you eat, especially if dinner is something like a roast. When
you pull out the entree, leave the oven on, and pop the pancake in
to cook.
</P>
<P>
   I learned how to make kaiser schmarrn from my mother, or thought
I did. She used to make the thin crepes served in Europe, where she
was born. I carried over the tradition, serving similar thin
pancakes to our children as a breakfast treat when their friends
stayed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a pancake tore, I would call it kaiser schmarrn,
explaining, as my mother had to me, how one of Franz Josef's chefs,
in an attempt to make superlight pancakes for the emperor, had
accidentally torn them. In a fit of inspired desperation, the chef
scrambled the pancakes even more until they were fluffy, then
crisped them up in the oven. He served them with sugar and plum
compote.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``schmarrn,'' incidentally, is culturally so purely
Viennese that it can't even be translated into German, much less
English. The word can mean anything from a trifle to the culinary
state of being fluffy and light. But the shredded pancakes of my
youth, I discovered later, were a delicious family fraud, because
they were not oven-baked.
</P>
<P>
   The other oven pancake I grew up with was the Swedish
ugnspannkaka (pronounced ung-span-KAH-kah). It can be either sweet,
when made with apples, or savory, when made with pork fatback or
bacon (when it is also known as flasskpannkaka) and served with
sugared lingonberries, the European equivalent of cranberries.
Either way, the dish is something special in that it is not only
tasty, but also quick and easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   The only disadvantage of making oven pancakes will probably be
perceived by the family pet. When making stove-top pancakes, the
griddle is rarely hot enough to make a good first pancake,
producing one that is a pale clone of those that follow.
</P>
<P>
   This starter pancake is usually thrown out _ or fed to the dog
or cat. These creatures will quite naturally speak up against oven
pancakes _ but they are the only ones that will. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIENNESE OVEN PANCAKES (KAISER SCHMARRN) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 stick unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups milk
</P>
<P>
   } cup flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sultanas or golden raisins
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla sugar (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small pan, melt half the
butter, putting the other half in a skillet in the oven. Whisk
milk, flour and salt together. Separate eggs, and beat yolks into
batter. Beat egg whites with sugar and vanilla until stiff. Add
melted butter to batter, and fold in egg whites. When butter in
skillet melts, swirl it around to cover bottom and sides. Pour
batter into skillet, and sprinkle sultanas on top.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bake pancake until brown on top, about 20 minutes. Remove
from oven and, using two forks, tear it into pieces. Return it to
oven for 5 more minutes. You want it to be firm in spots, fluffy in
others. Dust pancake with vanilla sugar, and serve with apricot
jam.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Note: Make vanilla sugar by placing one split vanilla bean in a
2- to 3-pound canister of sugar for a month. Seal well. &QL;

ONE, TWO, THREE MOLASSES  
 THE MERINGUE SOLUTION  
 SCALDED MILK FOR BAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a recipe calling for ``mild molasses.'' What is that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Molasses is a byproduct of the refining of cane sugar. It is
a dark, sweet liquid left over after the cane juice is boiled down
and the sugar crystals are removed. There are several types or
grades of molasses. Mild, or light, molasses is the liquid left
over from the first boiling of the sugar syrup. It is golden brown
and is often used as an ingredient in baked goods or as a pancake
syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Dark molasses comes from the second boiling, is more pronounced
in color and flavor, and thicker and not as sweet as light
molasses. It is often called for in spicy recipes like gingerbread
and baked beans.
</P>
<P>
   Blackstrap molasses comes from the third boiling and is very
sticky and a bit bitter. It is slightly more nutritious than the
other types of molasses, but most of it is used for cattle feed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I make a lemon meringue pie, it looks like a work of art
right out of the oven, but then the meringue collapses and beads of
brown ``sweat'' come up to the surface. What am I doing wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: You are probably overcooking the meringue. Meringue pies are
best baked at 425 or 450 degrees for a mere 4 to 5 minutes. To
ensure an evenly baked meringue, spoon the lemon filling in the
crust while the filling is still hot, then immediately top with
meringue. The heat from the filling will help set the bottom of the
meringue.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Corriher, a food scientist, suggests putting a
tablespoon of cornstarch into one-third cup water and heating it
until thick. Add this concoction to the beaten egg whites, 1
tablespoon at a time. The cornstarch prevents beading and shrinking
and makes the meringue tender, smooth and easy to cut. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A recent Food Chain question stated that one needs to scald
milk when making baked goods with yeast, to kill certain enzymes
that impede yeast growth. However, I am under the impression that
pasteurized milk does not need to be heated, since pasteurization
has already killed those enzymes. Is this correct?
</P>
<P>
   A. Pasteurization may destroy some organisms, like harmful
microbes and the enzyme lipase, which can make milk spoil faster,
but it does not kill the enzymes that inhibit yeast growth. Since
milk is pasteurized at the lowest possible temperature for the
shortest amount of time (either 144 degrees Fahrenheit for 30
minutes or 160 degrees for 15 seconds), many enzymes survive. So
scalding the milk _ bringing the milk to a full simmer, at 212
degrees, higher than that of pasteurization _ is necessary when
making baked goods with yeast, or the item may not rise. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Readers have offered comments and suggestions on recent Food
Chain questions. Here are a few of them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week's column considered the best ways to ripen mangoes. A
reader had this suggestion:
</P>
<P>
   Simply put the mango and an apple in a brown paper bag. Mangoes
ripen much faster than if left sitting out at room temperature. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent column discussed the pros and cons of keeping butter
refrigerated at all times. A reader responds: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a way to keep butter fresh without refrigerating it.
Since butter deteriorates when exposed to the air, it will stay
fresh when put in a bowl and covered with cold water. My
grandmother used to do this many years ago in Poland. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In response to another question, readers had suggestions on
cutting brownies neatly. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am a class mother in my children's classes, and I make a lot
of brownies. The best way to cut them is with a plastic knife. No
rinsing under hot water necessary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And here's a way to cut bar cookies:
</P>
<P>
   Fit a piece of aluminum foil into the pan so that it extends a
few inches past any two opposite sides. Trim the other two sides to
fit. Prepare the foiled pan as directed in the recipe. After
baking, remove the pan from the oven and run a small spatula or
knife to separate the dough from the two sides without foil. Cool
the pan on a rack. When cool, place in refrigerator for a few
minutes, then use the extended foil to remove the baked dough from
the pan. Invert to strip off the foil. Invert again, and cut. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How to keep dried shiitake mushrooms from becoming rubbery after
soaking inspired this reader's suggestion. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My mother taught me: Do not soak dried mushrooms in hot water.
Try warm water with a pinch of sugar. The best way, however, is to
soak them in water overnight. Mushrooms in water can be kept in the
refrigerator about a week.

AMID POLITICS AND PROTESTS, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT TRIAL REOPENS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The sexual misconduct trial of Malaysia's
opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, reopened on Monday in Kuala
Lumpur after a two-month recess, accompanied by the handful of
shouting protesters, the legal gamesmanship and the political acid
attacks that have made it a dispiriting spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were adjourned for a day, almost as soon as they
began, because Anwar's lawyers said he needed more time to study
his passport and diaries to establish his alibi against charges of
sodomy that could send him to prison for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But before he left the dock, Anwar resumed his verbal war with
his former mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, contending that
there was a ``high-level conspiracy'' among prominent politicians
to ruin him.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the trial it was a mild accusation. Anwar has
in the past accused the government of corruption, gambling and even
involvement in murder.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 53, was deputy prime minister and heir apparent until
Mahathir, 74, accused him of being morally unfit, fired him, and
had him arrested in September 1998. In a first trial that ended
last year, Anwar was sentenced to six years in prison for abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, despite much tumult and recrimination, Malaysian
politics has moved forward without Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently to remove Anwar from the public eye, his trial was
adjourned in advance of a parliamentary election on Nov. 29 that
began the reshaping of post-Anwar political power blocs.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's ruling coalition retained its two-thirds majority and
the opposition party formed by Anwar's wife fared poorly. But the
prime minister lost significant support among the ethnic Malay
majority and the post-election period has been a time of
score-settling and political arrests.
</P>
<P>
   No one has replaced Anwar as a full-fledged No. 2 to Mahathir,
and politics is being roiled by arrests and jockeying for position.
The jockeying is expected to intensify in advance of a meeting
later this year to choose the leader of the ruling party, the
United Malays National Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mahathir has made surprise his trademark, most political
analysts expect him to seek and to retain the party leadership, and
thus the leadership of the country. It is the race to be his deputy
as party leader that is already growing hot.
</P>
<P>
   A leading candidate is Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who replaced Anwar
as deputy prime minister, but has not yet won full second-string
status by gaining the position of deputy party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts in Malaysia say that Badawi's attempt to
overcome a too-nice-a-guy image has led in part to a political
crackdown that is under way now.
</P>
<P>
   Four political figures have been arrested this month for
sedition, and the editor of the most prominent pro-government
newspaper, the New Straits Times, has been removed, apparently for
being insufficiently enthusiastic in his political reportage.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests drew sharp criticism from a State Department
spokesman in Washington, James Foley, who called them a
``transparent and cynical attempt to intimidate government
opponents and stifle legitimate political discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said:
``The fact that only critics are being arrested suggests that the
law is being used as a tool to further political ends.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Abdullah responded in the nationalistic tone favored by
Mahathir. ``Why are they being smart alecks in questioning our
country's laws?'' he said. ``There is no law of the jungle in our
country. We have democratic laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests include Anwar's chief lawyer, Karpal Singh, a
prominent opposition figure in his own right, who was arrested for
remarks he made at the trial. This drew sharp criticism from
lawyers both within and outside the country, who said a lawyer's
defense of his client should be protected from legal attack.
</P>
<P>
   Karpal added to the multiplying layers of accusations on Tuesday
by saying that the attorney general should be held in contempt of
court for pressing the sedition charge against him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also arrested this month was the deputy president of the new
party led by Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah. The deputy president, Marina
Yusoff, was charged with sedition for saying in a campaign speech
that the ruling party was the ``source'' of race riots in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the editor and printer of an opposition newspaper,
Harakah, were charged with sedition for printing the remarks of
another opposition party member who talked about a supposed
conspiracy involving the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's hand was nowhere to be seen in the arrests. He was on
vacation.

 &HT;    No pat answers in Showtime's movie about Atlanta's infamous
child murders
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The upcoming Showtime cable movie ``Who Killed
Atlanta's Children?'' will not directly answer that question,
although it implies that the Ku Klux Klan was involved.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which recently completed filming in Toronto and will
air in the spring, may stir up raw feelings again in the city that
was traumatized from 1979 to 1981 by the murders of many black
children and young men.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Charles Robert Carner says the movie is not an
attempt to prove that Wayne Williams was innocent; Williams is a
very minor character in it. Williams was convicted of two of the
murders, and police then closed the other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's based on a 1986 Spin magazine article that
asserted the Georgia Bureau of Investigation launched a secret
investigation that turned up possible links to white supremacists.
Jim Belushi plays a Spin reporter, and Gregory Hines plays his
editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a film that's difficult, because it does not say this and
this and this happened,'' Carner says. ``It gives food for
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In one scene in the movie, Hines asks Belushi who he thinks
committed the murders after they have been investigating for
awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan,'' Belushi answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you prove it?'' Hines asks.
</P>
<P>
   Belushi doesn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people draw conclusions,'' Carner says. ``I know we
live in a sound-bite society, and everything's got to be boiled
down to one second: Guilty! Not guilty!
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been resisting the idea of drawing conclusions,'' he
continues. ``This is more complicated than that. It's an absolute
Gordian knot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?'' is the second TV movie to
raise questions about the infamous case. The first, ``The Atlanta
Child Murders,'' aired on CBS in 1985, three years after Williams
was convicted. It caused enormous controversy in Atlanta; Maynard
Jackson, who was mayor during the murders, called it ``rank,
avaricious exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming movie focuses much more on Spin magazine's
uncovering of the GBI investigation. It takes place after Williams'
conviction, and although there are some flashbacks, Carner says
none of the murders will be depicted.
</P>
<P>
   Originally titled ``Unanswered Questions,'' ``Atlanta Children''
was shot completely in Toronto, where filming costs are cheaper. No
shots of Atlanta will appear in the movie, although some news
footage from the period will be inserted.
</P>
<P>
   In the type of semi-fictionalization that occurs in such movies,
former Mayor Jackson is not named. A character appears who is
called ``the mayor,'' and he is a black man, but he does not
resemble Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Carner is aware of the wide diversity of thinking and theories
surrounding the case. Although the official number of murders was
frozen at 29, some people felt the number was as high as 69, and
that the murders continued after Williams' arrest. Others believe
the list of 29 victims was flawed and inflated, and that many of
the deaths could be attributed to other causes or killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the questions need to be raised,'' Carner says. ``It
seems like the evidence Wayne Williams was convicted on was pretty
slender. That's not to say he's an innocent man, though. I'm not
going to run around waving a flag to free a man from prison who may
be guilty of murder. But this is much more complicated than that.''
</P>
<P>
   So what conclusion does Carner want viewers to take from ``Who
Killed Atlanta's Children?'' when they finally see the movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``People draw the conclusions that they draw,'' he says.
</P>

   TURKEY-TERROR (Istanbul) _ With Turkey in a state of shock over

Konca Kuris, was often described as a Muslim feminist. In books,

   U.N.-CONGO (United Nations) _ Elusive and unpredictable,
President Laurent Kabila kept New York guessing about whether he
would attend a special Security Council session on the war in Congo
almost until his plane landed Friday night, disgorging one of the
biggest diplomatic delegations ever seen around the United Nations.
The Congolese had decided to seize the moment and maximize it.
Flanked by his own propaganda team and American public relations
experts, Kabila is hitting the media circuit. His message is clear:
he has been vilified to keep the burnish on his erstwhile Rwandan
and Ugandan allies, who won the approval of Washington when they
brought an end to genocide in 1994 and went on to help Kabila
overthrow the Zairean dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. They are now his
enemies, and he wants the world to know why. By Barbara Crossette.

   BUDGET-CLINTON (Washington) _ Driven by the strong economy and
the flood of tax revenues it is generating, the federal budget
surplus will surge over the next decade to levels that would have
been inconceivable only a few years ago, the Congressional Budget
Office said in a report made public Tuesday. Under the set of
assumptions traditionally used to project the budget outlook,

HEARST EXPANDS PACKAGE OF ASSETS IN SEARCH FOR EXAMINER BUYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corporation announced Tuesday that it
is expanding the package of assets it is offering for sale in
connection with its effort to find a buyer for the San Francisco
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's expanded offer covers all of the assets presently used
to produce and distribute The Examiner, including its printing
presses, plant, delivery trucks and other physical assets, together
with the ability to employ personnel needed to conduct the
business. Hearst said it is offering a turn-key package of assets
sufficient to allow a buyer of The Examiner independently to edit,
produce and distribute that newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst will consider selling additional assets, which are
currently jointly owned by Hearst and The Chronicle Publishing Co.
if needed by a buyer in continuing the business of The Examiner.
The announcement also said Hearst is willing to entertain proposals
for transitional arrangements to facilitate the sale of The
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement said Hearst was expanding its offer in response
to concerns raised by San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and other
local officials, as well as the California Attorney General's
office and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corporation and The Chronicle Publishing Co.
announced last August that agreement had been reached for the
acquisition by Hearst of the San Francisco Chronicle. At that time,
Hearst engaged Veronis Suhler &AMP; Associates, a New York City
investment banker, which since then has contacted more than 80
prospective buyers, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   This firm will now conduct the renewed search, offering
additional assets to any buyer who is willing to continue the
business of The Examiner, with a Feb. 15 deadline for interested
parties to come forward, according to the Hearst announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst restated its prior commitment that all employees will be
offered continued employment.
</P>
<P>
   If The Examiner is not sold, Hearst will offer continued
employment to all Examiner, Chronicle and San Francisco Newspaper
Agency employees. If The Examiner is sold, Hearst will offer
continued employment to all Chronicle employees and to any
employees of The Examiner or the agency not offered employment by
the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, The Examiner and the Chronicle have been printed and
distributed under a joint operating agreement (``JOA'') between
Hearst and Chronicle. Hearst's existing interest in the JOA is not
being offered for sale.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last several years, millions of Americans who had
turned a deaf ear to the virtues of soy have had a change of heart.
Sales of the lowly bean, which has been a staple of the Asian diet
for millennia, have been skyrocketing because preliminary research
suggested that soy has many life-enhancing benefits, from
preventing bone density loss to easing some symptoms of menopause.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the federal government put its imprimatur on soy
when it allowed food companies to make the claim that soy protein
reduces cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. The other claims
are still unproved, even though soy in all its forms, from tofu and
veggie burgers to shakes and supplements, is being heavily promoted
by its sellers as a panacea. The news media, too, have been almost
unanimous in praising its safety and efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of widespread praise, however, there is
growing suspicion that soy _ despite its undisputed benefits _ may
pose some health hazards. The scientific world is divided over many
of the claims for efficacy and over some safety issues, but there
are two points on which there is agreement. Soy is useful for
reducing cholesterol. And there may be an increased risk of cancer
associated with consuming the components of soy called isoflavones
in supplement form, particularly for post-menopausal women; and for
these women, there may also be hazards in adding soy foods to their
diets.
</P>
<P>
   Isoflavones, particularly genistein and daidzein, are
phytoestrogens (plant chemicals that have estrogen-like hormonal
effects on the body) that occur naturally in soybeans and foods
made from them. Compared with chemical estrogens, the kind taken by
women to reduce the symptoms of menopause, phytoestrogens are weak,
but they act the same way: they can both inhibit and stimulate the
growth of certain types of cells.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the 18 scientists interviewed for this column was
willing to say that taking isoflavones was risk free. Some
particularly cautioned against it. Dr. Margo Woods, an associate
professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine, who
specializes in nutrition and breast cancer, said: ``As a food, soy
does a lot of great things, but once you start looking at different
components like phytoestrogens, you are talking about
pharmacological things. It's wiser to talk about soy and soy foods.
A whole food behaves very differently in the body than when you
take one compound. We are looking into the components, but we
haven't been studying in the area long enough. I would not
recommend to anyone that they take isoflavones.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Food and Drug Administration approved the
cholesterol-lowering health claim for soy, sales were booming. In
1998, 770,000 metric tons of soybeans were sold in this country to
be turned into food products; in 1999 the figure rose to 1.007
million metric tons. Total sales of soy foods in supermarket chains
during the 12 months ending in October were almost $420 million, up
45 percent from the previous year's, according to Spins, a natural
products market research company in San Francisco. In natural food
stores, sales in the six months ending in October were up 37
percent from the previous six-month period. Many large companies
like Kellogg's, General Mills, Campbell Soup and Con Agra are
developing new soy products in response to the demand.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest jump has been in soy supplements, the isoflavone
pills, whose sales were up 246 percent in the 12 months ending in
October. But the carefully worded health claim the Food and Drug
Administration permits for cholesterol reduction is for soy
protein, not for isoflavones. To have that health claim on its
label, a food must be low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol and
contain 6.5 grams of soy protein per serving. For the
cholesterol-lowering effect, 25 grams of soy protein must be added
daily to a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are worried that the public is interpreting the
approval of soy protein as a recommendation to take soy
supplements, which generally have higher levels of isoflavones than
occur naturally in food.
</P>
<P>
   The highest levels of naturally occurring isoflavones are found
in soy beverages, cooked soybeans and tempeh, and the range is
wide. Some processed products, like sports bars, have added
isoflavones. Supplements can contain more than 85 milligrams of
isoflavones in a single pill, and some manufacturers advise taking
two pills a day. There are soy protein concentrate powders with as
much as 160 milligrams of isoflavones in a single serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't distinguish isoflavones from soy protein,'' said
Dr. Daniel Sheehan, a research biologist at the FDA's National
Center for Toxicological Research in Jefferson, Ark. He also
directs a program that studies endocrine disrupters, which are
chemicals like isoflavones with hormonal activity that disrupts the
endocrine system. ``The approval of soy protein for cardiovascular
disease is going to lead to tremendous increase in the use of
isoflavones, and this rachets up concern levels,'' he added. For
that reason, Sheehan opposed the FDA's health claim label.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory Burke, chairman of the public health sciences
department at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in
Winston-Salem, N.C., worries that Americans will overdose on these
supplements. ``To Americans, more is better,'' he said. ``Adding
soy to a healthy diet makes a lot of sense. If you have to take soy
through food, you are not going to overdose on isoflavones, but if
you take it through pills you could take doses up to 10 times what
folks consume in Japan'' _ where soy is a staple of the diet. ``I
don't know what the risk-benefit is on those high doses,'' Burke
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one is really willing to put a number on the maximum safe
level of isoflavones, because human studies have not been done,
said Dr. Daniel Doerge, a research chemist in biochemical
toxicology at the National Center for Toxicological Research.
``Nobody knows what high levels are,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Helferich, an associate professor of nutrition at
the University of Illinois, who specializes in diet and breast
cancer, pointed out that regulators, food companies and some
scientists are willing to make the assumption that 50 milligrams of
isoflavones a day are safe. One gram of soybeans contains about one
milligram of isoflavones. ``That amount may be perfectly safe and
beneficial for the vast majority of the population,'' he said.
``However, the potential for some individuals to be harmed, such as
post-menopausal women with estrogen-dependent breast cancer, still
remains unclear. Because it is a natural food component, there is
no requirement to put any indication or contraindication on the
products. I don't know how anyone can commit to any number, because
data are not there for all populations.'' The typical daily
consumption in Japan, for example, is 25 to 50 milligrams of
isoflavones.
</P>
<P>
   Whether soy or its isoflavones reduce the risk of breast cancer
or increase it has not been sorted out. Data on estrogens are mixed
so far, said Dr. Helferich. ``Estrogens are a mixed bag,'' he said.
``Given early they will prevent, given late they will likely
promote. Taking natural estrogens late in life to prevent symptoms
of menopause may be a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiological studies suggest that soy may reduce the risk of
breast cancer, but there are animal and even human studies that
suggest that soy may increase the risk. Dr. Stephen Barnes, a
professor of pharmacology and toxicity at the University of
Alabama, said that in countries like Japan, where there is a lot of
soy in the diet, women have lower rates of breast cancer than
American women. But American-born daughters of Japanese immigrants
have higher levels of breast cancer than their Japanese-born
mothers. This statistic is often cited as proof that soy reduces
the risk of breast cancer. Barnes said that consumption of soy
early in life may make the difference. ``But,'' he added, ``I don't
know what happens if you are 50 years old and go on soy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said it was a mistake to compare Asian and Western
populations. ``You are making an assumption they are biologically
identical, but there are significant differences in the way humans
handle chemicals, depending on their ethnic background,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another study, reported in The American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition in December 1998, showed that there was increased breast
cell proliferation in women given soy. The greater the cell
proliferation, the greater the chance for cancer cells to develop.
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies that may answer these questions are being
underwritten by the National Cancer Institute, but Dr. Peter
Greenwald, the director of the institute's division of cancer
prevention, said: ``The results are mixed and far from definitive.
I don't think we are in a position to give advice for or against.''
</P>
<P>
   The public looks for black and white answers, said Sheehan,
adding: ``We don't have enough information to be able to give the
public good advice, and that's why we need to do the studies. Not
only can there be some outcomes that are beneficial and some
adverse in the same individual, there are also going to be
different degrees of susceptibility in different organs, depending
on age. This sort of confusion and attempting to sort through the
confusion is characteristic of science, but people don't understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For adults, Barnes offers this advice: ``Examine your family
history. If there is premature cardiac death, it may be worthwhile
to eat soy. If you've got breast cancer in the family, I wouldn't
advise it, because we don't know. There is enough evidence out
there to raise concerns.''

A CREAMY SOUP WITH NO CREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
(DW) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all soups need to start with stock to taste rich and full.
Chickpeas, more than any other legume, exude so much flavor into
plain water as they cook that they can almost make a soup on their
own. Garlic, herbs and a few aromatic vegetables add another
dimension, but the trick to a superb soup is even simpler: puree
some of the cooked chickpeas, stir them back in, and the soup
becomes sublimely if deceptively creamy.
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful vegetarian soup, but it can be easily turned
into a meatier meal by adding either leftover chicken, beef, pork
or lamb or something cooked especially for the soup, like
pan-grilled sausage, shrimp or more vegetables. Croutons made with
olive oil are also a good addition.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most obvious question about this recipe is whether
it will work with canned chickpeas. The answer is, yes _ within
limits. The liquid in which most canned chickpeas are packed is not
the light, flavorful broth that results from simmering the legumes
at home, but instead is a heavy substance whose flavor is
mysterious at best. Canned chickpeas should be rinsed before using;
they can then be combined with water or, better still, chicken or
vegetable stock before simmering with the other seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Chickpeas can be cooked without being soaked, but they will cook
more quickly if they are soaked 6 to 12 hours. Either way, the
cooking time is unpredictable, depending largely on how much
moisture the chickpeas have lost in storage (older beans, being
drier, require longer cooking). Soaked chickpeas will take about an
hour and a half to turn tender; dry ones, 30 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   CHICKPEA SOUP WITH SAUSAGE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 2 hours, plus overnight soaking  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups chickpeas, soaked overnight in water to cover if time
allows
</P>
<P>
   5 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs rosemary or thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 medium to large carrot, peeled and diced small
</P>
<P>
   1 celery stalk, peeled and diced small
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, peeled and diced small
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { pound sausage, grilled or broiled, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine chickpeas, sliced garlic and rosemary or thyme in a
large saucepan with fresh water to cover by at least 2 inches.
Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer, partly covered, for at
least 1 hour, or until chickpeas are fairly tender. Add additional
water if necessary, and skim any foam that rises to the surface. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Scoop out herbs and add carrot, celery, onion, salt and
pepper. Continue to cook until chickpeas and vegetables are soft,
at least 20 minutes longer. Remove about half the chickpeas and
vegetables, and carefully puree in a blender, adding cooking liquid
as needed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Return the puree to the pot, and stir; add the minced garlic
and sausage, and reheat, adding more water if the mixture is too
thick. Taste, adjust seasoning and serve, drizzled with the olive
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: To use canned chickpeas, drain and rinse 4 cups and
combine with 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock and the vegetables
as in Step 1. Cook until the vegetables are tender, then proceed as
above.

&HT;     ENERGY CHIEF SAYS AGENCY CRACKING DOWN ON SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, under fire to
strengthen security at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories,
said Tuesday that his agency had made progress in protecting the
country's nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have definitely turned the corner and made substantial
improvements to where the country can feel safe,'' he said at a
news conference where he released three reports that outlined his
agency's actions to increase security at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, a congressional panel headed by Rep. Christopher
Cox, R-Calif., accused the Chinese government of obtaining an array
of nuclear secrets from the laboratories. Many lawmakers blamed the
Energy Department, which oversees the labs, for failing to maintain
adequate safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's three major nuclear weapons laboratories are the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and the Sandia
and Los Alamos national laboratories in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said his agency launched a number of programs to
tighten security at the facilities, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing the counterintelligence budget from $7.6 million in
1998 to $38.2 million in 1999;
</P>
<P>
   _ Strengthening nuclear materials inventory accountability;
</P>
<P>
   _ Creating a cyber-threat program;
</P>
<P>
   _ Adding dozens of security personnel;
</P>
<P>
   _ Tightening surveillance of foreign scientists at the labs;
</P>
<P>
   _ Conducting periodic tests and inspections of security
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Among the examples of lax security discovered during field
inspections in the past year were classified nuclear weapon parts
protected only behind a chain-link fence and no supervision of
classified computers, according to Glen Podonsky, director of
Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance, which conducted
the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee reported last May that ``stolen U.S. nuclear
secrets give (China) design information on thermonuclear weapons on
par with our own.'' It also alleged that espionage at the three
national laboratories that design and develop nuclear weapons had
allowed China to test modern nuclear weapons much sooner than it
would have otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Cox also has criticized the Clinton administration for not
enacting major improvements in nuclear security until last spring,
after the political furor over allegations Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   While the Energy Department oversees the facilities, the agency
contracts the actual running of the labs to universities and
private companies, such as Lockheed-Martin. However, the department
is responsible for maintaining security at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   The department's security problems emerged shortly after
Richardson was named head of the agency in August 1998 and have
become one of his priorities as secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Wen Ho Lee, a former physicist at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory, was indicted on 59 counts of violating the
Atomic Energy and Espionage Acts for allegedly transferring data on
the nation's newest nuclear weapons to unsecured computers and to
seven computer tapes, which the government says are missing. Lee,
who was fired from his Los Alamos job last March for security
violations, has pleaded not guilty. However, Lee, a naturalized
U.S. citizen born in Taiwan, was not accused of passing classified
information to any foreign government.  &UR;  &QL;

wines) 
(DW) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   German wines have had a rough time of it for at least 20 years.
The complaints are familiar: too sweet, too bland, too confusing
and too unsuited to American wine-drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   But now German wines _ fine German wines _ are making a
comeback. Alsatian wines are doing well, and Austrian wines are
suddenly everywhere. Since all three share the riesling as their
most important grape, it seems inevitable that Germany, which makes
the most famous rieslings of all, will share the spotlight with its
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer numbers, German wines performed well enough in the
United States into the mid-1980s. But indifferent, commercial wine
accounted for most of the imports; serious wine drinkers had begun
to abandon German wines years earlier. Chardonnay had begun its
long reign as the world's favorite white wine grape.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the German wine business was severe. As late as
the mid-1970s, great German rieslings sold for more than the most
prestigious white Burgundies. Ten years later, the German
winegrowers were undergoing what seemed like a massive loss of
confidence. While claiming that they would make riesling taste like
Chablis, they were pulling up famous old riesling vineyards and
replacing them with chardonnay and pinot noir. Predictably, the
results were unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, during all those dark years, great rieslings were made, and
a small group of connoisseurs bought and enjoyed them. Vintages
like 1971, 1976, 1985, 1989 and 1990 all produced superb wines that
were mostly ignored by fans of California and French chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the German vineyards have had a remarkable streak
of good years. Good to superb wines were made in almost every
vintage in the 1990's, with several years, like 1995 and 1996,
producing some truly profound wines.
</P>
<P>
   Now wine drinkers are coming back to German wines, said Terry
Theise of Silver Spring, Md., a irrepressible importer of Champagne
and German, Austrian and Alsatian wines. When it comes to German
wines, Theise has been something of a voice crying in the
wilderness for almost two decades. In town last week for a big
professional tasting at TriBeCa Grill, he cited impressive figures
showing sales of fine German wines in general had increased over
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sullivan, the executive director of the German Wine
Information Bureau in New York, said that importers reported
increases of up to 30 percent in 1999 over 1998 for the more
expensive rieslings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the sales increase, Theise replied: ``Look
around you; the answers are all here.''
</P>
<P>
   He indicated the room full of restaurateurs and sommeliers,
mostly in their 30s, looking like a gaggle of graduate students
with their book bags and parkas stacked haphazardly in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a new generation of wine professionals,'' Theise
said. ``They were not trained to worship Bordeaux and Burgundy,
they're not intimidated by anything, and they're always on the
lookout for something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Austria's Gruener Veltliner was the most sought after wine at
the tasting; the once-inoffensive little wine of the Viennese cafes
is, in its more elegant form, the rage at New York restaurants like
Danube and Union Pacific. But good German rieslings were almost
equally in demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the old Liebfraumilch and Zeller Schwarze Katz wines out
of the way, we can show people what German wines are really like,''
Theise said. ``You can't build a market from the bottom up. If you
hook people on wines that are cheap and schlocky, you're never
going to convince them that there's something better.''
</P>
<P>
   While German wines, particularly the late-harvest wines, can
reach astronomical price levels as quickly as grand cru Burgundies
and cult cabernets from California, there are bargains to be found
in the German section of the wine store. German wines may have gone
out of fashion in recent years, but they have never been difficult
to find in good shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen dollars will bring you more bang for the buck spent
on a German wine than any other,'' Theise said. ``They are
small-batch wines, made from a noble grape _ maybe the noblest _
and grown in perfect soil. They are hand-crafted, not blended by
some marketing nabob.''
</P>
<P>
   The riesling is a noble grape and in the right hands, it
produces wines unsurpassed in power and subtlety. The wine is
astonishingly long-lived. The few 18th-century wines left in the
world, wines that might still be drunk, are almost all German
rieslings. I have had a couple of 1929s, with fresh brook trout and
loin of venison, that were cleaner, more vibrant and more flavorful
than lesser wines bottled two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurous, or just the curious, there has never been a
better time to get to know or to become reacquainted with good
German wines. Historically, the German vineyards, the world's
northernmost, can be expected to have two or three good vintages in
every decade. Confounding the experts, Germany has had a dozen
years, each of which has produced truly fine wines. The 1996s,
1997s and 1998s, now in the shops, are among those vintages.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the German wine regions and wine regulations would
require endless space and immense patience on your part. Suffice it
to say that except for the Pfalz, the regions stretch along the
banks of rivers: the Rhine, Mosel, Saar, Ruwer and Nahe Rivers,
principally, along with the Main and the Neckar. Eighty-five
percent of the wines are white, and the signature grape is the
riesling, although there are many more white varieties grown,
including the most widespread of all, the Mueller-Thurgau. In
recent years, some producers have had great success with Scheurebe,
a riesling-sylvaner cross.
</P>
<P>
   German wines are not rated by where they are grown but, given
the northern climate, by the ripeness of the grapes at the time
they are picked, which is determined by their natural sugar
content. The more sugar, the higher the quality of the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Some wine drinkers complain that German wines with their touch
of sweetness are difficult to fit into American drinking patterns.
In fact, the sweetness is balanced by high acidity, and the wines
blend easily and creatively into many a traditional American meal
and with foods that might ordinarily go only with wines that are
totally dry. Wines in the kabinett and spaetlese categories are
usually considered the most suitable as table wines and as
aperitifs.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Theise said: ``Great German wines are perfect for fusion
cuisine, for dishes from the Caribbean, from the Pacific Rim, for
savory dishes, for chutneys. Just about anything but unsalted, rare
red meat.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   TRANSLATING THE GERMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Intimidating as they are, even the most complicated German
labels can be deciphered fairly easily. This is a typical modern
label. (As a general rule, brown bottles are used by winemakers
along the Rhine, green bottles by winemakers along the Mosel.)
</P>
<P>
   Weingut _ Winery in German &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Franz Kuenstler _ The producer of the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Qualitatswein mit Praedikat _ The wine comes from the highest
quality category, which has five subcategories: kabinett, the
lightest and driest; spaetlese, ``late picked''; auslese,
``selected late picked''; beerenauslese, individually late-picked
grapes selected for their sweetness; trockenbeerenauslese, the
sweetest and most expensive of all German wines _ the grapes are
left on the vines until they are practically dry.
</P>
<P>
   Erzeugerabfuellung _ Once stood for an estate-bottled wine. Now,
it means only that the wine was bottled by the producer, which
could mean an estate or a cooperative. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1992 _ At least 85 percent of the wine must come from the listed
vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Rheingau _ One of the 13 legally recognized regions where fine
wine can be made. In fact, the Rheingau, which stretches along the
northern bank of the Main and Rhine Rivers from Florsheim to Lorch,
is Germany's most illustrious wine region.
</P>
<P>
   Hochheimer Reichestal _ The wine comes from the Reichestal
vineyard in the village of Hochheim on the Main River near the
easternmost border of the Rheingau region.
</P>
<P>
   Riesling _ Auslese _ Trocken _ The name of the grape (riesling),
the level of quality (auslese) and the style (trocken) in which the
wine is made. Trocken means dry in German. The term may be used
only with wines with nine grams of sugar per liter or less.
</P>
<P>
   A.P. Nr. _ Amtliche Pruefnummer _ Proof number. This shows that
an official board has subjected the wine to laboratory analysis and
has checked its origin and taste. &QL;

AFTER LAST-PLACE FINISH IN IOWA, HATCH CONSIDERS DROPPING OUT
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., may update later)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, chastened by his
dead-last showing in the Republican presidential caucus in Iowa on
Monday, is considering whether to pull out of the race, a senior
aide said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, 65, the conservative chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
scheduled a news conference here at 2 p.m. Tuesday to discuss his
plans, but a snowstorm forced his campaign to postpone the event
until 10 a.m. on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports Tuesday that Hatch already had decided to
withdraw from the race after mustering only 1 percent in the
six-man caucus. But a top official in Hatch's campaign, Kevin
McGuiness, said Tuesday morning that the reports were premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a hard look,'' McGuiness said in telephone
interview. ``The numbers do not send a strong signal, but no
decision has been made yet.'' McGuiness said a decision could be
made later Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Hatch told reporters, ``I don't get
discouraged. I just keep going. Right now, I intend to keep moving,
keep plodding on.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment Hatch jumped into the race last July, his
shoestring campaign faced an uphill struggle against better funded
and better organized rivals. He raised only $1.4 million through
September, and relied largely on a group of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential debates, Hatch emphasized that his
experience as legislator made him the best candidate, and that as
chairman of the Judiciary Committee he was the best qualified
candidate to nominate new federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, the only Mormon among the presidential contenders, has
said anti-Mormon bias hurt him among the voters he was trying
hardest to court: Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people have an absolutely loony belief that
Mormons aren't Christian,'' Hatch said last Friday. ``There's some
misapprehensions and some miscomprehension about my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is out of the presidential race, Hatch is expected
to focus on his campaign this fall to seek a fifth term in the
Senate.

 &HT;    Texas prosecutor resigns amid controversy
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Bill Johnston, Waco's longtime federal prosecutor
who became embroiled in controversy over the latest flare-up of the
Branch Davidian case, submitted his resignation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said he will practice civil law in Waco, sharing an
office with former McLennan County prosecutor Susan Kelly at the
Triangle Tower, and work on what he called ``projects'' with
several other local attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I really need a break,'' Johnston said. ``I
started prosecuting when I was 23. I'm now 40. I love prosecuting.
The response I received last week from Mr. (Ezra) Griffin's family
after we got the conviction on Darren Law, that's what it's all
about. But I feel like I'm at a point of transition in my life and
need to do something else so I'm not completely burned out on
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Law was convicted in Waco's federal court of a carjacking
resulting in death.
</P>
<P>
   A fallout last year with Justice Department officials greatly
influenced his decision to submit his resignation, to take effect
in two weeks, Johnston admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret I've been frustrated by the Department of
Justice,'' Johnston said. ``The vast majority of people in the
agency are great people. But at the leadership level, I feel some
people have been less than forthright.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston _ who helped prosecute many of the surviving Branch
Davidians in 1994 _ drew flak from many inside the Justice
Department last spring when he allowed Mike McNulty, one of the
producers of the Oscar-nominated ``Waco: Rules of Engagement,'' to
tour a locker where Davidian evidence was stored.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty reported finding FBI projectiles that he contended were
capable of starting a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Johnston wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno
warning of a possible cover-up within the Justice Department
regarding the use of pyrotechnic devices at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time, the FBI publicly acknowledged
firing pyrotechnic tear gas canisters at the Davidian compound
several hours before the fire that led to the deaths of David
Koresh and 75 followers. But Johnston found himself snared in the
breaking story when notes by a paralegal indicated Johnston was at
a meeting prior to the 1994 trial where the use of pyrotechnic
devices was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston acknowledged being at the meeting. But he told
reporters that he doesn't recall the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows how all this will come out, but I have no
regrets,'' Johnston said. ``In terms of forcing the government to
admit certain things, that would not have happened unless McNulty
got in to see the evidence. It was definitely the right thing to
do. As a prosecutor, ideally you try to seek the truth, not
necessarily just what's good for your side. That may sound corny,
but that's what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said letting McNulty see the Davidian evidence and
writing Reno led to a breach with his boss, U.S. Attorney James
Blagg of San Antonio, and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It created an awkwardness obviously with our own office in San
Antonio and the Department of Justice,'' Johnston said. ``I'd like
to think it didn't affect the way they dealt with us. We wanted to
prosecute Darren Law for murder. That was turned down, but I've got
to believe they were professional enough not to let that affect
their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, after receiving a negative recommendation from a Justice
Department death-penalty review committee, ruled against the Waco
office last fall.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Baylor University's Law School, Johnston
began his law enforcement career in Waco as a prosecutor in the
McLennan County district attorney's office. He later became the
Waco Police Department's legal adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Johnston was chosen to head up the first U.S.
attorney's office in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges his association with the Branch Davidian case
will be what most people remember him for, but Johnston said he
takes the most satisfaction from helping to find the bodies of
several victims of serial killer Kenneth Allen McDuff and helping
found the governor's fugitive squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``That entity, which has been renamed, has done a great job
catching of parolee fugitives,'' Johnston said. ``I'll always be
proud of helping establish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said he worked with deputy U.S. marshals Parnell
McNamara, Mike McNamara and others for years trying to persuade
McDuff to disclose the whereabouts of his victims' remains.
</P>
<P>
   McDuff eventually took authorities to a site four miles
southwest of Marlin. He led Johnston and others to Reed's burial
site, although McDuff was shackled and never got out of the police
car carrying him, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think McDuff was going to cooperate,'' Johnston said.
``He was set to be executed. If we didn't get it done quickly, it
wouldn't have ever been done. We had gotten to know a lot of the
families. I felt an obligation to find Lori Bible's sister (Colleen
Reed). The families felt like they couldn't close that chapter of
their lives until they knew where the bodies of their loved ones
were. They wanted to have a funeral and go on with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, both Johnston and Blagg, his supervisor, were recused
from the Branch Davidian case by U.S. District Judge Walter S.
Smith Jr. of Waco. Blagg requested the recusals.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said he had been thinking about quitting for about two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just say it recently became a question of not if but
when,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the contentiousness of recent months, Johnston is not
ruling out a return to life as a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If given an opportunity in a more positive environment, I
might like to get back into law enforcement,'' Johnston said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Among certain Midwestern households, no summer is complete
without a visit to Cedar Point Amusement Park, a 15-acre expanse of
heart-thumping rides and nutritionally challenged foods in
Sandusky, Ohio, west of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Lisa Kron and her extended family would make the
pilgrimage from Lansing, Mich., to Cedar Point, a half-day's drive
away. Undeterred by poor eyesight, creaky limbs or brutal heat
waves, Kron's aging relatives, including her father, a 75-year-old
Holocaust survivor, took a kind of stoic pleasure in enduring this
annual ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering in the name of family solidarity is what held these
trips together, and it's also part of the thematic glue that binds
``2.5 Minute Ride,'' Kron's kaleidoscopically astute 70-minute
monologue, playing through March 5 at the Tiffany Theaters in West
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   A talented comic actress known for her solo work and her
performances with the Five Lesbian Brothers theater company, Kron
combines a quietly humorous conversational style with a gift for
spotting hidden connections among drastically dissimilar subjects.
Her easygoing persona and eloquent wit allow Kron to transport her
audience all the way from suburban Ohio to the Nazi killing fields,
almost before we know we've been hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``2.5 Minute Ride'' is actually the story of three separate
spiritual excursions, which Kron skillfully entwines into one
emotionally resonant narrative.
</P>
<P>
   First is the aforementioned Cedar Point outing, made when Kron
was an adult, accompanied by her unflappable Irish-American
partner, Peg. The second revolves around the wedding of Kron's
brother to a woman he met through a Jewish singles chat room on
AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The third concerns the trip Kron made several years ago with her
father to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where her paternal
grandparents perished. (Her father was sent overseas as a child to
escape the Nazis.)
</P>
<P>
   This encounter, which casts a deep shadow over the other two
stories, proves more painful in some ways for Kron than for her
father, who has learned to take life with a philosophical shrug.
Instead, it's Kron, a generation removed from Hitler's Final
Solution, who struggles to find words to express the inexplicable
horrors she envisions through her father's rapidly failing
eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on a nearly bare stage, Kron initially relates these
adventures like a cheerful tour guide, using slide projections that
appear to us as blurry swatches of color. But through her
penetrating words, the images resolve themselves into vivid mental
postcards, sweeping the action forward.
</P>
<P>
   Kron's monologue weaves and swoops like a roller coaster, now
pausing to consider the gruesome efficiency of a death camp layout,
now racing through a hilarious description of a state-of-the-art
Midwestern shopping emporium. As the three stories converge, we,
too, begin to glimpse the world through the eyes of her father, a
man whose keen sense of destiny's fuzzy edges prompts him to remark
that ``if it wasn't for the good fortune of being a Jew, I might
have been a Nazi.''
</P>
<P>
   Gracefully yet unobtrusively shaped by Mark Brokaw's direction
and Kenneth Posner's dramatically nuanced lighting, ``2.5 Minute
Ride'' is both a daughter's lovingly clear-eyed portrait of her
father and an incomplete act of contrition for events already faded
and distorted with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel the myth and the awe in my voice,'' Kron says,
speaking not only of her father but of an ultimately unknowable
past, ``and it makes me sick because it's not him.'' &QL; 
____ &QL; 
What: ``2.5 Minute Ride.'' &QL; 
Where: Tiffany Theaters, 8532 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. &QL; 
When: Through March 5. Performances at 8 p.m. Wednesdays through
Saturdays, 3 and 7:30 p.m. Sundays. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, nearly two feet of snow buried portions of interior
North Carolina as a powerful winter storm moved northeast along the
Middle Atlantic coast. Wednesday, this storm will advance into
eastern Canada, bringing additional heavy snow to northern New York
and northern New England. Farther south, residual moisture in the
lower portions of the atmosphere will cause snow showers to linger
across the central Appalachians and eastern Great Lakes. Meanwhile,
gusty breezes from the northwest drying on descent from the
interior will cause clouds to break, yielding intervals of sun near
the Northeast and Middle Atlantic seaboards.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and cool weather will cover the Southeastern states
Wednesday as sinking currents of air associated with high pressure
build toward the region. Farther south, sunny and cooler conditions
will also affect the Florida peninsula where daytime readings will
average in the 50s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   A potent jet stream disturbance will spiral into the Southwest,
bringing valley showers and higher elevation snow to Arizona, Utah,
New Mexico and Colorado. Some of the snow will be quite heavy,
especially in the San Juan mountains. Toward evening, the jet
stream disturbance will track eastward causing snow and ice to
shift into Oklahoma and extreme northern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Generally dry weather will cover the West Coast, though clouds
and spotty showers will occur over northern Washington as a weak
disturbance passes through the region. Elsewhere, light snow will
fall from western Kansas to central Montana as moist winds ascend
the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Capricious Storm
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes are notorious for moving and growing in unanticipated
ways. Tuesday's major winter storm, which surprised residents of
the East, matched the capriciousness of its tropical cousin.
Drawing energy from warm waters off the Carolina Coast, the storm
developed rapidly late Monday. Farther inland, steering winds at
18,000 feet were exceptionally weak. At the same altitude on the
ocean flank of the storm, winds from the southeast were much
stronger, overwhelming the weaker steering winds over land. In
essence, the storm began to steer itself, taking a more western
path than expected.

 &HT;    Dolphins target big plays
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ New Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt doesn't plan to
change the team's defensive philosophy next season, but new
defensive coordinator Jim Bates will call plays differently and
predicted more variety _ and he hopes more success _ from the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, introduced Monday along with new defensive line coach
Clarence Brooks, praised the Dolphins' defense of the past two
seasons, calling it ``very close'' to championship level. Miami
ranked fifth in the NFL in total defense, eighth against the run
and fifth against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   But its performance in the 62-7 playoff loss to Jacksonville and
its tendency to give up big plays, particularly against the pass,
shows it needs improvement, Bates said. He talked with secondary
coach Mel Phillips, nickel package coach Bill Lewis and assistant
Randy Shannon about his plans in a meeting Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will mix it up more,'' said Bates, who was the Cowboys'
defensive line and assistant head coach the past two seasons. ``We
will not put the corners out there in a situation where it will be
90-95 percent in bump-and-run. The corners were put in a lot of
pressure situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates, 53, hopes his experience coaching secondaries for the
Browns in 1995, for Florida in 1990 and for Texas Tech from 1978-83
will help him make the Dolphins less predictable with cornerbacks
and safeties.
</P>
<P>
   Man-to-man coverage works well sometimes, he said, but also can
be limiting, even with excellent players. Problems can be
particularly obvious against teams such as the 1999 Colts, who
mastered the play-action pass with quarterback Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Schemes might be adjusted to improve against that, Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a team is as versatile as Indianapolis, you are
vulnerable _ especially if you're playing bump coverage _ to the
play-action pass,'' he said. ``If you get those safeties sucking up
inside, then those corners are out on an island totally. But you've
got to mix and match and know when to run things.''
</P>
<P>
   He singled out cornerback Sam Madison, linebacker Zach Thomas
and tackles Daryl Gardener and Tim Bowens as players he's excited
to coach. He spoke Monday with Thomas and defensive end Jason
Taylor. He said he was not ready to discuss specific players or
positions that need improvement.
</P>
<P>
   But Wannstedt said he hired Bates and Brooks to replace
coordinator George Hill and line coach Cary Godette nearly as much
for the subtle things they'll change as for what can remain the
same. Their philosophies are close to his, which he thinks will
ease the transition for players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important to understand: The reason this is so
good and the reason it's going to be so positive and (create)
improvements is the defensive philosophy and a lot of the
terminology, all those things, will not change,'' Wannstedt said.
``Look at Dallas, Cleveland . . . a lot of things that they're
doing are things that we're doing right here and we have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, 48, said he and Bates will sit down with the Dolphins'
defensive playbook and adapt their language to it rather than vice
versa. It shouldn't be difficult for Brooks because he's been away
from Wannstedt for just one season.
</P>
<P>
   He coached the Browns' defensive line after spending six years
in the same position in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of Trace, all those guys have less than
seven years in the league,'' Brooks said, referring to 11-year
veteran Armstrong. ``It's a very young group and I think they
should be just about ready to hit their strides. History has shown
that those guys are ready to hit a peak.''
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Former Dallas head coach Chan Gailey arrived to
interview for offensive coordinator. He said he likes what he knows
of the Dolphins' organization but still would prefer another
head-coaching job. But those options are dwindling with only New
Orleans and New England still hiring. Gailey would not necessarily
take just any head-coaching job instead of an assistant's job,
however. ``I would not make that blanket statement,'' he said.
``But I cannot think of a lot of situations so bad that you would
not take the head job over that.'' . . . C Grey Ruegamer had
arthroscopic surgery on both shoulders to relieve chronic pain. He
should be ready for spring mini-camps.

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Placido Domingo, the world-class tenor who will assume artistic
directorship of the Los Angeles Opera on July 1, will sing three
concerts with the Kirov Orchestra as a vocal addendum to the
company's 2000-2001 season, announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's three concerts with the Kirov Orchestra, conducted by
Valery Gergiev, will take place Sept. 10, 13 and 15. He will sing
Act 1 of Wagner's ``Die Walkure'' and Act 2 of the composer's
``Parsifal,'' the first time Domingo has performed Wagner in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The singer said he added the concerts because he was not
otherwise scheduled to perform with Los Angeles Opera during the
upcoming season, which was planned by outgoing general director
Peter Hemmings.
</P>
<P>
   Season subscribers will receive priority ordering for the
concerts, beginning May 1.

<P>
   ``Aida,'' by Giuseppe Verdi, nine performances Sept. 6-28. With
soprano Deborah Voigt and tenor Johan Botha.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Cenerentola,'' by Gioachino Rossini, seven performances
Sept. 8-24. With mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore and tenor Kurt
Streit.

<P>
   ``Peter Grimes,'' by Benjamin Britten, seven performances, Oct.
18-Nov. 4. Directed by John Schlesinger. With tenor Philip
Langridge and soprano Nancy Gustafson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giulio Cesare,'' by George Frideric Handel, seven performances
Feb. 23-March 10. With countertenor David Daniels and soprano
Elizabeth Futral.

performances Jan. 16-Feb. 3. With bass-baritone Richard Bernstein
and soprano Maria Bayo.

11-29. With bass-baritone Simone Alaimo, soprano Ruth Ann Swenson
and baritone Thomas Allen.

RECIPES TOO GOOD FOR VEGETARIANS ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when cookbook subjects have never been more highly
specific _ a 494-page book on eggs will be hitting the shelves in
May _ it is difficult to get away with writing a cookbook of
eclectic recipes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I laughed a little when I saw the title ``Madhur
Jaffrey's World Vegetarian'' (Clarkson Potter, $40). How brave of
Ms. Jaffrey to approach a subject so unwieldy, so vast, that it
could make most authors dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Jaffrey is an experienced cookbook author. Apparently,
she kept her subject under control by including only vegetarian
dishes of the world that she likes. Thus the possessive in the
title.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ms. Jaffrey, who is best known for her books
on Indian cooking, includes many more recipes from India than from
any other country. She also leaves out broad swaths of classic
vegetable dishes. There are, for instance, very few recipes from
France, a country that by itself could offer enough artichoke
recipes to fill a book.
</P>
<P>
   She also includes a good number of recipes that have no cultural
roots, like curried red cabbage with cranberry juice. (Ms. Jaffrey
simply made it up.)
</P>
<P>
   She is careful to point out that this book does not result from
a lifetime of scholarly research, but from a lifetime of travel.
It's just a big bunch of recipes _ very big, more than 650.
</P>
<P>
   The danger in such a diversified book is that the dishes you
find inspiring may not exactly go together.
</P>
<P>
   I had fun cooking from the book. The recipes felt like
liberating adventures, rather than focused, rigid formulas. Mostly,
I was looking for tasty recipes that would make me want to cook
them again. And mostly, they were just that.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lankan sweet potatoes with cardamom and chilies were
pleasantly spiced and fragrant. They would be great with pork, if
you aren't vegetarian, and great with greens if you are.
</P>
<P>
   A savory yogurt dish that had spinach, cloves, ginger and
cardamom folded into it was fabulous but left me wondering what to
do with it. It seemed neither side dish nor condiment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jaffrey says to serve it with rice or flatbreads. All I had
was country bread, and it worked just fine. I mopped up every last
bit of the tangy yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   I made a second yogurt recipe, a lassi-like drink, with milk,
honey, almonds and basil. It was so unusual and so interesting that
it's the kind of recipe I'll save for a dinner party when I want to
surprise guests at the end of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Not every dish will stay earmarked. Mushrooms with wine and
coriander seeds, from Cyprus, tasted fine, but the white mushrooms
_ which can be lovely on their own _ seemed more a vehicle for
coriander than a clever pairing with the spice. The dish wasn't
bad, just unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for an Ethiopian lentil salad with
crushed mustard seeds and green pepper. It had a bitter edge.
</P>
<P>
   The dish that made an impression, though, was tea eggs. The eggs
are partly cooked in the shell, then gently cracked and finished by
simmering in a broth of soy sauce, tea, star anise and ginger. I'm
glad Ms. Jaffrey included this recipe from China over American
deviled eggs.
</P>
<P>
   TEA EGGS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Madhur Jaffrey's World Vegetarian'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   8 eggs, gently washed
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3 thin slices ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 tea bags (any black tea)
</P>
<P>
   1 star anise
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar.
</P>
<P>
   1. Fill a small pan with enough water to cover eggs, and bring
to a boil. Reduce heat to low, so that there are just a few gentle
bubbles rising to the surface. Using a spoon, lower eggs, one at a
time, into water. Simmer for 6 minutes, then drain, and cover eggs
with cold water for a minute. Drain again. Tap each egg gently
against a hard surface to create a network of small, connected
cracks all over.
</P>
<P>
   2. In the same pan, combine soy sauce, salt, ginger, tea bags,
star anise, sugar and 3} cups water. Bring to a gentle simmer. Add
the eggs, cover and simmer gently for 1{ hours, turning the eggs
now and then.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove eggs from liquid. Strain liquid and peel eggs while
they are still hot. Halve eggs, and serve braising liquid as a
dipping sauce. The eggs may also be served cold; leave them in the
shell until serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 &HT;    Pro Player naming-rights deal may unravel
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Fruit of the Loom seemed like a good fit
to Wayne Huizenga in 1996, when he made sports marketing history by
renaming the Miami Dolphins' stadium for a start-up sports apparel
brand, Pro Player.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the usual airlines and telecommunications companies _
this was a 75,000-seat billboard to help launch a line of jackets
and other clothing with NFL logos.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fruit of the Loom's bankruptcy may hold a cautionary tale
about stadium-naming deals that stretch too far.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player owes the former Joe Robbie Stadium for the final six
years of a 10-year, $2 million-per-year naming-rights agreement.
Huizenga owns the Dolphins and the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit of the Loom is considering selling its Pro Player division
and other ``non-core assets,'' Fruit of the Loom spokeswoman Lauren
Teggelaar said.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company has more than $1.3 billion in debts, it
revealed in a Dec. 29 filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization. Not all details are available, such as whether Pro
Player's annual obligation to the stadium will be treated as one
more bill to be negotiated in the reorganization process.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player is a healthy unit in a larger company that needs time
to get back on its feet, its representatives say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's business as usual for Pro Player and we're
moving forward,'' said Peter Seligman, spokesman for the Pro Player
division. ``Nothing's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga has met with Pro Player executive Doug Kelly, Seligman
said, and both sides are talking as if they intend to honor the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're our partner and we'll wish them the best of luck,''
said stadium President Bruce Schulze. ``We're just waiting to hear
what is the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly $12 million is not insignificant to an operation such
as Pro Player, whose annual sales are estimated at $200 million.
The brand still is trying to establish itself in consumers' minds.
A marketing deal with former Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson was
allowed to die, although the stadium name has received plenty of
exposure from a World Series, a Super Bowl, NFL and college
football games and other events. Sports marketing executive Ryan
Schinman, president of New York-based CNB Entertainment Inc., said
the legacy of the Pro Player deal is mixed. Arguably, both sides
have received benefits, at least through the first four years of
the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a tremendous infusion of cash Wayne Huizenga
got in to help his team,'' Schinman said. ``For Pro Player, it
really brought them on the scene, and got them exposure at the
Super Bowl, a World Series, Dolphins games and other events.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it also serves as a reminder that there are probably limits
to selling naming rights at stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Robbie Stadium was a relatively new, privately owned
facility honoring the Dolphins' previous owner who built it, yet
its name change still produced plenty of grumbling on radio shows
and in letters to the editor at the time. Other ballparks may
simply be out of marketers' reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain things have a sacredness to them and maybe you
shouldn't do it,'' said Schinman, who has a home in Jupiter.
``George Steinbrenner could probably get $9 million to $14 million
a year for renaming Yankee Stadium, but I don't think he will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay's Lambeau Field probably would be another example of
an untouchable name, he said. Team officials are trying to get
public money for renovations there but nobody is talking naming
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Player deal was significant because it helped end a
tradition of naming sports arenas for a person or company
associated with the stadium's home region. Once upon a time
stadiums were part of civic history and culture such as RFK Stadium
in Washington or Soldier Field in Chicago. There was corporate
money behind many names _ Wrigley Field, for example _ but once in
place, they typically became rooted in the landscape. The name was
not for resale.
</P>
<P>
   Then the idea of corporate sponsorship slowly entered the
picture. As late as 1990, only four teams had stadiums named for
corporate sponsors, including Buffalo's Rich Stadium (Rich Foods).
Corporate deals that did come along, however, generally had some
noticeable connection to the city such as Denver's Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player was different. It was not a local company, and had no
factories or large offices nearby. This was strictly exposure for
money, made for TV.
</P>
<P>
   If Pro Player has to pull out of the contract, it probably would
be embarrassing for Huizenga. Fans might have to get used to a
third name in five years. Yet Huizenga might find consolation in
this fact: The going price for a stadium name has climbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, you've seen deals go for more,'' Schinman said.
``There have been several deals for $5 million to $5.4 million a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even college arenas are no longer sacred. The University of
Miami wants to work with Ryder Corp. on naming a campus home for
its basketball team. Cable TV operator Comcast Corp. has agreed to
pay $20 million over 25 years for naming rights to the basketball
arena replacing Cole Field House at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just worry what kind of culture we're teaching our kids,''
Paul Pinsky, a Maryland state senator, told reporters there. ``I
don't think we should be using our public and government spaces to
be creating billboards and hawking products.''

MOST WANTED WINES LIST: $10 TOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: list appears at end of story.) &HT;    (DW) 
 By   ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anybody can find a good $100 white wine; just head for the
Montrachet section at the wine shop. The real challenge is finding
a good bottle for $10 and under, a wine versatile enough for all
sorts of meals, yet presentable even for special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, too often inexpensive white wines are
uninspiring, either flabby and nondescript or overly acidic and
acrid. But there are some tricks to finding the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   One is to seek out wines made from unfashionable grapes, or from
unpopular areas. Vouvray, made from the chenin blanc grape, for
example, can be a great value, like the one from Chateau de
Montfort. Many Vouvrays can disappoint, too.
</P>
<P>
   Riesling is also an undervalued grape. While good rieslings most
commonly come from Europe, the Bonny Doon riesling listed here,
made with grapes from California and Washington, is one of the best
American versions. The best sauvignon blancs, from the Loire and
New Zealand, are generally closer to $20 than $10, but the
sauvignon blanc from Domaine du Tariquet, produced in Gascony,
displays all the grassy, refreshing character of the grape.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick is to look for distinctive blends of grapes. The
excellent white here from Niebaum-Coppola, for example, is made
with chardonnay, muscat canelli, riesling and malvasia bianco,
while the Rhone is made from grenache blanc, roussanne and ugni
blanc. The Sarda is a blend of macabeo, xarel-lo and parellada, the
three grapes that are used to make cava, the Spanish sparkling
wine.
</P>
<P>
   None of these wines, listed in order of preference, are terribly
complex, but then you wouldn't want to put on a tuxedo when a pair
of comfortable jeans will do.
CHATEAU DE MONTFORT, VOUVRAY, 1998 $9 &QL; 
Mossy, honeyed scent and a touch sweet. &QL;

 &HT;    SURGEON GENERAL SETS NEW GOALS FOR NATIONAL FITNESS, HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Surgeon General David Satcher on Tuesday unveiled a
10-year wellness plan for the nation that focuses on whipping
Americans into shape and eliminating racial disparities in health.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also seeks to reduce smoking by adolescents, cut drug
use and help adults get treatment for depression.
</P>
<P>
   An overriding goal of the program is to help the nation's
younger generation live to be at least 100 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher, flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala, announced the new ``Healthy People 2010'' goals at the
opening of a weeklong conference on public health.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the goals represent a ``health agenda for the
nation _ a strategic plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new century brings new challenges and opportunities to
improve the health of everyone in the United States,'' she said.
``People not only want to live a longer life, but they also want to
enjoy a healthy life. As the baby boomers become the senior boom,
quality of life will become a central issue for our health
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher added that one of the primary objectives in eliminating
racial disparities in health is to educate people in how to make
intelligent health decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the goals, which also include getting kids
vaccinated, Satcher said the program will seek to reduce homicides,
provide greater access to health insurance and even curb fatal car
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying premise of Healthy People 2010 is that the
health of the individual is inseparable from the health of the
larger community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Healthy People program was started by the federal government
in 1979 and has been updated at the beginning of every decade since
then.
</P>
<P>
   He said people will not live up to their community
responsibilities if they fail to require physical education classes
in every secondary school grade level.
</P>
<P>
   The government has recruited stars such as actor Bill Cosby and
talk show host Oprah Winfrey to help promote Healthy People 2010.
Cosby will appear in nationally-televised public service
announcements, while Winfrey's show on Wednesday will be devoted to
health.
</P>
<P>
   Also endorsing the initiative are members of the U.S. world
champion womens soccer team, three of whom were at Tuesday's
launching of Healthy People 2010.
</P>
<P>
   To reach young people, ads will appear on MTV. And Shalala said
that some of the story lines in popular television soap operas will
include messages to educate the public about better health.
</P>
<P>
   Personal responsibility is the key to a healthy lifestyle and
the success of Healthy People 2010, Satcher said, but the community
must also get involved. For example, he said, it is known that
girls are less likely to smoke if they are involved in organized
sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   People can stay healthy by doing little things like taking the
stairs instead of the elevator, eating low-fat snacks, fruits and
vegetables, and making sure everyone in the family, including
parents, have the shots they need, Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steps are simple, but powerful,'' he said. ``The factors
that cause disease and death can be influenced by the choices we
make: physical activity, weight control, tobacco use, substance
abuse, immunization and many others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Healthy People 2010 goals are available online at:

COOKING CABBAGE? LIGHT A LAMP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several months ago, I received an object that looks like an
oversize perfume bottle. A leaflet with it said the object would
remove cooking odors and freshen stale air. I mumbled, ``Likely
story,'' and put it on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I had to do quite a bit of cooking in my windowless,
fanless kitchen and thought I would give the oversize perfume
bottle _ actually something called a Lampe Berger _ a try.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it work, but I can't wait to use it when I cook
cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   According to that leaflet, its secret for removing unpleasant
odors was patented in 1897 by a French pharmacist, Marcel Berger,
who ``tested the effects of high temperature catalytic combustion
as a process for disinfecting hospital rooms.'' Whatever that
means.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the process is explained, the lamp is simple to
use. You fill the bottle with an unscented fuel, add the wick and
burner, light the lamp and let it burn for two minutes, then
extinguish the flame. A little perforated shade is placed over the
burner for 25 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the room.
When the cooking smells have dissipated, the shade is removed and
replaced with a cap until the lamp is needed again.
</P>
<P>
   The French use the Lampe Berger, which has a garden's worth of
fragrances, to perfume their homes, but my choice would be the
neutral scent.
</P>
<P>
   The lamps range in price from $65 to thousands of dollars,
depending on size and material. They can be ordered in two sizes,
for $65 and $75, through (800) 201-8382, where refills are $23 and
should last for about six months. The lamps and fuels are also
available on various Web sites.

 &HT;    CCE losses not as bad as predicted
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world's largest soft-drink
bottler, reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the fourth
quarter and significantly improved prospects for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock shot up 10 percent Tuesday on the results.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Coca-Cola Co. is scheduled to report its earnings, with
analysts expecting a substantial number of job cuts and hundreds of
millions of dollars in one-time charges.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based CCE, which generally loses money in the fourth
quarter because of the seasonal nature of its business, posted a
quarterly loss of $18 million, or 4 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share and
represented a smaller quarterly loss than in 1998, when CCE lost
$34 million, or 9 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Cash operating profit, a key indicator of a bottler's
performance, got a boost from a 4 percent wholesale price increase
CCE imposed. As a result, cash operating profit rose 18 percent in
the fourth quarter to $516 million. After adjusting for the same
territories as existed in 1998, the increase was 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, cash operating profit rose 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for investors, the picture for this year has
improved dramatically, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Annual cash operating profit should rise 12 percent, while
earnings per share should jump to 70 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's announcement, Wall Street had been expecting
earnings this year of 42 cents a share, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial. In addition to higher prices, CCE will
benefit from programs aimed at prolonging the use of equipment that
will lower the year's depreciation expenses by about $160 million,
or 23 cents a share, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised my earnings estimate and my target price,'' said Marc
Cohen, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. He expects CCE to hit $30 a
share within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think volume growth in North America improved dramatically
and will continue to improve in 2000,'' Cohen said. ``The returns
on capital are rising and excess cash is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Company Chairman Summerfield Johnston Jr. said CCE undertook an
important transition last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, the industry shifted away from a pure price
discounting strategy to an emphasis on building brand equity and
creating value for the company,'' Johnston, who also serves as
chief executive, said in a statement. ``As a result, we enter 2000
with our business in the best condition in many years. The focus is
now on the products, packaging and marketing programs. . .rather
than the unsustainably low pricing that occurred in the last
several years.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, CCE earned $56 million, or 13 cents a share.
That was down from $141 million, or $36 cents a share, for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's product recall in Belgium, which cost the company
$103 million, was a key reason for the annual profit decline.
Excluding non-recurring items, such as the recall, net income rose
29 cents in 1999, compared with 28 cents in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Operating revenue last year rose 7 percent to $14.4 billion. For
the fourth quarter, it increased 8 percent to $3.5 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERGREEN, Colo. _ In his battered, treasured copy of ``American
Light: The Luminist Movement 1850-1875,'' the realist landscape
painter Don Stinson has tucked a few snapshots beside Albert
Bierstadt's ``Storm in the Mountains.'' One features a cloudless
blue sky and an immense vertical metal screen: a drive-in movie
theater. There is a pair of photos taped together to record a big
Western sky and a four-door sedan on a road leading away from a
snow-streaked Rocky Mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Just as painters like Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church, Winslow
Homer and Thomas Moran exuberantly chronicled late 19th-century
nature at its most romantic, 43-year-old Stinson is painting oils
of pastures, mountains and vast dreamy lapis-lazuli skies, but
something has been added. He has introduced human additions to the
land: abandoned gas stations, eerily silent drive-in movie
theaters, roads that seem to go on forever and roads that actually
end.
</P>
<P>
   In his mixed-media installation ``Cisco No Services'' Stinson
fills a room with mementos of a squat concrete abandoned gas
station in Cisco, Utah. He juxtaposes his landscape oil painting
with actual gas pumps, collages of survey maps, shreds of
black-and-white photographs of roadside tumbleweed, gas receipts
and a file box of rocks. The installation is on view in a group
show, ``The West: New Ways/Old Visions,'' at Metropolitan State
College's Center for the Visual Arts in downtown Denver, where it
will remain until Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when Western landscapes are frequently surveyed,
negotiated, developed and transformed, Stinson optimistically
paints what he calls ``culture in repose'': that is, Western
settings experiencing a pause. He calls his panoramic views of
ruins ``portraits that record human passage and its effects across
geography and time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinson, who lives high atop a piney hill overlooking Interstate
70 here in Evergreen, says he is not nostalgic about his seemingly
forlorn gas stations and drive-ins. Married to a public-policy
planner specializing in the environment, he revels in questions
like: Is there no time for us to reflect anymore? What happened
here? Why did they leave? In his view, ``A lot of these places
engage your imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a geologist, Stinson spent memorable slices of his
childhood driving to obscure sites and thinking about what was
behind the land, what was forming it. He spent summers on oil rigs.
He was born in Texas and reared in Littleton, Colo., and his family
frequently drove back and forth between both states. These rides
inspired Stinson's landscape series ``23 Degrees Latitude:
Geography of Obsolescence,'' exhibited last summer at the
Nicolaysen Art Museum and Discovery Center in Casper, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to paint landscapes of deserted stops along the
highways spanning the southern tip of Texas to Montana's Canadian
border. ``I have this love of driving and moving fast throughout
space,'' he said. ``I think the road culture is fascinating, but I
like it in an older, localized context.''
</P>
<P>
   He admired and has emulated the 19th-century landscape painters'
use of layered oils and their realistic detail. In an oil-on-birch
panel, ``Paonia Drive-In,'' a covey of satellite dishes, a water
tank and a man surveying are all clearly yet minutely represented
in contrast to a big driven-in screen and expansive indigo, pink
and purple skies. For Stinson these details are painterly, not
necessarily social criticism. Even in America's heralded wide-open
spaces, a lone drive-in or gas station reveals much about earlier
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The writings of John Brinckerhoff Jackson have been Stinson's
most esteemed bible. Stinson named a painting of an almost
glistening drive-in ``The Necessity for Ruins,'' in acknowledgment
of Jackson's book ``The Necessity for Ruins'' (1980), in which the
writer said that after a golden age of harmonious beginnings there
``ensues a period when the old days are forgotten and the golden
age falls into neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added that there ``finally comes a time when we
rediscover and seek to restore the world around us to something
like its former beauty,'' and that ``there has to be that interval
of neglect.'' Stinson said that ``with growth happening so fast,
everything needs to be looked at, and thought about, and because
the images of the West have been such a big part of our American
identity we need to really look at some of our spaces as they
change.''
</P>
<P>
   He is represented by Parchman Stremmel Galleries in San Antonio
and the Gallery in Bloomington, Ind. He is also represented by
Robischon Gallery in Denver, which will have a solo exhibit of his
work in May. Jim Robischon, the co-owner, said Stinson's paintings
``are about people trying to make it on the fringes of our
landscapes'' and ``are documentations of the recent pioneers of the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon McConnell, who was senior curator of the Yellowstone
Museum in Billings, Mont., said Stinson showed how ``we as humans
have become almost a geologic force on the land.'' As for the
drive-ins, McConnell said: ``You can imagine that there is a
remnant of John Wayne haunting those screens. We are haunted by
John Wayne.''

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta produces 'huge' earnings numbers
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Powered by the success of its new digital products,
Scientific-Atlanta surged strongly in the second quarter, handily
beating Wall Street estimates of its performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Norcross, Ga.-based company's earnings rose nearly 74
percent from a year earlier while sales were up 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And that success continues, with the Norcross-based supplier to
cable TV industry announcing another big sale Tuesday. Charter
Communications, which has systems in metro Atlanta, has agreed to
buy $100 million in digital set-top boxes from Scientific-Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Scientific-Atlanta's stock surged $2.56 1/4
Tuesday to close at $72.50. That close marks a new 52-week high for
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The strong earnings report came as Scientific-Atlanta announced
a big executive change. Steve Necessary, the company's vice
president for marketing, was named the new chief executive of its
PowerTV software unit.
</P>
<P>
   PowerTV makes the software that powers the company's Explorer
line of digital cable TV set-top boxes and networks. The company is
evaluating whether to spin PowerTV off as a separate publicly
traded company.
</P>
<P>
   In a newsy day for the company, earnings took center stage. Its
results beat both analyst estimates and the so-called whisper
number of 34 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   In these fast-paced days of the Internet, companies that fail to
match or beat rumored expectations often find their stocks pummeled
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, the company earned $33.4 million, or 41
cents a share, compared to $19.2 million, or 25 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue was $372.7 million, up $310.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to be a huge quarter,'' says George Hunt, a media
analyst at Wachovia Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Driving Scientific-Atlanta's results are sales of Explorer. This
digital system enables cable TV subscribers to receive digital
television signals, send e-mail and browse the Web, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   As of the second quarter, ended Dec. 31, The company had sold
more than 1 million Explorer set-top boxes. It shipped 267,000
alone in the second quarter, up from 126,000 during the same
quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta has installed 102 Explorer networks in 86
cable systems nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's sales are way ahead and so is installation,''
says Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deal is with Charter Communications, the cable TV
operator controlled by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Charter has
ordered 126,000 Explorer set-tops for the first half of this year,
say company executives.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Explorer network is PowerTV's operating
system. Scientific-Atlanta owns 80 percent of this company, based
in Cupertino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta wants to expand PowerTV's reach, selling its
software not only to other makers of set-top boxes but across new
platforms such as television manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to keep moving the mark,'' says Necessary, the 14-year
Scientific-Atlanta veteran who will now run the company. ``I want
to spread PowerTV's software to as many different platforms as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether Scientific-Atlanta would spin off PowerTV,
Necessary would only say, ``We are clearly evaluating a variety of
strategic alternatives for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers think Necessary is just the man to lead PowerTV
as independent company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well-known in the industry and well liked,'' says Hunt.
``Necessary will raise PowerTV's visibility. He's the perfect buy
for the job.''

   ``It's very difficult to live in war,'' says Sanel, who is 12.
``You just wait for the moment you will die.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years 2 million children have been killed in
increasingly brutal civil wars and ethnic or religious conflict.
For nearly half of that decade Alan and Susan Raymond, American
television-documentary makers who are nothing if not tenacious,
have been talking to children in four of the world's most tragic
recent battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   In their short lives children in the Bosnian city of Mostar,
like Sanel, have seen unspeakable barbarity. So have the children
of Rwanda, the segregated communities of Northern Ireland and the
troubled neighborhoods where Palestinians and Israelis wreak
vengeance on one another.
</P>
<P>
   In their most ambitious foreign venture the Raymonds have made a
108-minute documentary, ``Children in War,'' a film not so much
about children as by them. In the program, to be shown for the
first time by HBO on Monday, the Raymonds train their camera on the
little faces and let the children speak, prodded only by Ms.
Raymond's low-key, off-screen questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to tell children wherever they may be, God forbid
that they have to live what we've gone through in Bosnia,'' says
Sanel, who has lost an arm to a shell that fell near his bed as he
was sleeping. ``A shell doesn't have any eyes,'' he says, trying to
be philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children in War'' is also being turned into a book to be
published next month by TV Books (distributed by HarperCollins),
with the children's drawings, poetry and essays about their
experiences. A Web site, -www.childreninwar.com, is to list
organizations that help these young victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Raymonds have worked with children before. They won an
Academy Award for their 1993 documentary ``I Am a Promise: The
Children of Stanton Elementary School,'' about an inner-city school
in Philadelphia. The Oscar was one of many prizes they have
garnered since the 1973 PBS series ``An American Family'' made Bill
and Pat Loud and their five sons and daughters household names.
That documentary, conceived and produced by Craig Gilbert, gave the
Raymonds their first big break. Now part of filmmaking's academic
canon, it was updated in 1983 for HBO.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Raymond said in an interview that she and her husband were
originally only one of several camera-and-sound teams working on
the film _ he on camera and she on sound _ but because they were a
young couple with no children or other family responsibilities,
they began to spend all their time on the project, more or less
moving in with the Loud family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that kind of put us on the map is when we spent that
eight months living with the Louds,'' Raymond said as he and Ms.
Raymond talked almost interchangeably about their professional
partnership. During that time the Louds' marriage broke up and a
son, Lance, declared himself gay, all on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an early-on, very high-profile show,'' Raymond said.
``Some people love it, some people revile it. Some people feel that
it was the birth of cinema verite on television. Some people say
that the Louds were, you know, weren't worth the 12 hours of air
time. I guess it's your opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Raymonds went on to produce ``The Police Tapes,'' the life
of a South Bronx precinct (made on a $2,000 grant from the New York
State Council for the Arts), and ``Bad Boys,'' about juvenile
crime. Those and other works on crime inspired more than one
television series but got them temporarily stereotyped as
filmmakers with a lust for danger. So when they were hired on
contract to ABC News, one of the first places they were sent was
Northern Ireland during one of its most violent periods.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment was the beginning of their interest in the daily
life of war zones and in foreign reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of filming the police tapes, I think, in
combination with the `American Family' series sort of solidified in
most people's minds the idea that we were cinema verite documentary
filmmakers,'' Raymond said. ``Actually the truth of the matter is
we don't consider ourselves only cinema verite documentary
filmmakers. `Children in War' is really a fairly straightforward
report.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raymonds suggested the idea of children in conflict,
although they knew it was an unusual project for HBO, which more
often bought films or works in progress instead of backing original
documentaries. But after the Raymonds won an Oscar, HBO was willing
to let them make the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing easy about these films,'' Ms. Raymond said.
``It's hard to get the money. It's hard to get the idea approved.
It's hard to make the film, get it on the air. Every step seems
difficult. So I just decided it should be worth the effort. When we
made the school film, I really liked working with the kids, and I
decided, well, let's do some child issue that's important. And we
came back to that longing to do something international.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband added: ``Children are a kind of unrepresented group
as the subject matter of serious documentaries. I'm not suggesting
that there is not an enormous amount of programming directed to
children, but children as subject matter are kind of
underrepresented. They don't really have a powerful voice. They
don't vote. They just are kind of passive in many people's eyes in
terms of their roles in society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that some of the difference between us and some of the
other documentary filmmakers around today,'' he said, ``is that we
still believe in that original idea that there's some purpose to
making a documentary, that it should in fact inform and educate
people, or at least show them something that maybe they're not
fully aware of. I know a lot of times that's considered
old-fashioned. That's the old way to do things. But we really
believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Raymonds live in a very small town in upstate New York, near
the Berkshires and two hours from New York City. They value their
quiet environment and guard their privacy. Ms. Raymond said she
decided to settle there on the day their son was born 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a double life,'' she said. ``We used to have a
city apartment and a country house. We were always right in the
city, going out at night, or up in the mountains looking at the
view. We did that for a very long time. I guess the pull was
stronger to stay in the country. In the modern world, with
computers and a FedEx account, you can be anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Raymond remembered that as they traveled through war zones,
``One of the things people did ask us a lot as we made this film
is, did we have children? Sometimes even the children would ask us
if we had children, or ask us to show us pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Raymond said they chose their subjects with the help of
Unicef, private relief organizations, interpreters and others
picked up along the way. Sometimes they saw an appealing child on
the street and stopped spontaneously to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to kids you have to have a lot of patience,''
she said. ``And you have to have respect for them. Children are
great. They make a decision. It's black or white. They like you,
they don't like you. They're going to talk to you, they're not
going to talk to you. They don't have these sophisticated devices
of going around a subject. If you establish eye contact with them,
they read you, and they decide whether they like you or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to set this up,'' she said, ``because you're going to
have to ask them, what was it like when your parents died? You're
going to ask for these horrible memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raymonds found the children of Northern Ireland, where a
tenuous peace has now taken hold, and Israel and in the Palestinian
territories to be the most politicized because they had never known
life without violence. Talking in Gaza with a young veteran of the
Intifada, the long Palestinian revolt, the Raymonds got some of
their most hard-line answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 10 years old and saw what the Jews did and how
they shot at us, we couldn't be numb,'' Bilal, a teen-ager, said.
``We were shot at many times, but that only made us attack more.''
In Belfast another teen-ager, Patricia, said war had been going on
so long ``that if there is ever a peace, I think it will be a long
time before I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some children were too emotionally broken to talk, the Raymonds
said, particularly those who had been maimed by shelling and
snipers. But in most cases in all four war zones children
demonstrated a resilience, maturity and sagacity that was often
unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   When Selma, a girl driven from her home in Bosnia, was asked
what she thought of the man who killed her father, she replied,
``If the soldier who killed my father also has a child, I hope his
child does not have to suffer the way I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Raymond said that how children have handled violent death
and the nightmarish disruption of their lives varied from case to
case. ``I felt that the child's coping skill was directly related
to the mother,'' she said. ``If that mother was coping, if she was
not falling apart with all of the stress, then her child was also
doing all right. God knows they were tested. In Bosnia the kids had
their mothers, though they had all lost their fathers or brothers.
In Africa, where so many of them were orphans, you could really see
how difficult that was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, Umamuhoza, a tiny Tutsi girl of about 5, tried to
explain how she had lost everything in the 1994 genocide that left
as many as 800,000 people dead, most of them ethnic Tutsi. Her head
showed two deep wounds; her lower lip had been deeply slashed. Her
small, sad face gave a heartbreaking human dimension to a tragedy
almost too big to comprehend rationally.

   ``We were hiding, my dad, my mom and myself,'' she said in a
voice barely audible. ``And they came and killed us. They cut me
with a machete, and they killed me.''

 &HT;     McCAIN COURTS INDEPENDENT VOTERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain called for overhauling the
campaign finance system and other reformist measures Tuesday as the
Republican candidate courted New Hampshire's politically powerful
independent voters in a bid to clinch a victory in the nation's
first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator defied a snow storm to campaign across
populous central New Hampshire, courting independents who may be
having second thoughts about voting in the Democratic presidential
primary for the populist campaign of former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Registered independents outnumber Republicans and Democrats,
accounting for 37 percent of the state's 733,000 registered voters.
New Hampshire's 274,000 independents are permitted to cast ballots
in either political party's presidential primary and reclaim their
independent status by reregistering as an independent after casting
a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire Secretary of State's office estimates that
independents may account for 29 percent of the vote in the
Republican primary and 24 percent of the vote in the Democratic
primary. The state has 265,000 registered Republicans and 194,000
registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, hoping to upset Texas Gov. George W. Bush's march to the
GOP presidential nomination, echoed the issues of former Reform
Party candidate Ross Perot _ campaign finance reform, modest tax
cuts and protecting the federal budget surplus to salvage
middle-class entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working hard. The message has been getting through
on reform,'' McCain told the ABC News program ``Good Morning
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides said he planned to hammer away at the reformist
themes at three stops in stormy New Hampshire, where he has held
more than 100 town meetings.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was looking for ``a very big turnout here in New
Hampshire'' to bolster his campaign. Conservative Republican voters
played a disproportionately influential role in Iowa's closed GOP
caucuses where so few voters took part, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think here in New Hampshire, you've got a very kind of
different scenario, including independents either voting for
Democrats or Republicans,'' McCain said. ``So you're going to see a
much broader spread of the political spectrum here.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain once again relished ``a great victory'' at the hands of
the U.S. Supreme Court for his quest to restrict contributions to
presidential and congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States Supreme Court affirmed everything that I've
been saying, everything I've been working for, and has now just
blown away the arguments of those who were opponents of campaign
finance reform,'' McCain declared again on Tuesday, a day after the
high court upheld state-set limits on campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``I'm now very happy, because we're going to get
it, and this message of reform has been working.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain ducked a questioner's premise that Bush's record-setting
$67 million in campaign fund-raising might corrupt a Bush
presidency. But McCain, citing the Clinton re-election campaign's
receipt of questionable contributions from Chinese and Indonesian
donors, didn't miss the opening to add: ``I've seen what all this
huge money does, and so have the American people, and they're sick
and tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's pitch appears designed in part to woo independent
voters who might have been planning to cast ballots in the
Democratic presidential primary. Bradley suffered a setback in the
Iowa precinct caucuses where Vice President Al Gore swept over the
former New Jersey senator's challenge, 63 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley arrived in New Hampshire on Tuesday to confront a new
Quinnipiac College Poll that showed the vice president recovering
from a 10 percentage point deficit on Jan. 13 and pulling even with
Bradley in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   Linda L. Fowler, the political scientist directing Dartmouth
College's Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and Civic
Leadership in Hanover, said McCain is targeting independent voters
in the same way that Perot did when the Texas billionaire captured
23 percent of the state's vote in the 1992 presidential election,
compared to 19 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the same kind of campaign rhetoric we saw with
Perot _ `Let's be prudent about Social Security; let's not spend
the surplus; let's get under the hood of this car and get it
fixed,''' Fowler said. ``That message resonated here in 1992 and it
still does.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said McCain's pitch also appears aimed at many of the
independent voters who flocked to the presidential campaign of
former Sen. Paul Tsongas, D-Mass., in the New Hampshire primary.
Tsongas won the 1992 New Hampshire primary with 33 percent of the
vote and defeated then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, powered in part
by support from independents.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, said that independent voters' support for McCain lies
behind his lead in the survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonan led Bush 39 percent to 28 percent in a survey of
1,128 registered New Hampshire voters that was completed on Sunday.
The survey had a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only Republicans voted in their party's primary, Bush and
McCain would be neck and neck,'' Carroll said. ``But the
independent voters love McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll added: ``It's do-or-die for Sen. McCain in New
Hampshire, and it looks as if he'll do.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   A CBS News survey completed Jan. 17 showed McCain Bush nearly
even. But McCain swamped Bush among independents who expressed
plans to take part in the GOP primary, 46 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said that McCain faces challenges attracting independent
voters who had planned to take part in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``To switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican
is a big step,'' Fowler said. ``And the Democratic race is still a
horse race _ meaning a lot of independents won't abandon Bradley
just because he slipped in Iowa.''

thousands and causing at least one death. Snow was expected to fall
until the late hours of the morning in many areas, closing schools
and businesses and leaving in its wake wind gusts of more than 30
mph. The state Highway Patrol urged drivers to stay off roads,
warning that many of their own vehicles have been stranded in snow
drifts. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

when he worked at the Nashville newspaper in the 1970s. Their
decision: Talk to everybody they could find who worked at the
newsaper with Gore and then write three stories about it, one of
them on Page 1A. The Tennessean published those stories Tuesday. By
most accounts, the newspaper succeeded in showing that it can be
fair to native son Gore while at the same time not appearing to

 &HT;    More 'techies' calling Atlanta home
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the economy shifts into Internet gear, Atlanta has
been churning out contenders for the next great Net hope.
</P>
<P>
   With technology booming _ and stock valuations often
stratospheric _ it is the Internet that inspires many
entrepreneurs. They search for ways to use the Net, for capital
they need to get started and for a place to build their companies.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of them are calling Atlanta home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be the epicenter of all Internet
technology,'' said Miles Russ, first vice president at
Robinson-Humphrey. ``But this is a real hot pocket right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Without money, the best idea can dry up and die. But there is an
awful lot of big money looking for a home, and increasingly, that
money _ or at least the people holding the checkbooks _ either live
around Atlanta or are willing to visit here to seek candidates for
investment.
</P>
<P>
   It is a search that blends ambition and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Since the past few years have seen so many tech stocks rocket to
riches, no investor can pass up the chance to buy a seat on the
next flight. Choose the next Yahoo or America Online and the payoff
will be stunning _ and few, it seems, want to settle for anything
less than spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, investors at Robinson-Humphrey's ``Netlanta 2000''
conference were treated to a succession of presentations _ 41 in
all. Nearly every company claimed it had the customized, ``killer''
approach that would target a huge, lucrative and waiting market.
Each one that is right is a potential megastar, a multi-billion
dollar treasure-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The hitch is this: No one knows what is the real thing and what
is the fool's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to know the Net is changing the way Americans _
and eventually the rest of the world _ communicates and does
business. The conventional wisdom predicts a radical shift in the
economy, but as the new economy emerges, who for certain can
predict the winners?
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, clusters of high-tech companies have
collected in cities from Boise to Baltimore, with advocates looking
to the spectacular success of Silicon Valley as a model. Denver,
Austin, San Diego, Seattle, the Research Triangle and elsewhere
offer different specializations. Software, hardware, biotech or the
Net _ everyone wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   While Silicon Valley remains the dominant source of companies
and capital in the new economy, Atlanta, is reaching to be
recognized _ like Boston or Washington _ as being among the handful
of cities in the next tier.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was traditionally a sales and marketing hub for the
Southeast. In the early 1990s, the city began to look like a
telecommunications center as BellSouth set down thousands of miles
of high-speed wires and companies from AT&AMP;T to MGC Communications
laid a claim to business here and in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Robinson-Humphrey insists the city's high-tech identity
_ like the economy itself _ is being shaped in the image of the
Net. In a report released as part of its investors' conference,
Robinson-Humphrey sets out broad claims for ``Netlanta,'' arguing
that Atlanta has mimicked Silicon Valley in five critical ways.
</P>
<P>
   What made Silicon Valley the most intensive high-tech area in
the world were institutions that continually produced cutting-edge
research, talent, management, money to fund new ideas and a culture
of excitement around technology. The list, according to the report:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  University
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Research
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Industry leadership
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Venture capital
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Culture
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta cannot match the magnitude of the Valley forces. But it
has assembled the same equation _ albeit in smaller doses.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech now produces more engineers than Stanford.
Georgia's government, along with universities and businesses have
poured money into an Industrial Partnership Program to promote
usable research. Meanwhile, capital has collected in a small group
of Atlanta venture funds even while outside investors have grown
more willing to invest here.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley remains vastly larger in most categories. For
example, the Valley now lays claim to about $3.4 billion in venture
capital investment in a year, compared to $654 million in all of
the Southeast including Atlanta, Research Triangle Park and various
pockets of high-tech around the region.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta can hope to play in that first tier, Russ said. ``We are
certainly not going to be the epicenter of Internet technology. But
we can be in the same league as Boston or D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   And there has certainly been dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   When Internet Security Systems was launched, it could not find
funding in Atlanta, said Thomas Noonan, chief executive. Instead,
the company received most of its help from venture capitalists in
Boston and Silicon Valley. ``The situation five years ago was very
different.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to picking the right personnel, ISS has had
good luck locally, he said. ``Where do we turn? We are looking
internally, in Atlanta. That is a sure sign that there is local
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   And talent is key.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce last year launched
Industries of the Mind, an initiative meant to cultivate the area's
technology sector. The project means marketing Atlanta and sending
teams of executives as salesmen and recruiters to sell the area to
promising graduates as well as young companies. A trip to Boston is
planned for March, with missions to Virginia, San Diego, San Jose,
New York and Chicago to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for companies and we are looking for talent,''
said Martin Tilson, partner at Kilpatrick Stockton, chairman of the
firm's technology practice and a member of the Industries of the
Mind steering committee. ``And part of our job is to keep graduates
here. Human capital is becoming more valuable than financial
capital. There's just so much money out there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has attractions above and beyond the engines of
high-tech. Besides the growing tech sector and good universities,
there is an educated workforce, an efficient airport, a sub-Valley
cost of living and good climate _ enough to persuade some start-up
companies to move here and some big names to make this their
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, MindSpring Enterprises is in the midst of a merger
with Earthlink that will create a nearly $1 billion-a-year Internet
Service Provider that is second only to America Online. The company
will be called Earthlink, but be based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Healtheon recently merged with
Atlanta-based WebMD in an ambitious effort to create a dominant
healthcare service on the Net. Despite Healtheon's deep roots in
the Valley, Healtheon/WebMD is based here.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, some of those decisions involve movement of no
offices. Executives in the Valley can stay there and jet _ when
there is need _ to Atlanta. And sometimes, as with Healtheon/WebMD,
a company's engineering staff stays in the Valley, too. That is
hardly an endorsement of Atlanta's technology prowess.
</P>
<P>
   But naming a headquarters is more than trivial. It is unlikely
either Earthlink or Healtheon would accept an Atlanta headquarters
10 years ago. And some of that must surely reflect Atlanta's
history as a sales center for the Southeast, the nation's
fastest-growing region, its easy access to Latin America and
Europe, as well as the Northeast of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, some Net companies have shifted to Atlanta as a
place to grow.
</P>
<P>
   For example, three-year-old NetSchools moved in November from
Silicon Valley to Atlanta. Why? NetSchools, which supplies schools
with training and equipment meant to connect nearly all of its
learning to the Internet, sees ``all the educational resources
moving to the Web within a decade,'' said CEO and President John
Scott Redd.
</P>
<P>
   The company had sales and marketing here already, saw the
fastest-rising demand for Net connections east of the Mississippi
and made Atlanta home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge Storm, a 30-person company that connects buyers and
sellers of information technology, moved to Atlanta in November
from Chicago. The company's founders and management had wanted to
relocate to the Southeast and honed in on Atlanta, said Nancy
Hatfield, direct marketing manager. ``The decision was based on the
feeling that Atlanta is becoming the Silicon Valley of the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is already home to some prospering, promising,
publicly-traded Internet companies. Even more encouraging, some are
home-grown.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Security Systems, founded in a Georgia Tech dorm room,
is now one of the leading providers of protection for major
corporate and government networks. The company has a market
capitalization approaching $3 billion and revenue of more than $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD has sales of $50 million and _ thanks to a
rocketing stock price _ a market value of $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   IXL Enterprises, which designs and builds Web solutions, has
sales of more than $200 million and a market capitalization of $3.5
billion. CheckFree Holdings has annual sales of more than $250
million and a market capitalization exceeding $4 billion. Harbinger
Corp., which has morphed from software to business-to-business
electronic commerce, has sales of about $160 million and a $965
million market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   But for the long-term, one generation of success is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, companies _ especially Hewlett-Packard in the
Valley's early days _ throw off ideas, people and people with money
that help to fuel the next batch of start-ups, which go on to feed
still more up-and-comers. And in Atlanta, a second generation of
new ventures is now receiving start-up cash from the likes of Jeff
Arnold of Healtheon/WebMD, Bert Ellis of IXL and Jeff Levy of
EHatchery.
</P>
<P>
   And the more that Atlanta's Net companies pass on money and
talent, the more that other Net companies are likely to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has three things that we thought we needed as a young
company,'' said George Valentine CEO of Transchannel, an Internet
startup. ``Access to resources. Access to clients and access to
money.''

 &HT;    SNOW STORM CRIPPLES NATION'S CAPITAL
</HEADLINE>
 C -WEATHER-0126-COX &HT;    By BOB DART 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A conference on global warming was canceled here
Tuesday because of the snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day in the nation's capital: More than a
foot of slippery white stuff on the ground. A whirling wind
whipping wet snow sideways in your face no matter which direction
you walked. Temperatures never getting out of the 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government closed and 250,000 or so cocooning
bureaucrats snuggled under blankets. Schools were out and kids slid
down Capitol Hill on sleds and inner tubes. ``Read my lips,''
politically attuned moms warned. ``You can't go outside without
ChapStick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Monument was barely visible in the blowing snow.
At midday, Pennsylvania Avenue was a ghostly, lonesome byway. TV
correspondents lined up on a strategic sidewalk so they could
report on the storm with the snowy Capitol dome in the background.
Presidential Press Secretary Joe Lockhart engaged his staff in a
snowball fight on the White House grounds.
</P>
<P>
   There was bipartisan agreement that this was Washington's
biggest blizzard of the century _ all 25 days of it.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the day for the Office of U.S. Global Change to
hold its scheduled symposium on the earth's warming climate.
However, Tony Socci, a spokesman for the agency, cautioned that no
single snow storm _ no matter how cold and miserable _ can be used
to gauge long term climatic change.
</P>
<P>
   Observers ``would be hard put to use this as evidence one way or
the other'' in scientific discussions of global warming, he said of
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Such cancellations were the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had come back from its winter recess on Monday but
postponed most of its Tuesday hearings. Federal Reserve Chairman
Greenspan's appearance before the Senate Budget Committee was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardy few who did conduct their business with Congress
were Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriquez _ the grandmothers of
Elian Gonzalez. They met with lawmakers in their quest to have
their grandson returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time they've seen snow,'' said the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, which sponsored
the grandmothers' trip. ``They wanted to know if they could go out
and touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the west side of the Capitol, Carrie Noteboom was among
dozens of bundled and mittened enthusiasts not only touching the
snow, but also rolling in it, sliding over it, and even eating an
occasional hand full.
</P>
<P>
   The snowy scene was reminiscent of her native Colorado, said
Noteboom, a paralegal with the Justice Department. ``Only in
Colorado, nothing would be shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, families were enjoying the unscheduled holiday _ sliding
down Capitol Hill on plastic discs, Flexible Flyers and inflated
inner tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' said Steven Beckham, a lobbyist for the
University of South Carolina and other educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be travelers thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan Washington National Airport, which handles 650 commercial
flights a day, was closed. Dulles International Airport managed to
keep one runway open.
</P>
<P>
   Local TV stations quickly came up with logos for ``The Blizzard
of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mayor Anthony Williams arrived at a noon news
conference riding in the front seat of a snow plow truck. It was a
move of political symbolism. Former Mayor Marion Barry was once
criticized for extending his California trip to the Super Bowl
while a snowstorm crippled the District.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a cap with earflaps, Williams jokingly said that the 204
snow plows out on District streets were ``the largest armada ever
assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   The plows were needed. The snow was predicted to continue to
fall until 10 p.m.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Full trudge ahead in snowbound New Hampshire
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The campaign moved en masse today to New Hampshire, the
first-in-the-nation primary state, where the largely independent
residents will vote next Tuesday. Most of the candidates are
rolling out new ads aimed at an electorate that appears closely
divided among the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Candidacy going down the hatch
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses claimed a first victim. A ``senior adviser''
to Orrin Hatch said the Utah senator has decided to quit the
Republican presidential race, in which he came in dead last with 1
percent of vote. ``He's not taking any calls,'' said spokesman Paul
Smith. Hatch has a Wednesday news conference scheduled in
Washington, and an announcement is expected.
</P>
<P>
   An event made for cable
</P>
<P>
   Cable news viewers would have thought the Iowa caucuses were the
only thing going on in the world Monday night. And those tuned to
broadcast TV may have missed the story entirely. CNN, Fox News
Channel and MSNBC provided nonstop, prime-time caucus coverage,
blanketing airtime with sound bites, analysis and predictions. The
major broadcast networks stuck essentially to game shows, movies
and comedies, interrupting only for quick political updates.
</P>
<P>
   What the entrance polls showed
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Republicans rewarded George W. Bush for his ability to
restore the nation's moral values and thought he was a strong
leader who can win the White House in November, a poll of
participants found. Al Gore's victory was boosted by key Democratic
constituents such as older voters, union members and lower-income
voters. Steve Forbes' major support came from voters who thought
taxes was the top issue. The polling of people going into the
caucuses was conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of
several media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Third place feels just great
</P>
<P>
   He blistered Iowa with fervid oratory, but for months, Alan
Keyes was just the silver-tongued also-ran who would be fighting it
out for last place. But in one of the biggest surprises of caucus
exercise, Keyes placed third, beating two U.S. senators. Shouting
``Thanks to Almighty God,'' Keyes vowed to hundreds of supporters
in suburban Des Moines hotel ballroom that he would take his
campaign for moral renewal and against abortion ``all across
America and on until victory is ours. ... It is just the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   But fourth place should feel different
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer's supporters were disappointed their man failed to
break into the top three. But Bauer was cheered and applauded when
he addressed and thanked them. He said his campaign has focused on
``truth and family,'' and added that ``we're going to continue to
fight as hard as we can.'' The reality, though, as the Boston
Herald noted, is that historically a Republican candidate has
needed to finish in the top three to have a chance for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Another night of debating
</P>
<P>
   All candidates will debate Wednesday night at the WMUR studios
in Manchester, N.H. The Republicans will go from 7-8:30 p.m.; the
two Democrats from 9-10 p.m. You can catch the action live on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   A voice of experience
</P>
<P>
   He's been there himself, so he should know. President Clinton
said today the victories in Iowa were good for Al Gore and George
W. Bush but ``it's important not to over-read'' the results as they
turn to New Hampshire. ``The people of New Hampshire are very
independent,'' Clinton said. ``Now they want to make a good
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiding behind Hyde's hide
</P>
<P>
   John McCain says he'd support changes in the Republican platform
to allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, or to save the
mother's life. He told reporters before a town hall meeting in
Sunapee, N.H., that it's the same position taken by Illinois Rep.
Henry Hyde, a leader of the anti-abortion movement. But McCain
wouldn't say how actively he'd seek the abortion-policy change.
</P>
<P>
   See, even the court thinks so
</P>
<P>
   John McCain says he feels vindicated by the Supreme Court
decision that upheld dollar limits on political contributions and
declared them not an infringement on free speech. McCain has
focused on campaign fund-raising reforms, saying that's what his
whole campaign has been about.
</P>
<P>
   As goes Iowa, so goes Alaska
</P>
<P>
   Oh, right, there was something going on in Alaska, too. As in
Iowa, the order of finish in Alaska's statewide GOP straw poll was
George W. Bush followed by Steve Forbes. But the size of the win in
the non-binding poll could be counted on one hand. Bush netted
1,571 votes, or 36.3 percent; Forbes got 1,566, or 36.2 percent.
This despite Forbes outspending the front-runner by more than
10-to-1 and running many TV spots. Forbes made several trips to
Alaska. Bush settled for a phone call and two mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Next time he'll counterattack
</P>
<P>
   Feeling his first loss in 22 years in politics, an almost 2-to-1
drubbing, Bill Bradley said he will exploit the lessons of the Iowa
to strike back at Al Gore in New Hampshire. Bradley believes he was
hurt by failing to respond aggressively to Gore ads on a 1993 flood
relief vote and the possible impact of Bradley's health-care plan
on Medicaid patients that Bradley considered distortions.
``Whenever a misrepresentation is offered, it has to be
corrected,'' Bradley said. ``That is one thing I always knew, but I
certainly know now, based on experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of Paul Tsongas
</P>
<P>
   Niki Tsongas, widow of Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.), is accusing
Al Gore of using the sort of negative advertising that she alleged
helped destroy her husband's presidential hopes in the 1992
election. In an ad paid for by Bill Bradley's campaign and
scheduled to begin airing on New England TV today, Niki Tsongas, a
co-chair of the Bradley campaign in Massachusetts, says her husband
won the New Hampshire primary in 1992 with 34 percent of the vote,
but his campaign never recovered from negative attacks launched on
him by Bill Clinton during the subsequent Florida primary.
</P>
<P>
   Is you is or is you ain't?
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the latest issue of the New Republic features the a
smiling John McCain with the headline: This Man Is NOT a
Republican. The article, by Jonathan Chait, argues that while
McCain has not completely abandoned ``conventional Republicanism,''
he is ``increasingly taken with the aims of liberalism, and he is
starting to recognize that the two cannot always be reconciled.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, big spenders!
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the most expensive Iowa caucuses in history,
with millions spent on TV alone. Steve Forbes spent far more than
anyone, about $3.2 million, according to aides from the Forbes and
Bush campaigns. George W. Bush spent at least a million dollars
less, according to the AP. The Democrats spent about $1.5 million
each _ closer to $2 million for Bill Bradley, according to the Gore
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Same idea, slight difference
</P>
<P>
   The parties conducted their caucuses in Iowa in slightly
different ways. Democrats elect county convention delegates
reflecting their presidential preferences, discuss platform issues
and elect precinct leaders. Republicans elect precinct leaders,
hold a straw poll for president, elect delegates to the county
conventions and consider platform issues.
</P>
<P>
   In other words
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is expected to begin broadcasting
Spanish-language TV ads in Arizona, John McCain's home turf. Bush
speaks Spanish, televised ads in Spanish when he was running for
governord. He also has Spanish ads in Spanish-language newspapers
and radio in Iowa and New Hampshire. But the new ads are believed
to be the first televised in Spanish in a GOP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Front-running elsewhere, too
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Al Gore are well ahead of their rivals in
Illinois and Ohio, two recent polls have find. An Ohio Poll survey
and a Market Shares Corp. survey in Illinois, both conducted last
week, found each man with the support of more than 50 percent of
his party's registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Politics is not always pretty
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses apparently can be rather stinky. ``If turnout
at the precinct is high,'' the online magazine Salon reported,
``the able-bodied voters of Iowa _ often clad in long johns,
flannels, sweaters and beefy winter coats; packed into small,
overheated rooms in schools and municipal centers; engaged in
heated debates about candidates _ are prone to sweat. A lot.''

 &HT;    PARENTS CRITICIZE 'LAX' ENFORCEMENT OF DISABILITY LAWS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Parents of disabled students from across the nation
heaved wheelchairs out of taxis Tuesday and dragged walkers over
curbs capped by ridges of plowed snow.
</P>
<P>
   Pelted by gusts of sleet, a sighted man and a blind woman
clutched at each other for mutual support on Capitol Hill as they
inched along an icy sidewalk behind the Hart Senate Office
Building.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some four dozen parents and children made it to the
building's ninth floor. There, they praised a new federal report
that says the federal government has botched enforcement of laws
that require states to make sure their public schools educate all
children, regardless of their disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The senators and Education Department officials who had been
expected at the event were absent. Due to the unrelenting fall of
snow since dawn, official Washington was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Marca (cq) Bristo (cq), chairperson of the National Council on
Disability, said the visiting families had to fend for themselves
because the transport firm hired by the independent federal agency
had refused to let its van drivers brave the streets between the
visitors' hotel and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal,'' commented Lilliam (cq) Rangel-Diaz of Miami. She
said that, with six children who include two with disabilities, she
is used to overcoming barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No family should have to go through the pain, the suffering
and the frustration that we went through to provide Juan (her
oldest son) with an opportunity to receive an appropriate
education,'' she said. ``Yet I know that too many families do; some
of them are here with us today.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Rangel-Diaz has also seen progress as a
result of laws first passed in 1970, and consolidated in a law now
known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In
principle, IDEA gives children with disabilities a federally
protected right, not just to a free public education, but to one
that meets their special needs and is offered in ``the least
restrictive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Her stepson Christopher, her youngest child, came with her to
Washington. ``He is in third grade and happens to have autism,''
Rangel-Diaz said. Under IDEA, he attends ``regular classes at our
neighborhood school and receives all the services and supports that
he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the council reported over the weekend that federal efforts
under every president from Gerald Ford to Bill Clinton to get all
states and school districts to enforce IDEA have been
``inconsistent, often ineffective and without real teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to the 382-page report: ``Every state is
out of compliance with IDEA requirements to some degree, and
noncompliance has persisted in some states over many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits by parents ``at the expense of their personal lives,
their financial livelihoods and their careers,'' have done more
than federal action to force compliance with the law, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools within the same county will vary from obstructionist
to ideal and fully supportive,'' said Linda Shepard (cq) of
Douglasville, Ga., who is president of the National Parent Network
on Disabilities. Comparing education for disabled children to swiss
cheese, she said, ``If you slice it one way, it looks solid, and if
you slice it another way, it's full of holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristo read a message from an assistant secretary of education
who predicted that compliance will improve under a new monitoring
system adopted by federal bureaucrats last year. Attempts to reach
her for an interview were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Disability plans to post the full report
on its Web site (http://www.ncd.gov). Call (202) 272-2004 to order
in such formats as braille, large-print, diskettes or casettes.

 &HT;    By George! Titans running back getting his due
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee Titans running back Eddie George is trying
to make up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   George has been one of the better runners in the NFL since
entering the league in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This season, there's a difference. He's finally getting credit
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was voted to his third consecutive Pro Bowl for 1999
and became only the ninth player in NFL history to rush for 5,000
yards in his first four seasons, George labored in relative
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Titans prepare to play the Rams on Sunday in Super
Bowl XXXIV, he is one of the ones getting hyped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing my thing, but no one really cared,'' the 6-foot-3,
240-pound George said. ``At the time, (Denver's) Terrell Davis had
a big year, and (Detroit's) Barry Sanders had 2,000 (yards). My
1,300 every year didn't compare. When you're competing against
them, it's hard to get top billing.''
</P>
<P>
   George was lost in the shadow of the Titans' mediocrity. During
the transition from Houston in 1996 to Tennessee in 1997 and 1998,
but without its own stadium, the franchise finished 8-8 three years
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Titans went 13-3, including 8-0 in their new
Adelphia Coliseum. Much of that success can be attributed to
George, who rushed for 1,304 yards and had a career-high 1,762
yards from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he can carry this team,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher
said. ``He showed that he's got every reason to believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest knock on George before this season was that he
wasn't carrying the Titans late in the schedule. That criticism
grew after he failed to rush for 100 yards in the final seven games
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first few years that Eddie was in the league, we really
relied on him heavily,'' Titans offensive tackle Brad Hopkins said.
``We ran the ball a lot, and his numbers were up. He was getting
all this notoriety because he was a hard, punishing runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when teams had seen him once, they knew how to game-plan
him,'' Hopkins said. ``They knew what his style was and what his
tendencies were. It's harder the second time around, or the latter
part of the season, to be as successful as you were early in the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   George, 26, answered his critics this season and averaged 97
rushing yards in the final four regular-season games. He had 199
yards _ an NFL high for the season _ and two touchdowns in a 21-14
victory over Oakland on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we've had more success,'' he said. ``I've had more
chances to carry the ball late in games.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't slowed in the postseason. He became the first player
in franchise history to rush for 100 yards or more in consecutive
playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   George had 106 yards against the Bills in the wild-card round,
before setting a franchise postseason record with 162 yards against
the Colts the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy whose career started in the passenger seat of
a 1981 Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   George grew up in a single-parent home with his sister Leslie in
suburban Philadelphia. His mother, Donna George, kept a tight leash
on her only son after she separated from her husband, Eddie Sr., in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Donna George also was the architect of her son's future. She
worked two and sometimes three jobs to make ends meet. She was a
production manager at an automobile plant during the day, a fashion
model at night. Later, she picked up work as a product importer and
banquet caterer.
</P>
<P>
   Donna George tried to instill that work ethic in her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the fashion shows every night, but when I did, I'd
take Eddie and Leslie with me and have them do their homework while
I was on the runway,'' Donna George said. ``I took them to show
them that, whatever you want in life, you have to work for. Sitting
on my tail and praying to God wasn't going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was young, George attended a Catholic school outside
Philadelphia. He was the perfect student. But it started to change
during high school.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer before his junior year, George asked to borrow
$55 from his mother. He told her he wanted to take a summer-school
course to improve his math skills.
</P>
<P>
   But Donna George eventually learned that he needed the course to
remain eligible for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in trouble with my law,'' she said. ``Not the law
law.''
</P>
<P>
   With her patience wearing thin, Donna George made a decision
that changed her son's life. In 1989, she enrolled him at Fork
Union Military Academy, a prep school in Virginia. Jets quarterback
Vinny Testaverde and Raiders tight end Rickey Dudley attended the
school. So did George's uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in my 1981 orange Mustang and packed everything,'' Donna
George said. ``He wasn't living up to expectations. He was telling
me a whole bunch of lies. I told him, `You are going in a different
direction with more focus.' It was a good decision, not to discuss
it with him and just go.''
</P>
<P>
   When George arrived at Fork Union, he was given a jersey without
a number. Fork Union coach Mickey Sullivan told George he'd get a
number once his academics were in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``His main concern was that I was dumping him in this hick town,
and the scouts weren't going to notice him,'' Donna George said.
``I said, `Eddie, you're here for your education, and your football
will kick in, and they will come looking for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The college coaches didn't come at first. After his senior
season, George's only scholarship offer was from Edinboro, a
Division II school near Erie, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   George returned to Fork Union for a postgraduate season and
averaged 275 yards per game in the Virginia Prep League. He
received 25 scholarship offers and accepted one from Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing only two years in the Buckeyes' starting
backfield, George left as Ohio State's second-all-time leading
rusher. He won the Heisman Trophy in 1995 and earned a degree in
landscape architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fork Union) instilled discipline in me that I think I lacked
in that particular time of my life,'' George said. ``It was very
crucial for me to leave and go to Fork Union, because, really, I
was on a path headed to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, George is playing in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be in jail somewhere, but I don't think I would be
as successful as I am,'' he said. ``I'd probably be a manager at a
fast-food restaurant or something. Not that that's a bad job, but
that was just the reality of my situation.''

 &HT;    Titans receiver Thigpen will probably give way to Byrd
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yancey Thigpen was running the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be Thursday. It may be Friday,'' Tennessee's foremost
receiver said Tuesday. ``I may not practice at all. It may be a
game-day decision whether I play or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl week is not the time for introductions, but this more
or less has become one for Issac Byrd, who came to the Titans a
year ago with an empty portfolio and now finds himself as ``The Man
Who Would Be Yancey.''
</P>
<P>
   With a broken right foot making it almost certain that Thigpen
will not play on Sunday, Byrd anticipates making only the ninth
start of his three-year NFL career. Byrd was a practice-squad
member with Kansas City in 1997. He signed as a free agent with the
Titans as a sixth receiver two years ago when they were only
carrying five. Now, he finally has wandered into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   He filled in for Thigpen seven times in 1999, catching 14 passes
for 261 yards. He might have the best hands on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization believes in me,'' Byrd said. ``My teammates,
they believe in me. When I get in that huddle, they don't see
Yancey not being there. They just see Ike Byrd there right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steve McNair drops back to pass, he doesn't drop back
thinking, 'Okay, I can't throw over here because Yance isn't out
here.' He has confidence in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but while McNair has been knocked for an inability to
locate receivers downfield, the removal of the team's most
productive receiver is hardly an inconvenience. Thigpen played just
10 games and had 648 yards of McNair's 2,179 regular-season passing
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen said, ``The guy's been there for us all year He's
stepped in and done a great job for us. Very sound guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd fully expected to be someone's outfielder by now. He was
drafted by San Diego and St. Louis while playing baseball and
football at the University of Kansas. He spent a season in the
Cardinals system in 1996 before joining the Chiefs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This week verifies his decision to switch sports. Originally
slotted at all three receiver positions, he has the growing trust
of coach Jeff Fisher. His previous best chance at fame came two
weeks ago against Buffalo, when he was originally designated as the
receiver in Frank Wycheck's now-famous lateral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Mace (Derrick Mason) was injured, they put me in his
spot and Kevin Dyson in my spot on the play,'' said Byrd, who
caught a touchdown pass from Wycheck against Atlanta during the
regular season. ``When Wycheck got the ball, if everything worked
out, he would have thrown the ball back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the play became Dyson's, and Byrd became a footnote.
Until, possibly, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's our destiny this year to win it all,'' he said.
``All the things we've overcome _ all the injuries, sometimes bad
play _ it looks good.''

`KESTREL'S EYE': OK, STOP SQUAWKING, IT'S DINNER TIME (CHIRP)

 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   To put it simply, the extraordinary documentary ``Kestrel's
Eye'' is a spectacle of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   This remarkable and beautiful Swedish film, opening Wednesday
and playing only through Tuesday at the Film Forum in Manhattan,
views the world through the eyes of two kestrels, or European
falcons, that make their home in the upper reaches of a
13th-century church. In an age when virtual reality has become
commonplace, this film by Mikael Kristersson astonishes by
capturing reality with a fidelity and intimacy that prompt
old-fashioned wonder at how the feat was accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Below the birds' aerie lie the church grounds, and as the
seasons change and winter's snow gives way to blossoming trees and
blooming flowers, graves in the cemetery are tended, mourners
remember the dead, funerals are carried out and weddings celebrated
as happy voices and organ music and pealing bells rise into the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the church stands a village where parents walk their
children to school, youngsters play, joggers exercise and life
seems peaceful. And beyond the village, grassy marshlands and
pastures of grazing cattle lead at last to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   While the cycle of life and death and seasons plays out below
the church, the focus of ``Kestrel's Eye'' remains the birds,
followed in exceptional intimacy as they survey their domain,
chatter, hunt, feed, mate, tend their eggs, hatch them and raise
six tiny chicks to the moment they first take wing.
</P>
<P>
   Kristersson, using remote-controlled cameras placed at various
vantage points, including inside the nest in an aperture high in
the church, allows the viewer to see what seems to be every aspect
of the birds' life. And in one amazing sequence, apparently
accomplished with the aid of a motorized hang glider, the camera
flies, like a pursuit plane, directly behind one of the kestrels as
it flaps above the landscape where this raptor's keen eyes find
prey among the voles, mice and lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Kristersson, who produced, wrote, photographed, edited and
directed ``Kestrel's Eye,'' has no recourse to narration or sounds
other than those that might be found where he filmed: the whirr and
rustle of wings and feathers, the chatter of the adult birds and
the clamor of their hungry offspring, a dog barking, the voices and
laughter and music that drift up from below. ``Kestrel's Eye'' is
something to see.

SUPPORTERS CONDEMN BEIJING'S CLAIM THAT JAILED U.S. SCHOLAR HAS
CONFESSED
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (nk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese government officials said Tuesday that a
U.S.-based scholar who has been in a Beijing prison for the last
six months has confessed to vague charges of providing confidential
information to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Song Yongyi, a research librarian at Dickinson College in
Carlisle, Pa., was in China collecting documents relating to his
specialty, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when he was detained
and imprisoned on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged on Dec. 24 with ``the purchase and illegal
provision of intelligence to foreigners,'' a charge that has
mystified academics here and in the United States, since original
documents from that tumultuous period in Chinese history are
readily available in street markets and circulate freely.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, a Foreign Ministry official
defended the government's case again Song and gave more details,
implying that Song had admitted to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present, Song has confessed what he has done and the
judicial department in China is now handling the case,'' said Zhu
Bangzao, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. Zhu noted that
Song had ``undermined China's national security'' by ``secretly
transferring abroad materials and documents'' weighing about 700
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Academics and lawyers involved in the case outside China reacted
angrily to the statement, saying that Song continues to maintain
his innocence and that the government was using word games to
pressure him to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese word ``gongren'' can be translated variously as
``confess'' ``admit'' or ``acknowledge.'' Legal advisers in the
case said that from the start, Song had admitted that he was in
China buying materials related to the Cultural Revolution but had
denied that these activities were in any way criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is totally misleading,'' said Jerome Cohen,
an expert on Chinese law who is a legal adviser in the case on
Song's behalf. ``As far as we know there has been no confession. He
has maintained for months that he's sent dozens and dozens of books
back _ that was his job and that would weigh 700 pounds. And we are
puzzled at the characterization of this material as `state
secrets.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Song was formally charged only with ``providing
confidential information to foreigners,'' a far less serious charge
than ``endangering national security'' or ``revealing state
secrets'' _ the terms used Tuesday to describe crimes that can
carry long prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The case is currently under review by the prosecutor's office,
which will either issue an indictment or dismiss the case for lack
of evidence. Last week the government said that Song's case would
move forward within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Tuesday, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., condemned the
Foreign Ministry statement. ``China has absolutely no credibility
in its claim that Yongyi Song confessed,'' Specter said in a
statement of his own, adding that any confession ``is suspect as
being coerced when he is held in detention for months without an
opportunity to confer with counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Song's family, lawyers and supporters have complained that he
has not yet been allowed to see a lawyer despite repeated requests,
a violation of China's criminal procedure code.
</P>
<P>
   David Strand, a historian and a colleague of Song at Dickinson
College, who has organized China scholars world-wide into a massive
letter writing campaign to secure Song's release, said Song's older
brother was permitted to visit him last week. At that time, Song
was ``very resolute in proclaiming his innocence'' and ``in no
respect acknowledged any guilt,'' said Strand.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   China scholars frequently travel here to obtain materials like
those presumably collected by Song, who was still a Chinese citizen
at the time of his detention, but was scheduled to become an
American citizen in one month.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cultural Revolution is regarded as one of modern
China's greatest embarrassments _ Mao Zedong ordered schools
closed, intellectuals jailed and millions of urban youths sent off
to the countryside _ it has been long since officially been
declared a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural Revolution paraphernalia are widely available at street
markets and curio shops, including some letters, documents and
newspapers from that turbulent period.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's statement, the Foreign Ministry spokesman suggested
that Song had been doing more than collecting Cultural Revolution
material, noting that the material he collected dated from 1966 to
1982, ``far exceeding the period of the Cultural Revolution, which
he claimed to be studying.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cultural Revolution formally ended in 1976, a decade after
it was launched by Mao.

TRYING TO LURE SYRIANS BACK TO THE TABLE, BARAK PRAISES ASSAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel showered praise
on the Syrian president's character Tuesday, issuing a statement
seemingly aimed at luring the Syrians back to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
   As he did when he sought last summer to revive frozen relations
with Syria, Barak offered a public assessment that Syrian President
Hafez Assad is an honorable partner in peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a recent closed-door meeting with his security
advisers, the prime minister repeated his view that President Assad
is a strong leader, who is serious and trustworthy and honors his
word,'' said the statement from Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
   High-level peace talks were suspended after two rounds last week
when Israel refused to meet Syria's precondition of promising in
writing a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, to the borders
that existed on June 4, 1967. Barak has said that such promises
cannot be made without commitments from Syria on Israel's demands
for security arrangements and the normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
   When the third round of talks was canceled, both sides said they
would send lower-level negotiators to the Washington area this week
to lay the groundwork for the resumption of higher-level
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel said Tuesday that its negotiators would not depart on
Tuesday night as expected, and the Syrian negotiators apparently
canceled their trip as well.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, an Israeli soldier was killed in southern Lebanon
when guerrillas fired a rocket at an Israeli military outpost near
the port city of Tyre, Lebanese security officials said. It was the
first Israeli casualty since last August, and the Hezbollah
guerrilla forces claimed responsibility.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak has pledged to withdraw Israeli troops from southern
Lebanon by July, preferably in the context of a peace agreement
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's political and military leaders continued to present the
lull in negotiations with Syria as an expected complication in a
difficult process that they still expect to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Malka, the army's intelligence chief, told a parliamentary
committee Tuesday that Assad was committed to seeing the talks
through to a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the tourism minister and a
former army chief of staff who accompanied Barak to the talks
earlier this month, said both sides wanted peace, and described the
interruption of negotiations as ``tactical.''
</P>
<P>
   And, starting his second term as American ambassador to Israel
on Tuesday, Martin Indyk talked about what he said were expected
``ups and downs in any process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain hopeful, because we believe that both sides are
committed to achieving a comprehensive peace this year, that it
will be possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli radio and television reports said Barak would not go to
Davos, Switzerland, this weekend to meet with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, and President Clinton. They said the leaders'
schedules did not mesh, since Clinton's only free time would be
during the Jewish Sabbath, when Barak would not participate in
business meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the Palestinians' expression of disappointment,
Barak's office said, ``The complex problems of the Middle East will
not be solved on the ski slopes of Switzerland.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's no stopping Dainon Sidney's Excellent
Adventure this week, other than answering for weather that feels
more like Anchorage than Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A former Atlanta area high school player, the Tennessee Titans
cornerback is warmed by the familiarity of the surroundings for
Super Bowl XXXIV. Tuesday morning, five days from the most
ballyhooed event in sports, Sidney was on the floor of the Georgia
Dome addressing thousands of media representatives. Tuesday
afternoon, he started preparations for Sunday's game against the
St. Louis Rams. Tuesday night, Dainon took his mother out to dinner
and visited the new Riverdale, Ga., house he bought for her.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a starting assignment, what more could he desire?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Sidney said. ``It's amazing to know you played
like 15 minutes down the road and now you're playing in the Super
Bowl with 50 million people around the world watching you. . . . I
don't think it really has sunk in yet. This is what you dream
about. This is what you play your whole career for.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a shared thrill. Bill Kennedy, his former coach at
Riverdale High School in suburban Atlanta, can't quite believe it,
either. Riverdale could not brag of an NFL player before Sidney's
arrival with the Titans, much less one playing for a Super Bowl
ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coach comes to a lot of kids,'' said Kennedy, who retired
four years ago, ``but rarely do you get one in a Super Bowl. It's a
great reflection on him, great for when I was at Riverdale, and
it's a great success story for his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has followed the Titans on television, because so many
Atlanta Falcons telecasts were blacked out this year. In
Tennessee's game against Atlanta in Nashville, Sidney intercepted
two passes and recovered a fumble. Against Jacksonville in Sunday's
AFC title game, the 6-foot, 180-pounder made five tackles as the
left cornerback behind starter Denard Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney showed early indications of such instincts in high
school, but he didn't reach his potential until college, first at
East Tennessee State, then at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was with is, he was almost kind of like a young
colt,'' Kennedy said. ``Real gangly, but with great instincts and
great natural ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy wants at least to stop by Georgia Tech this week, where
the Titans are working out, to say hello to his former player.
Sidney said Tuesday, ``I still hold him in high regard. It meant a
lot to me that he congratulated me after I was drafted (in the
third round in 1998).'' Sidney also wants to make contact during
the week with coach Don Shockley, a former Riverdale High School
assistant and now the head man at North Clayton, just south of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   On the field for most third-down passing situations, Sidney made
one start this year against Cleveland, after Walker was hurt in the
Cincinnati game. If the Super Bowl works out for Sidney, Riverdale
will be jumping Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive nature of the St. Louis offense is to his liking.
``My whole deal is, just don't give them any space,'' Sidney said.
``They're not the biggest receivers, but they're real fast, shifty
off the line. I want to make sure I don't give them anything early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rams play the type of offense, being a DB, you like to
play,'' he said. ``I mean, they challenge you. They make you step
up. Either you step up or you get embarrassed. You got to do one or
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling his family's ticket requests could be more painful.
The players get two complimentary tickets each and may buy a
limited amount. ``I've got hundreds of relatives in Atlanta,''
Sidney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom is taking care of it,'' he said. ``How many? I don't
know. Everything is payroll-deducted. It could wind up to be a
lot.''

 &HT;    Titans say pass bread and butter
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Titans tight end Frank Wycheck seems to be getting all
of the breaks lately.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the NFL
playoffs, Wycheck's cross-field lateral sparked an improbable
kickoff return for a touchdown. His side-arm pass to receiver Kevin
Dyson survived an instant-replay review and lifted the Titans to a
22-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck, 28, played another significant role in Sunday's AFC
Championship Game in Jacksonville's Altell Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Wycheck caught a pass from quarterback
Steve McNair but fumbled at the Jaguars' 1-yard line. Jacksonville
recovered the ball inches from the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Titans, their defense turned the miscue into
a safety and a 19-14 lead. Then, the Titans' Derrick Mason fielded
the ensuing free kick and returned it 80 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   So, Wycheck's fumble turned into nine points for the Titans in
Tennessee's 33-14 victory, which clinched a spot in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to joke about it, because it really hurt me that I
coughed it up down there,'' Wycheck said. ``If we'd lost the game,
I was prepared to take that loss on me. After the lateral (against
Buffalo), I stood up in front of the team and got patted on the
back. I was going to take this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck, a seven-year pro, was an integral part of the Titans'
offense long before his postseason heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck, 6 feet 3 and 250 pounds, was voted to the Pro Bowl for
the second time in 1999. He led the Titans in receiving and
finished the regular season with 69 catches for 641 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck finished second among all NFL tight ends in receptions,
trailing only the Kansas City Chiefs' Tony Gonzalez, who had 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think defenses are so caught up with stopping (running
back) Eddie George and containing (McNair) that the tight ends are
able to get in the seam and get open,'' Wycheck said. ``That's just
our offense. It's our bread and butter.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from Wycheck's college career at Maryland. The
Terrapins' career leading receiver, Wycheck left school in 1992
with one year of eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck made the decision after Terps coach Mark Duffner phased
out the tight end and switched to a ``run-'n'-shoot'' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck was drafted in the fourth round by Washington, was moved
to fullback in his second season and then was waived by the
Redskins in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans claimed him for the $100 transaction fee. Wycheck has
led the team in receiving the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does what he's supposed to do. He gets to the right place
at the right time,'' Titans tackle Brad Hopkins said. ``He's not
some tenacious mauler or something, but that's not his forte. His
forte is getting the ball in his hands and running after the
catch.''

MY DAUGHTER'S IMAGINARY (AND HANDSOME) BOYFRIEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 5:30 p.m. Sunday. I was watching a football game, eating
Domino's pizza. I was washing it down with a tall, frosty glass of
water, as far as you know. Suddenly, I sat up, frightened. My
daughter, 5, had been quiet for 15 consecutive minutes. Something
was up. Five-year-olds are not quiet unless asleep or scheming.
</P>
<P>
   She walked in, smiling. Smirking, really.
</P>
<P>
   What did you break? I asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing. I just need some nice pants and a pretty shirt and a
tie and a jacket out of your closet, Daddy. Would you get them for
me right now?''
</P>
<P>
   I explained to her that, if she wanted to play dress-up, she
should use Mommy's clothes, lest someone from Child Protective
Services show up unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Daddy. They're not for me. They're for Tommy. He's one of
my Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, Tommy. He's one of the Power Rangers, the
mighty-morphers themselves. My daughter, a Type-A, 21st-century
gal, does not just have one imaginary friend, she has all the Power
Rangers, any one of whom could kick Harvey the Rabbit's furry tail.
Apparently Tommy needed some haberdashery. I told her I'd be happy
to help, and we headed toward the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure they're ironed, Daddy. I want him to look handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   I stopped. Did I hear that right?
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to look so handsome, Daddy. Like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you say, ``aaawww,'' realize that she was just playing me
for a fool _ a) I'm not handsome, and she knows it; and b) she's
just trying to distract me from the fact that she has
surreptitiously been taught the concept of ``handsome''!
</P>
<P>
   Honey, why do you want him to look handsome?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're going on a date.''
</P>
<P>
   If I told you my heart stopped for four full seconds, you
wouldn't believe me, so I won't tell you. Thinking fast, I searched
the house, looking for my wife, so I could blame her. She was
nowhere to be found, so I gave in and provided my daughter with the
clothing she requested. I aimed to find out just what she thought a
date would entail. She laid my shirt, pants, sports coat and tie
neatly on the bed. She then put in a videotape _ something
romantic, as I recall, something like Iron Giant or Clever Little
Piglet _ opened up two SnackWell's fruit bars (blueberry) and
settled in for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   By now, I was talking to myself. She's only 5! What does this
mean? Is this harmless? Will she start real dating too early _
i.e., before the age of 24? Are boarding schools as bad as I've
heard? Finally, Mom showed up. I explained to her the severity of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, how sweet,'' she said. ``Tommy is cute, you know. He's the
one with a ponytail.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you agree with my wife (now known around the house as
``mine enemy'') and start claiming I was overreacting simply
because fathers have a hard time dealing with their little girls
growing up, think about if this had happened with a boy. What if we
had a little nipper and he started pretending that he was getting
ready for a date? He would pick up his play cell phone, call up his
imaginary homeys, start talking about, ``Dude, did you see that
fine Angelica playing with the other Rugrats today? Yeah, well,
guess who's goin' out with Miss Thang? Dude, the answer is so me.''
Then he'd ask Mom if he could borrow ``something in a black mini''
for his girlfriend, because he wants her to look ``like she's all
that.'' Then he'd ask Dad if he could borrow the Trans Am.
</P>
<P>
   Not so pretty, is it moms? Maybe next time, you won't think a
man in a white Power Rangers suit and a ponytail is so harmless.
Maybe next time you'll join me in my crusade against all boys cute
and/or handsome.

BORN-AGAIN PROMOTER OPENS CHRISTIAN ``BAR'' IN DALLAS' DEEP ELLUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Russell Hobbs moved from his suburban home in
Richardson, Texas, and took up residence in Deep Ellum, back when
Deep Ellum was street after street of unkempt warehouses, abandoned
buildings and unrealized dreams on Dallas' downtown fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Then in his late 20s, Hobbs was struck with a vision: To open a
club that would cater to left-of-center artistic types _ bands,
poets, artists and actors who didn't fit in with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   A road paver for Deep Ellum's growth as a nightlife playground,
Hobbs' first club, Theatre Gallery, was born in 1984 on Commerce
Street, and it was the site for everything from underground rock
shows to plays to poetry readings. The same went for his second
club, the Prophet Bar, which booked similarly insurgent
performances.
</P>
<P>
   So much has changed since then, Hobbs says, and so much has not.
</P>
<P>
   Today, years after Hobbs found Christ and turned away from Deep
Ellum for a life of seclusion in East Texas, the 41-year-old
entrepreneur is back in Dallas pursuing his original mission: To
spotlight artists who don't exactly fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Although his goal hasn't changed, his agenda has.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave me the vision to open a new place,'' says Hobbs, who
says he found Christianity 13 years ago via a born-again janitor.
``The vision has to do with our society and how it's segregated and
departmentalized. The Door stands between two of those
establishments, the church and the secular bar world. It's for all
the people who don't fit into either.''
</P>
<P>
   Opened by Hobbs in May 1998, The Door is an all-ages venue
catering to _ but, Hobbs points out, not limited to _ Christian
artists. In Deep Ellum's maze of bars, live-music venues,
restaurants and pretty-people meat markets, The Door wasn't
expected to survive. Christian-rock venues generally struggle
anyway, but one planted on the outskirts of Deep Ellum (the club
sits away from the congestion of the area) seemed destined for
failure.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, not only has The Door survived, it has thrived,
supported by a circle of fans and bands that, as Hobbs says,
consider it a middle ground between church life and club life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's probably the best thing to happen to Christian
music in a long time,'' says Chuck Dennie, lead singer for By the
Tree, a popular Fort Worth Christian rock-pop band that plays the
venue once a month and has released two CDs, Shoot Me Down and
Passion for Jesus. ``It's a place where Christians can go, but it's
not necessarily threatening to non-Christians. Offering something
like that, I think that's the best thing a Christian can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs, naturally, agrees. In fact, he says places like The Door,
where young people can mingle and worship without the pressures of
church, are the wave of the future. ``Young people wanna talk about
God and life every night, not just from 10 to 12 on Sunday,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying The Door's popularity with an
across-the-board crowd. On a recent Friday night, the club is
jammed. Young Christians and non-Christians, sporting Seventeen and
GQ fashions, mix and mingle, talking about guys, girls and God. A
17-year-old girl in a skirt buzzes by, clutching the phone number
of a cute guy. Two teens are huddled at a corner table, quietly
sipping soft drinks and talking about the latest disc from Jars of
Clay, a national Christian-rock band; some even smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing these two worlds has been an uphill battle. Hobbs says
the club has taken flack, ironically, from the people it's trying
to attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We catch criticism from the Christians who say, `Why do you
let people smoke in here? Why do you let non-Christian bands play?'
'' he says. ``Then we catch flack from non-Christians, because
people who come here wanna talk about God, and they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't understand what we're doing,'' Hobbs says.
``People are selfish _ they wanna go to a show and have it just be
perfect for them. There's a greater cause going on at The Door.
What we do is desegregate religious stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs says that newcomers to The Door will be surrounded by
religion, but not by the strict standards of organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big churches have the guy in the robe that controls everyone.
My values are so different,'' he says. ``I don't look up to the
pope. Who I do look up to is Jesus, and he doesn't care about
superficial things, if you have tattoos or piercings or colored
hair. He looks at your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs didn't always feel this way. When he opened his first two
clubs, he admits he was absorbed in rock 'n' roll's typical,
decadent lifestyle. ``Oh, yeah, I smoked pot every day, drank every
night, had sex with different girls,'' he says. ``The world was my
playground.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hobbs was born again in 1987, his Prophet Bar began to live
up to its name. Instead of hard-core punk acts, there were
Christian rockers. Drugs and drinking were replaced by Bible
studies and praying.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, Deep Ellum was quickly turning into a commercial
zone, and the real-estate pressure for Hobbs to conform the Prophet
to the area's changing face was more than he could take. So he
bailed and left for East Texas, where he spent the next several
years finding himself and his true calling.
</P>
<P>
   His true calling, he says, was opening The Door.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I haven't changed at all,'' Hobbs says of his
two lives as a club owner. ``I was real passionate and visionary
then, and I'm that way now. But now the biggest reward doesn't have
to do with me. The biggest reward is seeing the people whose lives
have changed because of us, seeing the fruits of our labor pay off
and seeing lives change for the better.''

 &HT;    Rams will concentrate on shutting down McNair
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The game plan from St. Louis isn't expected to arrive
until today. The Rams' defensive unit already knows what it will
say: Snare McNair.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans' double-threat quarterback poses as much of
a threat, if not more, with his ability to make plays on the run
than as a passer. And no matter what defense St. Louis is in,
keeping track of where Steve McNair is and what he might do will be
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important to keep track of him,'' middle
linebacker London Fletcher said. ``He hurt us in the first game (in
Week 7) running the ball. We have to account for him at all times,
as a runner and a passer. But you've got to almost worry about the
run more than the pass. That's where he's been killing teams.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair had only 36 yards on 12 carries in the Titans' 24-21
victory against the Rams, but he gained 10 on a touchdown run that
put Tennessee ahead, 21-0. When he tucked the ball away, the St.
Louis sideline held its breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's dangerous,'' cornerback Todd Lyght said. ``When he
makes up his mind to take off, he's like a running back. It's a
tough chore against him, because you've got to defend your receiver
but also worry about him taking off. It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It's especially difficult, because there is no real formula for
containing McNair, Pro Bowl defensive lineman D'Marco Farr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a defensive lineman, it's frustrating,'' Farr said. ``You
want to pin your ears back and go after the quarterback on third
down. But with this guy, if you get too wide, leave your lanes,
he's gone, right up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is right where Fletcher starts out on every play. It might
not be far-fetched that Fletcher act as the designated
McNair-stopper on passing plays. Anything to limit McNair's
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game plan hasn't gotten here yet, so I don't know what
it's going to say,'' Fletcher said. ``But I know it has to include
him, what we're going to do with him. I'm out there to make plays;
that's it. So if I have to make a play on him, I take it as a
challenge to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams spent much of Tuesday's Media Day at the Georgia Dome
talking about their lives, their trek to the Super Bowl _ almost
anything. And for the defensive players, it almost always came back
to McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steve McNair runs the ball,'' Fletcher said, ``he's not
looking to go down. He's looking to score. He's a big-time threat.
Got to pay attention to him. And when you get a chance to get a
lick on him, you've got to get a good lick.''
</P>
<P>
   Having played against McNair once this season and the San
Francisco 49ers' mobile Steve Young through the years, the veterans
of the Rams' defense use their previous experiences as learning
tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``McNair is like Steve Young,'' Farr said. ``He'll make a play
with his legs. He's not afraid to run. You know what? It's almost
like he's excited about running. He puts it away and acts like a
running back. He's not afraid to take a hit. He's always attacking.
We have to attack back.''

HOSPITAL RAID MAY CAUSE BACKLASH AGAINST BURMESE REFUGEES IN
THAILAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RATCHABURI, Thailand _ On their hijacked bus, the 10 Burmese
gunmen squabbled about where they wanted to go to take hostages.
Then, the driver said, they wanted to give some hitchhikers a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Once they chose to seize a hospital here, along with 800
hostages, one of the nurses said, the gunmen seemed unsure what to
do, banging with rifle butts on locked doors where patients
cowered, then wandering off.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours after their adventure began, this strange and
inept band was dead, shot by Thai troopers who stormed the hospital
just before dawn Tuesday and freed hundreds of traumatized but
unharmed patients, doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, in the sunbaked courtyard, the troopers displayed the
gunmen's bodies, wrapped in bloody white sheets. The twin
12-year-old boys who lead their ragtag band of ethnic Karen
fighters were not among them, apparently having sat out the raid
despite their claims of invulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The goals of the raid were a bit unclear: medical treatment and
some sort of safe haven for their rebel comrades inside Myanmar,
the former Burma, just across the border from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Its result was a disaster for the cause of Burmese dissidents
and refugees who have taken shelter in Thailand by the tens of
thousands in the last decade: The Thais were furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thai government will have to review its policies,'' Deputy
Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra said. ``Maybe it is time for
Thailand to re-evaluate our foreign policy toward Burma. There are
a lot of issues to be considered, such as illegal migration and the
supervision of refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry's spokesman, Don Pramudwinai, said: ``We have, up
to now, always based our treatment of these ethnic groups on
humanitarian grounds. We may have to sit down with other agencies
to review whether there would be any change in this policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since a military junta took power in Myanmar after a violent
crackdown in 1988, thousands of students and political dissidents
have flooded into refugee encampments just inside Thailand, as well
as into Bangkok itself.
</P>
<P>
   The camps have been swelled by refugees from fighting between
the Burmese military and a welter of ethnic separatist
insurgencies. More than 100,000 people now fill an archipelago of
camps up and down the 1,000-mile border. In addition, as many as
one million Burmese work illegally in Thailand, mostly as fishermen
and construction laborers, the targets of periodic campaigns to try
to send them home.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly impulsive raid on the hospital in this city 75
miles west of Bangkok has put all those people at risk of a new
surge of Thai nationalism. Radio airwaves were filled Tuesday with
demands to protect the country's borders and to expel refugees and
illegal workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly unfortunate that there may be a backlash on the
very people that are fleeing this violence, the refugees,'' said
Debbie Stothard, an expert on the refugees who campaigns for
democratic rights in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   She said the hostage-takers, whose fundamentalist Christian band
calls itself God's Army, were the products of a half century of
guerrilla warfare that has created a strange and brutal world in
the isolated jungles of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have not had access to a good education
and for whom violence is a way of life,'' she said. ``It never
occurs to them that mounting a siege on a hospital is actually
wrong. They have not lived in a world where detaining someone with
force is actually unacceptable. It's as though they came from a
different planet and that planet is ruled by the Burmese military
regime and their values.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks leading up to the raid, the small army of no
more than 200 fighters, under its young leaders Johnny and Luther
Htoo, had been fighting for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   With the Burmese military closing in, 1,000 new refugees had
fled across the border, and the Thais, to keep the fighters from
crossing too, had begun to add their own artillery fire to that of
the Burmese.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-takers might have thought their raid would be easy.
In October, Thailand took a soft approach when five student
fighters from another group took over Myanmar's Embassy in Bangkok.
After just one night's occupation, the Thais had let them board a
helicopter back to the border, where they found refuge with God's
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Tuesday that two of the embassy hostage-takers
were among those killed in the hospital seige.
</P>
<P>
   When the group hijacked a blue public bus on its route along the
Thai-Myanmar border on Monday morning, they first wanted to go to a
different border town, according to the driver, who gave his name
only as Eed.
</P>
<P>
   Then some wanted to drive all the way to Bangkok but were
persuaded that this would be too difficult. Finally they chose the
Ratchaburi Provincial Hospital, a sprawling complex of buildings
that is very difficult to secure.
</P>
<P>
   They did it all on Thailand's Armed Forces Day, virtually daring
the military to take aggressive action against them.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, according to a pediatric nurse, Aphai Teadeangphat,
26, the gunmen did not seem to have a clear plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The came banging on our door with their guns,'' she said as
she sat weeping with relief Tuesday morning in the hot courtyard of
the hospital. ``We had 29 children inside, with their parents. We
were so afraid. We just got down on the floor and sat there
listening to them. We refused to open the door, so they went
away.''

AMID POLITICS AND PROTESTS, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT TRIAL REOPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct time element in 1st graf; Tuesday is correct)  
 (HLW)  
 By SETH MYDANS

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The sexual misconduct trial of Malaysia's
opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, reopened on Tuesday in Kuala
Lumpur after a two-month recess, accompanied by the handful of
shouting protesters, the legal gamesmanship and the political acid
attacks that have made it a dispiriting spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were adjourned for a day, almost as soon as they
began, because Anwar's lawyers said he needed more time to study
his passport and diaries to establish his alibi against charges of
sodomy that could send him to prison for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But before he left the dock, Anwar resumed his verbal war with
his former mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, contending that
there was a ``high-level conspiracy'' among prominent politicians
to ruin him.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the trial it was a mild accusation. Anwar has
in the past accused the government of corruption, gambling and even
involvement in murder.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 53, was deputy prime minister and heir apparent until
Mahathir, 74, accused him of being morally unfit, fired him, and
had him arrested in September 1998. In a first trial that ended
last year, Anwar was sentenced to six years in prison for abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, despite much tumult and recrimination, Malaysian
politics has moved forward without Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently to remove Anwar from the public eye, his trial was
adjourned in advance of a parliamentary election on Nov. 29 that
began the reshaping of post-Anwar political power blocs.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's ruling coalition retained its two-thirds majority and
the opposition party formed by Anwar's wife fared poorly. But the
prime minister lost significant support among the ethnic Malay
majority and the post-election period has been a time of
score-settling and political arrests.
</P>
<P>
   No one has replaced Anwar as a full-fledged No. 2 to Mahathir,
and politics is being roiled by arrests and jockeying for position.
The jockeying is expected to intensify in advance of a meeting
later this year to choose the leader of the ruling party, the
United Malays National Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mahathir has made surprise his trademark, most political
analysts expect him to seek and to retain the party leadership, and
thus the leadership of the country. It is the race to be his deputy
as party leader that is already growing hot.
</P>
<P>
   A leading candidate is Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who replaced Anwar
as deputy prime minister, but has not yet won full second-string
status by gaining the position of deputy party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts in Malaysia say that Badawi's attempt to
overcome a too-nice-a-guy image has led in part to a political
crackdown that is under way now.
</P>
<P>
   Four political figures have been arrested this month for
sedition, and the editor of the most prominent pro-government
newspaper, the New Straits Times, has been removed, apparently for
being insufficiently enthusiastic in his political reportage.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests drew sharp criticism from a State Department
spokesman in Washington, James Foley, who called them a
``transparent and cynical attempt to intimidate government
opponents and stifle legitimate political discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said:
``The fact that only critics are being arrested suggests that the
law is being used as a tool to further political ends.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Abdullah responded in the nationalistic tone favored by
Mahathir. ``Why are they being smart alecks in questioning our
country's laws?'' he said. ``There is no law of the jungle in our
country. We have democratic laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests include Anwar's chief lawyer, Karpal Singh, a
prominent opposition figure in his own right, who was arrested for
remarks he made at the trial. This drew sharp criticism from
lawyers both within and outside the country, who said a lawyer's
defense of his client should be protected from legal attack.
</P>
<P>
   Karpal added to the multiplying layers of accusations on Tuesday
by saying that the attorney general should be held in contempt of
court for pressing the sedition charge against him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also arrested this month was the deputy president of the new
party led by Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah. The deputy president, Marina
Yusoff, was charged with sedition for saying in a campaign speech
that the ruling party was the ``source'' of race riots in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the editor and printer of an opposition newspaper,
Harakah, were charged with sedition for printing the remarks of
another opposition party member who talked about a supposed
conspiracy involving the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's hand was nowhere to be seen in the arrests. He was on
vacation.

 &HT;    Pass rush boosts spirit of St. Louis
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kevin Carter had two destinations in mind all season _
Atlanta and Maui. He's here now, and he's going there.
</P>
<P>
   A season of personal accomplishment helped bring team success,
and the St. Louis Rams' defensive end became one of the NFL's best
pass-rushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the kind of year I envisioned,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Carter had prophetic words. ``If you lead the
league in sacks, they can't rightfully keep you out of the Pro
Bowl. That's what I intend to do this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did, with 17, making him a quarterback's most-feared
vision. ``Once he sees that the quarterback still has the ball in
his hands, it's like a steak,'' coach Dick Vermeil said. ``He's
going after it to take a bite out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's effective manuevers _ especially a speedy power move
inside _ make passing against the Rams a less-than-pleasant chore.
If he doesn't get to the quarterback or pressure him, the
double-team attention he has earned opens a lane for a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Carter's got a chance to be the best defensive end in
the NFL, to dominate at the position for the next four or five
years,'' said Charley Armey, Rams vice president for player
personnel. ``He's got quickness, strength, power, explosion,
desire, intelligence. He's the total package.''
</P>
<P>
   His effective play at the line of scrimmage had gone
underappreciated in the past. He had 12 sacks in 1998 but was left
off the Pro Bowl squad. The Rams were 4-12, which probably affected
his consideration. With Carter anchoring a defensive unit that has
gone virtually unnoticed amid the team's offensive spectacle, St.
Louis rose to the top of the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning brings attention,'' Carter said. ``I've had a good
year, the kind of year I expected. My personal success couldn't
have come at a better time. We're winning, and I feel a part of it.
It's the perfect combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter did not have the perfect combination for ultimate success
when he arrived in the NFL as a first-round pick from Florida in
1995. He was too small at 275 pounds to consistently win interior
tussles with 300-pound offensive linemen. But he has beefed up with
muscle and raised his weight to 291 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his mixture of strength, speed and tenacity have made him a
juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   The key to his status? ``Just experience,'' he said. ``The
longer you play, the more you know. I've gained poise and maturity.
There's no replacement for it.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps that Carter has fellow linemen D'Marco Farr and
Grant Wistrom applying similar heat to the quarterbacks. Farr made
the Pro Bowl, and Wistrom's future seems to be there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can wear a player down,'' said Wistrom, who had 6 1/2 sacks
from left end. ``I tend to get stronger and into a rhythm, and I'm
a better player in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The better Carter and Co. rush the passer, the better the Rams'
defense. And Carter considers it his responsibility to get everyone
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin gets such a great push up front that the quarterback
always has to be aware of him,'' cornerback Todd Lyght said. ``That
makes him sometimes hurry his throws, which helps us in the
secondary. At the same time, if we have good coverage, it gives
Kevin and the guys extra time to get to the quarterback.''

 &HT;    Matthews finally arrives
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He is an offensive machine that keeps on ticking. Yet,
he has never scored a point, and that's a record for a man who has
played 264 games, which is also a record for offensive linemen in
the NFL. He has gained thousands of yards without touching the
football, usually under such names as Earl Campbell, Eddie George
and Mike Rozier, who couldn't have done it without him.
</P>
<P>
   He probably could have hung around just doing the long snapping,
but he didn't want to be one of those guys who never got his
uniform dirty. He has been so good at what he does that Jerry
Glanville calls him ``the greatest offensive lineman who ever
played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks the part of what he does for a living, hairy arms,
bulging biceps, an ample midriff, but not fat, and a wondrous
attitude. It was best illustrated at the tedious Media Day exercise
in the Georgia Dome, where he was planted on a covered podium fit
for an Egyptian monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, did Bruce Matthews prepare for his first Super Bowl, after
17 seasons. That's still two seasons short of his brother, Clay,
who checked out after 1996 spent with the Falcons. This, of course,
will set off a furious research into the Matthews family genes.
</P>
<P>
   Their football history can be traced back to the campus about
two miles away, where Clay Matthews Sr. was a tackle on two of
Bobby Dodd's bowl teams in the late `40s. Then he played a few
seasons with San Francisco, then became a transient manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Raleigh, and we lived in North Carolina three
times, and California and Wisconsin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional lineman, Bruce Matthews now has become a
transient as well, not altogether to his taste. He thought he would
always be a Houston Oiler, ``never thought of going to another
team.'' Instead, the team changed towns and names, for him, from
Houston to Tennessee, from Oilers to Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nashville was a hard sell for me. I wasn't too hot about that
move. We still live in Houston. It was two years before the family
finally moved up here for the season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years with no home field, with no home crowd, it wasn't
what it was cracked up to be.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk of the din in Adelphia Coliseum in Nashville; Matthews
has some news for them. ``I've heard dins before, and if you've
ever been to the Astrodome, you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   He never really thought of himself as a news item, before.
``Then when I broke Jackie Slater's record (for most games played
by an offensive lineman), people suddenly wanted to talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's not through yet. He still loves to play, and plans to
play some more, even with the knee that is giving him pain now.
``In lots of ways, I'm still a kid. But everything hurts a little
bit more than it used to. Sometimes in the locker room, I feel
old.''
</P>
<P>
   A glance at his coach can do that. He and Jeff Fisher were
teammates at Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   He has been blessed with a body able to absorb the pounding, and
he is not reluctant to thank God for that, and he speaks often of
him. He can quote from the Bible, line and verse, and did. And no
matter how many times the question was barked at him out of the
herd wielding those furry microphones on sticks, he handled it with
patience, very Job-like.
</P>
<P>
   Some of what he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has changed, but it's still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do in high school and college never changes. It just
gets bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buffalo game, that was just a freak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner this part is over, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll go along with that.

SHOCKING THE CULTURE: EXAMINING UNNERVING BOOKS, FILMS AND ART  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Movies are schools of vice and crime, offering trips to hell
for a nickel,'' a Cleveland minister wrote in 1910. In the next
decade the Ladies' Home Journal wondered, ``Does Jazz Put the Sin
in Syncopation?'' These dated entries in the culture war weren't so
funny at the time. They still act as warnings that today's
censorious critics of everything from Oliver Stone films to dung
art may have reason to feel sheepish tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   There are few such colorful statements in ``Culture Shock,'' a
bland four-part series whose illuminating moments are almost
entirely accidental. Each episode _ two will be shown Wednesday
night on PBS (Channel 13 in New York at 9), and two more next
Wednesday _ is about a work of art or genre that unnerved
mainstream society.
</P>
<P>
   It is no compliment to say the series is classroom-ready. The
first three installments _ on ``Huckleberry Finn,'' Edouard Manet's
painting ``Olympia,'' and the Hollywood Production Code _ are
methodical, even-handed, dull. Only the lively and thoughtful final
episode, ``The Devil's Music: 1920s Jazz,'' is a true television
film rather than an educational exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as in so many earnest documentaries with talking heads and
predictable visuals, ``Culture Shock'' can be formidable in spite
of itself. With a little digging, a viewer can discern provocative
ideas about vilified art of the past and draw enlightening
connections to the present. Beneath the surface it suggests how
frequently censorship has been and remains motivated by class or
race.
</P>
<P>
   The episode on ``Huck Finn'' focuses on a mother in Tempe,
Ariz., who asked the school board to remove the book from the
required-reading list. The report is most shocking in its
familiarity: how can that still be happening? Both the mother and
her teen-age African-American daughter are clearly anguished by the
language Twain used to refer to the slave character Jim. Yet their
literal-minded reading of the novel confuses Twain's satiric attack
on slavery with racism itself. Their comments inadvertently point
out a huge omission in education: even this reasoned, intelligent
mother has not been taught to think critically, to go beyond the
actual words.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist David Bradley incisively addresses the Tempe
student's plea that the book hurt her feelings. He says: ``If the
word `nigger' did not have meaning today, we wouldn't care if it
was in `Huckleberry Finn.' The hurt is that it still does have
meaning. The hurt is that what happens on the playground is
reflected in the book, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes what may be the most crucial distinction in any
discussion of banned work: Art that reflects social injustice and
vile behavior is not the cause of it. That distinction is still
conspicuously missing from most recent discussions of violent
movies and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's observation leaps out of the flat surface of ``Culture
Shock'' like an epiphany. Something similar happens in the
installment about ``Olympia,'' Manet's 1863 portrait of a nude
prostitute reclining languorously with a flower in her hair.
Despite its clever title, ``The Shock of the Nude'' concedes that
it was not nudity but realism that outraged French society.
</P>
<P>
   Here the fleeting but revealing comment comes when John Lithgow,
the narrator, says Manet shocked ``by depicting a working-class
woman as a rich courtesan and by elevating his subject matter to
the status of a grand Salon painting.'' The comment nods at a fact
social critics prefer to mask: Culture shock is often no more than
a violation of bourgeois values.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't even a glancing insight in the confused installment
on the Hollywood Production Code, instituted in 1934, banning sex,
drugs and generally any unpunished bad behavior on screen.
</P>
<P>
   This episode is the greatest waste, because movies are the most
influential genre the series deals with, their links to the present
most potent. The episode notes that in 1966 the Production Code was
replaced by today's MPAA movie ratings; now that would have been
worth grappling with.
</P>
<P>
   The movie ratings in turn became the model for the television
ratings, that jumble of letters in the corner of the screen. Both
offer guidelines so vague as to be laughable. The muddled
television ratings came from an impulse similar to the Production
Code's, as Hollywood producers fled from the threat of government
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   After all this dullness, the jazz in the background might have
been enough to enliven next week's final episode. But ``The Devil's
Music'' goes beyond that. (Each installment has different writers
and directors; the last was written, produced and directed by Maria
Agui Carter and Calvin A. Lindsay Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   It traces the African-American roots of jazz and observes how
the music's sexual charge scandalized society. It makes connections
between racism and attacks on jazz; in a jaw-dropping bit of film,
Duke Ellington is introduced at the Cotton Club as ``The greatest
living master of jungle music.'' It compares jazz to today's
attacked music forms, rap and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   The critic Michael Eric Dyson notes how jazz was adopted and
distorted by white musicians and points out the eerily perfect name
of the popular band leader Paul Whiteman, who replaced jazz
improvisation with bouncy syncopation and crowned himself the King
of Jazz. Jazz was effectively neutered and made safe for white
society. The historian Ann Douglas perceptively says that radio and
records brought black musicians into white homes where they would
never have been invited in real life.
</P>
<P>
   The episode does not strain to draw parallels between jazz and
rap. The broad outlines are strong enough: rooted in
African-American culture, rap is as unsettling to middle-class
America as jazz was.
</P>
<P>
   With its often violent lyrics and urban working-class roots, rap
creates a cultural fault line that is not as simple as black and
white. Addressing this complex intersection of race and class, the
series finally engages viewers in a conversation as vigorous as the
art it chronicles. Until then ``Culture Shock'' is a model of how
not to talk about disruptive art.

 &HT;    By Tim Tucker

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Larry Brown left his Atlanta home early one morning
last July, en route to the San Diego Chargers' training camp. Or so
he thought.
</P>
<P>
   The closest he got was the San Diego airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the Chargers when I landed, and they said, `There's
been a mix-up. You better talk to Mr. Beathard,' '' Brown said;
Bobby Beathard is the San Diego general manager. ``He told me,
`Sorry, we couldn't get in contact with you. But you've been
released. Do you want to go back home today or wait until
tomorrow?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brown re-checked his bags and returned to Atlanta on the next
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the cruel world of big-time sports.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Brown's rookie season in the NFL has taken a sharp turn
for the better. He is back home in Atlanta this week, a backup
tight end with the Tennessee Titans, getting ready for the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say which is crazier, how his season began or how
it is ending.
</P>
<P>
   He admittedly is dazed by it all: ``If there are any other
undrafted free-agent rookies who have played in a Super Bowl in
their hometown, on the same field where they played their last
college game, in the same season they were cut on the first day of
training camp _ golly, let me know if there's anyone else like
that, because that is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a star in football, basketball and baseball at Atlanta's
Crim High, then a four-year starter in football and a four-year
letterman in basketball at the University of Georgia. It was a
shock to him when he was not selected in last year's NFL draft.
Scouts cited concerns about an old knee injury and poor showings at
pre-draft workouts. Soon after the draft, Brown signed a free-agent
contract with the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   He attended two mini-camps, battled a quadriceps injury, never
even got to put on pads. And on that long flight back from San
Diego, he said, ``I doubted my ability for the first time in my
life. I had this slight question: Do I want to play? But soon I
looked in the mirror and said, `I'm too good not to play in the
NFL.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, he rededicated himself to workouts. Two weeks later,
he got a call from the Titans. Not the most promising employment
opportunity for a tight end, what with Pro Bowler Frank Wycheck and
veteran Jackie Harris on the roster. But Brown made the team and
eventually played _ both at TE and on special teams _ in seven
regular-season games and two playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coaches think he has a nice future. He believes that
the disappointments of the draft and the Chargers served him well.
``My size and athletic ability had taken me as far as they could. I
had to go back to the drawing board, hit the weights, get faster,
get more mentally sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly he's lining up Super Bowl tickets for his parents,
two sisters and other family members.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first odd turn in Brown's athletics career. He
holds a UGA record of sorts: most head coaches played for _ three
in basketball (Hugh Durham, Tubby Smith and Ron Jirsa) and two in
football (Ray Goff and Jim Donnan). ``Three football coaches,''
Brown corrected, ``if you count George Mason, who was my coach for
a day.'' He meant Glen Mason, who didn't stick around Athens much
longer than Larry Brown stuck around San Diego.

 &HT;    Hear no evil: Kentucky's Smith blocks out
 &HT;    criticism and does his job
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ Tubby Smith learned a lasting lesson in Rock
Hill, S.C. It was December 1995, his first season as Georgia's
coach, and the Bulldogs were playing at Winthrop College before a
sparse crowd. A few fraternity types were amusing themselves by
taunting Georgia players, most notably the powerfully built Carlos
Strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Carlos!'' one kept yelling. ``Where's your neck?''
</P>
<P>
   Taking up for his player, Smith turned to the hecklers and said,
``Why don't you just cheer for your team?'' His suggestion had, as
such suggestions will, the opposite effect. The verbiage grew
exponentially worse. And Smith realized, not for the first time,
that the only way to answer critics is not to answer, not ever.
</P>
<P>
   Today he hears nothing. ``I'm too old for that,'' Smith says.
``I block people out. People will chant things during games, and I
won't even hear it. If I heard everything people said, I wouldn't
last.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubby Smith has a job that encompasses what he calls ``the best
and worst things.'' He coaches basketball at Kentucky, a place that
cares about the sport with a passion that reaches mania. He has
taken Kentucky to the 1998 NCAA championship and has earned the
lasting admiration of his peers. He has not, however, placed
himself above criticism from his constituents. No Kentucky coach
ever does.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is,'' says Jack Blanton, the school's vice
chancellor for administration. ``If you lose two in a row, the end
of the world is here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the cusp of Y2K, the end of the Big Blue was reportedly nigh.
Dealt a wicked pre-conference schedule, the callow Wildcats lost
four of their first eight games. Such was the perceived
dissatisfaction that the Rev. Louis Coleman, who heads the Justice
Resource Center in Louisville, felt moved to wonder if the school,
once seen as exclusionary toward black basketball players, was
doing enough to back Smith, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an advantage,'' says P.G. Peeples, president of the
Lexington Urban League. ``I know (athletics director) C.M. Newton,
and I have no reason to believe that C.M. Newton has ever wavered
in his support of coach Smith. At the same time, you cannot
discount that there were some people who didn't want him there for
whatever reason and who, given the small window of opportunity,
jumped in.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman and Peeples met with Newton. Smith sat in. The
university made no public statement of support, but Newton made it
clear that the coach was under no in-house pressure and never would
be. ``Any of us,'' Peeples says, ''likes to know that we've got
people behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, the Wildcats are 13-5, having won nine of 10
games. After dropping from the Associated Press Top 25 before
Christmas, they are ranked No. 16. They won at Vanderbilt on
Saturday, giving Smith his 200th victory in nine seasons as a
Division I coach. The sniping has been all but muted, leading some
peopleto wonder if there had been all that much to begin with and
if it ever had been racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever the Kentucky coach is,'' says Larry Ivy, the senior
associate AD and a university employee for 30 years, ``if he loses
four games in December, he's going to be criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   Marta McMackin, administrative assistant to the last four
Kentucky coaches, reports that Smith has received ``maybe a
half-dozen'' race-baiting letters in his three years on the job.
Joe B. Hall, who is white, used to get more negative mail in a
week, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think race was a factor at all,'' says Saul Smith,
Tubby's son and the Wildcats' point guard. ``This university is
bigger than that. It's just that people are going to get on you if
you're not winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul Smith has become a Bluegrass flash point. ore than a few
locals want to see J.P. Blevins starting instead. Consider this
letter, written by Cliff Barker of Morehead, Ky., that ran in
Sunday's Lexington Herald-Leader: ``Saul Smith . . . is not
Kentucky basketball talent. We, the basketball fans of Kentucky,
welcome Tubby Smith with open arms. He could have very well become
one of the greatest coaches in Kentucky had he not tried to cram
his son down our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are the coach's son, the worst thing you can be is pretty
good. If you are leading the nation in scoring, as Pete Maravich
did at LSU for his dad, Press, your worth is evident. If you are
Chuckie Driesell, a Maryland reserve under his father, Lefty, you
don't play enough to do any harm. But if you are Saul Smith, a
serviceable guard on the nation's most scrutinized collegiate team,
your failings are made to seem glaring. This, too, is nothing new
at Kentucky. A decade ago, Sean Sutton faced a similar chorus of
disdain while playing under his father, Eddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine percent of UK fans are loyal,'' Saul Smith says.
``The other 1 percent are always going to find something to
complain about. There are crazy fans here who live and breathe
Kentucky basketball, but you've got to realize that it's just a
sport. I care passionately about it, but it's still just a sport.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where perspective is in short supply, a
disproportionate amount seems to have settled in the Smith
household. G.G. Smith, who played point guard for his father at
Georgia and who is teaching and working with the basketball program
at Lexington Catholic High, says about his brother: ``There's a lot
of pressure playing guard for Kentucky. . . . He's doing fine. I'm
proud of the way he has handled this.''
</P>
<P>
   And G.G.'s father? How is he handling whatever ``this'' might
be? ``He ignores it,'' G.G. Smith says. ``If you let it get to you,
you're going to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the equanimity with which Tubby Smith greeted the
December slump that Blanton, a member of the school's athletics
board since 1975, was amazed. ``He caught hell,'' Blanton says.
``People kept saying he should have been playing Blevins, that Saul
wasn't worthy. It was water off a duck's back. Tubby didn't react.
He didn't cancel the `Big Blue Line,' (the coach's call-in show).
He blithely ignored it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He separates what he needs to do from what people are
saying,'' Saul Smith says. ``He's here to help young men become
men, and he can't let the media or crticism impede his opportunity
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Tubby Smith says, it's not about him. ``This is the
people's program. It doesn't belong to me. The minute you lose
sight of that, you're through.'' He laughs. ``We all have egos, but
nobody's ego is big enough'' to outsize Kentucky basketball.
</P>
<P>
   On this cold night, Smith is sitting in Joe Bologna's, a
venerable restaurant three blocks from his office. He's eating a
meatball sandwich and paying no attention to the stares he gets
from other patrons. He might be the most famous person in the
Commonwealth, but he carries himself in such a way as to seem no
different from the guy at the next table. As Blanton says, ``He's
very comfortable being Tubby Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches have been changed by the adoration and acrimony
that comes with the Kentucky job. Smith seems no different from
when he was working in Athens and struggling to fill Stegeman
Coliseum. He speaks about his media commitments. ``When that
(radio) show is over, it's over,'' he says. ``That's not really
basketball. Basketball is out there on the court, coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls the last ``Bulldog Hotline'' he did before leaving
Georgia for Kentucky. A caller wanted to know if Georgia was going
to sign a big-time point guard. Never mind that the incumbent, G.G.
Smith, had two years of eligibility remaining and had led the
Bulldogs to a 24-9 season. ``I could have said, `You don't think
G.G.'s good enough?' '' Smith says. ``Instead, I just said, `I'll
certainly take that into consideration.' See, people have their
opinions. You're not going to change opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   So he doesn't waste time trying. He does his job his way, which
isn't quite the way his predecessor, Rick Pitino, did it, and it is
a source of some displeasure among fans and media. Bottom line,
however: Smith has won just as many NCAA titles as the sainted
Pitino. The line of unbroken success that Smith has traced from
Tulsa to Georgia to Kentucky has stamped him, as son Saul says,
``as one of the best, if not the best, coach in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Vanderbilt game, a less biased source spoke up. ``It's
amazing that the guy can win a national championship and a year or
two later people question who he should put on the floor,''
Commodores coach Kevin Stallings said. ``If I were (Smith), I'd be
telling someone to kiss my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't Tubby Smith's way. He doesn't seek out
confrontation. He doesn't assign malignant motives. ``If I started
doing that,'' he says, ``I'd be seeing every comment as racial. But
I try to look at the source. Why is somebody making a particular
statement? Probably because he loves Kentucky basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, does Tubby Smith. He laughs off a rumor, started on the
Internet, that he will replace Lenny Wilkens as the Hawks' coach at
season's end. ``He loves this atmosphere,'' Saul Smith says. The
controversy over Saul notwithstanding, Tubby Smith would love to be
able to coach a third son, Brian, a freshman at Lexington Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I not be be happy?'' Smith asks, spreading wide his
arms. ``I've got my family. I've got people around me that I
love.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hears only what he cares to hear. It's not a bad way to
go through life.

AFTER 13-MONTH SEARCH, CINCINNATI SYMPHONY HIRES NEW CONDUCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an unusual number of American orchestras agonizing over
whom to hire as their next music director _ besides the big guns in
Boston, New York and Philadelphia, second-tier orchestras in
Houston, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Indianapolis are searching _ one
of the older and more solid Midwestern orchestras has dropped off
the list. After scouting the field for 13 months, the 105-year-old
Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra announced Monday that Paavo Jarvi,
37, would become its music director in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvi (pronounced YAR-vee), who was born in Tallinn, Estonia,
and is now a U.S. citizen, made guest-conducting debuts with the
New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra last season
that were warmly reviewed. He is also the principal guest conductor
of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in England, and has
held positions in Stockholm and Malmo, Sweden. He will succeed
Jesus Lopez-Cobos, the orchestra's music director since 1986.
Lopez-Cobos reportedly told the orchestra in 1998 that he wanted to
expand his guest-conducting career, particularly in opera, and
would not renew his contract when it ended this season. But he
agreed to a one-year extension to allow the orchestra time to find
a new director, and will be taking an emeritus title. Lopez-Cobos
invited Jarvi to make his debut with the orchestra last February.
Since then he has conducted two more subscription weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A directorship is a long-term proposition,'' Jarvi said,
speaking from Atlanta where he was conducting Tuesday, ``so one has
to feel right about the chemistry, and about how you think you can
be useful to the organization. This orchestra, musically, is in
very good shape, and I think they are in the right place to go on
to the next level. Someone in Cincinnati told me that the orchestra
is one of the best-kept secrets in America. If that's the case, we
should make it less of a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvi studied at the Tallinn School of Music until he was 17,
when he moved to Philadelphia to study at the Curtis Institute of
Music. One of his conducting teachers at Curtis, Max Rudolf, was
the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony from 1958 to 1970.
His father, Neeme Jarvi, is the music director of the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra and has had a notably prolific recording career.
His brother, Kristjan Jarvi, is the assistant conductor of the Los
Angeles Philharmonic and leads the Absolute Ensemble, a new music
group, in New York. A sister, Maarika Jarvi, is a flutist living in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra is not quite the secret Jarvi's informants
suggest. It has a colorful history. Leopold Stokowski became its
music director with scant conducting experience in 1909 (he had
been a church organist in New York), and was hired by the
Philadelphia Orchestra three years later. Its past directors
include Eugene Ysaye, Fritz Reiner (who conducted for nine seasons)
Eugene Goosens, Thomas Schippers and Michael Gielen.
</P>
<P>
   During Lopez-Cobos' tenure, the orchestra made a series of
recordings for Telarc Records, which will apparently continue. (
Jarvi has also made nearly 20 discs for Virgin Classics.) With a
budget of $28 million, which its chairman, Peter Strange, said was
balanced, and an endowment of $90 million, it is among the 10
best-financed orchestras in the country. Among its problems,
though, has been a shrinking audience. Its home, the 125-year-old
Cincinnati Music Hall, was built as an opera house and has 3,417
seats. The average attendance at concerts, however, is just over
2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, for one, is betting that Jarvi can begin to turn things
around. ``We asked him the usual kinds of questions a board asks,''
he said, ``like, `How can we get more young people?' It was
thrilling to feel the energy in his suggestion that we try new
things and take some risks. He suggested thinking about concerts
not as a one-dimensional experience _ hearing music _ but as an
opportunity to offer other activities in the hall beforehand, for
example.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also relief in Cincinnati that the search committee is
out of a job. ``I think we felt a certain amount of urgency,''
Strange said. ``We couldn't ignore the competition. But we couldn't
let it guide our actions. In the end, our focus was on finding the
right match for us.''

<P>
   (Jack Gerson, 53, an antiwar activist in the 1960s, finds
himself part of a very different subculture today: the world of
genetic technology, where a booming market could turn his
intellectual pursuits into wealth he never expected.)
</P>
<P>
   The second time I was suspended from Stanford, it was
indefinitely, so I spent more than a decade doing political work.
Then in the late '70s, I switched to computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   I came to Silicon Valley in the early '80s to work at
Hewlett-Packard. I had done some talks about what I thought were
the dangers of the microelectronics revolution, with the weakening
of the labor movement. So, I thought it was a good opportunity to
see this phenomenon firsthand. But I ended up being swallowed by
it!
</P>
<P>
   Was I wrong, or did I sell out? I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   I came to the conclusion that there is a struggle between
people's cooperative and competitive sides. In the last several
decades, the competitive, individualistic side has been dominant.
</P>
<P>
   In November, I was offered stock options at Gene Logic, a
biotechnology company where I had been a short-term contract
consultant for a while. I can walk to work from home, which is
about 100 yards into Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   I have a Ph.D. in biostatistics from Berkeley, and I have worked
as a biostatistician and as a software engineer for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few different components to my job. I do
bioinformatics, which is a broad term for people who work with the
vast amount of data being generated now by the revolution in
genetics.
</P>
<P>
   During a typical day I spend time doing ``gene expression,''
analyzing what distinguishes the genetic signature of a normal
person from a diseased person. It's a bit like being the Red Queen
in ``Alice in Wonderland'' _ the faster you run, the faster you
have to go, because the technology is changing so much.
</P>
<P>
   Before November, I was paid straight by the hour. With stock
options, it's much better.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is currently selling at more than four times the
option price. It has quadrupled in the four weeks since I signed
up.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology has suddenly got hot. The biotechnology industry
is smaller and newer than the computer industry. Here, there is a
tremendous optimism among colleagues that there will be a lot of
breakthroughs during the next decade, that we are breaking through
barriers. That is very exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Before I signed up I got a call from a recruiter. I told her I
wouldn't consider anything unless it was well above $100,000. She
didn't think that would be any problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to attribute some special things to themselves when
they're suddenly making more money or are really successful in
business.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, I think when I was younger I could probably think
better. I just happen to be lucky now.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of it is being in the right place at the right
time.

MEET FREDDIE PRINZE JR.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAVONNA MAY-MONS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After numerous bit roles and big-screen performances, Freddie
Prinze Jr. has proven himself to hordes of moviegoers. Last
summer's sleeper hit ``She's All That'' sealed A-list actor status
for Prinze, 23. Even the less-than-successful ``Wing Commander''
hasn't spoiled the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Acting wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision for Prinze.
Immediately after graduating from high school in 1994, he headed
west to his birthplace, Los Angeles. After a number of auditions,
he landed a four-line spot on ``Family Matters.'' Soon after, he
gained more television guest spots and began appearing on ``After
School Specials.'' His screen debut came with his role as Claire
Danes' unfit boyfriend in ``To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday.''
After his roles in ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and its
sequel, the scripts came rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted to ``Seventeen'' that sharing his father's name
(Freddie Prinze Sr.) did help him snag an agent when he burst onto
the acting circuit. He's always wanted to act, but following in his
father's footsteps stops there. The 1970s TV sitcom ``Chico and the
Man'' put Prinze Sr.'s name on the map. But with the fame came
drugs. At age 22, Prinze Sr., upset about his divorce from his
wife, committed suicide when the younger Freddie was just 10 months
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done drugs or even smoked a cigarette because of my
old man,'' Prinze Jr. said. ``I don't like the idea of being
controlled.'' Growing up without a father was hard on him, he said,
but he doesn't let those unfortunate circumstances get to him. ``I
know one day I'm going to be the best father in the world,'' he
told ``People.'' ``Not having a father makes me want to be a great
one.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see Prinze on the big screen right now in ``Down to
You,'' the story of a guy pursuing the girl who got away. In June,
he'll star alongside Monica Potter and China Chow in the romantic
comedy ``Head Over Heels.'' The plot is kind of hush-hush right
now, but according to the official Web site
(www.headoverheels.com), Freddie may portray a lady-killer _
literally.

WORKPLACE: WHEN BUTTONED-DOWN MEETS BUTTONLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The negotiation was one part corporate diplomacy and
one part Dilbert.
</P>
<P>
   The young executives of methodfive Inc., a Web design firm, were
planning a Halloween party in their loft-like headquarters in
Greenwich Village. The partners of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the
giant accounting and consulting firm that had recently bought a
stake in methodfive, couldn't decide whether they should wear
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Donning disguises would make them seem hip, the partners
thought. But they worried that they also might end up looking silly
in front of clients who would be at the party. So they vacillated.
``One day, they would be wearing costumes; the next day they
wouldn't be wearing costumes,'' said Alaina Yoakum, methodfive's
marketing manager, who had frequent conversations with a public
relations executive at Pricewaterhouse about the party.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they decided that the most senior partner coming to
the party would wear a costume so long as methodfive's chief
executive did, too. Somehow, though, Andrew Zimmerman, the partner,
got a garbled message and came in a suit, while Adeo Ressi, the
executive, came as Obi-Wan Kenobi, light saber and all.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman could do little but try to laugh off the mix-up and
rescue himself by joking in a speech to his audience _ including
Austin Powers, a werewolf and a sack of potatoes _ that he was
really a consultant who had come dressed as an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The Halloween party was more than just an amusing turn in the
cultural acclimation taking place since the button-down
Pricewaterhouse bought a 12 percent stake in the cutting-edge
methodfive eight months ago. It was also a stark illustration of
the communications gap that more and more workplaces are
experiencing as bricks-and-mortar behemoths team up with Web
companies. America Online's plan to acquire Time Warner is only the
grandest of such partnerships. These ``clicks and bricks''
alliances give established companies, many of which have failed to
figure out the Internet, an immediate entry to the online world,
and they give dot-com ventures a scale that might otherwise take
decades to build.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for the methodfive-Pricewaterhouse deal was
similar. Methodfive would quickly gain a foothold with hundreds of
Pricewaterhouse clients around the world (as well as an infusion of
cash). Pricewaterhouse would add sparkle to its enormous but staid
information-technology consulting practice, contending that it,
too, could tap the minds of creative twentysomethings who truly
understood the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, however, employees of both companies
realized that the strategic vision was the easy part. Melding the
two workplaces would be the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pricewaterhouse, the result of a multibillion-dollar merger,
employs 150,000 people in 150 countries. Its consultants zip in and
out of airports, offering executives advice about ``adding value.''
The top consultant holds an M.B.A. from the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Methodfive opened its doors in 1996, the result of an idea by
Ressi, who was then a 23-year-old dropout from the University of
Pennsylvania's undergraduate program and had already sold one
Internet start-up. Methodfive employs 80 people, most of them in a
10th-floor office lighted as much by the glow of computer screens
as by dim bulbs overhead. Elsewhere in the building are a discount
rug store and a nutrition newsletter. When boredom strikes,
methodfive's employees try to throw a stuffed dog into a trash can
from across the office.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ressi who received a call from Zimmerman last summer. The
two had lunch and hit it off; before long, they had agreed on the
broad outlines of a deal. Then came the first lesson in what it is
like to work with an enormous company. Pricewaterhouse said it had
to study the proposed agreement to make sure it did not violate
Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Throughout the summer,
methodfive added clients, hired new workers and waited for word
from Zimmerman. ``That is not Internet speed,'' Ressi said of the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but he found the decision-making machinery at
Pricewaterhouse difficult to fathom. ``You think: `This dude is in
charge. I speak to him. It gets done.' That's not really true at
PWC,'' he said. ``One guy has three or four different bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   To find their way, methodfive's workers have set up an internal
public-relations group to treat Pricewaterhouse as a potential
client to which it must sell itself. Ressi said he had traveled to
Pricewaterhouse offices around the world to ``evangelize.'' Ms.
Yoakum, the marketing manager, spends almost one day a week talking
up methodfive to Pricewaterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Pricewaterhouse's consultants do not dispute the methodfive
workers' description of the cultural divide. The differences in
both style and substance, they say, are why Pricewaterhouse
invested in methodfive. ``We need to make sure we protect their
brand and not pull it too close to us and turn it into oatmeal,''
said Michael G. Macesich, a Pricewaterhouse partner.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Wymbs, one of three Pricewaterhouse consultants on a
yearlong loan to methodfive, got a quick taste of culture shock
shortly after arriving in December. Sitting with two methodfive
employees at an impromptu meeting, he began talking about ``value
chains'' and ``core competencies,'' he said. Their reaction?
``Blank stares.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a large organization, you get embodied with
consultant-speak,'' Wymbs said. ``Being here made me take a step
back and say, `I can eliminate this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has worked out, to be sure. Several employees who
didn't like the idea of linking up with a consulting giant have
left, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the remaining employees said they saw the benefits of
alliance. Working with Pricewaterhouse has taught them to attack
problems more systematically and to be tougher negotiators with
clients, they said. They have even begun showing up a little
earlier in the morning, some as early as 9. ``A year ago, no one
was in the office at 9,''` Ressi said. ``Not a soul.''

 &HT;    Georgians named to Parade list
 &HT;    By Darryl Maxie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Parade magazine chose four Georgians to its
All-America team, announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest DeKalb High School linebacker Travis Harris, The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution's player of the year, was chosen,
along with two Super 11 AJC preseason selections _ Houston County
High School linebacker Hobie Holiday and Northside High School
lineman Jason Respert.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth pick is Douglass High School safety Yohance Buchanan,
cited by the magazine as ``this year's top defensive back.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglass coach Butch Climmons concurred. ``Yohance plays like a
linebacker at safety,'' Climmons said. ``He hits like Ronnie Lott _
very physical. He'll knock you out if he gets shot at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a 6-foot-2, 205-pound safety, is headed to Florida
State. He is one of four defensive backs on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine chose 55 players from 24 states. The team was
selected by coaches, scouts, recruiters and other experts.
California had the most Parade All-Americans with nine, followed by
Florida with seven.
</P>
<P>
   Parade chose eight linebackers nationwide, including the two
from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who has committed to Florida, had 179 tackles, caused
five fumbles and recovered three fumbles, with 14 tackles that
caused opponents to lose 202 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday, a 6-4, 230-pound linebacker who this week committed to
Georgia Tech, had 61 tackles and seven sacks, but he missed Houston
County's final five games because of a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Respert, a 6-3, 290-pound lineman who anchored the Northside
offense and helped his team reach the Class AAAA semifinals, had
committed to Georgia, but he also is considering Tennessee. He is
one of 17 linemen on the team.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ |William Eckart, the trailblazing designer
who created intricate-but-accessible sets for the original Broadway
productions of ``Damn Yankees,'' ``Mame'' and other hit musicals
before moving to Texas and turning to college teaching, died Monday
in Dallas. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be at 3 p.m. Saturday in the Bob Hope
Theatre at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where Mr.
Eckart was professor emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Mr. Eckart designed sets for ``The Importance of Being
Earnest'' at Texas Stage, a short-lived classical theater company
based at Caravan of Dreams in Fort Worth. In 1996, he designed the
set for the regional premiere of ``Better Half Dead'' at Circle
Theatre. And in 1976, he designed scenery and costumes for the Fort
Worth Symphony's production of the Leonard Bernstein ``Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Eckart's best known work was in collaboration with his wife,
Jean, who died in 1993. The Eckarts, who pioneered integrating
scenery changes into the action of shows, were nominated for Tony
Awards for ``Mame'' and ``Fiorello.'' Their scenic design for ``The
Golden Apple'' won the prestigious Donaldson Award in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Eckart had recently been working with Andrew B. Harris on a
book about the Eckarts' Broadway years. Harris, former drama
chairman at SMU and Texas Christian University, said the book,
titled ``The Performing Set,'' is ``about 90 percent complete'' and
will be published.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Eckart retired from SMU in 1994 but continued to design at
least one show a year. At the time of his death, he was preparing
set designs for ``Macbeth,'' which will play Feb. 24-March 5 at
Collin County Community College in suburban Dallas. Director Gail
Cronaur said on Tuesday that the sets will be completed according
to Mr. Eckart's design sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's conception was inspired by the sculpture of Louise
Nevelson,'' Cronaur said. ``He planned to use a lot of found
objects. We'll honor his design, of course, but we'll miss his
insight, taste and genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Eckart was born Oct. 21, 1920, in New Iberia, La. He
graduated from Tulane University and Yale University Drama School.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Peter Eckart of San Francisco; a
daughter, Julie Johnson of Dallas; two grandchildren, Phoebe Eckart
of San Francisco and Travis Johnson of Dallas; a sister, Rosemary
Bernard of New Iberia, La.; and stepmother-in-law, Herta Kahn of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The family asks that memorial donations be sent to the William
and Jean Eckart Scholarship Fund, Meadows School of the Arts,
Southern Methodist University, Dallas, 75275, or to Broadway Cares:

FRANK E. MORRIS, 76; WAS PRESIDENT OF BOSTON FED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Frank E. Morris, a retired president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, died Monday in his home in Naples, Fla. He
was 76.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank from 1968 to
1988, Mr. Morris played an influential role in setting federal
monetary policy. As the prime mover behind the design and
construction of the Federal Reserve's new aluminium office tower on
Atlantic Avenue, he also played an influential role in the creation
of the Boston skyline
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years Mr. Morris attended the meetings of the Federal
Open Market Committee, held in the paneled board room of the great
marble headquarters of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, to
chart the monetary policy of the nation. During that time he often
played a leading role in the formulation of the Fed's policies,
recruiting one future chairman to the system (G. William Miller),
playing chief devil's advocate to another (Paul Volcker), and
taking an active part in the great intellectual debates of the age.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the feeling when you walk in that room''
where the committee meets,'' Mr. Morris said in a story published
in the Boston Globe on Sept. 11, 1988. ``I suppose legislators get
the same sensation in the halls of Congress. But events there come
to a head only every once in a while, while we meet every month,
and what we did there had its effect on every man, woman, and child
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Morris was born and raised in Detroit. When his father was
laid off by Cadillac during the Depression, his family operated a
corner grocery and soda fountain. After graduating from Wayne
University, he shipped out to England as a navigator in a B-24. He
flew 27 missions over Germany and France, including bombing runs in
support of D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, studying on the GI Bill, he earned a master's
degree and doctorate in economics at Michigan State University. ``I
knew I didn't want to be an engineer,'' he said in 1988. ``I took a
course in economics, and that decided it. I think my experience in
the Depression had something to do with it; I wanted to know why
that had happened. Economics seemed to be something that had the
capacity to lead the way to a better life for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an economist with the Office of Price Stabilization and
the Central Intelligence Agency, an assistant to the Treasury
secretary during the Kennedy administration, and vice president of
Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. before becoming president of the Federal
Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   When he decided to build the new Boston Federal Reserve Bank,
Mr. Morris said he developed an elaborate ruse to mask his
intentions and avoid driving up real estate prices. He pretended to
prepare to build on the parking lot across from the site where the
bank had stood since the 1920s, at the corner of Franklin and Pearl
streets (it is now the Meridien Hotel), while secretly assembling
the land from parcels of derelict waterfront property along the
Fort Point Channel across the street from South Station. He thus
began the city's return to its waterfront, before developers began
the conversion of Lewis Wharf, five years before the Quincy Market
restoration was begun.
</P>
<P>
   He commissioned architect Hugh Stubbins to design the building.
The key elements of Stubbins' design were the stoutly defended,
highly secure low-rise building where the money is kept; the
minimum-security office tower beside it (because the building is
suspended from pylons at either end, many floors are wide open from
end to end, an uncommon and beautiful aspect); and, of course, the
shining aluminum in which the building is clad. The new building
opened in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about banking is that you can't see its product,''
Mr. Morris said. ``It's just numbers that add up and cancel out. So
it's more important than it might otherwise be that your building
make a strong statement about the kind of bank you are.''
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down from the Federal Reserve, he taught at
Boston College for five years.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed reading and traveled widely.
</P>
<P>
   He leave his wife, Geraldine (Coltharp); three daughters, Susan
Carlson of Acton, Lisa Grobar of La Crescenta, Calif., and Betsy
Rosen of Wellesley; a sister, Dorothy Green of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.; and six grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when Ford Motor's giant River Rouge plant in Dearborn,
Mich., was the pinnacle of industrial achievement. Barges of iron
ore docked at one end, new Fords rolled out the other.
</P>
<P>
   But that was half a century ago, an eternity at Internet speed.
Today's model is no longer Ford's assembly line but the quick
assembly techniques made famous by Dell Computer. Dell's pioneering
methods for making and selling personal computers have become
required reading at business schools. Manufacturers in every
industry have studied Dell's immense success.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that includes the auto industry, producer of the most
complex mechanism that human intelligence has ever devised for mass
consumption. Now operating in a faster-paced economy, the industry
is urgently seeking ways to bring its products to market more
quickly. The trade talk at the North American International Auto
Show in Detroit earlier this month suggests that the auto giants
are lumbering toward Dell's idea of manufacturing for today's
world.
</P>
<P>
   Dell made its name by selling directly to customers and allowing
them to specify the features they wanted their personal computer to
include. Dell quickly assembles customized machines to fill orders
arriving by way of the Internet or by phone. Among manufacturers,
the company is known for extreme reliance on suppliers for
components.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Charles H. Fine, who teaches manufacturing at the
Sloan School of Management at MIT, attributes the company's success
to mastery of ``supply chain management,'' that is, its complete
flexibility about whether a particular function is performed by its
own people or by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers seem to have absorbed that lesson. Last week,
General Motors, the world's largest company and traditionally
Detroit's most self-sufficient, declared that from now on it would
seek growth through partnerships and alliances _ ``clearly a
different approach,'' John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief
executive, acknowledged in a speech at the Automotive News World
Congress in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's speech was policy ratifying practice. General Motors has
gradually evolved a web of alliances with Toyota, Isuzu, Suzuki and
other foreign automakers. Last May, GM took the watershed step of
spinning off its captive parts maker, Delphi Automotive Systems, a
$30 billion business. The parting freed Delphi to seek new
customers among rival manufacturers and signaled GM's intent to
open its supply base to more vendors. Ford is in the process of
following suit with its parts maker, Visteon Automotive Systems.
</P>
<P>
   That decision was right out of the computer industry's playbook.
Selling direct, with no distributors or retailers, Dell is spared
the expense of an inventory of finished goods. Its supplier system
keeps investment in materials to a bare minimum. The Dell process
depends on close tracking of customer demand and sharing that
intelligence with its suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   An order in hand before making a car amounts to an automaker's
vision of heaven. Today, almost all vehicles are manufactured for
dealers' stocks. That requires the automakers to anticipate demand
and figure out an attractive product mix. That task has become
exceedingly difficult as consumer tastes have splintered and as
products proliferate. Car and Driver's current guide to new cars,
vans, sport utilities and pickup trucks indexes 279 model lines,
sold under 45 different brands. The choices in color and options
make the potential combinations almost infinite. Wrong guesses
result in ``lot rot'': hard-to-sell vehicles piling up expensively
on dealers' lots.
</P>
<P>
   If companies could make cars and add options to order, Fine
said, ``not only could they charge full price, they could satisfy
the customer _ people will pay more for what they really want.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offers buyers instant access to car data, putting
pressure on car companies for immediate response. A customer can
choose a vehicle and select options now, of course, but must then
wait weeks or months for delivery. Nearly every carmaker has a
high-priority plan for chopping down that delay.
</P>
<P>
   At the Detroit auto show, Louis Schweitzer, chief executive at
Renault SA, said that by next year Renault would provide 15-day
delivery of cars manufactured to customers' specifications. Fujio
Cho, president of Toyota, said the time had come to apply the
company's mastery of ``just in time'' manufacturing to distribution
and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Roberts, group vice president for North American sales at
General Motors, said GM's ambitious goal was to cut ``order to
delivery'' from about 50 days to 10. Robert Rewey, a group vice
president at Ford, said Ford was busily building an information
system to dispatch a new order instantly back through the chain to
parts suppliers, speeding the manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   The Dell system's quick response time depends on ``modularity,''
a basic building block in the computer industry. The term refers to
``plug and play'' components that click together, like a
home-entertainment system. Modularity relies on industrywide
agreement on performance standards and on ease of connection.
</P>
<P>
   Fine and others say that all the auto companies are working hard
to exploit modularity, especially the companies that produce the
cheaper cars. Primary suppliers like Delphi or Johnson Controls no
longer provide mere parts. They offer complete ``systems,'' from
climate control or braking to entire interiors or fully equipped
cockpits. By all accounts, the automakers are relegating more and
more engineering of complex components to suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks that modularity is the answer for Detroit.
The United Auto Workers vigorously opposes it as mainly a pretext
for removing work from its jurisdiction. Beyond that, fine cars
like Mercedes or BMW all tend to be highly integrated designs, Fine
said, with much less scope for ``plug and play'' systems.
Nevertheless, most of the 17 million vehicles sold in the United
States last year were not peak-performance cars, and the industry's
swing toward modularity is unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the board, more systems, more subsystems and whole
modules are being done by the supplier community,'' Harry Pearce,
GM's vice chairman, said in an interview at the Detroit show. He
predicted that a shakeout among suppliers would produce ``half a
dozen powerhouses.'' Those companies will then engage in ``a
natural tug of war'' with automakers over controlling the critical
engineering in a vehicle.

 &HT;    Coyotes 'trapped like rats,' thanks to Mother Nature
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Phoenix Coyotes probably didn't expect much of a
weather difference for their road trip against three Southeast
Division teams.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' scheduled game Tuesday night against Carolina night
was canceled because of a storm that dropped nearly two feet of
snow on the Raleigh area. Because of impassable roads, the team was
trapped at its airport hotel Tuesday. But barring another winter
blast, the Coyotes are scheduled to bus to the Raleigh airport this
morning for a charter flight to Atlanta to play the Thrashers
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix coach Bob Francis said, ``We're trapped like rats. We're
three miles down the road from where we should be playing, and we
can't play.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport Embassy Suites sits in an office park, away from any
restaurants or shopping. Because there was no way into or out of
the hotel, only a skeleton staff was working. ``There's no
housekeeping and no room service,'' Coyotes spokesman Rick
Braunstein said. ``They put out one buffet, and that's what
everybody eats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina-Phoenix game at the Raleigh Entertainment and
Sports Arena was canceled after Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of
emergency. The Coyotes, scheduled to play at Washington on Friday,
could have stiff legs tonight. They haven't skated since their game
Sunday night against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not crazy about the whole scenario,'' Francis said.

TORTURE AND KILLING OF MUSLIM FEMINIST CAUSES OUTRAGE IN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With Turkey in a state of shock over the
discovery of dozens of savagely tortured bodies beneath hide-outs
of a religious terror group, much of the outrage and grief has been
focused on the case of the only female victim.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Konca Kuris, was often described as a Muslim
feminist. In books, articles, lectures and television appearances,
she had described Islam as a religion that guarantees women's
rights, and asserted that male commentators over the centuries had
twisted its essence in ways that led to the oppression of women.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Ms. Kuris was kidnapped from the street in front
of her home in the Mediterranean town of Mersin. There were no
clues to her fate until her burned and disfigured body was exhumed
Saturday from a shallow grave in Konya, 220 miles northwest of
Mersin.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was one of 33 that have been found so far at properties
used by Hizbullah, or the Party of God, a group dedicated to
overthrowing the secular Turkish state and establishing an Islamic
republic in its place. Police investigators are searching for more
corpses.
</P>
<P>
   Hizbullah is not believed to be connected to the similarly named
group that has fought against the Israeli occupation of southern
Lebanon. Both groups, however, proclaim loyalty to fundamentalist
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   According to press reports, the police team that uncovered Ms.
Kuris' body also found a videotape containing scenes of torture
sessions she endured over a period of weeks. At one of the
sessions, her captors are said to have charged her with seeking to
become Turkey's version of Salman Rushdie or Taslima Nasrin,
writers whom some Muslims consider heretics deserving of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a great influence on Turkish women,'' said Ayse Onal,
who has written several books on feminism in Turkey. ``She showed
that it's possible to be completely modern and still be faithful to
Islam. That's why she was killed. Hizbullah, which is a very sick
and deeply violent group, could not tolerate her point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kuris was the only intellectual among the Hizbullah victims
found so far. Most of the others are believed to have been Kurdish
businessmen from war-torn provinces in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   After the first bodies were found last week, several
politicians, news commentators and others charged that the Turkish
military had collaborated with Hizbullah in the early 1990s,
encouraging its death squads to kill Kurds considered favorable to
the cause of Kurdish nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel rejected that charge, but appeared to
agree that some government agents or agencies might have had
connections to Hizbullah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state does not commit murders or order murders to be
carried out,'' Demirel told reporters in Ankara on Sunday. ``There
may be forces belonging to the state that act illegitimately, but
they are committing a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders issued a statement denying that they or
their predecessors had sponsored or aided Hizbullah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general staff is closely following operations against the
Hizbullah terror organization and shares the public's justified
outrage at the horrors that have recently been uncovered,'' the
commanders said. ``Directly linking this merciless murder network
to the Turkish armed forces is a senseless and illogical slander.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is arguably the world's most secular Muslim country, and
many people here, especially women, considered Ms. Kuris an
exemplar of their tolerant brand of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in 1960, was married at 17 and had five children.
At a young age she became interested in Islam, but quit the first
religious sect she joined after being asked to wash its leaders'
clothes. Later she made a trip to Iran with a Hizbullah delegation,
but returned disillusioned with the organization because, she said,
it supported a brand of Islam that was hostile to women.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the Koran and various works of commentary, she
began challenging religious orthodoxy, asserting that Islam does
not require women to cover their hair with scarves and does not
require the separation of the sexes at funerals or in schools. She
also urged that public prayers be offered in Turkish rather than
the traditional Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Konca used her mind, her emotions and her conscience to
interpret God's message,'' said Gonul Tufekci, a lawyer who is
prominent in Islamic feminist circles here. ``This approach
challenges the ideology that tries to use Islam as a tool to keep
women down. It is based on the concept of an open mind. This
concept is repugnant not only to groups like Hizbullah, but to many
institutions in this part of the world.''

TV NOTES: LETTERMAN AUDIENCE GROWS; TEEN SHOWS; `MILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Letterman has been behind Jay Leno for so long _ more than
five years _ that he had been all but written off as a factor in
the competition for late-night viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But this season Letterman managed to do something extremely rare
in contemporary network television. He built his audience, adding
almost half a million viewers to his nightly average.
</P>
<P>
   That achievement was far more significant, at least to the
show's producers, than their show's one-week return to first place
in the ratings. Letterman managed that feat two weeks ago, at
considerable physical cost. Climbing back to the top took not only
a much publicized interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton, but also
an equally publicized emergency quintuple bypass for the star
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Being forced to the sidelines to convalesce might seem a
terrible bit of timing, coming after the momentum of the Clinton
show, but Rob Burnett, executive producer of ``Late Show With David
Letterman,'' said he did not see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as some bad break that will prevent us from
getting back permanently to first place,'' he said. ``We won
because of Hillary and a quintuple bypass. I would trade both for a
10 p.m. show on CBS that gets a 40 share.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been Burnett's contention for some time that Letterman
cannot realistically hope to beat Leno regularly because of what he
calls the disadvantages of being on CBS instead of NBC. Mainly
these concern the disparity in the number of viewers leading into
the late-night shows. For years, NBC has had much stronger network
shows from 10 to 11 p.m., especially on Thursday with the mighty
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's local stations have newscasts that in most cities are much
stronger than those on CBS stations. This is especially true in the
largest cities and in many others, where CBS's newscasts are often
among the weakest. NBC's stations average an 8.8 rating for local
news, while CBS's average only a 7.2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local news drop-off on some CBS stations is astonishing,''
Burnett said. ``The viewers run like it's a test pattern with a
really annoying siren. We are so overwhelmingly behind from the
moment we go on the air that we can only make up the difference
with events.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his point, he cited New Orleans, which has a local
CBS station that dominates its competition in news. ``We always
beat Jay in New Orleans,'' Burnett said. ``It's the same show. Dave
isn't any funnier in New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   The handicap did improve somewhat this fall when CBS added
stronger 10 p.m. shows, most notably the hit ``Judging Amy'' on
Tuesday. ``And we see an uptick in our numbers on Tuesday,''
Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   But Letterman also made some adjustments in his show that seem
to have helped to attract some viewers. Beyond adding viewers, he
has nudged up his rating among viewers between the ages of 18 and
49, the group beloved by many advertisers, by about 6 percent. That
bucks several trends, including the entire movement of the CBS
network, which more than ever is becoming a network built on
viewers over 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But Letterman has always defied CBS's skew toward older viewers.
According to CBS's research, he does not have fewer fans than he
did when he dominated the late-night ratings for two years after he
moved to CBS in 1993; they simply watch him less frequently. The
research also indicates that there is little cross-over audience
between Letterman and Leno, which was validated by the results two
weeks ago. Even with Letterman scoring higher ratings when Mrs.
Clinton was on his show on Jan. 12, Leno posted a rating that
matched his season average to a tenth of a point.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's adjustments include cutting back his monologue,
sometimes to just a few jokes; adding a segment in which he sits at
his desk and talks directly to the audience, one of his strengths;
moving his Top 10 list around to different places; bringing guests
out earlier; and improving the show's pacing.
</P>
<P>
   This format helps differentiate the show from Leno's, which is
more than ever a showcase for his greatest skill: the monologue.
That strategy works best for Leno because it plays into another NBC
advantage, which is the institutional status of the ``Tonight''
show.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ross, executive producer of NBC's other nightly comedy
show, ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien,'' noted that when O'Brien
took over that show _ from Letterman when he left for CBS _ there
was some debate about whether to call the show something else.
``That would have been a mistake,'' Ross said. ``These franchises
are really worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight'' has had a multi-generational tradition of the
monologue. Johnny Carson perfected it; Leno has shrewdly maintained
the tradition. Viewers watch local news on NBC's stations then
watch the same news become the subject of jokes on the ``Tonight''
show.
</P>
<P>
   Overall Leno's ratings are down only slightly this season, about
1 percent in total viewers and 4 percent in young adult viewers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Burnett argued that Letterman's ratings were unlikely to suffer
even if he was forced to stay off the air several months. But with
the star's rapid recovery Burnett said he doubted he would be away
that long. ``Dave was off the air 2.5 months after he left NBC,''
he said. ``His audience was there when he came back.'' That's one
reason it is becoming less likely that Letterman will have guest
hosts fill in during his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never opposed having a guest host,'' Burnett said.
``It's just a discussion we've never had. I didn't think it was an
appropriate topic to discuss with Dave right after his operation.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Letterman continues to progress well, Burnett said, it's
likely that the show will simply package repeats as creatively as
possible. This week's round of shows were done in other locations.
Burnett said he might invite guests like Julia Roberts to tape
short introductions to repeat episodes that feature them.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always Letterman's comeback to look forward to.
Burnett predicted that the night he returned the ratings would best
Leno's. Soon thereafter, he said, ``We'll be behind Jay'' once
again.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age Wasteland
</P>
<P>
   One show that is definitively down and out is ``Beverly Hills
90210,'' the Fox drama that has for some time fit the oxymoronic
description of venerable teen-age hit.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fox executives announced a plan this month to bring the
show back for new episodes starting in the summer, that plan has
now been dropped after declining ratings for recent episodes and
mass defections by the show's cast. The show's high cost, more than
$2 million an episode, was also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Another long-running Fox drama, ``Party of Five,'' is also
facing a final episode this season. Its biggest stars, Scott Wolf
and Neve Campbell, have expressed no interest in continuing and the
show's ratings have drifted down for several years.
</P>
<P>
   With both series heading for cancellation, Fox has even more
incentive to find a way to bring ``The X-Files'' back for one more
season, though that may not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   The time frame for working out a deal to bring back both the
series star, David Duchovny, and its creator, Chris Carter, is down
to ``a couple of weeks,'' said one executive involved in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   `Millionaire' Ratings
</P>
<P>
   Though ABC's top program executives, Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd
Braun, took great pains at a news conference this month to avoid
predicting that ABC would ride ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' to
a win in the season's network rating competition, the facts seem to
be overwhelming their reticence.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, ABC officially caught up to NBC for leadership
with ages 18 to 49.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is broadcasting the Super Bowl on Sunday, and there will be
three more editions of ``Millionaire.'' The network will surely be
in first place this time next week.

BRITAIN ALLOWS GAY COUPLE TO KEEP TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain Tuesday said it would allow twins born in
California to an American woman to stay in Britain with a gay
couple who went abroad to defy a ban on homosexuals having children
here by surrogate mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw said the infant boy and girl, who were
born Dec. 9, could remain in Britain permanently. Immigration
officials had threatened to deport the babies by the end of this
month after they arrived at Heathrow Airport with millionaire
businessmen Barrie Drewitt and Tony Barlow.
</P>
<P>
   A California court ruled that Drewitt, 30, and Barlow, 35, are
the legal parents of the twins, but under English law the parents
are the California woman who gave birth to the twins and her
husband, whose only connection to the arrangement is that he is
married to her.
</P>
<P>
   That conflict in the law, and the unprecedented circumstances of
the children's births, led to a dispute between the couple and the
British government over the twins' nationality and their right to
live here.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hillman, a Home Office spokesman, said Straw's decision is
limited only to immigration status, and that Drewitt and Barlow
would have to apply for citizenship for the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home secretary has exercised his discretion outside the
normal immigration rules,'' said Hillman. ``The decision was made
in light of the particular circumstances of the case and having in
mind the welfare of the children. The welfare of the children is
paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from Drewitt and Barlow, who are
being paid for exclusive interviews by a British Sunday newspaper
and television station that is making a documentary about them.
They have said they intend to return to the United States and have
more children by surrogate.
</P>
<P>
   They had insisted that the children should be recognized as
British citizens because one of their sperm fertilized the egg of a
donor that was planted in the surrogate. They had also rejected
suggestions from the government that they adopt the children in
order to gain citizenship, saying that adoption was an unnecessary
burden being foisted on them in the same country where five years
ago they were deemed unfit to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, only married heterosexual couples are allowed
to have children by surrogate. Drewitt and Barlow said they had
been turned down by British authorities when they tried to adopt.
They complained that they were being discriminated against because
they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a British government authority lifted a ban
against women freezing their eggs for future attempts to get
pregnant. Women undergoing cancer treatments that could leave them
infertile had led the argument for lifting the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office announced the decision on the twins on the same
day that it revealed that a record number of asylum seekers, more
than 71,000, came to Britain last year. It was 50 percent increase
from 1998. Only Germany saw more people looking for asylum in
Europe, with much of the surge blamed on the war in Yugoslavia.

ANXIOUS THOUGHTS FADE IN THE REFLECTION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child, I had a self-esteem problem. I also had an anxiety
problem and a really bad acne problem, but that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the root of my self-esteem problem was my size. I was
small in stature and athletically challenged. I wasn't goofy or
anything like that. Rather, when my friends selected someone for
the anchor leg on the relay team, it was a certainty that I would
not be picked.
</P>
<P>
   I was a good student, but this was during the days before
``Jeopardy,'' and intelligence was not considered a valuable
commodity on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of my anxiety problem is more difficult to pinpoint.
I was well cared for, in a fairly stable environment, with a close,
supportive family. Yet, I worried about anything and everything for
much of each day. Was my hair OK? Would my pencil break during the
test? Would the teacher let me sharpen my pencil after it broke?
Would I waste precious minutes at the pencil sharpener and not have
enough time to finish my test? If I failed the test, would my
mother let me go to Jackie's birthday party on Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing that I ever completed the first grade with all of
that angst.
</P>
<P>
   As time went by, I got over that skinny thing. It's amazing what
you can accomplish with a few pancakes swimming in syrup. However,
I continued to struggle with my anxiety. Worries about my career,
my family, national security and, yes, my weight consumed too much
of my brain matter.
</P>
<P>
   I've read a lot of self-help books and articles to help me take
things in stride, but then I get caught up in the hectic routine of
my life and jump right back on that worry wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Then one evening, a light bulb came on in my head. I jumped out
of bed and scribbled a few words in bold letters on a strip of
paper. I taped that paper to the mirror in my bathroom and went
back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, when I stepped out of the shower, the first
thing I saw was that note to myself. It said, ``Objects in mirror
are smaller than they appear.'' I smiled in relief. Clearly, the
image I was viewing was distorted and not at all representative of
my true nature.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't try this tactic with my scale, for obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I found that starting my day with a different
perspective greatly eased my apprehension about coming events. I
started applying this principle to everything around me until my
problems and issues shrank to manageable proportions. Maybe you
tell yourself not to sweat the small stuff or ask yourself,
``What's the worst thing that can happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, do whatever it takes to get things into perspective and
prevent you from having a heart attack. And teach your precious
children not to fight windmills, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hypertension, ulcers, domestic violence, food and drug
addictions. Why worry?
</P>
<P>
   It won't take a nuclear war to wipe out society; we'll kill
ourselves long before that ever happens.
</P>
<P>
   Take time out to chill out. And, if you don't think that's
important, do yourself a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Look in the mirror.

WE ALL WONDER: CAN MCNAIR TOE THE LINE?

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turf toe.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds funny, like hat head, tennis elbow, writer's cramp, or
coffee breath.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a phony or funny injury, and the Tennessee Titans
aren't laughing about Super Bowl quarterback Steve McNair's double
dose of turf toe.
</P>
<P>
   Former Super Bowl quarterback (and fellow turf toe sufferer) Joe
Theismann said, ``If you want to focus on one thing that's going to
be critical in this game, it's going to be Steve's toe.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Steve's toe.(unitals) Imagine. Several tons of sculpted,
marbled USDA prime beef on parade with the whole world watching . .
. and Super Bowl XXXIV might hinge on a case of turf toe.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often toes grab headlines. Denny McLain's broken toe
(smashed by a mobster when McLain didn't pay a debt) helped the Red
Sox win the 1967 pennant. The Toe Hall of Fame would include Lou
``The Toe'' Groza, Toe Blake, Dizzy Dean (career shortened by a
broken toe), Sixto Lezcano, and Dick Morris. Now there is turf toe.
Now QB McNair is doing for toes what Hall of Famer George Brett did
for hemorrhoids during the 1980 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Non-athletes chuckle when they hear the expression. Turf toe
sounds like something that would give Pervis Ellison another excuse
to look good in an Armani suit at the end of the Celtic bench.
Robinson Checo could have used it to buy yet more time on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL medical glossary defines turf toe as ``sprain of
metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint of the great toe.'' In layman's
terms, it's a sprain of the largest joint in the big toe. It
happens most often on unyielding artificial turf (hence the name).
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the big toe digs downward into soft grass, but on hard
surface, the toe can't dig and slides toward the middle of an
athlete's shoe. Once aggravated, turf toe is doubly painful when an
athlete plays on a hard surface rather than real grass. The only
treatment is rest. Ice and anti-inflammatory agents sometimes
reduce the swelling. Painkillers allow a player to play.
</P>
<P>
   McNair and the Titans were glad they played on real grass at
Jacksonville last weekend. This Sunday, it'll be back to the hard
surface on the floor of the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Turf toe ended the career of Pittsburgh tough guy linebacker
Jack Lambert. Former Packers receiver Sterling Sharpe was another
high-profile sufferer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it in '92,'' said Titans backup Neil O'Donnell (goat of
Super Bowl XXX as QB of the losing Steelers). ``It's a nagging
injury. You just have to deal with it. It hurts right in the joint.
You just get used to it after a while. I know after the Colts game
it was hurting Steve pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Four-time Super Bowl loser Jim Kelly said, ``Pretty much if I
had turf toe, it wouldn't affect me anyhow because I wasn't able to
run anyway. But it's very painful. If anybody ever says, `Just suck
it up,' they've never had it. It takes a good long time to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Turf toe is not limited to quarterback. Titans offensive tackle
Brad Hopkins (who played high school basketball with Acie Earl)
said, ``I have turf toe. A player fell on my foot and bent my toe
back. Anyone in athletics knows the big toe is pivotal, and when
that muscle is strained, they're very painful. And artificial turf
adds to the pain because you have to use more of that muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair wears a walking boot to protect the big toe on his left
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an off-and-on thing all year,'' he said. ``We played
on turf a couple of times in the last month. Hopefully, it's
getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm just wearing it until we start practice on
Wednesday. I'm just resting it for precautionary reasons. I think
it will be harder playing on this field. It's always harder on
turf. So I'll practice for a couple of days, then put on the boot
on and rest it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me more in the Indianapolis game because of the
turf _ the consistent pounding. Last week in Jacksonville, the
ground was soft and I came out and performed and I wasn't worried
about it. In Indianapolis it really bothered me after the game more
than it did all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hints have been dropped that McNair may have pain in both big
toes. The QB said he'll take a game-day painkiller shot if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some good stuff,'' said O'Donnell. ``Dr. Feelgood
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes down to it, maybe, but that's not my first
priority,'' said McNair. ``But I want to go out there and be
free-lancing. Just go out there and play normally.''
</P>
<P>
   Theismann said, ``I wouldn't be surprised, if the thing gets
aggravated enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage is set for Tennessee. They are a Cinderella football
team and I wouldn't be surprised to see Neil O'Donnell come in in
the fourth quarter and the goat of a Super Bowl becomes a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why come Sunday, all eyes will be on McNair's toe. The
turf toe.

`ONCE UPON A TIME IN NEW YORK': POLITICAL SHOWDOWN AT GAMY TAMMANY
HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 Phillip Lopate edited the recent anthology ``Writing New York.''  
 (bl)  
 By PHILLIP LOPATE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corruption and reform _ that cha-cha-cha of big city rule _ have
come to seem as embedded in New York's deep structure as the grid
plan of its streets. Underpaid civil servants will occasionally
take bribes; political kingpins like Boss Tweed of Tammany Hall
will build patronage empires, meanwhile feathering their nests
until such time as ambitious do-gooders arouse the outrage of the
sleeping populace.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Mitgang's lively ``Once Upon a Time in New York''
restages one of the classic confrontations in the city's history:
on the one hand the dapper, immensely likable if venal mayor, Jimmy
Walker, and his earthy cronies in the Tammany machine; on the other
hand the virtuous if priggish Judge Samuel Seabury, investigating
municipal corruption, and his ally, the patrician governor,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In the wings stood Fiorello H. La
Guardia, ready to take over the mayoralty if Walker should fall.
The wild card was ex-Gov. Al Smith, a onetime liberal hero who had
been defeated for president and, resenting Roosevelt's presidential
ambitions, threw his support to Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Mitgang, a former writer for The New York Times and author or
editor of 15 books, knows this territory well, having already
written a book on Seabury. If the current volume feels like
something of a rehash, revisiting favorite anecdotes and scandals,
Mitgang is certainly a most reliable guide, a true Gotham maven.
All the colorful Jazz Age characters you would hope to see make
their appearance: the gambler Arnold Rothstein and the madam Polly
Adler, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Jack Dempsey, Walter Winchell and
the saloonkeeper Texas Guinan.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid bark of Winchell and the streetwise ironies of Damon
Runyon echo in Mitgang's journalistic prose: ``Legs owned a piece
of the Hotsy Totsy Club, a Prohibition joint on 54th Street and
Broadway. There he could be seen with his girlfriend, Kiki Roberts,
a Ziegfeld Follies looker whose actual name was Marion Strasmick.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaching too constantly for a bright cleverness, he can sound
glib, calling Walker ``a dude for all seasons,'' or piling up
figures of speech, however clashing: ``Eventually, the economic
boom that began after the First World War began to run out of
steam. Yet even when prosperity failed to appear just around the
corner, Mayor Walker continued to trip the light fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   This is popular history, longer on vignette than analysis. What
makes it worthwhile are Mitgang's shrewd insights into local
politics _ the implications of each player's chess move for future
elections _ and the deft way he sets up the protagonists of his
story and orchestrates them cunningly for the final showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The nightclub-hopping Walker, openly escorting his mistress, a
showgirl named Betty Compton, seems to have been one of those
officials, like Adam Clayton Powell Jr. or Bill Clinton, who charms
the electorate by their peccadilloes. A politician perfectly suited
to the good times of the Jazz Age, Walker identified himself with
the people, vacationing on the Riviera in their stead. His failing
was that he could see no further than his own popularity, even when
the Depression called for a different, more imaginative response.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, who had struck the pundit Walter Lippmann and others
as a lightweight (they doubted that he would show the moral fiber
to stand up to Tammany), surprised everyone. Using his prerogative
as governor, he served as judge and jury in special hearings, where
he interrogated Walker, with the aid of Seabury's investigative
findings, and essentially forced the mayor to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Mitgang writes, Roosevelt passed an important test
of character that prepared him to win the presidency, an attempt to
govern on this premise: ``The hopes of the Republic cannot forever
tolerate either undeserved poverty or self-serving wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that is said in Walker's behalf, it is clear whom the
author regards as the good guys: Roosevelt and Seabury. Stressing
the ironies of class, he sees the blue bloods as defending the
working poor and unemployed and the politicians who rose from the
sidewalks of New York as their predators. Some revisionist
historians have argued for Tammany Hall as protector of the poor
and the immigrant, and the reformers as ruling-class pawns, but
Mitgang is having none of it. He makes a convincing case, on the
evidence, that Walker and his associates had their hands in the
till and betrayed the voters' trust.
</P>
<P>
   A child of the 1930s, Mitgang is nostalgic not for the Jazz Age
but for leaders like Roosevelt and La Guardia; he yearns for the
return of their visionary idealism and innovative programs serving
the less fortunate. In this sense his genial book is a jeremiad and
a liberal's call to arms.

COCA-COLA AND SMALL EXPORTERS IN LEGAL BATTLE OVER SALES IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ For years, Japanese consumers have had
two Coca-Colas to choose from _ identical except for their
packaging, but at strikingly different prices. There is the locally
bottled brand, labeled simply Coca-Cola, and ``American Coke,''
labeled Coca-Cola Classic _ bottled in America and shipped abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The name Coca-Cola Classic is used only in the United States and
Canada, denoting the return to the original formula in 1985 after
the ``New Coke'' debacle. But it's all the same stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the thousands of miles American Coke has to travel, it
is usually cheaper than Japanese-made Coke, which typically sells
for 120 yen ($1.14) in a 12-ounce can from vending machines.
American Coke costs as little as 70 yen (67 cents), or 40 percent
less, said Kazumasa Nagasaki, president of a company that imports
American Coke. That compares with about 80 cents in the United
States. ``I have never seen Japanese Coca-Cola for 70 yen,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   That price gap is at the heart of a complex civil case soon to
be heard by a federal jury in San Francisco. For four years,
Coca-Cola has been battling a pair of tiny California exporters.
Coke brought the original lawsuit, but last year the companies,
Omni Pacific and Dependable Vending, filed a countersuit accusing
Coke of violating antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, these are the opposing positions: Coke says the sale
of its products outside specified regions raises quality-control
issues, infringes its trademark rights, and violates contracts with
bottlers. The exporting companies say Coke is grasping at straws to
drive them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Coke makes more money per can in Japan than
anywhere else. Only about 5 percent of its products are sold there,
but they bring in at least 20 percent of its profits _ about $1
billion before taxes, said Andrew Conway, an analyst for Morgan
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of this market, Conway wrote in a recent report to
investors, is ``critically important to Coke's ability to grow
corporate-wide operating income in the 12 percent to 14 percent
range.''
</P>
<P>
   What began in 1996 as a throwaway lawsuit has blossomed into one
that could have major implications for the way that Coca-Cola does
business with bottlers around the world. Within the 200,000 pages
of documents in the case, the company is shown struggling to
mollify its Asian bottlers, which complained to Coke in Atlanta
about cheaper American drinks flooding their markets. But other
documents show Coke's biggest bottler, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
Enterprises, or CCE, eagerly selling to companies like Dependable
Vending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get calls and they'd say, `We haven't made our numbers
this month. Can you take 30,000 cases?''' recalled Mark Oliver,
Dependable's soft-spoken president. One manager told him he would
not be eligible for a hefty bonus if he did not sell a particular
amount by a certain deadline, and asked Oliver to help.
</P>
<P>
   Omni Pacific and Dependable, which together did about $20
million in business last year, a mere trickle next to Coke's $18.8
billion in annual sales, say they bought Coke products from
bottlers and wholesalers in the United States who were well aware
of their exporting plans and sold them to distributors like
Nagasaki. With its lawsuit, Coca-Cola asserted that no one could
sell Coca-Cola outside the territory where it was bottled. The
countersuit contends that Coke provided some Japanese bottlers with
discounted American-made Coca-Cola in an effort to undercut
companies like Dependable and Omni Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling which cans of Coke end up where in Asia is a
longtime problem back in Atlanta. ``This is about our right to
protect our trademark, our bottlers' contractual rights and the
system that benefits customers and consumers in local communities
around the world,'' said Ben Deutsch, a Coke spokesman. Among the
hundreds of hours of depositions on videotape is one from Douglas
Daft, Coke's president, who oversaw the company's business in Japan
for 11 years and is expected to become chairman and chief executive
in April.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue is whether companies like Omni Pacific and
Dependable have the right to buy cans of Coke from any source and
resell them abroad. Deutsch said bottler contracts contain
``territorial sales provisions'' intended to prevent that. The
chief lawyer for the companies, which make money on the price
differences between American-made Coke and overseas versions, says
Coca-Cola is unfairly trying to control prices worldwide. The
methods involved _ threats of legal action, agreements with
bottlers not to do business with suspected transshippers and
``blacklists'' that order distributors not to sell Coke to
particular companies _ violate foreign fair-trade laws and U.S.
antitrust statutes, said the lawyer, William Wineberg.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Coca-Cola and other soft-drink companies
grant exclusive franchise rights to bottlers in given locations.
That exclusivity was reinforced by a 1980 law, the Interbrand
Competition Act, which holds that as long as competition exists,
exclusive territories are acceptable. Coke and Pepsi fine bottlers
whose products are found outside their territories. But no such law
exists abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where about 50 percent of Coke products are sold
through vending machines, Coke's sales of carbonated soft drinks
have been flat or falling lately. Coca-Cola makes $1.26 in profit
per case in Japan, Conway estimated, compared with 28 cents at home
and 94 cents in Germany. Bottlers' profits have declined in recent
years, while Coke's have risen.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch said the bottlers set the wholesale and vending prices,
but prices in stores and supermarkets are set there.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, scheduled for a jury trial in May, began as a
relatively simple case brought by Coke lawyers against one of Omni
Pacific's suppliers, a small family-run company in Canada, in 1996.
Brett Roberts, the lanky and colorful president of Omni Pacific,
said that after he provided a statement to Coke's lawyers, he was
added as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   For Roberts, who founded Omni Pacific and runs it from a
low-profile office building at the edge of a highway in Walnut
Creek, the experience of going up against Coke has been traumatic.
``I used to sit here at my desk and throw up into the trash can,''
he said. ``I got real paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers fled, some after receiving subpoenas from Coke's
lawyers. He himself was shocked by the initial lawsuit, he said,
since he had been exporting Coke for years unhindered. He began by
looking up law firms in the Yellow Pages. To cope with his
increasingly ragged emotional state, he said, he bought a gun, took
up meditation and started a Web site with details of the case. In
his wallet, he keeps a copy of a letter he received from a Coke
lawyer in 1997; he rereads it now and then for inspiration.
``Litigation,'' the lawyer, Frederick Whitmer, wrote, ``is not for
the squeamish.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for legal help, Roberts bounced around, racking up
six-figure bills from firms like O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, before Wineberg
took the case. Wineberg, a veteran antitrust lawyer whose trophies
include a $320 million settlement with oil companies in a
price-fixing case on behalf of Long Beach, Calif., brought the
countersuit on a contingency basis and has asked for more than $10
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Wineberg form an unlikely pair, although they share
a fondness for frequent cigarette breaks. Roberts is a
fast-talking, at times emotional 40-year-old who left rural Iowa at
18 and, once he saw the ocean, decided never to leave California.
Wineberg, a father of five, personifies the eminence grise,
strolling pensively in a trenchcoat near his office in downtown San
Francisco. Oliver falls somewhere between the two, closer to
Roberts in age but understated like Wineberg.
</P>
<P>
   Their joint odyssey has highlighted many internal business
decisions made by Coca-Cola. It has also raised the question of
whether the interests of shareholders in Coca-Cola Enterprises, in
which Coca-Cola holds a 39 percent stake, as well as other publicly
traded bottlers are being served by Coca-Cola's actions. Has Coke's
worldwide empire grown too large to be managed efficiently and
without conflict?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could live with CCE making an independent decision not to
sell to us, although we think it's in the economic interests of
their shareholders to sell to us,'' Wineberg said. ``We are saying
that it was pressure from the foreign bottlers that made Coke start
this vendetta.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch would not comment, citing the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Omni Pacific and Dependable have obtained a court order barring
Coke from using names or documents in the case to block supplies to
them. But it is happening anyway, Oliver said. ``I was told by one
of my sources that Coke lawyers called and told them to continue to
sell to me,'' he said. ``Then the lawyers called back after I
placed my order, and said, Don't deliver to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether there has been a breach of antitrust law is unclear.
``The real question is whether the law supports this case,'' said
Maxwell Blecher, an antitrust expert in Los Angeles. But Wineberg
said the damage to his clients' business was cause enough to show
the antitrust laws had been broken. ``There's no question that
consumers in Japan have been injured, but that's not what this case
is about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said Coke's dominance in Asia emboldened it to set high
prices, creating a market for companies like his. ``Other people
can come in with other Coke products that they have shipped halfway
around the world, and still undercut them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping those prices in place in Japan is a big chore for Coke,
Wineberg said. ``Our claim is that Coke has set up an agreement
among all of its bottlers that they won't compete with each other
in the sale of Coca-Cola products, and that is inhibiting Coca-Cola
Enterprises from competing with bottlers in places like Hong Kong
and Japan,'' he said, calling the arrangement a ``hub and spoke''
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Oliver say Coke was aware of their activities for
years. Oliver placed orders for Coke by the containerload from
bottling plants in Seattle, Denver and Jacksonville, Fla., and says
it became a problem only when a foreign bottler complained.
</P>
<P>
   His liaison in Jacksonville, he said, was a Coca-Cola executive,
to whom he sent ``supporting documents explaining who I was and
what I do,'' Roberts said. He bought up to 100,000 cases of soft
drinks a week until 1993, when he was cut off.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that Coca-Cola encouraged the practice because it
helped build sales overseas. His own customers were all over the
world. ``This is their way of profiting in those marketplaces,'' he
said. ``The Jacksonville plant manager told me that the only reason
he was able to fill these orders was that they were coming from
Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver continues to export Coke, but ``not nearly as much as we
want to,'' he said. Among his customers is Nagasaki, president of
an Osaka company called Panavac, which imported about 400,000 cases
of Coca-Cola Classic last year.
</P>

   ``I supply shops, vending machines and discount stores,''
Nagasaki said in a telephone interview, adding that no one from
Coca-Cola in Japan had ever objected. He's hardly the only company
importing American Coke, he added. Although consumers seem to be
switching to less sugary beverages, ``there is still good demand,''
he said.

   Meanwhile, the lawsuit wends its way toward trial.``It never
goes away,'' said Roberts, who has stopped selling Coke abroad. ``I
go to bed thinking about it, and I wake up thinking about it.''

TORMENTED, ALCOHOL-DRENCHED SOUL SOARS IN PRINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malcolm Lowry surely is one of the more tragic figures in the
pageant of authorship. He lived precariously and died pathetically
under the hot lava of a personal volcano, and the work for which he
will be eternally known is a mirror image of his own
self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Briton, Lowry (1909-1957) drank away much of his
tormented life in the Western Hemisphere _ in Mexico, Canada and
the United States (Hollywood). As an adolescent runaway, he put out
to sea and returned a few years later, a fully established
alcoholic. He managed a Cambridge education despite the creeping
disease, but drink caused the collapse of his youthful first
marriage, after which he was never sound emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultramarine,'' detailing his maritime adventures, was
published to little fanfare in 1933, and 14 years passed before
Lowry was again in print. He was writing all the while between his
titanic drinking bouts, often occupied with several novels
simultaneously and finishing none of them. For 10 or so years, he
was occupied fitfully with composition of ``Under the Volcano,'' a
fictional re-creation of his experience in Mexico in the late
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, he married a woman who believed in Lowry's worth as a
writer. She stayed with him to his end and proved indispensable to
his career, while he lived and also afterward. She helped him
organize the many shards of ``Under the Volcano'' into a narrative
shape. The novel appeared in 1947, breaking Lowry's long silence;
but when it sank almost without a trace, the author was plunged
into permanent despair. He kept on drinking, hopelessly addicted to
the Mexico-distilled mescal; but he also kept on writing. Five
years after Lowry's death, his widow was instrumental in obtaining
republication of ``Under the Volcano.'' This time it captured major
critical attention, and its star has ridden an upward trajectory
ever since. It now appears on every legitimate list of great
20th-century novels.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry essentially is a posthumous author. Following the
solemnization of ``Under the Volcano,'' other works began to appear
in print, ultimately forming a substantial body of work, much of it
impressive. His poems have been collected, and he is a considerable
poet. ``Lunar Caustic,'' relating a drying-out in New York's
Bellevue Hospital when his first marriage ended, was published
first and sensationally in France. The Lowrys lived frugally in
British Columbia from 1940 to 1955, but that stay was punctuated by
a return to Mexico in 1945. The visited provided the background for
``Dark Is the Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid,'' one of two notable
novels issued long after the author's demise. The other novel is
``October Ferry to Gabriola,'' and Lowry's stories are collected in
``Hear Us O Lord From That Dwelling Place.'' (His titles really are
seductive.) Other than ``Under the Volcano,'' Lowry's works have
attracted only a minority readership but are much admired.
</P>
<P>
   All of Lowry's writings are to some degree autobiographical,
perhaps most evident in ``Under the Volcano'' wherein the author's
alter ego is Geoffrey Firmin, a former British diplomat, now living
(dying) in Mexico and enslaved by mescal.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's cinematic structure includes flashbacks and shifts
in time sequence, all framed within a single day (symbolically, the
Day of the Dead) in November 1939. It is the last day of Firmin's
life, coinciding with the advent of the second World War.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is both allegorical and heavily symbolic, perhaps
justifying Lowry's own claim of pretentiousness. It also affirms
his literary education, revealing indebtedness to Greek tragedy,
Buddhism, Freud, Conrad, Joyce, Faulkner, Swinburne, Baudelaire and
other influences, not to exclude American movies.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of movies, there was a vested supposition that
``Under the Volcano'' should never be filmed, and the supposers
were right. Not even a director as resourceful as John Huston (in
1984) could translate visually Lowry's coruscating prose. The movie
also died at the box office, as downer movies often do.
</P>
<P>
   The book's a downer, too. Yet it's an oddly heroic testament to
one's quest for spiritual redemption, however fruitless. Malcolm
Lowry is a once and future author and ``Under the Volcano'' is a
dark treasure.

KEYES SAYS MORALITY CAMPAIGN WILL FIT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Alan Keyes knew he was traveling toward a political
landscape that differed from the one that gave him third place in
Iowa's Republican caucuses, but it was not apparent how different
until noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With snow and ice enveloping New England, Northwest Airlines
Flight 384, carrying Keyes on the second leg of his trip to New
Hampshire, was turned back 100 miles short of Boston. The plane
returned to Detroit, grounding the candidate along with hundreds of
other East Coast-bound passengers for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview aboard the plane, Keyes said he had no concern
about confronting a New Hampshire electorate that is not as driven
by the passions of the abortion issue as the voters in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a conservative constitutency,'' he said of New
Hampshire. ``They are interested in taxes, and the Second
Amendment, but the moral crisis is the issue. And if they look at
every Republican candidate in terms of moral values, they'll see
that I am the one who most effectively articulates these
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, as the Republican race moves halfway across the
country, the three candidates who made their opposition to abortion
the centerpiece of their campaigns in Iowa _ Keyes, Steve Forbes
and Gary Bauer _ will face new dynamics in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Claremont, N.H., does not have the same priorities as Colfax,
Iowa, and the New Hampshire seacoast towns will never be confused
with the river ports of Dubuque and Davenport. New Hampshire has
been roiled by issues such as taxes and gun control and nuclear
power, but rarely by abortion, a topic that is believed to be
paramount in the minds of 40 percent of the Republican caucus
voters in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at the grave of an abandoned fetus in Des Moines on
Saturday, Bauer was asked if abortion would be an issue in New
Hampshire. ``If I have anything to do with it, it will,'' he vowed.
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer, one of the veteran voices of the antiabortion
movement, finished a weak fourth in Iowa, and New Hampshire looks
like unfavorable terrain for him to resuscitate his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As the caucus results flowed into a Republican center in Des
Moines Monday night, Forbes' aides were elated over the returns
from the Christian conservative counties the publisher had
cultivated for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In Woodbury County which includesSioux City, a conservative
fortress, Forbes led Governor George W. Bush by more than 100
votes.
</P>
<P>
   All but abandoning the flat-tax theme he carried in 1996, Forbes
pitched his campaign again on abortion. As he traveled the rural
Iowa towns in the last week, Forbes pounded on the issue in the
company of another well-known antiabortion crusader, Phyllis
Schlafly.
</P>
<P>
   Schlafly was not with Forbes in New Hampshire Tuesday. The
candidate's spokesman, K. B. Forbes said in a phone interview that
he did not know if Schlafly would appear in the state, but he said
abortion ``will be part of our overall message'' in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes was skeptical about Forbes' use of the issue. ``His
commitment to prolife is strictly political,'' Keyes said Tuesday.
``We'll see what he does when he's not under the moral pressure''
of the Iowa conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who calls the acceptance of abortion the most destructive
element in America, was able to mobilize a unique following in
Iowa. Keyes, a black man and a communicant of the Catholic Church,
was supported by a constituency that barely exists in New
Hampshire: white working-class Protestants who hew to a
fundamentalist faith.
</P>
<P>
   At an election eve rally in West Des Moines, members of the
audience offered evangelical prayers and expressed disgust at a
moral decline they see at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   After his admirers boosted Keyes into third place in Iowa, he
said he would have new credibility in New Hampshire. ``It will
excite people who have been saying: `I like you, but I don't think
you can win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said it would be difficult to use issues such as tax-cut
proposals and trade to run against the Democrats in times of
economic prosperity. But President Clinton, he said, represents
``the moral crisis in this country.'' Once he makes it to New
Hampshire, Keyes promised he would continue his moral campaign.

ANALYSIS: MUSIC MERGERS HERALD A SHIFT TO THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good way to understand the fast-changing music business is to
look at its nomenclature. ``Product'' used to be the industry
jargon for recorded music. But recently ``product'' has been
replaced by another coldly clinical word: ``content.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction? Product is something physical that can be
packed in a box and shipped to stores. Content is something
intangible, converted into digital code, and posted on an Internet
site.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between these two words is the difference between
the music business last year and this year. When the Seagram-owned
Universal Music Group took over Polygram Music in late 1998 (then
the biggest merger in music history), Seagram was interested in
product: it wanted to expand its reach physically through
Polygram's international distribution network.
</P>
<P>
   But when the newly created AOL Time Warner further consolidated
its pop power by announcing plans this week to merge with EMI Group
(bringing together the immense music publishing arms of both
companies as well as the record labels), it was interested in
content.
</P>
<P>
   EMI's catalog includes the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Rolling
Stones, Frank Sinatra, Garth Brooks and hundreds more acts. If made
available for direct digital download online alongside Warner
Music's superstars (from Madonna to Led Zeppelin to the Eagles),
this music package could in theory hasten public acceptance of the
music computer file as an alternative to the CD.
</P>
<P>
   With industry executives talking of further consolidation among
major labels, it is clear that the music business is on the verge
of historic change. The traditional six major recording companies
have already been reduced to four and perhaps even fewer in the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
   The music business is cocooning. The big labels are contracting
as a vast Web is spinning around them. Emerging from this cocoon
will be either a world in which artists have more autonomy, a new
media oligopoly with an even heavier hand over music consumption,
or, more likely, the same creeping caterpillar that spun the cocoon
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   There is hardly a single popular recording artist who will not
be affected by these consolidations. The industry is bracing itself
for broad staff layoffs and canceled recording contracts that could
number in the hundreds. (Both were results of the
Universal-Polygram merger.) If the past is prologue, even bands
that are retained by the new megacompany will have to worry about
their releases and their corporate relationships getting lost in
the transition.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer run, many executives in the music and Internet
industries see the push toward mergers as forerunners of other
realignments across industry lines. In the long-term, what many
independent entrepreneurs considered the utopian dream of the
Internet as a musical free-for-all is disappearing day by day. In
1993 and 1994, when the entrepreneurs and college students began
forming companies to distribute music on the Web, there was one
cliche they beat into the ground: the Internet was going to level
the playing field, leaving artists and fans alike unbeholden to
what were then the big six record labels. But the giants have
arrived in Lilliput.
</P>
<P>
   But several executives at Internet music companies are excited
by the developments, which they said was the first major step
toward a new music distribution system. They also expected the
likely mergers and the ensuing artist cuts to make many acts more
wary of major labels and more willing to sign with independent
companies and Internet start ups.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not the only reason for mergers. The
consolidation is also a result of a maturing industry falling into
the general business pattern of growth through acquisition and
consolidation, a trend that has set the radio and concert
industries reeling in recent years. It is also a defensive move to
correct the imbalance caused by the powerful union of Universal and
Polygram.
</P>
<P>
   And strategically, expanding the vaults through mergers and
forming alliances with online partners (Bertelsmann, for example,
has been buying into Internet companies in Europe and Asia) is an
extension of the business practices, particularly the merging of
record companies, music manufacturing plants and distribution
companies, that led to the creation of major labels.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though some see the urge to merge as a well-thought-out plan, it
is also motivated by uncertainty about the expanded Universal and
the Internet. Among the fears: being left behind in a new era,
being too small to compete and being unable to show growth to
shareholders. This anxiety is compounded by uncertainty about how
the new technology will take hold. The Internet is probably the
biggest technological revolution in the industry since the
phonograph. And in preparation, content must be accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   What was a dream in the industry a year ago _ consumers paying
monthly fees for unlimited music as they do for cable television _
seems more like an imminent possibility now. Marc Geiger, the
proselytizing chief executive of the Internet site Artist Direct
Network, envisioned, in an interview this week, consumers buying
songs on America Online with the cost simply added to a monthly
bill that could include other charges, like phone calls and ATM
withdrawal fees. It is a plan much more conducive to mass purchases
than the current online system in which consumers must pay before
each song they download.
</P>
<P>
   The future, Geiger said, is a world in which record labels
``supply and market content, and what we're seeing now is the first
dribs and drabs of those deals in which digital distribution gets
unstuck,'' or supported.
</P>
<P>
   A small but relevant event took place as Time Warner, AOL and
EMI were attempting to cojoin: the major labels joined the
Recording Industry Association of America, to sue the Internet site
MP3.com for a service it offers called MyMP3.
</P>
<P>
   By subscribing to this service MP3.com users can access CDs they
buy online and in stores through a giant Internet database of
music, allowing them to hear the music anytime they are online. The
major labels claim that this storage violates their copyrights,
although MP3.com denies this. But they are also staring at the
future of music: instant access on demand anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The major labels want to dominate on the Web and if they do it
would be because they have the content. Their Secure Digital Music
Initiative is attempting to devise foolproof protection against
Internet music piracy, which even some members of the initiative
concede is an impossible goal.
</P>
<P>
   The current climate for mergers, then, may turn out to be less
about cooperation than about a battle over new technology. It would
pit record companies that want to do their traditional business
through the Internet as well as the record stores against a new
breed of online business people who see music as a loss leader for
profits through advertising, corporate sponsorships, subscription
fees and other sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online opened the door to use Internet stock to
purchase a company,'' said Goldberg of Launch. ``If other
traditional media companies start accepting Internet stock as
currency as well, a lot of things could get bought. It's not
inconceivable that we will see someone buying Seagram. They could
sell off the liquor company to someone else and the movies to
another buyer, and then keep the record company for themselves.''

STUDY SAYS DOUBLE-HORMONE TREATMENT A BREAST CANCER THREAT 
</HEADLINE>

 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A provocative new study suggests that menopausal women who take
both estrogen and another hormone called a progestin may increase
their risk of breast cancer more than by taking estrogen alone.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the study of more than 46,000 women, done by the
National Cancer Institute and published in the current issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, found that while
taking estrogen alone increased a woman's risk of breast cancer by
1 percent for each year of use, taking estrogen plus progestin
increased the risk 8 percent per year. If that's true, according to
an editorial accompanying the study, taking the combination therapy
for 10 years could increase breast cancer risk by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Women take hormone supplements at menopause to combat symptoms
such as hot flashes and to reduce the longterm risk of heart
disease and bone fractures caused by osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   But while some researchers not involved with the study said the
new results are troubling and should cause women to reassess their
use of hormone therapy, an alternate interpretation is that the NCI
study is too flawed to be meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Catherine Schairer of NCI's division of cancer
epidemiology and genetics, does fit with some other data, including
an updated report from the Nurses Health Study at Harvard, which
also suggests an extra risk for combining the two hormones, as many
women now do. (Doctors recommend that women take progestin with
estrogen to protect against the increased risk of uterine cancer
associated with estrogen alone; women who have had hysterectomies
do not need to add progestin.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though no study is definitive, the NCI study ``does
change the picture'' of the risks of hormone therapy, said Dr.
Walter C. Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the
Harvard School of Public Health, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the NCI research, Willett and his
Harvard co-authors Drs. Graham Colditz and Meir Stampfer conclude,
``The commonly held belief that aging routinely requires
pharmacological management has unfortunately led to neglect of diet
and lifestyle as the primary means to achieve healthy aging. Now is
an appropriate time to reassess this emphasis.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are other ways to look at the NCI data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this study gives us any new information,'' said
Dr. Nananda Col, director of the Women's Wellness Center at New
England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there were only 39 cases of breast cancer among
women taking the combination estrogen-progestin therapy for four
years or more _ not enough to provide compelling conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the NCI study looked mainly at women who took
progestin in a cyclical fashion _ taking the hormone for half the
month and skipping it for the other half, a pattern that some women
do not like because it induces regular bleeding. Some scientists
think that regular bleeding reduces the risk of uterine cancer
because potentially cancerous cells are shed along with the uterine
lining.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, many women who take combination therapy today take
both estrogen and progestin every day, a pattern that does not
induce bleeding, which many women prefer. It is not clear if the
study's results apply to such women.
</P>
<P>
   More controversially, the NCI researchers also analyzed their
results by the women's weight. A woman was considered heavy if she
had a body mass index of more than 24.4. (To calculate body mass
index, multiply weight in pounds by 703 and divide that figure by
height in inches squared.)
</P>
<P>
   When analyzed this way, the results become hard to interpret.
There was no increased breast cancer risk in heavier women whether
they took estrogen alone or in combination with progestin, said
Schairer. This may be because heavier women are already at
increased risk because fat tissue makes estrogen, which can drive
some breast cancers.
</P>
<P>
   In leaner women who were current or recent hormone users, the
increased risk of breast cancer was 3 percent per year with
estrogen alone and 12 percent per year on the combination therapy.
But this could merely reflect a detection bias _ it's easier to
find breast cancers on mammograms in thin women with small breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the NCI data actually found that among heavier
women, taking estrogen alone appeared to reduce annual breast
cancer risk ``which doesn't make any sense biologically,''
</P>
<P>
   notes Col.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also divided up their data into unusual chunks
of time. Most studies analyze results in five-year intervals _ five
years or more of hormone use, or five to 10 years and so on. The
NCI team used intervals of 2, 4, 8 and 16 years. ``This makes me
wonder whether they were juggling their cut points,'' said Col, in
other words, whether the researchers were re-grouping the data to
make the findings appear stronger.
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers' goal was to prove or disprove the
hypothesis that adding progestin to estrogen therapy at menopause
increases breast cancer risk, ``I am not convinced that they showed
this. Most of their reported findings did not reach statistical
significance,'' Col added.
</P>
<P>
   And why would adding progestin increase breast cancer risk in
the first place? Some researchers think progestin may drive the
proliferation of breast cells, but this is controversial.
</P>
<P>
   What does seem clear is that women who take hormones for relief
of menopausal symptoms like hot flashes for only two or three years
``should not be influenced by fear of cancer risks,'' as Willett
noted in the editorial.
</P>
<P>
   It is also clear that women who have had a hysterectomy should
not take combination therapy; in fact, it is already customary for
doctors to tell women without a uterus to take estrogen alone if
they want any hormone therapy at menopause.
</P>
<P>
   As always, specialists say, the bottom line is that women should
talk over risks and benefits of hormone therapy with their doctors
_ and to re-open this discussion periodically as they age. The
benefits of hormones may outweigh risks early in the menopausal
years but the ratio may change with longer term use.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, there are also other options _ diet and exercise
to control the risks of osteoporosis and heart disease, SERMS
(selective estrogen receptor modulators) such as raloxifene and
tamoxifen to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and breast cancer, and
other drugs to control cholesterol and strengthen bones.

INTERNET (Phoenix) - Steven Eric Townsend, 41, tidied his apartment
and showered, working off a ``to-do'' list on the day he was to
meet the 12-year-old girl he had been chatting with online. The
last thing on his list: ``Make love to Heather.'' He allotted four
hours. But Heather turned out to be a Phoenix Police officer, and
Townsend was charged with attempted sexual conduct with a minor.
While other states have laws against luring a child for sex over
the Internet, Arizona laws haven't kept up with the fast-pace of
technology. Pedophiles have, though. By KARINA BLAND. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DORMS (Phoenix) - Opinions were as prevelant as worn backpacks at
Arizona State University in Tempehours after the state Legislature
advanced a bill banning alcohol and late-night dorm room visits by
the opposite sex. ``They're trying to separate the boys and the
girls,'' said Annie Sarazin, a freshman marketing major. ``I don't
know if they're worried about kids having sex or what.''
Apparently, some legislators are. By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER and CHRIS
MOESER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FLORES (Phoenix) - Arizona doesn't pump enough money into bilingual
education and too many students new to English are forced into
classrooms with teachers not able to help them, a federal judge
ruled this week. However, U.S. District Judge Alfredo Marquez
didn't go so far to say the AIMS graduation test is discriminatory
and should be scrapped. Tim Hogan, co-counsel for the Nogales
parents responsble for the 1992 lawsui, said he may file another
now that the first batch of AIMS results are out and show some
minority groups struggled. By KELLY PEARCE. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
INTEL (Phoenix) - Amid expectations of strong sales of personal
computers for several years, Intel said Tuesday that it will build
a $2 billion chip-fabrication plant in Chandler, Ariz. The plant is
being designed to use three cutting-edge technologies to crank out
Intel's fastest personal computer chips when it begins production
next year. The plant would add 1,000 jobs to the Valley economy in
five to eight years, Intel said. By JONATHAN SIDENER and CHRIS
FISCUS. Story will move in the ``F'' category. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``A VAST CONSPIRACY'' &QL; 
By Jeffrey Toobin (Random House, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toobin's last book was about the O.J. Simpson trial. We've had a
hard time deciding whether he has come up in the world or plunged
to new depths by taking on this more recent tangle of thorns, the
Clinton sex scandal. In the end, of course, he has traded up _
there was no blood shed in the White House, merely a shedding of
judgment and esteem and familial accord. We spoke with Toobin after
the Simpson book was released, and he told us that as a lawyer he
was both horrified and fascinated by the trial, like a passing
motorist gaping at a terrible accident. This time, Toobin has
jumped out of his vehicle and is selling tickets, tour guide
extraordinaire. He covered the Clinton saga for ``The New Yorker,''
and he offers all the details, including Paula Jones' relentlessly
explicit descriptions of Clinton's flawed anatomy. And, of course,
we knew as we read it that we, like Toobin, were no longer just
driving by. We became part of the ghoulish scene. &QL; 
``AMERICAN FAN'' &QL; 
By Dennis Perrin (Spike, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   errin offends just about everybody in this look at sports in
America, and it's great fun watching him do it. Christians take a
beating in the section about ``religious'' athletes. Radio
talk-show hosts are taken to task for being ``White, male,
heavyset, obsessive, egomaniacal, brusque,'' and only once removed
from the people who call them. Shaquille O'Neal, Nike and college
basketball coaches (with ``Nike bucks stuffed in their G-strings'')
come under scrutiny in a chapter on sports marketing. Even Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa suffer under Perrin's analysis of the home
run race, during which ``Big Mac was the All-American boy . . .
(and) Sosa the Dominican was made his comic sidekick: less Sancho
Panza (McGwire was no wayward Quixote), more a smiling Tonto to
McGwire's Lone Ranger.'' Women are left out altogether, and we
should be grateful. ``I deal almost exclusively with male sports
and male fans,'' Perrin writes, ``for the simple reason that this
is where the true lunacy lies.'' &QL; 
``THE COMFORTS OF HOME'' &QL; 
By Merritt Ierley (Potter, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1799, the family of a Philadelphia woman named Elizabeth
Drinker purchased a ``shower bath'' _ a framework holding a
container of water that would fall on a bather's head when she
pulled a cord. It was an odd luxury. ``I bore it better than I
expected,'' Elizabeth wrote in her diary, ``not having been wett
(SIC, CORRECT) all over att (SIC, CORRECT) once for twenty-eight
years past.'' When Thomas Jefferson moved into the White House in
1801, there was only a privy out back. Jefferson, who had witnessed
innovations in modern convenience in France, requested that a water
closet be installed (it was, but not until 1804, leaving Jefferson
to suffer in the privy for three long years). Ierley charts the
evolution of comfort and convenience in the American home,
beginning with the turn of the 19th century; jumping to 1860,
before the mass-production spurred by the Civil War; and ending
with 1920s to the present, with America on the cutting edge of
household convenience. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``JAMES JOYCE'' &QL; 
By Edna O'Brien (Viking, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all its great writers, James Joyce's relationship with
Ireland is the most contradictory. ``He determined to reinvent the
city where he had been marginalized, laughed at and barred from
literary circles,'' O'Brien writes. ``He would be the poet of his
race. In one of his early verses he likened himself to a stag,
antlers charging upon the land.'' That sets the tone for this
wonderful volume from the ``Penguin Lives'' series of short
biographies. O'Brien reveals Joyce's tumultuous ties to his mother,
who bore 16 children, and to the Catholic Church; his sexual
appetite for Nora Barnacle, the common girl from Galway who would
be his wife (and who would never read beyond the first pages of
Ulysses; his attractions to other women; his struggle to find
acceptance for his work; and his self-absorption and eccentricity.
``He was a tragic man with a staggering genius for whom humor was a
weapon,'' O'Brien says. Or, as another writer put it, he was ``a
Dante who had lost the key to his own inferno.'' &QL;

VIVA LA FEMINISTA: WOMEN'S LIVES ARE SLOWLY IMPROVING IN MACHO
MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 RETRANSMITTING  
 
 By TANYA MIZRAHI  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not long ago, the Mexico City government tried to
make a switch. It called for a one-day experiment in which all
married women would exchange jobs with their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, husbands were asked to clean house, wash dishes, do
laundry and take care of kids.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that would have been unthinkable only a few years
ago, when Mexico's middle class was the confirmed center of
masculine privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But things are slowly changing in this homeland  &QL; 
of machismo.
</P>
<P>
   For example, beginning in August, 900 policemen in Mexico City
lost their authority to write traffic tickets. That authority was
given only to policewomen, who were deemed less corruptible by the
city's police chief.
</P>
<P>
   And consider some numbers: 50 percent of the people now
graduating from universities in Mexico are women, and half a dozen
women occupy high-ranking posts in Mexican governments, including
Rosario Robles, the first female mayor of Mexico City _ the biggest
city in the world _ and Rosario Green, Mexico's foreign relations
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The changes perhaps were best summed up by Monica Almazan, a
policewoman patrolling the Condessa neighborhood: ``Finally, we
have the opportunity to show the men that we can take on a job
which is supposed to be for men only. We now have the chance to
prove ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Is feminism taking root in the hard soil of Mexican culture? The
answer is complicated because it depends on what kind of feminism
you mean. But it is accurate to say that a Mexican women's movement
is emerging on the American model, with women making some gains in
industry and government, while still blocked by institutional and
cultural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that the struggle for women's rights in
Mexico is nearly as old as the country itself. &QL; 
GROWING INDEPENDENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It can be seen today in the growing independence of
working-class women along the border, and in a National Women's
Commission that is confronting stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Or in Mexico's efforts to improve family planning, because
unwanted teenage pregnancies are high and legal abortion is
restricted tightly.
</P>
<P>
   More women are entering legislative bodies and demanding more
laws to ban job discrimination and provide more money and health
care to women in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And in pop culture, women are flocking to male strip shows that
feature some of the country's biggest soap-opera stars, prompting a
Catholic priest in Guanajuato to admonish on the radio, ``Rush to
confession!''
</P>
<P>
   The events, and the history behind them, defy outside notions of
a nation content with machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Among what loosely might be called the Spanish aristocracy of
Mexico and, in a vastly different way, among its peasants and
working women, Mexico has been a cradle of feminism for the entire
Western Hemisphere. &QL; 
FIRST FEMINIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mexicans and feminists everywhere celebrated the 300th
anniversary of the death in 1695 of Sor (Sister) Juana Ines
(EDITORS: ACCENT over ``E'' in InEs) de la Cruz, often acknowledged
as the ``first feminist of the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sor Juana lived from 1651 to 1695 and now is regarded widely as
Mexico's greatest writer, akin to Shakespeare in the
English-speaking world. Her published works include more than 120
sonnets and ballads, many more short poems, three one-act dramas,
two comedies, more than two dozen prologues to plays and numerous
songs, carols and hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Her most popular work, however, is the poem that begins:
``Hombres necios que acusais (EDITORS: ACCENT MARK ove ``A'' in
acusAis) . . .'' _ ``You foolish men who accuse women . . .'' The
poem is memorized by literature students across Latin America
because it strikes at the heart of male attitudes toward women.
</P>
<P>
   But Sor Juana's best defense of women's role is found in a more
obscure work, a response to a bishop who had written a letter
attempting to silence her. (This work and the poem, ``Philosophical
Satire,'' are translated and edited by Electa Arenal and Amanda
Powell in ``The Answer/La Respuesta, Including a Selection of Poems
(by) Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz,'' City University of New York
Press).
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sor Juana was an aristocrat. More commonly, the tough
work for equality was performed by women who were literally in the
trenches, the ``soldaderas'' (soldiers), who included many officers
in their numbers and fought in the revolutionary armies of Pancho
Villa and Emiliano Zapata (their story has been preserved in a book
by Elizabeth Salas, ``Soldaderas: Mitos e Historia.''. Even today,
as soldiers in the largely Mayan independence movement in Chiapas
state, women take up arms, not least for the fact that Indian women
still may be sold into marriage for the equivalent of $400.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after the revolution, there were women such as
Benita Galeana, a grass-roots leader who led the first squatter
land-takeovers in Mexico City in the Depression years of the 1930s.
She was arrested 60 times and almost lost her eyesight from hunger
strikes while fighting for Mexican women's suffrage, which was
finally won in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the companera (TILDE OVER ``N'' in compaNera) in the
braids speak,'' was the cry in the 1930s when Benita Galeana would
come to address the crowds in Mexico City. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PRIMER FOR FEMINISTS
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she wrote her autobiography, ``Benita,'' which became a
primer for the women's movement. Her book and her legacy were
rediscovered in the 1980s, when Mexican women formed a coalition to
fight for democracy and an end to violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   Benita Galeana was able to unite working- and middle-class women
for the first time despite profound philosophical differences
between the two groups concerning the role of men and class in the
struggle. But even she wasn't able to bring the movement to the
point that the Mexican government would identify its own interests
with those of the women's movement. That took nearly three
generations of factory women, the foot soldiers of a blue-collar
cultural insurgency in Tijuana that is slowly spreading from the
border south into the rest of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by economic crisis, the immigration to the United
States of male heads of household and the demand for female
employees at border factories, these women, like Rosie the Riveter
of World War II America, were the first to break en masse into
Mexico's male-dominated industrial workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Their relative autonomy, accelerated by liberal U.S. social
attitudes and economic benefits that have drifted across the
border, has granted working-class women an unusual degree of
domestic clout and social freedom, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of progress are stirring themselves up much more
along the border,'' said Susan Tiano, a sociology professor at the
University of New Mexico and author of ``Patriarchy on the Line,''
a book on the effect of the ``maquiladoras'' on border gender
roles. ``Some amazing changes happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Women in Tijuana come and go as they please, working night
shifts and shopping at 24-hour supermarkets. Women hit the discos
on weekends, with or without male escorts. Some wear tight pants
and miniskirts. Unmarried mothers are not pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   There are serious social problems for women in the border
workplace. Low pay (the average wage is around 80 cents an hour,
and independent unions are discouraged), sexual harassment and
gender barriers to higher-paying jobs prevent factory women from
raising their status.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, including a number of U.S.-owned factories and
border-region ``maquiladora'' manufacturing plants, force job
applicants to take pregnancy tests and will hire them only if the
exams are negative. And although women's role in the workforce has
doubled to 30 percent since 1980, female workers still earn 25
percent less than men in the same jobs, says Elena Azaola, a social
anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is widely acknowledged that blue-collar women are
creating a new female archetype to reckon with in Mexican society,
and that has been lost neither on the government nor on
middle-class women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by
its Spanish acronym PRI, and its standard-bearer, President Ernesto
Zedillo, taking note of the fact that 70 percent of Mexicans who
are illiterate are women, announced a new social-service program
aimed primarily at women and girls. &QL; 
LEGISLATIVE GAINS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym
PRD, which focused heavily on women's issues in the past
presidential campaign, has been contributing to the rise of women
in Mexico's legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 elections, the party doubled its number of female
deputies in the lower house to 30, giving it the largest percentage
of female elected officials of any of the three major parties
represented in the 500-seat Mexican parliament.
</P>
<P>
   All of these changes contributed to the creation of a National
Women's Commission, intended to confront double standards. In 1998,
it launched an American-style advertising campaign questioning
whether society could advance if comments such as these were
allowed to go unchallenged:
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the director. I wonder how she got there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband can do what he wants, because he is a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you pregnant? I told you to take care of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the campaign offered statements affirming a new
attitude:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the director, and I did not sleep with anybody to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to sleep around to be a man, and I also use
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Machismo will not make for a smooth adjustment to any changes,
but some see change as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican man idolizes women as `the Mother,' and he will
not tolerate her being contaminated,'' said Alejandro Radchik,
president of the Psychoanalytic Society in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a society where `la casa chica' _ the little house for
the mistress _ is common, not because the husband no longer loves
his wife but because, once she becomes the mother of his children,
sex becomes a dirty act that will contaminate her,'' Radchik said.
</P>
<P>
   `The Mother is her own worst enemy. She is the one educating her
sons, the Mexican men, to be macho and preparing her daughters to
be good mothers and housewives.''
</P>
<P>
   How about the future? Many women believe there is good reason to
hope. With women representing 53 percent of Mexican voters,
presidential candidates campaigning for what is hoped could be the
most competitive democratic election in Mexican history in July,
middle-class women could achieve a measure of political power _
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, (the Mexican man) will react by trying to belittle
her and by being condescending,'' Radchik said. ``When this
attitude does not lead to his desired effect, he will acquiesce to
this new feminine authority.'' &QL;

 &HT;    BUDGET EXPERTS DOUBLE PREVIOUS PROJECTED SURPLUS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal budget surplus is on track to hit as
much as $1.9 trillion over the next ten years, double what was
projected just last summer, congressional budget experts said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue windfall sets the stage for a bare knuckles election
year debate between President Clinton and his Republican foes in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the new estimate, Clinton said he will propose a
budget plan to pay off the government's $3.3 trillion publicly-held
debt by 2013, two years sooner than he had previously projected.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans immediately repeated their calls for tax cuts
mixed with more modest debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The good budget news is based on expectations that the economy,
which has been expanding for nearly nine years, will continue to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties rushed to take credit for the budget gold
rush, and to stake their claim on a politician's dream: unexpected
money to promise their constituents months before the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to propose, as I did last time, a set of tax cuts
that I think are targeted to the middle class,'' Clinton told
reporters at the White House. ``But I think the most important
thing . . .is to keep our fiscal discipline, to keep paying down
the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that much of that surplus amounts to an
overcharge. Their solution: a hefty tax cut, along with a plan to
pay down 60 percent of the country's publicly-held over the coming
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's pretty fair,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., told reporters on Capitol Hill. ``When you
ask a generation to pay the debts of the previous three or four
generations, you're asking them (to pay taxes) that they really, in
a sense, never owed.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposing views marked the early battle lines in a partisan
feud likely to define much of this year's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and his Republican foes have pledged not to touch
the Social Security trust fund _ Tuesday's estimates by the
Congressional Budget Office do not include such funds _ and to
devote some of the expected revenue windfall to shoring up the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Where the two sides depart sharply, however, is over how much of
the projected budget surplus to spend or to give back in tax cuts,
and how much to shovel into debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four decades of running budget deficits, the
federal government is the world's largest debtor. It has piled up a
staggering $5.8 trillion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, $2.5 trillion is money the government essentially owes
to itself, through various trust funds and other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $3.3 trillion, however, is money owed to banks and
other private investors. Paying interest on that portion, called
publicly-held debt, will cost taxpayers more than $220 billion this
year.
</P>
<P>
   With calls for expanding government spending on education, crime
prevention, social services and tax breaks for low-income
Americans, Clinton has proposed spending increases of tens of
billions of dollars for the budget he's preparing to submit to
Congress in February. He'll elaborate on those plans Thursday
night, when he addresses the country in his final State of the
Union address before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By avoiding a large across-the-board tax cut, however, Clinton
said the government can pay off the publicly-held debt by the year
2013.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be debt-free for the first time since 1835,'' said
Clinton, ``when our nation just had 24 states and fewer than 15
million people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed using much of the interest savings on that
debt to shore up the Social Security trust fund, a plan the White
House claims would keep the massive public retirement fund solvent
for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is well beyond the life of most baby boomers,'' said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Teeing up the ball for his State of the Union address, Clinton
said his approach to debt reduction has helped hold down interest
rates. According to CBO numbers, the government has paid down $153
billion in debt over the past two years. That has meant an average
savings of $2,000 a year in mortgage payments for American
families, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Staying the course is the best approach, said Clinton. His
message was meant to bolster the presidential prospects for Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore and I set our nation on a new path of
fiscal responsibility,'' said Clinton. ``Now is not the time to let
up on a strategy that is plainly working.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted, though, that Clinton's approach leaves out
a critical constituency: the workers and corporations whose taxes
are projected to swell the government coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That raises the question...what is going to happen to that
surplus,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only three things that can happen to that surplus,''
said Gorton. ``It can be spent; it can be returned to the American
people, in the form of tax relief; or it can go to the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton favors tax cuts, as do others in his party. Republican
presidential hopeful Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, for example, has
proposed a tax cut of roughly $500 billion over ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer the Republican-controlled Congress approved a
$792-billion tax cut over ten years. Clinton vetoed the cuts,
saying they would dig too deeply into a surplus that, at the time,
was expected to total roughly $1 trillion over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's estimates of roughly double that amount, even
Republicans will be debating how to divvy up the unexpected
surpluses, with a likely eye toward even greater tax cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be divided between those who believe that the maximum
number of these dollars should continue to go to pay down the debt,
which has such a positive impact on our economy,'' said Gorton,
``and those of us who believe that the money should not be taken
out of the pockets of the American people in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gorton, ``the great temptation here is that if the money
comes in, you know, we're going to spend it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRIMACK, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush was between chapters of
his candidacy, en route from a state that he had handily won to a
state that he could easily lose, and it provided both pause and
cause for reflection.
</P>
<P>
   As midnight came and went and he flew east in his chartered
16-seat plane, Bush mulled over what he was doing well in his quest
for the presidency and what he could be doing better, what was
fueling his optimism and what was worrying him, the distance he had
traveled and the distance left to go.
</P>
<P>
   The first state contest, the Iowa caucuses, were now behind him.
New Hampshire and a fierce battle with Sen. John McCain loomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Bush asked the four reporters accompanying him overnight
Monday, ``what do you want to know about my mood?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a teasing remark, punctuated by a facial expression of
mock exasperation, but it quickly gave way to more serious
ruminations.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor predicted he would emerge victorious from New
Hampshire and said his strategy there would change slightly this
week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to contending that his proposal for tax cuts is
superior to McCain's, Bush said he planned to devote more time to
talking about education, in which he believes he has shown greater
interest than the Arizona senator has. Although the two candidates'
aides have accused their counterparts of unfairly negative attacks,
Bush pledged anew that he would not let the contest turn ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to intensify some,'' he said, but he added, ``I'm
not going to let it get personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking farther down the road, Bush expressed confidence about
winning the Republican presidential nomination and, beyond that,
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate conservatism, he said, was a message that was
striking chords in voters. His campaign organization was
formidable. And, despite the strong statements against abortion
that he made in Iowa last week, Bush insisted that he had not yet
taken any positions that he would change in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Had Vice President Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you, if he has, he'll surge to the middle,'' Bush
said. ``He'll change his stripes in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added, ``I don't change stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore posted a victory in Iowa that was arguably more impressive
than Bush's, trouncing Bill Bradley by a margin of almost 2-1. Was
there any lesson in that showing that Bush should heed?
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the unions are very strong in a caucus state,'' he
replied. ``Why would it send a signal to me? It ought to be sending
a signal to Bill Bradley is who it sends a signal to.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that sounded arrogant or dismissive, there were as many
moments in a wide-ranging, hourlong interview when Bush sounded
humble and there were several striking confessions or glimpses of
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that he could improve as a candidate by working to
become ``completely conversant on every single question that you
might ask me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever get there,'' he added, implying that
there are always going to be bits of knowledge outside a given
individual's possession. ``It's an impossible task.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush insisted that he had not been as flustered as many
reporters perceived him to be in a news conference that focused on
abortion last week, he said he could use some work on his poker
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sometimes very good about hiding my emotions,'' he
said. ``I'm like anybody else _ I've got moods and feelings.
Sometimes, I'm tired.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, the 53-year-old candidate returned
repeatedly to the subjects of depleted energy, genuine fatigue and
the difficulty of being away from home for long stretches while he
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush schedules small pockets of rest on many days but he said he
does not sleep well away from home and has suffered for it.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, ``I was exhausted; I was dead tired,'' he said at one
point.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he said, ``This last week was hard. We were on
an airplane every day, traveling, getting back late at night, and
it was strenuous. It took a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point he characterized the days leading up to the New
Hampshire primary on Feb. 1 as a ``test of stamina'' that would
require him and other candidates to ``dig down deep into our
reservoir of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the next important marker after New Hampshire,
Bush said: ``I'll tell you where my sights are. What I'm really
looking forward to is having a long weekend in my own home.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who can sometimes come off as a swaggering cowboy,
revealed a habit that seemed out of sync with that aura: he takes a
feather pillow from his bed on the road with him, and keeps it in
its own bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you all bring your own pillows?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush even talked about drinking too much in the past and
quitting at the age of 40, about the time he began to spend more
time reading the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he visited a faith-based rehabilitation center for
drug and alcohol abusers in Colfax, Iowa, and, in subsequent days,
he often cited that campaign stop as one of the most meaningful he
has made.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane he said: ``It did get to me. It got to me a lot. It
was a reconfirmation, a reaffirmation, of the redemption I
personally sought.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a high-energy person, and I'm using my energy in better
ways,'' the governor continued. ``And when you drank, at least when
I did _ occasionally _ all I'd be interested in doing was sitting
around and having a drink or two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not need alcohol to play the cutup. When he left the
reporters in the back of the plane and returned to his seat in the
front, he put on an eye mask for sleeping. But before he dozed off,
he stood up and made a show of walking like a blind man.
</P>
<P>
   He is an intrinsically merry man, and no fool about the
manipulation of opinion, so he cast what had happened in Iowa and
what he hoped would happen in New Hampshire in the most positive of
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes had drawn many religious
conservatives in Iowa away from Bush. But, he said, that did not
mean that those voters necessarily disliked him.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Forbes' second-place finish was stronger than some analysts
had thought it would be. But Bush said that had little bearing on
the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last polls I've seen show John and me deadlocked around 37
percent,'' Bush said, referring to McCain. ``That doesn't leave a
lot of the vote left to carve up.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As for his battle with McCain, Bush said he thought it was still
in flux.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people walk up to me at these events and say, `I was
leaning to McCain, I heard you speak, I'm leaning to you,' and it
leads me to believe that you'd go hear McCain and say the same: `I
was McCain, now I'm Bush, now I'm McCain, now I'm Bush.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he continued, sounding weary but excited, ``this is
going to be a very interesting week.''

STUDY: HIGH-RISK, LOW-INCOME FLU PATIENTS MORE LIKELY TO BE
HOSPITALIZED 

</HEADLINE>

By LEIGH HOPPER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Low-income individuals with chronic lung problems are
eight times more likely to require hospitalization when they come
down with the flu or other respiratory illnesses than middle-income
people with the same health conditions, according to a study
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cause-and-effect relationship between poverty and
hospitalization is unclear, ``it teaches us we need to be more
diligent in delivering flu vaccines to high-risk patients,'' said
the study's lead investigator, Dr. Paul Glezen of Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston. ``It underlines a need for providing ongoing
health care for low-income people.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor researchers looked at 1,029 patients from two Harris
County Hospital District clinics and two clinics in the
Kelsey-Seybold medical group who were hospitalized with acute
respiratory illness between 1991 and 1995. The county clinics serve
a low-income clientele and the Kelsey-Seybold clinics serve
middle-income and affluent families.
</P>
<P>
   The acute illnesses included in the study were influenza,
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza, a group of
viruses that includes measles, mumps and croup.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of individuals in the study had chronic lung
problems _ asthma in children and obstructive pulmonary disease in
adults _ but the low-income group had other underlying conditions
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one percent of the low-income patients with chronic lung
disease had at least one other high-risk condition, such as
diabetes, congestive heart failure or hypertension, compared with
7.3 percent of the middle-income patients with chronic lung
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a direct effect of lack of income? Not getting regular
care? Compliance with medication?'' said study co-author Dr.
Stephen Greenberg, chief of infectious disease at Ben Taub General
Hospital in Houston. ``We need to start looking at issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Glezen, a pediatrician at Ben Taub and a professor of molecular
virology and microbiology at Baylor, believes the high
hospitalization rates can be blamed on low-income patients not
receiving regular treatment for ongoing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't go in (to see a doctor) until they are really sick,
so they don't have good preventive management,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said development of a flu vaccine that also provides
immunity to parainfluenza and RSV could help keep people out of the
hospital. Wider use of relatively expensive antiviral drugs, such
as Tamiflu and Relenza, which can lessen flu's severity and reduce
complications, could also prove cost-effective, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The study appears in Wednesday's issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.

   This is one of those rare columns that you _ you being the
parent of a video-gamer, you poor, broke soul _ are gonna wanna cut
out and stash somewhere. Birthdays are coming up, report cards are
coming out, you haven't had to clean up any broken glass in a week
or so _ it's reward time. So here are the top 10 vidgames your
little shining star's gonna want in 2000:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pokemon Silver and Gold: With a new movie coming out July 21
and the forthcoming Pokemon Stadium Nintendo 64 title (which we'll
get to in a sec), Pokemania is far from dying. The sequels to Red
and Blue, which will introduce the new Pikachu Baby (uh, did I just
spoil something?), will be two of the year's hottest games. Better
order 'em now.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pokemon Stadium: The Nintendo 64's version of the Pokemon Game
Boy titles. Using a Transfer Pak, which will be, of course, sold
separately, players will be able to upload characters from the
hand-held versions. Out March 6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sega Rally 2: Championship: Sporting 16 courses and 19 cars,
Sega's phenomenally popular and profoundly realistic on- and
off-road racing game hits the Dreamcast. Out now.
</P>
<P>
   _ South Park Rally: Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny _ as well as
all the other demented characters in the South Park family _ duke
it out on the racetrack. Out now for PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disney's Princess Fashion Boutique: Girls ages 5 and up create
3-D models of themselves. Sounds goofy, but the thing's hot. Out
now for PC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Crazy Taxi: What a great idea: Drive a taxi around a busy
city, picking up passengers and scoring points by getting 'em to
their destinations on time. Rack up more points by driving against
traffic, swerving around corners and flying down the street _
literally. Out Feb. 1 on Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   _ NHL 2K: Sega Dreamcast's NFL and NBA 2K did groundbreaking
wonders for the football and b-ball genres last year. Hockey's
next. What little has leaked out about NHL 2K _ Plexiglass
reflections, re-creations of player mugs _ sounds promising. Can't
wait till Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   _ Star Wars: Episode I Jedi Power Battles: The third Episode I
title pits Jedis against an army of, well, anti-Jedis. Hope it's
better than the first two stinkers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tarzan: Already available on PlayStation, Disney's Tarzan _
based on the recent animated movie _ morphs over to the N64. Same
premise (vine-surf, battle critters, save Jane), better graphics.
Challenging enough for all ages. Out Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tech Romancer: Japanese-animation action/adventure title. Hope
the stunning graphics are as good as the gameplay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anything for the PlayStation 2, which launches this fall.
PlayStation 2's frontline of games will include the racing title
Gran Turismo 2000, the way-awaited fighter Tekken Tag Tournament
and the role-playing game Final Fantasy 9. Got about $300 handy?

A HARD LOOK AT THE YEAR 2000

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Now that we've given the Millennium a
breather and the ``I remember'' stories are behind us, it's time to
make a few predictions for the wine world of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   New releases to watch
</P>
<P>
   _ Bordeaux: The 1997 reds are beginning to arrive and it's an
average year: a vintage to drink, not collect. Unfortunately, the
wines were heinously overpriced two years ago when the Asian
economy was thriving. The best '97s in general are from St-Emilion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Burgundy: Early reports on the 1997 red burgundies call it a
spotty vintage, offering some of the best and some of the worst
wines of the just-completed decade. Prices remain astronomical, so
collectors should buy carefully. As for whites, 1997 is considered
an excellent vintage: superior to the 1998s that will begin to
trickle into the market later this year, but generally a notch
below the 1995s and 1996s. Prices again are steep, so consumers
should buy carefully. Watch for tasting reports.
</P>
<P>
   _ California: While the 1998 wines are generally a notch below
the excellent 1997s, California continues its winning streak. The
'97 cabernet sauvignons are beginning to arrive and are among the
best of the 1990s vintages. The 1998 pinot noirs, zinfandels and
merlots _ just beginning to be released _ are spottier than the
1997s, so tread carefully. The 1998 chardonnays are superb but the
'99s will arrive soon and vintners are providing mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   _ Italy: Fans of chianti and the reds of Piedmont _ barolo and
barbaresco _ have much to rejoice as the 1997s begin to arrive. The
vintage is considered one of the best in decades. The downside:
Prices are out of control.
</P>
<P>
   _ Port: The 1990s has had a string of excellent vintages and the
1997s _ just being released _ are among the best of the decade, if
not the century. The wines seem to have the best of both worlds
ripe fruit and dense, complex tannins, which means they can be
appreciated now but the best is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chile &AMP; Argentina: If you think you've heard it all from these
two countries, think again. They are just getting started. Sure,
companies like Kendall-Jackson Vineyards and Robert Mondavi Winery
are there in a big way, but their efforts pale compared to the
horde of European wine conglomerates such as Castel Freres that are
just beginning to see their investments pay off. And in many cases
those European companies are more diversified and have better
distribution channels than the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux and Burgundy prices
</P>
<P>
   Expect prices to remain stagnant. With the American economy
continuing to soar, Bordeaux prices are probably safe from price
drops, even though the average-quality 1997s entering the market
are wildly overpriced. Interest is lukewarm at best, so warehouses
are backed up with Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Bordeaux, after three years of dramatic increases,
prices for futures of the 1998s were down 10 to 25 percent from the
1997s. Ironically, the '98s are far superior to the '97s. Prices
may drop for '97s as collectors look to the '98s and those from
1999, considered another fine vintage in early reports.
</P>
<P>
   Burgundy price trends generally follow Bordeaux. Prices dropped
slightly, but ended three years of 20- to 40-percent successive
rises.
</P>
<P>
   California prices
</P>
<P>
   The expensive wines will get more expensive and the cheaper
wines will get _ if not cheaper, at least better. That, in a
nutshell, is what industry analyst Jon Fredrikson sees for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high end will continue to do well,'' the San
Francisco-based analyst said. Crop sizes were down in '98 and '99
compared to '97 and demand remains steady for the top end, which
means there may be some price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``With wines under $7, there will be a heyday for consumers,''
Fredrikson says. ``The consumer especially in the 1.5-liter and
fighting varietals will be getting more for his money.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond cabernet
</P>
<P>
   California talks the talk about being on the cutting edge but
its stuck in the same cabernet and chardonnay rut. At least syrah,
unlike sangiovese, is living up to its promise.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, you'll be reading and _ with any luck tasting _ a new
wave of wines made from offbeat varieties from up-and-coming
regions. From Uruguay, there's the tannat grape and from southwest
France there's the Beaujolais-like fer servadou (also known as
braucol). And from Portugal, there's ferna pires, which makes
attractive, fresh and lemony wines.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hype about 1999 being the year for wine
e-commerce, 2000 will be the real test. Wine.com had a great
holiday '99 season, but it didn't have much competition. Two other
deep-pocket wine e-commerce sites, WineShopper.com and Drinks.com,
didn't make it out of the starting gate in '99, and now say they'll
launch later this winter. It's going to be an interesting year.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate shipping will continue to be a cantankerous issue but
don't expect anything dramatic from Washington in an election year.
But pressure will continue to build in 2000, fueled largely by the
explosion of the Internet and e-commerce, as wine lovers around the
United States continue to demand their piece of the action. Expect
more lawsuits filed in more states challenging bans on shipping.

STATUE TO HONOR TOUGH TEXAS RANGER JACK HAYS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Texans think of Texas Rangers _ the lawmen, not the
baseball team _ they often think of Deaf Smith, Rip Ford or Ben
McCulloch, historians in San Marcos say. But not very many think of
Jack Hays.
</P>
<P>
   That's bothersome because San Marcos, Texas, is the county seat
of Hays County, and historians would like the locals to know why.
</P>
<P>
   Hays wasn't a rough-and-tumble-looking Ranger like some of his
compatriots. He wasn't the quintessential horseman with the
upturned brim on his hat. In fact he was kind of soft and gentle
looking. But he successfully fought in battles alongside Smith,
Ford and Sam Houston, and was considered one of the Ranger's
toughest Indian fighters.
</P>
<P>
   His battles against Mexican forces are legendary. U.S. forces
often had to be used to pull Hays' men off retreating Mexican
forces. In return, the Mexican forces showed no mercy when they
faced the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Hays and a small crew of surveyors were credited with holding
off a force of 100 Comanches during an attack at Enchanted Rock in
Central Texas. Later, some historians doubted the battle.
</P>
<P>
   When Hays retired from the Rangers, he moved to California, and
Texas named a county after him. Now, to jog everyone's memory, the
county wants to honor the former Ranger with a statue on the
courthouse lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Hays County historians want the people to know more about their
namesake. They would at least like for the locals to know what he
looked like, what he did to help secure independence and safety for
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was 1849 when Hays left Texas, and memories of him
have dimmed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a legend that says he was here once,'' said Frances
Stovall, a local historian and author. ``I wasn't able to ever
substantiate his presence here, but I think the story will stand
nevertheless.''
</P>
<P>
   Stovall is one five authors who wrote ``Clear Springs and
Limestone Ledges, A History of San Marcos and Hays County.'' She is
also past president of the Hays County Historical Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people around here know about Hays, and I guess I get
a little bit red-headed when I hear people say he needs more
attention. During the formation of the county, Gen. Edward Burleson
protected the people around here and I think we ought to be doing
more about him. I can document that he was in 30 battles and never
received a single battle wound.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hays, like most Rangers, is a colorful figure, and after
all, they named the county Hays, not Burleson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's going to happen,'' Stovall said of the proposed
statue. ``I'm glad of it, I just hope we can get one of Burleson.''
</P>
<P>
   A local sculptor and historian, Jason Scull, has been
commissioned to do the sculpture and has prepared a miniature of
his proposed depiction of Hays. He has the Ranger astride a horse,
wearing a buckskin jacket and carrying a revolver in his right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Scull said he studied photos of Hays to capture the Ranger's
physical features.
</P>
<P>
   The Hays statue was unanimously endorsed by Hays County
commissioners this month and now must go before the Texas
Historical Commission for approval. It will be presented to the
historical commission by members of the new nonprofit group, the
John (Jack) Coffee Hays Sculpture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to sell 40 miniature statues as a limited
edition offering to help pay for the project which is estimated to
cost about $125,000. The monument, which is designed to be 14-feet
tall, is expected to be unveiled by March or April next year.

PBS'S ART SERIES PROVOKES THOUGHT, BUT TAKE IT SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, college classmates were forever touting Art
Appreciation as the quintessential easy A. It was easier, they
said, than Geology 101 (a k a Rocks for Jocks), even easier than
Introduction to Advertising. Sadly, I never squeezed Art
Appreciation into my schedule. Not because I preferred the
rigorous, easy-C curriculum of the student/masochist. I just
couldn't study Art Appreciation and Athletic Officiating at the
same time. Scheduling conflict, I guess. Thus, while I took
immediate satisfaction in flagging Sigma Chi for lining up offside
in an intramural football game, I took years to appreciate da
Vinci's mastery of linear perspective.
</P>
<P>
   My bad luck. Happily, a four-part PBS series called ``Culture
Shock,'' airing tonight and next Wednesday on KCTS/9, goes a long
way toward plugging the gaps in my appreciation of the arts. More
important, and unlike the easy-A courses we cherished as college
sophomorics, ``Culture Shock'' provokes thought. A whole lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   The series targets four areas of artistic endeavor _ literature,
painting, film and music _ and poses questions that aren't easily
answered. Is Mark Twain's ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' a
brilliant satire or a pernicious embodiment of stereotypes? Who
decides if art is good? Do films reflect social behavior, or cause
it?
</P>
<P>
   With its annoying penchant for cramming too much into one night,
PBS threatens to make ``Culture Shock'' a chore instead of a
pleasure. Viewers reluctant to commit to Wednesday night's 2 and a
half hour package or next week's two-hour pairing should know that
there are four distinct parts to ``Culture Shock,'' and that
viewing one segment at a time, with sufficient room for subsequent
thought and discussion, is preferable to watching two segments back
to back. So, for those who'd like to set the VCR to take a more
leisurely approach to art appreciation, here's the schedule as
defined by PBS, but be warned: Other affiliates might air them
differently.
</P>
<P>
   _``Born to Trouble: `Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'''
Wednesday night at 9.
</P>
<P>
   _``The Shock of the Nude: Manet's `Olympia,''' Wednesday night
at 10:30.
</P>
<P>
   _``Hollywood Censored: Movies, Morality &AMP; the Production Code,''
Feb. 2 at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _``The Devil's Music: 1920s Jazz,'' Feb. 2 at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's opener, the discussion of ``Huckleberry Finn'' is
placed into intriguing perspective. Universally panned by critics
for its shocking use of vernacular English in the late 19th
century, it wasn't until the 1930s and '40s that it was given a
place of high honor in the American literary canon. More recently
vilified for its casual and disconcerting use of the ``N word,''
critics question the wisdom of incorporating it into high school
literature courses when it obviously causes pain and raises
self-esteem issues among students of color.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Edouard Manet's painting, ``Olympia,'' set Paris
society on edge in 1865 not because it depicted a nude woman, but
because it depicted a nude woman in direct contravention of
contemporary artistic principles.
</P>
<P>
   Manet's nude doesn't just lie there like those of the great
masters before him. She stares back: challenging, questioning,
confronting, suggesting. It was disturbing then, and it's a little
unsettling even today.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make it great art? The experts think so. But that's
the great thing about art. What delights some disturbs others and,
as ``Culture Shock'' generously points out, the best art does a
little of both.
</P>

surrounding great works of art. Wednesday and Feb. 2 on PBS. Check

SUPPORTERS CONDEMN BEIJING'S CLAIM THAT JAILED U.S. SCHOLAR HAS
CONFESSED
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese government officials said Tuesday that a
U.S.-based scholar who has been in a Beijing prison for the last
six months has confessed to vague charges of providing confidential
information to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Song Yongyi, a research librarian at Dickinson College in
Carlisle, Pa., was in China collecting documents relating to his
specialty, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when he was detained
and imprisoned on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged on Dec. 24 with ``the purchase and illegal
provision of intelligence to foreigners,'' a charge that has
mystified academics here and in the United States, since original
documents from that tumultuous period in Chinese history are
readily available in street markets and circulate freely.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, a Foreign Ministry official
defended the government's case again Song and gave more details,
implying that Song had admitted to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present, Song has confessed what he has done and the
judicial department in China is now handling the case,'' said Zhu
Bangzao, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. Zhu noted that
Song had ``undermined China's national security'' by ``secretly
transferring abroad materials and documents'' weighing about 700
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Academics and lawyers involved in the case outside China reacted
angrily to the statement. Legal advisers in the case said that from
the start, Song had admitted that he was in China buying materials
related to the Cultural Revolution but had denied that these
activities were in any way criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is totally misleading,'' said Jerome Cohen,
an expert on Chinese law who is a legal adviser in the case on
Song's behalf. ``As far as we know there has been no confession. He
has maintained for months that he's sent dozens and dozens of books
back _ that was his job and that would weigh 700 pounds. And we are
puzzled at the characterization of this material as `state
secrets.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Song was formally charged only with ``providing
confidential information to foreigners,'' a far less serious charge
than ``endangering national security'' or ``revealing state
secrets'' _ the terms used Tuesday to describe crimes that can
carry long prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The case is currently under review by the prosecutor's office,
which will either issue an indictment or dismiss the case for lack
of evidence. Last week the government said that Song's case would
move forward within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Tuesday, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., condemned the
Foreign Ministry statement. ``China has absolutely no credibility
in its claim that Yongyi Song confessed,'' Specter said in a
statement of his own, adding that any confession ``is suspect as
being coerced when he is held in detention for months without an
opportunity to confer with counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Song's family, lawyers and supporters have complained that he
has not yet been allowed to see a lawyer despite repeated requests,
a violation of China's criminal procedure code.
</P>
<P>
   David Strand, a historian and a colleague of Song at Dickinson
College, who has organized China scholars world-wide into a massive
letter writing campaign to secure Song's release, said Song's older
brother was permitted to visit him last week. At that time, Song
was ``very resolute in proclaiming his innocence'' and ``in no
respect acknowledged any guilt,'' said Strand.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   China scholars frequently travel here to obtain materials like
those presumably collected by Song, who was still a Chinese citizen
at the time of his detention, but was scheduled to become an
American citizen in one month.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cultural Revolution is regarded as one of modern
China's greatest embarrassments _ Mao Zedong ordered schools
closed, intellectuals jailed and millions of urban youths sent off
to the countryside _ it has long since officially been declared a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural Revolution paraphernalia are widely available at street
markets and curio shops, including some letters, documents and
newspapers from that turbulent period.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's statement, the Foreign Ministry spokesman suggested
that Song had been doing more than collecting Cultural Revolution
material, noting that the material he collected dated from 1966 to
1982, ``far exceeding the period of the Cultural Revolution, which
he claimed to be studying.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cultural Revolution formally ended in 1976, a decade after
it was launched by Mao.

   HOLLYWOOD-ROYALS (Undated) _ Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf, the
wastrel heir to a shipping fortune in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
is the purest example of an upper-class American golden boy to
appear in the movies in a long time. His female counterpart in
Anthony Minghella's portrait of rich young Americans abroad in the
late 1950s is Cate Blanchett's Meredith Logue, a textile heiress
bouncing around from one swell European hotel to another.
Hollywood's fondness for casting British actors as upper-class
Americans belongs to a long and duplicitous Hollywood tradition of
pretending to erase class differences while actually celebrating
them. By Stephen Holden. &QL;

   COMIC-GENIUSES-FILMS (Undated) _ Humankind used to produce two
or three geniuses per century. Now, it gives us a couple of dozen
per month. Last November's Genius issue of Esquire showcased those
men and women ``transforming our civilization,'' including the NBA
point guard Allen Iverson and the brilliant Leonardo _ not Da
Vinci, but DiCaprio. Today, everyone and his dog is a genius.
Nowhere is this inflation more evident than in current comic
cinema. ``Comic genius'' Jim Carrey (Time magazine) appears as

   EUROPE-FILMS (Paris) _ For all the ardent nationalists battling
American cultural and capitalist incursions, a new generation of
Europeans is living and working across the 15 borders of the
European Union, using the Internet, speaking ``American'' to their
children the way the Russian aristocracy used to speak French _
global citizens whose lives take place, at least some of the time,
in English. There is a struggle going on to create a cultural
identity for this united Europe, and one of its arenas is the
European film. If defining that identity now is more elusive
artistically, financially and geographically than ever before, one
thing is certain: the film will be in English. By Kristin

   BLAIR-BROWN-THEATER (Undated) _ With the slow decline of the
Broadway play, and the dearth of musical roles for women over 50, a
middle-aged actress expecting to find steady, varying work on
Broadway might be a candidate for some sort of professional
intervention. So what is to be made of the unconventional
trajectory of Blair Brown, the erstwhile star of television sitcoms
(``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd'') and of movies (``Altered
States'') who has reinvented herself as, a Broadway actress? Last
year, she scored a critical triumph in ``Cabaret,'' replacing Mary

   ROBERT-SHAW-MUSIC (Undated) _ It would somehow have been both
fitting and a bit grotesque if Robert Shaw, the great choral
conductor who died just over a year ago at 82, had left behind a
recording of a Requiem, to be released after his own death. And he
missed doing so only by weeks. His last recording, made in late
1998 and recently released by Telarc, was of Dvorak's Stabat Mater,
an expansive setting of a traditional text of the Roman Catholic
Church, reflecting on the sorrows of the Virgin Mary at the cross
of Jesus. By James R. Oestreich.  &QL;

   MUSIC-FINALES (Berlin) _ For their New Year's Eve concert here
at the Philharmonie, the Berlin Philharmonic and its conductor,
Claudio Abbado, came up with an extraordinary program that worked
extraordinarily well: seven finales in a row, to mark the passing
of the year and, depending on how you count, the century. By Paul

   LONG-OPERAS (Undated) _ Many operas, including great ones, are
routinely criticized for being too long. Puccini's ``Tosca,'' a
miracle of dramatic streamlining, is conceded to be just right, but
``Madama Butterfly,'' which is not that much longer, is thought to
have dead spots. Wagner's ``Siegfried'' is way too long, detractors
say, and even many partisans concede as much, not to mention tenors
who take on the exhausting title role, the most demanding in opera.
Yet ``Goetterdaemmerung,'' an even longer work, is generally felt
to be gripping theater. By Anthony Tommasini. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   MARSALIS-JAZZ (Undated) _ Sometime during the last year, those
of us who were on the mailing list of Columbia Records ran for
cover. It was raining CDs by Wynton Marsalis. By the end of 1999,
Marsalis had released some 20 hours of music on 15 CDs, a heroic
effort called ``Swinging Into the 21st'' that still has not emptied
Columbia's vaults of his material. There has never been anything
like that sort of effusion in the history of jazz, and to achieve
it Marsalis cut his earnings per album from $1 million to $100,000.

   DENNY-DOHERTY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The moment the surviving members
of the Mamas and the Papas came onstage two years ago to sing an
old hit song and accept induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame, a certain group of mothers and fathers in the television
audience surely did a double take. For there on the screen, now
getting on in years, were the rock band's founder and chief
songwriter, John Phillips; the singer (and Papa John's ex-wife)
Michelle Phillips, and, belting out the lead vocals ... the Harbor
Master. Rock music fans with long memories may have known him as

   AFRICAN-SLAVE-POTTER (Winterthur, Del.) _ The robust
eight-gallon jar was both impressive and puzzling: slightly larger
than a basketball and richly glazed in greens and browns, it bore
the neat signature of Dave, a slave who was a poet and master
potter in Edgefield, S.C., in the 19th century, the first
African-American to sign his ceramics. A traveling exhibition of
his work began at the McKissick Museum of the University of South
Carolina in 1998. The show's title quotes a line from a poem on a
pot by Dave in the Smithsonian: ```I made this jar...' The Life and
Works of the Enslaved African-American Potter, Dave.'' It will open

   CORNELIA-PARKER-ART (Boston) _ Like a slightly daft forensic
detective, the British artist Cornelia Parker gathers evidence from
moldering cultural artifacts. Tarnish from Davy Crockett's knife, a
feather from Sigmund Freud's couch, dust from the grooves of a
phonograph record that belonged to Adolf Hitler, all become loaded
icons once she gets hold of them. Through precise presentations and
mind-spinning titles, Ms. Parker cleverly turns the trivial into
secular relics. Her first American museum survey exhibition opens

   EISENMAN-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ For years, one of the burning
questions in American architecture has been: Will Peter Eisenman
find himself before the world finds Peter Eisenman? By himself, I
don't mean Eisenman's personality. I mean his attitude toward his
medium. Can he finally place architecture above the external
sources _ linguistics; semiotics; structuralist philosophy _ he has
relied on over the years? By the world, I don't mean popular
acclaim, of the kind that Frank Gehry has achieved in recent years.
I mean curiosity on the part of a public that has been slow to
recognize its stake in Eisenman's ideas. By Herbert Muschamp. &QL;

   TV-STORM-IN-SUMMER (Undated) _ It's the summer of 1969 and
Herman D. Washington, a 9-year-old black boy from Harlem, has just
stepped off the bus in the upstate town of Fairview, N.Y., where he
is to spend a charity-sponsored vacation with a local family. He is
not thrilled at the prospect, and the greeting he receives does
nothing to increase his enthusiasm. ``A Storm in Summer,'' directed
by Robert Wise, is the 41st movie that Showtime has produced for
family audiences in the last five years. Its themes of racism,
anti-Semitism and hard-won friendship are typical for these movies,
which Showtime, in an effort to attract both younger viewers and
their parents, now promotes under the banner Original Pictures for
All Ages. By Suzanne MacNeille. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

MOVE TO EASE STUDENT STRIKE IN MEXICO FAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In what was meant to be an audacious display of
openness to break the impasse with student strikers who have shut
down the national university here for nine months, Juan Ramon de la
Fuente, the university president, marched to the campus Tuesday to
appeal to student rebels to re-open the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a professorial tweed jacket, de la Fuente hoped to
hand student leaders the results of a referendum he organized last
week in which more than 157,000 university members voted to end the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he found that the strikers had closed the big metal gate
at the main entrance and uncoiled a chain-link fence to block the
esplanade to his office. Hemmed in on an out-of-the-way sidewalk,
he was engulfed in a shoving crush of photographers, some of whom
appeared to be provocateurs and not journalists, and student
strikers shouting slogans and epithets.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente tried to hold a dialogue with one student who
managed to plunge through the melee. It was all but lost in the
ruckus, and the student finally refused to receive the referendum
results.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente succeeded in turning up the pressure on the
strikers to settle, but also further polarized the conflict at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico, a conflict that has moved
to the center of Mexico's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo has been reluctant to step in to end
it in an unusually competitive presidential election year, but many
Mexicans have grown frustrated with his inaction. The university,
which has 275,000 students, has been the main avenue of social
mobility for working-class youth.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente said Tuesday that he would not return to
negotiations with strike leaders until after they opened the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   According to results of a competing referendum the strikers held
last week, no more than 113,000 university members voted to support
them. The strikers took no steps to ensure that no one voted more
than once.
</P>
<P>
   Although their figures showed that they are not in the majority,
the strikers said they would not release the campus until they win
acceptance of all of their platform calling for free tuition and
open admissions from certain high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's peaceful takeover of the campus is
inadmissible,'' said Alfredo Velarde, an economics professor and
adviser to the strikers who described himself as a ``proud
anarcho-communist.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We will not leave here until they sit down at the
table to resolve our demands.''

HOT SHORTS AT SUNDANCE, BUT NO FRENZY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Utah, Calif.)   (jw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ The Atom Short Bus, actually a recreational
vehicle, was double parked on Main Street, a long line of impatient
S.U.V.'s stacked up behind it, while inside people in designer
glasses and black leather lounged on a queen-size bed or around a
Formica dining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Short Bus,'' chirped a young woman in an
AtomFilms jacket. ``Say hello to your driver, Pappy,'' she said.
``Hello, Pappy!'' everyone yelled.
</P>
<P>
   And then the bus took off, making a slow circuit around this
crowded ski town, home to the Sundance Film Festival, now at the
midpoint in its 10-day run. Among the apparent differences between
this year's festival and previous ones has been the invasion of the
dot-coms _ companies like AtomFilms.com, Reelplay.com, -iFilm.com
and many others that have taken out storefronts on Main Street,
houses in the nearby hills and even recreational vehicles to
trumpet their presence.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest restaurants in town, Harry O's, has been
transformed into a sprawling cybercafe where several dot-coms have
set up booths and computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was about the only one here,'' said Mika Salmi,
chairman of AtomFilms. ``There was us and maybe two or three other
dot-coms. But this year there are dozens. They're everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a brisker-than-normal market for the
hundreds of short films that come to the festival in the clutches
of their nervous directors. AtomFilms issued an announcement of
what it said was this year's first acquisition deal for a short
film. The Sundance Channel said it had bought five short films and
was close to buying three more. Many were predicting that hot short
films _ driven by the presence of all these dot-coms hungry for
short films to stream from their Web sites _ would create a bidding
frenzy similar to, if not quite as large as, the bidding that has
sometimes erupted over hot feature films here.
</P>
<P>
   That did not happen, at least yet, but the sales have been
brisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There actually is an acquisition market here now for short
films,'' said Liz Manne, executive vice president for programming
and marketing at the Sundance Channel. ``But so far, I'd say, we
haven't seen the prices going up. The speed has gone up, people
have to act more quickly, but not the prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sundance festival, once a sleepy gathering of artsy,
independent filmmakers with a ragged appeal, has become the most
important event on the American independent-film calendar, helping
to create and being energized by the boom in independent films over
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been larger and larger crowds, more agents,
fancier clothes, splashier parties, a steady stream of breathless
announcements of rapidly forgotten acquisitions, more agents, lots
of public posing on cell phones (``They're asking for another
rewrite, but I think we've got Bobby committed'') and more agents.
</P>
<P>
   Sundance has also been used increasingly by Hollywood studios as
a showcase for their independent-flavored films, which adds a touch
of celebrity to the atmosphere. At any given moment it is possible
to spot Nick Nolte, Heather Graham, Emily Watson, Ethan Hawke and
numerous other stars sauntering up Main Street. In the evening
parties erupt all over town, often stretching into the wee hours,
and crowds form outside restaurants, peeking through the windows
past the clipboard-carrying guards at the door for a glimpse of Uma
Thurman or Billy Crudup.
</P>
<P>
   For years the Sundance festival was where filmmakers came in
hopes of striking gold, about the only place they had any hope of
doing so. The biggest news each year was about new discoveries and
major acquisitions by independent-film distributors. But a
tightening market for independent films has made striking gold a
more difficult proposition, as more and more movies fight for
screens in the nation's art-film cinemas and more Hollywood studios
get into the independent-film production and acquisition racket.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, a steady stream of multimillion-dollar acquisitions at
past Sundance festivals of films that went on to earn next to
nothing at the box office _ ``Twin Falls, Idaho,'' ``Happy,
Texas,'' ``Sugar Town'' _ had the major distributors coming to
Sundance this year promising to keep a tighter grip on their purse
strings. They would not, they swore, allow the hothouse atmosphere
to drive them into a bidding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk is always like that early in the festival, but by the
end people are buying,'' said Matt Brodlie, Miramax Films' vice
president for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   And this year there have already been several acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan Entertainment, which bought ``The Blair Witch Project''
at last year's festival, this year bought all worldwide and
television rights to Miguel Arteta's ``Chuck and Buck,'' a comedy
about estranged friends, for about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures Classics bought ``Groove,'' a multicharacter,
music-filled film set at an all-night rave, for $1.5 million.
Lion's Gate bought Raymond DeFelitta's ``Two Family House,'' a
1950s romance set on Staten Island, for an undisclosed sum. At the
top end of the spectrum, Fine Line Pictures spent between $3.5
million and $4 million for ``Saving Grace,'' a comedy from the
British director Nigel Cole about a once-wealthy woman (Brenda
Blethyn) forced to grow marijuana so she doesn't lose her house.
</P>
<P>
   And deals were also said to be imminent for several films that
had emerged as festival favorites, including ``Girlfight,'' Karyn
Kusama's gritty story of a woman boxer; ``Love and Sex,'' Valerie
Breiman's dissection of 1990s romance; and ``Happy Accidents,''
Brad Anderson's quirky time-travel comedy starring Marisa Tomei and
Vincent D'Onofrio.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed little evidence of the bidding frenzies _
outside of ``Saving Grace,'' perhaps _ that led to sales of more
than $10 million in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people have finally learned their lesson,'' said Ruth
Vitale, president of Paramount Pictures Classics, which has yet to
make a purchase at this festival, despite seeing what Ms. Vitale
described as the most intriguing selection of new films in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Amir Malin, president of Artisan, came into the festival last
week vowing that he would not be pressured into overspending and
predicting that most other distributors would also play it cool.
``What happened is that after the screening of `Chuck and Buck' I
turned and said, `This is it,' '' Malin said. There was a short
burst of bidding, but it never spiraled out of control, and the
deal was quickly set, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures, said he drove down
to Salt Lake City to see ``Groove'' on little more than a hunch,
also hoping that the screening site, an hour away from the
festival's Park City headquarters, would keep other distributors
away. It did, he said, and a deal was struck in short order.
</P>
<P>
   The absence this year of Harvey Weinstein, chairman of Miramax,
who has frequently led the acquisitions charge at previous
festivals but who this year is in a New York hospital recuperating
from a bacterial infection, has also served to keep the bidding
less heated, distribution executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax, which has become increasingly involved in recent years
in releasing its own productions and thus somewhat less interested
in festival acquisitions, had yet to buy a new film by midweek. Bob
Weinstein, Harvey's brother, was in Los Angeles, where tapes of
festival films were being shipped to him, something that was
bothering several distribution executives who had trooped up to
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I'm here, if they can just ship the tapes to
me in New York,'' Bernard said.

SUPER BOWL XXXIV: AMERICA'S PAEAN TO WRETCHED EXCESS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BOB PADECKY   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The Super Bowl is not about moderation. Never has been. It's
about using a diamond swizzle stick to stir the Bloody Mary. Shoot,
if the Space Shuttle could land on the 50-yard line at halftime,
the NFL would pay for it. If Elvis is indeed live and well, he'll
make his return entrance singing the National Anthem. It's
surprising a peace accord hasn't been signed yet on a Super Bowl
field.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rozelle wanted the Super Bowl to be this big, fat guy who
does a cannonball into the swimming pool during the family reunion.
Everyone gets wet. Everyone notices, whether they want to or not.
And that's how people will react on Sunday. The very same people
who will be griping about the wretched excess will be the very same
ones who will watch it.
</P>
<P>
   Rozelle, the former commissioner of the league, knew he had the
aces in his hand. Baseball and basketball need seven games to be
considered memorable. The NFL would throw the dice on A Singular
Last Game. The game could go snake-eyes on you. It could go bust.
The Super Bowl often has. It has sent a lot of people walking away
from their television sets at halftime muttering, ``I can't believe
I spent all this time getting ready for this load of mud.''
</P>
<P>
   But the risk is the thing. That's the hook. Americans like to
take chances. How else to explain bungee jumping and garlic ice
cream and Amazon.com? So hype A Singular Last Game for a week.
Winner takes all. In fact, the winner takes so much he can and
often does strip the loser of the previous four months. He makes
the loser feel like the Cincinnati Bengals, as if they never played
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who says one loss cannot ruin a season never lost a
Super Bowl,'' said Dick Vermeil after his Philadelphia Eagles lost
Super Bowl XV.
</P>
<P>
   It's because we hate the color gray. We hate that in-between hue
because it shows neither victory nor defeat. It makes people and
things invisible. No wonder all our fighting ships were that color,
the better to hide on the open seas, you know. We hate that
in-between feeling.
</P>
<P>
   No one hides during Super Bowl week. The only gray you'll be
seeing this coming week is on some aging Baby Boomer stringing up
backstage lighting. When in doubt, the Super Bowl rule of thumb is
to wear orange. That's just conforming to the players themselves,
who frequently are in full-colored verbal plumage.
</P>
<P>
   They can start sweetly ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A stick of gum would have been enough,'' said Oakland Raider
wide receiver Fred Biletnikoff after receiving the MVP trophy after
Super Bowl XI.
</P>
<P>
   They can progress to cute ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd run over my mother to win it,'' said Redskins guard Russ
Grimm before Super Bowl XVIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd run over Grimm's mother, too,'' said Raiders linebacker
Matt Millen.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can just go over the edge ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Feces,'' said Pittsburgh linebacker Jack Lambert before Super
Bowl XIII, when asked his Zodiac sign.
</P>
<P>
   The incredibly, excessively absurd is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long have you been a black quarterback?'' the Redskins'
Doug Williams was asked before Super XXII.
</P>
<P>
   You can see it.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mary was the location for the Super Bowl I party.
</P>
<P>
   You can smell it.
</P>
<P>
   Hialeah Race Track was the location for the Super Bowl XXIII
party.
</P>
<P>
   You can touch it.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in Minneapolis for Super Bowl XXVI spent part of their time
strolling through an ice castle.
</P>
<P>
   If you experience sensory deprivation during Super Bowl week,
that's only because the cops won't let you out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   That big, fat guy cannonballing into the family swimming pool is
getting bigger and fatter as the years go on. The cost of 30-second
television commercials could bail out some Third World country from
debt. Ticket prices are even higher than for Raider games! To see a
team getting a police escort to and from practice is to know how
Neil Armstrong was treated after he walked on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a football game? How silly, you might say. And
you'd be justified. How properly serious, you also might say. And
you'd be justified as well. So silly and serious meet and join
hands with drums and bugles and fireworks and dancers and singers
and more colors than a peacock. What a sight. The Super Bowl is
like going to the circus, only larger.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect, said P.T. Barnum, also known as Pete Rozelle.

   ATLANTA _ Lester Thurow, the economist and writer on global
issues, says that the gulf between prosperous people and those who
lag in the new technological economy will grow, ``creating a
dangerous and tough problem that has no easy solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing, he said, ``I'm not sure how long we can continue on
this path without a kickback... I'm not sure we want to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurow was in town Tuesday to lecture businessmen at the Carter
Presidential Center on wealth and wealth building in the
technological era, part of a continuing forum sponsored by the
Leadership Center and Georgia Tech's DuPree College of Management.
</P>
<P>
   Thurow said the growing divide between the wealthy and the poor
in the new economy had much to do with inadequate education and a
lag in skills, where it is easier to import skilled people than
attack the problem in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   In concluding his three-hour discourse, Thurow said this period
of technological advances may well be remembered, a thousand years
from now, for a growing area of learning that often takes a back
seat to subjects like Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   We may be best known, he said, for breakthroughs in
biotechnology, such as genetic modifications in plants and animals,
and possible transplantations from animals to humans.
</P>
<P>
   It will all be seen as one of the key elements in what Thurow
calls the Third Industrial Revolution: the knowledge revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates is probably the first 'world's wealthiest man'
whose fortune was not based on property or material possessions,
but rather on knowledge,'' Thurow said.
</P>
<P>
   In the shorter term view of this revolution, he said, the trends
toward further globalization of business should continue, with the
US playing a major role because of many factors, such as
investments in research and development, a social structure that
allows change, and world leadership in entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   Among the components of the global economic growth, he said, are
potential advances in microelectronics, computers,
telecommunications, new materials, robotics and biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is scarcely any business that can survive and grow
without significant use of the new technologies,'' Thurow said.
</P>
<P>
   Thurow, an adviser to businesses and US presidents, is author of
many books, including, ``Building Wealth: New Rules for
Individuals, Companies, and Nations and The Future of
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that the United States has problems that would seem to
impair its ability to compete. For instance the Japanese and
Europeans have better elementary and high school education, and
nearly every country has higher savings rates, crucial in raising
money for economic development.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the US has key advantages at the moment, including
active entrepreneurship that involves risk-taking that many other
countries and societies find unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a social arrangement that allows American businesses
to be flexible, firing and laying off people to change directions
to gain economic advantage _ a flexibility that more rigid
societies such as Japan and many European nations discourage or
prohibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a period where matters have been reversed,'' he
said, ``where businesses are not just taxed by governments, but
where taxes are paid to businesses to encourage their growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic congestion caused by the use of automobiles is a growing
problem that needs to be helped by better use of public
transportation, including trains, Thurow said.
</P>
<P>
   But bowing to the American love of the car, Thurow said, ``I am
actually led to believe we love those traffic jams, a chance to
sit, listen to music, and not listen to spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   After his talk, Thurow said that if we were
</P>
<P>
   seriously concerned about traffic congestion we would be more
active in juggling office hours and locating offices differently.

WORK CONDITIONS AT APPAREL, FOOTWEAR FACTORIES ABROAD SAID TO
IMPROVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparel and footwear factories overseas have slowly improved
working conditions in response to a highly vocal anti-sweatshop
movement, labor rights advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from college students and other opponents of sweatshops
have led some factories that make goods for industry giants like
Nike and the Gap to cut back on child labor, to use less dangerous
chemicals and to require fewer employees to work 80-hour weeks,
according to groups that monitor such factories.
</P>
<P>
   These changes, labor advocates say, could signal the beginning
of a broad improvement in conditions for low-paid apparel workers
in Asian and Latin American factories after four decades in which
the trend has been for American companies to transfer production
overseas in search of ever-cheaper labor.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates stress that the improvements have been spotty, and
that serious problems remain at factories from Honduras to Hong
Kong. Wages are often too low to feed a family, factory air is
often filled with chemicals and many managers refuse to let sick
employees leave work to get medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some improvement on the ground, but nowhere
near significant enough,'' said Charles Kernaghan, executive
director of the National Labor Committee, a leading anti-sweatshop
group.
</P>
<P>
   At many factories, labor rights advocates say, managers have
stopped hitting workers, have improved ventilation and have stopped
requiring workers to obtain permission before going to the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Sweatshop opponents praise some companies, like Liz Claiborne,
for improving conditions, while accusing others, like Wal-Mart, of
being slow to ensure changes at the overseas factories that produce
their apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of companies that produce globally are watching much
more carefully to deal with problems before they become
embarrassing public problems,'' said Pharis Harvey, executive
director of the International Labor Rights Fund, a watchdog group
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-sweatshop movement has put many apparel makers, like
the Gap and Kathie Lee Gifford, on the defensive by picketing in
front of stores, holding sit-ins at colleges and bombarding
companies with letters.
</P>
<P>
   The movement, one of the nation's largest to push for changes
since the 1960s, includes church and consumer groups, labor unions,
human rights organizations and college, high school and even
middle-school students. The movement's leaders often note that
sweatshops are not just found overseas; many remain in New York,
Los Angeles and other American cities.
</P>
<P>
   The movement sprung up partly because the International Labor
Organization, a United Nations agency, and American labor unions
are virtually powerless to improve conditions in Third World
factories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At December's protests in Seattle, conditions in such factories
were a major focus, with many demonstrators demanding that trade
treaties punish countries that permit violations of minimum labor
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel industry executives say that with shoppers hunting for
bargains, they face intense pressure to produce goods as cheaply as
possible, encouraging many to turn to substandard factories. And
some economists say sweatshops are a necessary first step for
developing countries seeking to raise living standards through
exports.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate executives acknowledge that the anti-sweatshop
movement's efforts are paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Knight, chairman of Nike, the world's largest footwear
maker, said the movement has gotten his company to accelerate
efforts to improve conditions. ``It probably speeded up some things
that we might have done anyway,'' said Knight, whose company uses
565 footwear and apparel factories employing 500,000 workers in 46
countries. ``Basically the workers in footwear factories, not just
our factories, are better off today than two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In one significant move, Nike and its rival Reebok are requiring
the many Asian factories that produce for them to stop using
petroleum-based adhesives that cause damage to the liver, kidney
and central nervous system in favor of safer water-based adhesives.
</P>
<P>
   Labor rights experts point to many improvements. Five years ago,
monitoring groups say, apparel factories in Honduras often employed
children under 14, but now it is rare to find workers under 16. In
Indonesia, managers no longer systematically squash unionization
efforts or have the leaders of such efforts jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Claiborne, the Gap and Reebok have all hired respected human
rights groups to monitor a handful of their factories.
Anti-sweatshop advocates say these organizations are tougher, more
credible monitors than the corporate auditing firms usually used
for monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-sweatshop movement has improved working conditions,''
said Apo Leong, executive director of the Asia Monitor Research
Center, a labor rights group based in Hong Kong. ``We're seeing the
multinationals putting pressure on their contractors and
subsequently conditions have improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Leong noted that factories in China were using less child labor
and prison labor. But he said grave problems remained throughout
Asia. He said that China often imprisoned union organizers, that
many Nike and Reebok plants still lacked adequate ventilation and
that many factories in Cambodia had deplorable health and safety
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sweatshop opponents point to other problems. Jeffrey Ballinger,
executive director of Press for Change, a labor rights group, said
wages paid by Nike's Indonesian factories had fallen in recent
years, after accounting for inflation, an assertion the company
denies. ``After a five-year struggle, wages are behind where they
were,'' Ballinger said. ``They're below what is considered
necessary to meet the minimum needs of a single adult.''
</P>
<P>
   In Central America, many female workers at apparel factories
complain that managers touch them improperly or demand sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee said, ``While we're
seeing progress on cleaner bathrooms, better ventilation, less
yelling at workers, there are two places where progress seems to
grind to a halt: the effort to form unions and the effort to have
wage increases.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent development is the formation of the Fair Labor
Association, a White House-backed group of human rights
organizations and companies, including L.L. Bean, Nike and Reebok.
This group is setting up a monitoring system to inspect overseas
factories to get them to meet minimum labor standards, like not
hiring children under 15 and not requiring employees to work more
than 60 hours a week. Companies that comply can sew ``No Sweat''
labels onto their apparel to reassure consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Many campus groups criticize this association for not requiring
factories to pay a living wage and favoring scheduled inspections
over surprise visits. These campus groups insist that the Fair
Labor Association is pro-corporate and will paper over deplorable
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The association's members defend it as the first serious
corporate-backed effort to inspect apparel factories systematically
and to put teeth behind basic labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Karp, Liz Claiborne's general counsel and chairwoman of
the Fair Labor Association, said the association would have
rigorous monitoring and the financial wherewithal to ensure regular
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see quite meaningful change in the industry
once this is up and running,'' she said.

COMMENTARY: BEING BOB FOREHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening scene of ``Washingtoon,'' Mark Alan Stamaty's
classic Reagan-era political comic strip, an insomniac plutocrat is
impressed by a late-night infomercial host. ``Anyone who can sell
glow-in-the-dark coat hangers to me could probably sell supply-side
economics to America,'' he declares. And thus, with guidance from
the nation's leading charismatician, begins the career of
Congressman Bob Forehead.
</P>
<P>
   The strong performance by Steve Forbes in the Iowa caucuses
shows that a good charismatician, with a hefty budget, can do well
even with unpromising raw material. But why does the wealthy
publisher feel the need to be his own Bob Forehead? Is he just a
capitalist fool?
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators have speculated about the candidate's personal
motivations. And of course, rich men in general are made more
likely to run for office by campaign finance laws that allow an
individual of means to lavish hard money on his campaign but not on
someone else's. But the reason this restriction matters so much is
that Forbes is all alone, forced to finance a supply-side campaign
single-handed _ because the rest of his party isn't interested.
After all, who needs another crusade when you've already won?
</P>
<P>
   Consider, if you will, how America near the end of the
Rubin-Summers administration compares with America near the end of
the previous Democratic presidency. In 1980, the wealthiest
taxpayers faced a marginal tax rate of 70 percent _ that is, they
got to keep only 30 cents of each extra dollar they earned. Now
they get to keep more than 60 cents. In 1980, conservative social
critics warned that excessively generous welfare was sustaining a
culture of poverty; in the '90s Bill Clinton ended welfare as we
knew it. In the late '70s powerful unions extracted huge wage
increases in industries like autos and steel; today only one
private-sector worker in ten is unionized, and the unions that
remain are shadows of their former selves.
</P>
<P>
   And even more important than these changes in policy is the
changing shape of the economy itself. In 1980, conservative critics
complained that enterprise was not being rewarded, that stock
prices had declined in real terms, that America was becoming a
society in which it just wasn't worth trying to get rich. Twenty
years later, after a decade that makes the 1920s seem merely
meowing by comparison, it is hard to see what more the rich could
ask for.
</P>
<P>
   So why can't people like Steve Forbes simply declare victory and
go home? The well-off would, of course, like to see even lower
taxes _ which George W. Bush, his life made easy by the revenues a
booming economy generates, promises to deliver. (Is he sincere, or
is he just doing this because that is what Republicans are supposed
to do? Who knows?) But there is one important thing that the
supply-side movement has not gotten, and still desperately wants:
intellectual vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: Bush's economic advisers, at least the ones
whose names have appeared in the press, are _ it pains me to say
this _ reasonable men. Translated, that means they have a view
about the way the world works that differs in some important
details but not in broad outlines from the view held by a
mainstream economist like me _ or, for that matter, Larry Summers.
And that reasonableness is what drives Forbes up the wall.
</P>
<P>
   For Forbes is, intellectually at least, the true heir of the
Reagan revolution _ a revolution that was supposed to sweep the
ideas of all those establishment types from Wall Street and Harvard
into the dustbin of history. The true believers didn't want a
scaled-back welfare state, they wanted a repudiation of the whole
idea of a social safety net. They didn't want economic policy that
worried less about Keynesian demand management and more about
incentives, they wanted an official declaration that Keynesian
economics was a fraud. Call it idealism, call it vanity _ the
supply-side cause has always contained more than its share of
frustrated academics (Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey) - but the movement
Forbes represents wants nothing less than unconditional victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican establishment, however, isn't interested. It has
gotten what it wanted; now it's mainly a matter of protecting its
gains. And it doesn't need Bob Forehead, because it's got George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's the same thing.

 &HT;    For the love of politics
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALPOLE, N.H. _ Dayton and Dianne Duncan fell in love over
politics.
</P>
<P>
   He was the chief of staff to New Hampshire's Democratic governor
in 1982. She was the political beat reporter at the Concord
Monitor, the state capital's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic politics was their passion well before they married
in 1986. But this year's New Hampshire primary between Al Gore and
Bill Bradley is adding new fire to their relationship. Dayton, 50,
is supporting Gore, while Dianne, 44, is supporting Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with the first competitive New Hampshire primary since
1992, couples such as the Duncans are splitting their loyalties
between Gore and Bradley with an intensity that reflects the heated
competition the two Democrats have ignited in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Even in their tiny town of Walpole, nestled in the hills
straddling the Connecticut River, the couple is friends with two
other couples who are also divided.
</P>
<P>
   For the Duncans, the year leading up to Tuesday's
first-in-the-nation primary has been filled with impassioned
political discussions, hours of lobbying friends and, more
recently, evenings scheduled around the candidates' TV debates.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few of their late-night ventilations have ended with
a mutual decision not to talk about their disagreements for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had to sleep on the couch yet, but depending on the
outcome on February first I don't know,'' Dayton joked while
sitting around a fire in their living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows who cooks the dinner,'' added Dianne, giving her
husband a playful kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Duncans haven't exactly seen eye to eye on most Democratic
candidates for president. In 1992, Dayton supported President
Clinton, while Dianne voted for former California Gov. Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But this year has been different. Dayton, who served as Michael
Dukakis' press secretary in 1988, was one of Gore's charter New
Hampshire supporters. He decided to back Gore after the vice
president personally invited him to the White House in November
1998 to ask for his support.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne, the more liberal of the two, signed on with Bradley
after hearing him speak at a county Democratic dinner more than a
year ago. Since then, the mother of two has become one of Bradley's
most active volunteers, devoting 30 hours a week to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent chilly day, she delivered 700 of Bradley's mailings
to local voters. She phones undecided voters from home and
buttonholes neighbors in town and at her 12-year-old daughter's
basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   She has left no stone unturned. For her local book club this
month, she insisted the group read ``A Sense of Where You Are,''
John McPhee's biography of Bradley's basketball days at Princeton
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it might help with the two undecideds in the
group,'' she explained. She also has been reading passages to her
husband in bed at night, but the pillow persuasion hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually kind of sad to me in a way because I believe
that I know his political soul and I think it belongs to the Bill
Bradley campaign,'' she said. ``The things that attract me to Bill
Bradley are the same things that attract me to my husband. It's
frustrating to me that I can't sell him on this person who I think
is so much like he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, a producer and script writer for noted documentarian Ken
Burns, is a member of Gore's environmental advisory board in New
Hampshire.

   He attends strategy meetings with Gore when the vice president
is in the state. He's put his name on Gore's mailings to voters and
written letters to the local papers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he's encountered problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep bumping into people here in Walpole hoping to engage
them in conversation about who they are going to support and
(Dianne's) already got them locked up,'' he sighed. ``I wish she
was with Gore because that kind of energy is going to have an
impact on the vote here.''
</P>
<P>
   He sums up the way he feels about Dianne's support of Bradley by
saying, ``I think she's made the wrong choice, but I love her
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Their disagreements revolve mostly around personality, not
issues. Dayton argues that Gore is better qualified than Bradley
because he served in Congress and as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty well agreed that in terms of vice
presidents and their role in the White House his has been one of
the more important in modern history,'' Dayton said.
</P>
<P>
   For Dianne, the issue is character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust Bill Bradley,'' she said. ``I trust him to be straight
with me. I trust him to act from a position of integrity, and I'm
not sure I have that same feeling about Al Gore.''Ken Foskett

SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS TO REMAP EARTH'S TERRAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Using powerful but ungainly looking radar gear that juts 200
feet from their spacecraft, orbiting NASA shuttle astronauts plan
to chart the ups and downs of most of the Earth's terrain with
unparalleled accuracy next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see the Earth as never seen before,'' said Diane
Evans, chief of Earth sciences research at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ``It will be like rediscovering our
own planet. Whenever we see things from a new perspective, we are
bound to have new discoveries.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Endeavour, with six astronauts aboard, is to blast
off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Monday for the 11-day
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, a space-age version of Lewis and Clark's early
19th-century mapping expedition, promises to chart the rest of the
Earth in the same detail as has been accomplished patchwork in the
United States and Europe. Endeavour's flight should capture most of
the land mass between the Arctic and Antarctic circles, or more
than 70 percent of the Earth's terrain, home to 95 percent of the
planet's inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the benefits:
</P>
<P>
   -- Discrepancies in current elevation measurements will be cut
from within 90 feet to within 45 feet.
</P>
<P>
   -- Measurements of Earth's surface will be taken every 90 feet,
down from 300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The global reach of the project has prompted an unlikely
partnership among the nation's military, intelligence gathering and
environmental communities, as well as among NASA and the space
agencies of Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The new maps also are expected to find wide use among planners
involved in flood control, airport development, cell phone tower
construction and petroleum pipeline construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department's National Imagery and Mapping Agency is
contributing about half of the mission's $450 million expense, and
European interests will contribute another $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   As the mission's major sponsor, the little-known mapping agency
will obtain the global maps of highest quality and control access
to material that could jeopardize national security, said Thomas
Hennig, the agency's program manager for the flight.
</P>
<P>
   However, the highest quality topography of the United States
will be available to the public. Maps of similar quality, produced
by lower-flying aircraft already are available to the public
through the U.S. Geological Survey and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military and intelligence-gathering agencies are especially
interested in high-quality elevation mapping of terrain outside
North America, Hennig said.
</P>
<P>
   When combined with existing optical photography, the new
elevation measurements will produce computer simulations that will
enable military strategists to better prepare combat pilots and
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Aviators, for instance, can train for missions on realistic,
computer-driven simulators to familiarize themselves with the
locations of surface-to-air missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The military will receive the highest quality global maps, but
global maps made from measurements taken every 300 feet will be
made public.
</P>
<P>
   The mapping agency is currently negotiating procedures to make
the higher quality maps of terrain outside the United States
available to scientists on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
END OPTIONAL TRIM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Uniform topography of this quality can be produced only from
Earth orbit with powerful radar emissions directed at the ground.
Scanning through cloud cover and darkness as easily as sunlit
skies, the transmissions rebound from the rugged depths of
Arizona's Grand Canyon, the towering Himalayan peaks of Nepal or
Africa's barren Sahara desert and are recorded by the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's flight is a culmination of space radar research
initiated by NASA more than two decades ago and featured on four
previous shuttle flights.
</P>
<P>
   The latest advance is a nearly 200-foot-long mast that will be
deployed once Endeavour reaches orbit. Fashioned from stainless
steel, titanium and carbon-fiber reinforced plastic, the mast is
folded into a 9-foot-long canister stowed in Endeavour's payload
bay for the launch.
</P>
<P>
   Once in orbit, the shuttle crew must extend the mast over
Endeavour's left wing. Fastened to the outboard end of the boom is
a second set of radar receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement allows radar signals bounced off the Earth by
Endeavour to be received by antennas positioned within the cargo
bay and at the tip of the mast. After the flight, the recorded
signals will be decoded by computer to produce the
three-dimensional maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when I first saw this 200-foot mast, and they said
we're going to send this out the end of your orbiter, I was
concerned because this is something different,'' Endeavour
commander Kevin Kregel said during a preflight press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Working with ground-control teams, Kregel and shuttle pilot
Dominick ``Dom'' Gorie will conduct a series of test maneuvers with
the extended boom early in their flight before the mapping begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do a very smart test plan. We will observe it from the
cockpit. We will be taping it with our cameras. Folks will be
looking at it from the ground,'' Kregel said of the long mast. ``I
think we have a very safe buildup approach, just in case there is
an unforeseen failure up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two astronauts have trained to manually extend or retrieve the
boom if the electric motors falter. In the most dire case, the mast
can be jettisoned with commands from the cockpit crew.

 &HT;    ELIAN EXPECTED TO MEET GRANDMOTHERS, RELATIVES AGREE TO NEUTRAL
SITE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The on-again, off-again reunion of 6-year-old Cuban
rafter Elian Gonzalez and his grandmothers is expected to come
about Wednesday, as federal immigration officials ordered the boy's
Miami relatives to make him available for a private meeting at a
neutral site.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, lawyers for the boy's Miami family notified
federal officials that they would bring the boy to a 4 p.m. EST
meeting at the Miami Beach home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin,
president of Miami's Barry University and a noted South Florida
advocate for children and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much want a meeting with Elian and his grandmothers,''
said Spencer Eig, one of the Miami family's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials insisted the meeting was ``only a visit,''
and the boy would not be turned over to the grandmothers to take
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion could be the first step toward ending what has
become a nasty family squabble _ and growing international issue _
over where the boy should live. It would come two days after an
attempted reunion in Miami fell apart in a swirl of rancor and
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The brittle relations between Elian's Cuban and American
families showed again Tuesday, as his grandmothers spent the day
making tearful appeals to several lawmakers sympathetic to their
pleas to let the boy return to his home in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very humiliated and very offended by that (Miami)
family,'' Elian's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez told
reporters. ``If they have taken the boy so many places since he
came here _ including Disneyland ... how is it possible that they
couldn't bring the child a few blocks away to see us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears streaming down her face, Rodriguez showed Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a family photo that included every member of
her Cuban family, except Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of the images, Elian's Miami relatives sent two
family members jetting to Washington late Tuesday for a press
conference and meetings with their Congressional supporters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also weighed in on the case Tuesday, asking
Congress to think about ``what is right for the child'' before
acting on several bills that have been introduced to give Elian
U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would veto such a bill, Clinton said, ``I have not
decided what to do and I would not rule that out.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus in the topsy-turvy case on Wednesday will
likely again be Miami, as the grandmothers are expected to finally
have their long-awaited reunion with their grandson.
</P>
<P>
   The letter ordering the meeting came from Executive Associate
Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Michael Pearson, who
said the Miami family must make the boy available as a condition of
Elian's current immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   While he has lived with his Miami relatives since November,
Elian is legally under the custody of federal officials, who have
granted him a status called ``temporary parole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is legally under the control of the Attorney General, who
chose to lodge him with the family instead of with Catholic Relief
Services or some other group,'' said University of Miami law
professor David Abraham, an expert on immigration issues. ``They
have no legal custody. It's as if they were the keepers of a hotel
where he is being lodged, only now the hotel keepers are trying to
say what can and can't be done with the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister O'Laughlin was asked by U.S. Attorney Janet Reno to
provide a neutral location for the reunion. Her gated home on Miami
Beach will allow police to keep the media and any demonstrators at
a distance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin, 70, president of the Catholic school in North Miami,
has intervened in several past immigration cases, helping to find
housing for groups of immigrants with no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   She also has no known ties to the National Council of Churches,
a Protestant umbrella group that brought the grandmothers from Cuba
and has attempted to act as a go-between for the boy's return to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exiles have been highly critical of the group, saying they
have ignored past pleas to help in immigration cases.
</P>
<P>
   Exiles turned out en masse Monday night when the grandmothers
flew to Miami and were expected to meet with Elian at the Little
Havana home of his Miami relatives. Exile leaders handed out
flowers and exhorted the crowd to be on its best behavior, but
televised images of the scene frightened the grandmothers, who
remained at the Tamiami Airport and refused to visit the house.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives - who insisted the meeting could take place
only at their home _ were on their way to the airport to negotiate
further when the women departed for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Exile leaders told the media they believed they saw an official
from the Cuban government boarding the plane with the women, and
cited that as further proof that the grandmothers are being
controlled by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers have said the Miami family is controlled by the
``Miami Mafia'' of exile extremists.
</P>
<P>
   It remained to be seen whether the reunion would help heal the
family's sharp divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers have said they want the boy to go back with
them to Cuba, but the Miami family insists they won't give him up
until a judge has ruled in a federal lawsuit they have filed to
block an INS decision to send Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit may move forward this week, as federal officials
are expected to file a response that might clear the way for a
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the Miami family has been stalling, hoping that
Congress would grant the boy citizenship, moving the case into the
realm of family court, where custody issues are decided.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers gave a letter to President Clinton to Rep.
Jackson Lee Tuesday, asking her to deliver it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the
Senate bill, told reporters Tuesday the Senate likely will debate
the bill early next week, rather than Wednesday as he earlier
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is find the best way to have an
impartial, nonpolitical decision made for the young boy,'' Lott
said, blaming the delay on the snowstorm and the large number of
senators still out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seemed clear the Congressional debate over the issue
will be heated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not place the burdens of the adversity between the
United States and Cuba on the shoulders of Elian Gonzalez,'' said
Jackson Lee.

US ORDERS CUBAN BOY, GRANDMOTHERS REUNITED IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The saga of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez unfolded with
new drama Tuesday as US immigration officials ordered a reunion in
Miami, the boy's Cuban grandmothers braved a blizzard to beg
Congress for his return, and President Clinton called on all the
parties in the poignant and politically charged case to put the
best interests of ``this poor kid'' first.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, who have claimed the Cuban boy since he
was rescued at sea Nov. 25, were informed by letter Tuesday that
they must bring him to the home of Jeanne O'Laughlin, a Dominican
sister and president of Barry University in Miami, to meet alone
with his grandmothers at 4 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives agreed to the meeting, a Justice Department
official confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting site, in an upscale area of Miami Beach, was
arranged by Attorney General Janet Reno, the former state's
attorney in Dade County, Fla., and a friend of O'Laughlin's. The
grandmothers, who arrived in the United States last Friday, flew to
Miami Monday to be reunited with Elian, but refused to visit the
boy in his great-uncle's Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the rift in the family that recent events have
caused, as well as security and publicity concerns, the
grandmothers have clearly stated they would not be comfortable
visiting with their grandson in Lazaro Gonzalez's home,'' wrote
Michael Pearson, a senior INS official.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to Gonzalez's lawyers, Pearson assured the Miami
family the meeting was to reunite Elian with his grandmothers, not
to return him to them or to his father. At the same time, the INS
official threatened Gonzalez's temporary custody of Elian if he
refused to allow the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Rodriguez, the boy's father, has demanded custody of
the boy, and on Jan. 4 the INS ruled the boy must be returned to
him in Cuba. The Miami relatives filed suit in federal court to
overturn the ruling. Elian's mother, Elizabeth, was killed along
with 11 others when the boat bringing all of them from Cuba
capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's custody case has grown far beyond a tug-of-war between
feuding family members. It has become a cause celebre for the
fiercely anti-Castro Cuban-American lobby and its many supporters
on Capitol Hill, who say the boy's mother sacrificed her life for
freedom and he should not be returned to the communist country, no
matter what the family circumstances are.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana de Gonzalez,
Elian's grandmothers, were back in Washington to enlist lawmakers
in the fight to return the boy to Cuba and to urge them to defeat
bills that would confer US citizenship on their grandson.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton told reporters that while he had not
made a decision, he would not rule out vetoing the legislation, now
on a fast track in Congress, which would remove Elian from the
jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to try to let the legal system take its
course,'' Clinton said, arguing that lawmakers should not ``take
this one decision out of context'' in the swell of anti-Castro
sentiment on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government was shut down by a snowstorm _
the first snowfall Rodriguez and Quintana had ever experienced _
several legislators sympathic to their cause opened their offices
and warmly greeted the grandmothers. The women were accompanied by
officials of the National Council of Churches, a Protestant
umbrella group that has hosted their visit.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Representatives Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and
Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas met for nearly an hour with the women.
Later, the grandmothers visited several senators in the office of
Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, and then saw
Representative J. Joseph Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts, in the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two women are heartsick,'' McGovern said, noting how
they tearfully showed him photographs of Elian and how he, in turn,
showed them pictures of his 20-month-old son. ``They are suffering
more than any of us can really appreciate. One of them lost her
daughter, and her only link to that daughter is this little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern said the women are frustrated by Congress's political
involvement in what they view as a family struggle and baffled by
the movement to make Elian a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to them _ and there were no Cuban government officials
there _ `if we could grant you all permanent resident status, would
you want to stay in the United States?''' McGovern said. ``They
looked at me like I was crazy. `We don't like the snow and cold,'
they said, `we want to go home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley said he was glad that federal officials had ordered the
families to meet. ``I think the INS is finally stepping up to the
plate and trying to get past all of these theatrics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Moakley was dubbed ``Havana Joe'' by the Cuban American
National Foundation for leading a delegation of US business people
to Cuba, promoting US-Cuba trade, and meeting with Fidel Castro.
Tuesday he greeted the grandmothers in Spanish and told them:
``Don't believe everything Fidel Castro says about us. Some of us
are very nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley, the ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee, promised
the women he would try to muster the votes to defeat the
citizenship bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an American mother died in Cuba and her relatives there
wanted to keep her son, the very same people who are screaming in
Congress about making Elian a citizen would be calling out the
Marines to grab the American boy and bring him home,'' Moakley said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Senate was preparing to begin debate on a citizenship
bill proposed by Florida Republican Connie Mack. Action on the
House bills is not expected until next week.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Tuesday, Clinton called on Congress to put aside
election-year politics and show restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the minimum, I would like to see this court case played out
before the Congress takes action,'' Clinton said, referring to the
Miami family's lawsuit to block the INS ruling and grant Elian
political asylum. Immigration officials say the case could be heard
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's just because I'm not running for anything, but I
just somehow wish that whatever is best for this child could be
done,'' Clinton said. ``This poor kid has already lost his mother,
and whatever happens, I'm sure he's going to carry certain burdens
into his early adolescence that most of us did not carry.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will put a national spotlight on O'Laughlin, 70, who
is known around Miami for flamboyant fund-raising stunts for her
university. In one instance, Sister Jeanne received a $1 million
donation after she, while wearing a white satin dress and a feather
boa, sang ``Don't Cry for Me, Argentina'' on a millionaire's yacht.
For $2 million, she learned ballroom dancing and demonstrated her
prowess at the US ballroom dancing championships.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first woman to serve on the city's Orange Bowl
Committee, as well as the first woman invited to join the
Non-Group, a behind-the-scenes organization of community leaders.
She currently is serving on a committee seeking ways to cut
corruption at Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in very deep prayer today that the Lord would use
us as a tool for good,'' she told reporters.

said Spencer Eig, one of the Miami family's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials insisted the meeting was ``only a visit,''
and the boy would not be turned over to the grandmothers to take
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion could be the first step toward ending what has
become a nasty family squabble _ and growing international issue _
over where the boy should live. It would come two days after an
attempted reunion in Miami fell apart in a swirl of rancor and
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The brittle relations between Elian's Cuban and American
families showed again Tuesday, as his grandmothers spent the day
making tearful appeals to several lawmakers sympathetic to their
pleas to let the boy return to his home in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very humiliated and very offended by that (Miami)
family,'' Elian's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez told
reporters. ``If they have taken the boy so many places since he
came here _ including Disneyland ... how is it possible that they
couldn't bring the child a few blocks away to see us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears streaming down her face, Rodriguez showed Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a family photo that included every member of
her Cuban family, except Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of the images, Elian's Miami relatives sent two
family members jetting to Washington late Tuesday for a press
conference and meetings with their Congressional supporters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also weighed in on the case Tuesday, asking
Congress to think about ``what is right for the child'' before
acting on several bills that have been introduced to give Elian
U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would veto such a bill, Clinton said, ``I have not
decided what to do and I would not rule that out.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus in the topsy-turvy case on Wednesday will
likely again be Miami, as the grandmothers are expected to finally
have their long-awaited reunion with their grandson.
</P>
<P>
   The letter ordering the meeting came from Executive Associate
Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Michael Pearson, who
said the Miami family must make the boy available as a condition of
Elian's current immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   While he has lived with his Miami relatives since November,
Elian is legally under the custody of federal officials, who have
granted him a status called ``temporary parole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is legally under the control of the Attorney General, who
chose to lodge him with the family instead of with Catholic Relief
Services or some other group,'' said University of Miami law
professor David Abraham, an expert on immigration issues. ``They
have no legal custody. It's as if they were the keepers of a hotel
where he is being lodged, only now the hotel keepers are trying to
say what can and can't be done with the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister O'Laughlin was asked by U.S. Attorney Janet Reno to
provide a neutral location for the reunion. Her gated home on Miami
Beach will allow police to keep the media and any demonstrators at
a distance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin, 70, president of the Catholic school in North Miami,
has intervened in several past immigration cases, helping to find
housing for groups of immigrants with no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   She also has no known ties to the National Council of Churches,
a Protestant umbrella group that brought the grandmothers from Cuba
and has attempted to act as a go-between for the boy's return to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exiles have been highly critical of the group, saying they
have ignored past pleas to help in immigration cases.
</P>
<P>
   Exiles turned out en masse Monday night when the grandmothers
flew to Miami and were expected to meet with Elian at the Little
Havana home of his Miami relatives. Exile leaders handed out
flowers and exhorted the crowd to be on its best behavior, but
televised images of the scene frightened the grandmothers, who
remained at the Tamiami Airport and refused to visit the house.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives - who insisted the meeting could take place
only at their home _ were on their way to the airport to negotiate
further when the women departed for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Exile leaders told the media they believed they saw an official
from the Cuban government boarding the plane with the women, and
cited that as further proof that the grandmothers are being
controlled by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers have said the Miami family is controlled by the
``Miami Mafia'' of exile extremists.
</P>
<P>
   It remained to be seen whether the reunion would help heal the
family's sharp divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers have said they want the boy to go back with
them to Cuba, but the Miami family insists they won't give him up
until a judge has ruled in a federal lawsuit they have filed to
block an INS decision to send Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit may move forward this week, as federal officials
are expected to file a response that might clear the way for a
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the Miami family has been stalling, hoping that
Congress would grant the boy citizenship, moving the case into the
realm of family court, where custody issues are decided.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers gave a letter to President Clinton to Rep.
Jackson Lee Tuesday, asking her to deliver it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the
Senate bill, told reporters Tuesday the Senate likely will debate
the bill early next week, rather than Wednesday as he earlier
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is find the best way to have an
impartial, nonpolitical decision made for the young boy,'' Lott
said, blaming the delay on the snowstorm and the large number of
senators still out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seemed clear the Congressional debate over the issue
will be heated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not place the burdens of the adversity between the
United States and Cuba on the shoulders of Elian Gonzalez,'' said
Jackson Lee.

TWO TOP FIDELITY EXECUTIVES OUT IN RESHUFFLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Investments lost two top executives Tuesday
and promoted a third, in a sudden reshuffle that reflects efforts
by the mutual fund giant to find a stronger footing in a brutally
competitive investment world increasingly dominated by the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   J. Gary Burkhead, who headed two of Fidelity's largest and most
challenging areas _ retail fund sales and brokerage operations _
said he was retiring after a tumultuous 17-year career at the
Boston fund giant.
</P>
<P>
   A behind-the-scenes player who was never a household name among
ordinary investors, Burkhead, 58, had been through most of the top
jobs at the world's largest fund firm. Despite notable successes,
he was often a scapegoat for his company's periodic troubles,
including what some observers have called Fidelity's slowness in
recent years to embrace the Internet as a core means of selling
products and services to millions of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a new job and family-related issues, Fidelity's
iconoclastic marketing czar also resigned, after less than two
years at his post. Stephen A. Cone, 49, an outspoken financial
marketer, took a position at Citicorp's Salomon Smith Barney, where
he will oversee global marketing for the New York brokerage's asset
management group.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cone and Burkhead were replaced by a rising Fidelity star
who is also one of corporate America's top women executives. Gail
J. McGovern, 48, had been a senior operating officer in Burkhead's
group, overseeing Fidelity's global telemarketing effort and
investor centers.
</P>
<P>
   After only two years in financial services following a career at
AT&AMP;T, McGovern is now in charge of Fidelity's all-important
``retail'' sales of funds and brokerage services, including those
on line, to ordinary investors. Her bailiwick includes Powerstreet,
the low-cost online fund and stock trading service that Fidelity
launched last fall. The group McGovern inherits from Burkhead
oversees close to half of Fidelity's $1.53 trillion in total assets
under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned a tremendous amount from Gary Burkhead and am
really excited about this great opportunity,'' McGovern said
Tuesday. ``In the past year we launched the on-line brokerage, our
market position is up, our profitability is up, and now we have to
maintain the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Fidelity's retail business is now on line. But the firm
faces increasing competition from an array of competitors,
including fund firms Vanguard Group and Putnam Investments and
other financial services players. Some observers have faulted
Fidelity _ and Burkhead _ for allowing Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the
brokerage and fund supermarket, to gain the number-one spot in
gathering assets on line. Burkhead had overall responsibility for
Fidelity's Internet efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether Fidelity was able to recognize the
influence of the Internet on the business early enough,'' said Eric
Kobren, an investment manager and publisher of the Fidelity Insight
newsletter. ``Certainly you can say they had the wherewithal to
make things happen faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's changes reflect fresh efforts by Fidelity to organize
itself less around products _ which are used by all sorts of
customers, from ordinary investors to big institutional investors _
and more around services tailored to specific customer groups.
</P>
<P>
   As part of those efforts, Fidelity said it had put all of its
institutional brokerage services, products, and operations under
one group. The division, known as Fidelity Investments
Institutional Services Co., is run by Kevin J. Kelly, and caters to
investment advisers at brokerages, banks, and insurers. Previously
the institutional brokerage was part of Burkhead's group, which is
now known simply as Fidelity Personal Investments.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern also assumes Cone's marketing duties until a permanent
successor is found. She becomes the second woman on Fidelity's
powerful, 15-person Operating Committee, the firm's strategic
decision-making organ. While Burkhead remains a director of FMR
Corp, Fidelity's parent, he is no longer on the Operating
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A 1965 Harvard Business School graduate who underwent successful
surgery for prostrate cancer in 1996, Burkhead said he was retiring
to spend more time with his family, play golf, invest his personal
money in start-up companies, and seek positions on corporate
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhead, a native Arkansan, was at the center of Fidelity's
spectacular growth from a company with $23 billion in assets and
2,100 employeees in 1983, when he joined, to one with more than $1
trillion and 30,000 staffers. From 1986 to 1997, he was head of
investment management _ traditionally Fidelity's second-most
important job, and a position Burkhead held for 11 years, before
being replaced by Robert Pozen in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A close confidant of Fidelity's chairman, Boston billionaire
Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson 3d, Burkhead was regarded as a brainy and
introverted, if less than facile with technology. But in a
statement Tuesday, Johnson praised Burkhead as ``a visionary and
exemplary leader'' who played ``an enormous role in making Fidelity
what it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some of Fidelity's toughest times transpired on
Burkhead's watch. There was a devastating dip in fund returns in
the mid-'90s and highly-publicized turmoil among portfolio
managers, many of whom quit or were fired for pedal-to-the-metal
bets. Most of all, Burkhead was blamed for not reining in Jeffrey
Vinik, the manager who ran Magellan, Fidelity's flagship fund,
before being fired for bad bets on bonds. Burkhead had ramped up
Fidelity's bond department in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Cone persuaded legendary Fidelity stock picker Peter Lynch to
serve as the firm's spokesman in a controversial advertizing
campaign that was panned by critics. A commuter, Cone never moved
his family to Boston from New York, where his wife works as a
personal consultant to a wealthy Manhattan couple.

CLINTON TO SEEK STIFF RULES ON DEADBEAT PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton wants to prevent deadbeat parents
from driving, traveling overseas or squandering their gambling
winnings _ and collect an estimated $2 billion in child support
payments in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Responsible Fatherhood Initiative,'' to be announced in
the president's State of the Union message Thursday, would also
encourage states to pass through more child support money to
custodial parents on welfare _ money states now share with the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   A third element of the package, called the ``Fathers
Work/Families Win'' initiative, would provide $255 million next
year to help non-custodial parents, mainly fathers, get trained for
jobs and to reconnect with their children. Massachusetts Governor
Paul Cellucci has already proposed such a program on the state
level, using extra money from federal welfare grants.
</P>
<P>
   To punish non-payers of child support, the Clinton plan allows
for booting the deadbeats' cars, seizing their gambling winnings,
denying passports to those who owe at least $2,500 in child
support, and prohibiting doctors and other health care providers
from participating in the Medicare program if they owe child
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding fathers responsible for supporting their children is
the next critical phase of welfare reform,'' said Bruce Reed,
Clinton's domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The idea gives a political boost to Vice President Al Gore, who
is set to discuss welfare when he campaigns Wednesday in New
Hampshire. In October, the Democratic presidential candidate
proposed cracking down on deadbeat parents by requiring states to
force noncustodial parents to go to work and pay child support.
</P>
<P>
   States that refuse would lose their federal child-support funds;
parents who defy the state's order to pay child support could go to
jail under the Gore plan.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the two events _ the State of the Union message
and the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1 _ underscores a key political
advantage Gore has as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Gore has sought to run separately from Bill Clinton
the man, but close to Clinton the president, who is presiding over
what is shortly to be the nation's longest-running period of
economic expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement of the welfare plan may give more weight
to Gore's proposals and comments on the issue, even if they are
made in his capacity as a candidate and not as the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan would end up bringing another $135 million into
federal coffers over five years, Reed said, since parts of the
program will cost the government money, and sections of it will
increase federal receipts.
</P>
<P>
   If a parent is on welfare, the noncustodial parent sends child
support payments to an agency; that money is typically kept by the
state and federal governments as a way of offsetting the cost of
paying the family welfare. Some states pass some of the money onto
the custodial parent; Massachusetts passes on $50 a month to the
live-in parent, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, states would be given a federal incentive to
provide as much as $100 per family, per month of this money. The
theory is that noncustodial parents would be more likely to pay
child support if it was clear the money was going to the live-in
parent.

   MISSOURI VALLEY, Iowa _ He bit his lip as he rose, his hands
fumbling on the table and the butterflies careening around his
stomach, but then Kris Cunard looked around at his neighbors' faces
and just let the words tumble out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes is unapologetic in his pro-life positions,'' said
Cunard, an insurance salesman. ``I have to vote my conscience, and
to me that's the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of life and death,'' Cunard added firmly, and
then he slumped back in his seat and allowed himself a relieved
smile for having done his part.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican caucus here in Missouri Valley, a town of 2,800
people in the far west of Iowa, 130 miles west of Des Moines, was
one of the 2,100 caucuses held all around Iowa on Monday night. It
can be criticized for all the reasons people denigrate the Iowa
caucuses: scarcely anybody turned up, those who did did not
represent the electorate, and the votes are little more than a
meaningless straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Cunard and 105 other people who turned out for two hours
on a freezing night at the Missouri Valley High School _ surrounded
by school pep signs like ``wrestling takes guts'' and tributes to
the school's own ``Big Reds'' _ it was a deadly serious venture,
one in which they invested passion, indignation and occasional bits
of information as they dreamed aloud of a country without sin,
abortion or the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a stretch to offer Iowa as an American answer to
Athenian democracy, and Pericles certainly did not show up Monday
night in Missouri Valley. It would be pretty easy to mock the
citizens of Missouri Valley, which has 10 churches, six policemen
and three stop-lights, for engaging in debates that were at times
dizzying in their impracticality, and some speakers were clearly
more impassioned than informed.
</P>
<P>
   But others had an impressive understanding of their candidates'
tax policies and other positions, and the meetings in Missouri
Valley High were far more civil than most political discussion
shows on television. The participants invested far more effort in
the Iowa caucuses than voters in other states do in their contests,
and the lengthy discussions of candidates and issues reflected just
the kind of citizen participation that Americans often bemoan as
lacking today.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Valley, an old railroad town where children still find
Indian arrowheads in the surrounding cornfields, is not a hub of
political activity. Despite the perception elsewhere that ordinary
Iowans virtually have to fend off importuning presidential
candidates every four years, in small towns like Missouri Valley
the contact with presidential contenders is minimal. The only
candidate to campaign in Missouri Valley in the last year was
Forbes, who dropped by once last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a rumor that Alan Keyes was sighted in our
McDonald's,'' added Jesse Render, editor of the local newspaper.
``But it wasn't a campaign stop. He just had a meal when he was on
his way to somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of campaign organization was evident as soon as
Republican voters arrived at the high school to register for the
caucus. Julie Haner, who greeted people and checked off their names
against a voter list, was wearing a t-shirt with big blue letters:
``George W. Bush for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Valley's caucus comprised six townships or precincts,
and so voters soon were divided into smaller groups depending on
their address. Some of these groups had just a few people, usually
old friends who gossiped about the neighbors in between choosing
presidents, while the largest had several dozen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bigger meetings was run by a grandmotherly woman
named Rose Casteel, who called the group to order and then began by
making a pitch for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I like him for is the flat tax,'' Mrs.
Casteel said. ``You'd just need a simple form to fill out. You
wouldn't need a Philadelphia lawyer to do your income taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Casteel asked who else wanted to speak. There was an
anxious pause as voters refused to catch her eye.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Dwight Wilcox, a retired firefighter, stepped up. Like
most of the speakers, he seemed to want to go out of his way to
avoid offending anyone, and the goodwill and humility all evening
made quite a contrast with the behavior of the candidates
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at electability,'' Wilcox announced, ``and as I
see it George Bush has what it takes to win. So while Forbes and
all the others are good,'' _ he nodded politely at Mrs. Casteel _
``I think Bush is the one who can beat the Democrats.''

   Bill Hughes, an accountant, rose cautiously and at first said he
wasn't going to endorse anybody at all, but just offer a few
observations. But the observations were that ``the media is trying
to manipulate us and make this a two-man race, but actually there
are other good candidates and we've got to look at them.'' As
Hughes spoke, he seemed to gather courage, and he soon let on that
he had chosen a candidate and that this person had a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the soft-sell approach, Hughes added, ``I would
encourage you to think about Alan Keyes.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There was no give-and-take, and usually only a single person
spoke for each candidate, often just a few words to commend him to
Missouri Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In one room, when the chairwoman asked if anybody else wanted to
speak, Doug Bishop raised his hand awkwardly and slowly rose. ``I'm
a Vietnam veteran and I support McCain,'' Bishop, a teacher, said
in a voice with a catch, as if he was near tears. ``There've been
times when we really needed a good man in office _ times like the
Civil War and World War II. I hope to God this country doesn't go
through that again, but if it does, then we need the best man.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, stared down over the paunch in his sweatshirt, peeked
up for a moment at his fellow Republicans and then added in a rush,
``Right now, it's McCain. I don't see anyone close to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop tumbled down into his chair, and everyone applauded him
loudly, not in agreement but to show appreciation of the effort the
speech had obviously cost him. A relieved smile slowly spread
across Bishop's face as he looked around at the warm faces.
</P>
<P>
   Then the chairwoman passed around paper ballots with the names
of all the candidates, and the voting was over. For the six
mini-caucuses together, the vote was George W. Bush, 49 votes;
Steve Forbes, 27; Alan Keyes, 11; John McCain, seven; Gary Bauer,
six; Orrin Hatch, one.

   With the voting out of the way, the meetings switched to
platform issues, and the talk quickly became more impassioned.
``What we need is to abolish the IRS,'' suggested Edmond Rector, as
heads nodded around the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go further,'' added Duayne J. Brindle. ``I think
we need to get rid of half the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting did pass a resolution in favor of a flat tax, but it
was a bit unclear what that meant because after vigorous discussion
the consensus was that the flat tax should eliminate ``loopholes''
while preserving key ``deductions.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the meeting also hastily endorsed a resolution
calling for a ban on abortion. One man said that it should be
flexible enough to allow abortions in cases of rape, incest or
serious health risk to the mother, but his neighbors nodded sagely
and said the details could be left to the politicians.

<P>
   One of the toughest issues of the evening was raised by Everett
Ellithorpe, who owns an auto-repair shop in town. He raised his
hand and asked, ``So what are we doing? What do these votes count
for?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a long silence, and the other voters cocked their
heads curiously. Connie O. McWilliams, who runs an insurance
company and was presiding, took a deep breath and frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she answered hesitantly, ``I think the big thing about
it is that it keeps Iowa alive, to be honest with you. It shows
that we're more than corn and hogs, that we're interested in our
governmental process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of eyes on Iowa,'' she added. ``Sometimes they
take us more seriously than we take ourselves.''

 &HT;    Opening arguments presented in Edwards corruption trial
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ The federal government's case against former
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards ``is a corruption case without
corruption, an extortion case without extortion,'' Edwards's
attorney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After almost two weeks of jury selection, prosecutors and
defense attorneys presented opening arguments in the gambling
corruption trial of Edwards, 72, and six co-defendants, including
his older son, Stephen, and state Sen. Greg Tarver. It was the
first opportunity the defendants have had to state their side of
the story since they were indicted on 34 counts in November, 1998.
U.S. District Judge Polozola has a strict gag order on everyone
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a meeting is just a meeting, and sometimes a friend
is just a friend,'' said Dan Small, a Boston attorney representing
Edwards. He was refuting the government's claim that Edwards and
six co-defendants met with casino developers and pressured them for
millions in payoffs in exchange for Louisiana operating licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Small said the government's case_which relies on more than 1,000
secretly taped conversations, as well as testimony from alleged
co-conspirators who pled guilty in exchange for lenient
sentences_is just ``bits and pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of anyone paying money because they were
threatened by Edwin Edwards,'' he said. ``He tried to help friends,
yes, strangers, yes. But the government's case is all speculation
and spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Edwards said the government was putting
the ``worst spin'' on things.
</P>
<P>
   ``People call on me for advice and suggestions, whether I am in
or out of office,'' he said. ``I don't turn people down. But
everything I do is controversial and everything I say is sometimes
twisted into something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's charges stem from seven alleged schemes to
extort money from riverboat casino operators in exchange for
favorable rulings from the state casino licensing board. The
schemes allegedly took place between 1991 and 1998, during and
after Edwards's fourth and final term as governor. They involve
five existing and proposed casinos around the state. Only 15
riverboat casinos are allowed to operate in the state at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Letten said in opening arguments
that Edwards led a ``criminal business'' and that he ``served at
the core of that enterprise with his son, Stephen.'' He used his
power, notoriety and influence to extort money from casino
developers. He, his son, and several of his friends and business
associates profited from the deals made with casinos, Letten said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution on Tuesday confirmed a long-rumored report that
state Sen. Cleo Fields, a former U.S. congressman and candidate for
governor, received $25,000 in cash from Edwards, which he was
supposed to distribute to Tarver and Ecotry Fuller, a gaming
commission member who is also indicted. Fields has not been
indicted. The government says it has a secretly-recorded videotape
of the hand-off.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 jurors include six white men, four white women and two
black men. There are six alternates_four white men and two white
women. The makeup of the jury was considered crucial: Edwards
fought unsuccessfully to have the trial moved to New Orleans, where
the jury pool tends to have more black people. He has enjoyed a lot
of support from the black community.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last at least three months.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Andres Pastrana of Colombia began
campaigning here Tuesday for Congress to approve more than $1
billion in emergency aid to his embattled government, but argued
strongly against any attempt to tie the aid to his military's
actions on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, who met with President Clinton on Tuesday, said in an
interview later that while his government was committed to
improving its human rights record, its efforts would not be helped
by further pressure from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to respect human rights because the United
States Congress imposes conditions on the aid,'' Pastrana said.
``We are going to do it because it is the policy of my
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's comments laid down the lines of what may yet be a
considerable battle with congressional Democrats over the terms of
$1.3 billion in assistance that the Clinton administration wants to
provide over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The aid, almost 80 percent of which would go to the Colombian
military and security forces, is aimed at helping Colombia fight
both drug traffickers and the leftist insurgents who sometimes
protect their operations. It would be the largest such package for
a Latin American ally since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also includes major increases in funding to help
farmers develop new crops, protect human rights workers and support
other programs backed by congressional liberals. But as outlined by
Clinton administration officials, the plan has done little to
assuage critics who fear that the United States will be drawn more
deeply into Colombia's long-running civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In comments before his meeting with Pastrana, Clinton
acknowledged that an increased U.S. commitment to Colombia would
entail risks. But he added, ``I think we're going into this with
our eyes wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not directly address concerns that U.S. support for
Colombia's anti-drug campaign could spill over further into its
counterinsurgency effort. But he said that ``in the intersection of
the narco-traffickers and the political rebels, you see a picture
of what you might see much more of in the 21st-century world.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior congressional Republicans have been making similar
arguments about Colombia for several years, pressing the
administration for a greater commitment to the stability of the
government there. But some Republicans have suggested recently that
they, too, have some qualms about the priorities of the White House
plan.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said such concerns would be
addressed quickly when the administration presented the plan in
detail in early February.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There will still be some controversies before this is over,''
the official said. But he added: ``If people are saying we need to
do more, it's because we haven't rolled out the whole dog-and-pony
show.''
</P>
<P>
   But some influential Democrats may not be satisfied so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts are among those seeking to have the aid hinge on the
Colombian military's willingness to cut ties to right-wing
paramilitary groups and accept the civilian authority in cases of
military involvement in crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy, who was the first member of Congress to speak with
Pastrana on Tuesday, said in an interview later that he would
continue to press for such conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want us to make the mistake in the drug war that we
made in the Cold War, where we gave money to people regardless of
their human rights records as long as they were anti-communist,''
Leahy said. ``I am concerned that we are in a position where we
could end up supporting people involved in human rights violations
_ this time for what is considered the greater good of fighting
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, human rights groups have cited a series of
cases suggesting that Pastrana's government has not taken the
problem seriously. Tuesday, however, Pastrana emphasized to Clinton
that there has been a steady, significant drop in reported human
rights violations by the Colombian military, a White House official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana made the same point in the interview, arguing that
under a three-year-old law sponsored by Leahy, the Colombian
military authorities understand implicitly that U.S. aid could be
cut off if their forces are found to be involved in significant
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a big change,'' Pastrana said. ``We know that
we still have a lot of problems.'' But he added, ``I don't think it
will be good for the aid to try to put all kinds of conditions on
it.''

 &HT;    Stopped cold: Snow closes schools, businesses in North Carolina
 &HT;    By Jenna Hunt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Another winter storm dropped 2-3 inches of
snow Tuesday and stopped eastern North Carolina cold for the fourth
time in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's accumulation brings the total snowfall since Jan. 18
to 6-8 inches, said meteorologist Kevin Lipton at the National
Weather Service station in Newport. Eastern North Carolina averages
about 3 1/2 inches of snow a year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the snow came high winds, with one gust measuring
nearly 40 mph at 4 a.m. in Pitt County, Lipton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not safe for folks to be out on the roads unless
necessary,'' said Sharon Bradley, director of nursing care at Pitt
County Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, the county's largest employer, canceled all
elective surgeries on Tuesday and may cancel elective surgeries
this morning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rain fell here most of the night. Meanwhile, as much as 20
inches of snow blanketed central and western North Carolina,
cutting power and paralyzing most of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Pitt County, the snow closed the county schools, forcing the
system to use its only remaining makeup day. The schools had one
left after September's flooding and a Jan. 18 snow day.
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina University canceled all classes on Tuesday and all
8 a.m. and 9 a.m. classes today. All other classes are set to meet
today as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The storm caused no power outages in the area, according to the
Greenville Utilities Commission. But the local utility was
preparing to send crews to help with outages in the Rockingham
County area Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Greenville's residents, not at work or school, hit the
city's grocery stores in full force. Lines were 20-people deep at
one point, according to workers at Food Lion and Harris Teeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to close all the Greenville stores at 5 o'clock due
to weather conditions,'' said Terry Martin, the Greenville
operations manager for Food Lion.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Teeter closed its doors at noon Tuesday. ``It's worse
than a hurricane _ we have loads of people in line. I don't know
why people want to wait 20 minutes in line for a carton of milk.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the staff at Pitt Memorial reported to work
before conditions worsened Tuesday. The hospital plans to truck in
additional staff for the evening shifts, said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in great shape,'' Bradley said. ``It's tight, but it's
not a problem. We were picking up some of our folks this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the county's largest industries reported many of their
workers did not make it to work Tuesday morning. Some workplaces
closed by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   TRW, which manufactures automobile components, had more
employees out than on-site, said Bob Brooks, human resource
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deal with what you got,'' he said. ``This is kind of a
freak storm _ you just have to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   The business, which flew in workers during September's record
flood, will remain open as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't typically close for weather,'' Brooks said. ``We keep
our key operations going.''
</P>
<P>
   NACCO Materials Handling Corp., a forklift maker, closed its
doors at about 10:30 a.m., officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Catalytica Pharmaceuticals, the county's largest private
employer, closed down its operations at noon Tuesday with the
exception of a few essential employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very seldom we'll close for inclement weather _ it's been
many years since we've closed for snow,'' said spokesman Larry
Seigler.

THE SNOW KEEPS FALLING, AND CLINTON KEEPS CHATTING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton called reporters in Tuesday to
talk policy, introducing a plan to pay off the federal debt by
2013. But his schedule had been cleared by a snowstorm, and so
after his announcement, he continued talking, and talking.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about Elian Gonzalez, and of his own efforts to view
the controversy over the Cuban boy from the perspective of a
parent, not a president. He talked about the coming session of
Congress, and of what it might accomplish. Looking out the window
at the swirling snow, he talked of his plans to release emergency
funds to help low-income families pay for home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last question,'' Joe Lockhart, the White House
press secretary, interrupted at one point.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't. Clinton made no move to leave the White House
briefing room, and both the questions and the answers continued.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the president had begun walking back to the Oval
Office, he stopped for one more:
</P>
<P>
   Did he miss campaigning in Iowa?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it there, you know,'' he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's volubility was partly attributable to the storm, which
shut down much of official Washington. The president of Colombia
was not due to come by the White House until later in the
afternoon. The State of the Union speech was in good shape. And a
fund-raising lunch where Clinton had been scheduled to speak around
midday had been scrubbed.
</P>
<P>
   In his impromptu remarks, Clinton seemed at first hesitant to
offer a post-mortem on the Iowa caucuses, saying he had not
followed every twist and turn in the campaigning and did not want
to interfere in the coming primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But when the subject turned to another sport he loves, football,
he was talkative once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed it this year very closely,'' he said of the
playoffs, going on to show that he knew a thing or two about the
Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams, which meet Sunday in the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got one that's a very powerful defensive team _
Tennessee _ with the capacity for real offense, and then you've got
the most powerful offensive team playing against them, that was
stymied last Sunday and played better defense than I thought they
could,'' the president said. ``So, I mean, I don't think you can
predict which one of them is going to win this.''
</P>
<P>
   At length, it became difficult for Clinton to hold his tongue
concerning the world of presidential politics that is rolling on
without him. He has a favorite in Vice President Al Gore, and he
has long been the political equivalent of the sports fanatic who
shows up in the stadium with the team logo painted across his bare
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican race was about as I thought it would
be,'' he said, referring to the caucuses, ``and I think that the
vice president had a terrific victory last night in Iowa _ all the
more impressive because he and Sen. Bradley, I thought, ran very
substantive campaigns, very idea-oriented campaigns, and had that
whole series of debates, which I think served the people very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Clinton commented on how Gore's victory in Iowa
might play in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a plus,'' he said, ``but I agree with what the
vice president said last night: it's important not to over-read it.
The people of New Hampshire are very independent. Now, they want to
make a good choice. They understand that to some extent, the choice
they make affects the choices that the country has after New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton insisted that he was struggling to stay out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all want to get me involved in it,'' he said. ``But I
think, you know, the vice president, Sen. Bradley, Gov. Bush and
Sen. McCain, they can all do this without me. They're doing fine.''

JEEVES PUTS UP BIG BUCKS FOR DIRECT HIT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet search engine firm Direct Hit Inc. isn't as well known
as rivals AltaVista and Yahoo, but it's still worth half a billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That's the price Ask Jeeves Inc. has agreed to pay for ownership
of Direct Hit, which uses special software to identify and deliver
the most popular Web pages on particular topics. Ask Jeeves, based
in Emeryville, Calif., is a popular search site that lets users
find Web sites by asking complete questions, rather than typing
individual words.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves will pay 5.12 million shares of its stock to acquire
privately held Direct Hit, of Natick, Mass. At Ask Jeeves' closing
stock price of 104 Tuesday, that would make the deal worth $532
million.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few people go to the Direct Hit site when searching
the Web. That's because the company's main business involves
linking itself to other companies' search sites. Direct Hit
searches are performed automatically at major sites like Lycos,
Hotbot and Microsoft Network. ``Our products are used by over 70
percent of all searchers on the Web,'' said Direct Hit president
Mike Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves is also in the business of providing natural language
search services used on other companies' sites. For instance, a
visitor to Microsoft's software support site can ask a question
about Windows 98, and Ask Jeeves software will recognize and
respond to the question.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves president Robert Wrubel said the Direct Hit
acquisition will give his company a more complete set of solutions
for providing precisely focused Internet searches. ``What we saw in
Direct Hit was really the next generation of automated search
technology that was really aligned with our vision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy will become vice president of technology for Ask Jeeves.
He and the rest of the Direct Hit staff will remain in Natick.

RAYTHEON REPORTS 79 PERCENT DROP IN PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. said fourth-quarter profits fell 79 precent because
of sales problems and project delays, backing up its recent
financial warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, the country's third-largest defense contractor, also
said it hasn't solved the financial controls issues that have sent
its profits and share prices plummeting in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The results were in line with diminished expectations Raytheon
set last week when it issued a grim profit outlook, its third in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington, Mass. company attributed its falling income to
slower shipments of weapons such as its Patriot missile and
problems at its civil aircraft and construction units.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Daniel Burnham also described suggestions the
company plans to make to a Pentagon task force studying how to
improve the industry's health overall.
</P>
<P>
   Along with rivals like Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon is still
struggling to integrate large units following a massive round of
defense industry consolidation that ended in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Raytheon said net income
fell to $72 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, from $341
million, or $1 a share, for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales fell 8 percent to $4.83 billion from $5.26 billion.
For all of 1999, Raytheon reported profit of $404 million on sales
of $19.8 billion, compared to profit of $844 million on sales of
$19.4 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Raytheon trade at less than one-third of the high they
reached last July. After the results were announced Raytheon's
class B shares rose 1 11/16 to close at 20 in New York Stock
Exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call, Raytheon executives cited personnel
changes and new computer systems they said would help them get a
better grip on their finanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very far along in the discovery process,'' chief
financial officer Frank Caine told analysts. ``I'm more confident
today than I was in October that we have identified the key issues
that present the key sources of surprises and disappointments for
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't enough for some observers, however, who want
specifics on progress Raytheon has made integrating 50 different
computer systems to track its expenses more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still aren't in a position to say whether there are more
skeletons in the closet,'' said William Fiala, an analyst at Edward
Jones. ``Until they can say that, their ability to regain
credibility doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiala still rates the stock a ``buy,'' citing the long price
drop and an 18 percent increase in order backlog to $28.4 billion
at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Caine said some units could still report unexpected problems,
such as Raytheon's troubled Engineering &AMP; Constructors unit, which
he described as ``a wild card'' and ``highest on my worry list.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to an analyst's question about whether the unit
should be sold, Caine said ``we'll look at any reasonable
proposition,'' but said ``the issue in front of us is to make sure
it is stable'' in terms of its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company also disclosed more about problems at its Kansas
aircraft unit, which until last week was thought to be a rare
bright spot.
</P>
<P>
   Total employment stood at 105,300 at the end of 1999, Raytheon
said, down from 108,200 a year ago. Net debt was $9.5 billion at
year-end, versus $8.6 billion at the end of 1998, and Caine said
the target is around $9 billion for the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said the company is also putting together an analysis
for a pending review sponsored by the Pentagon into ways the
government might improve the health of US defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly are some systemic issues is in terms of our
prime customer,'' Burnham said. ``There's a lot of enthusiasm for
this so we can put these issues in front of people making these
decisions, not just in the Pentagon'' but also in Congress, he
said.

HATCH READY TO BOW OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After drawing only 1 percent of the Republican vote
in Monday's Iowa caucuses, Senator Orrin G. Hatch is expected to
announce Wednesday he is withdrawing from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a four-term Republican senator from Utah, attracted fewer
than 900 votes in Iowa, where he spent 48 days campaigning. His
campaign is equally troubled in New Hampshire, where polls show him
with no more than 2 percent support among GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a little bit disappointed in the results,''
Hatch's campaign spokeswoman, Margarita Tapia, said Tuesday. And
while Hatch aides delivered a meek promise that Hatch would
continue to campaign in New Hampshire despite the trouncing in
Iowa, the conservative standard-bearer is widely believed ready to
quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disappointed to say the least. `Devastated' is probably
a better word,'' said Kent Cook, scheduler for the Hatch campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch had planned a Washington news conference for Tuesday, but
delayed it until Wednesday because of the snowy weather in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is well-known in Washington and has drawn both ire and
accolades as powerful chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
But outside the capital, Hatch is virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   After a debate in Manchester last month, Hatch showed up at the
airport alone, carrying his own bags and eager to chat up anyone
hanging around the terminal. In the days before the Iowa caucuses,
Hatch's comments took on a defeated tone, as he thanked voters just
for showing up to listen to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got in late. He kind of slipped in without people really
knowing who he was,'' said Andy Smith, director of the University
of New Hampshire Survey Center, referring to Hatch's late entry
into the race last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really seem to have any specific reason to be in the
race other than that he seemed to feel he was better qualified than
the other candidates,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is known for his ardent defense of Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas during Thomas's confirmation hearings, when he was
accused of sexually harassing law professor Anita Hill when she had
worked for him.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch, a strong conservative, has also suprised some with
his left-leaning initiatives. Hatch has teamed up with Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, on health care bills
and has been active in seeking help for AIDS patients. Hatch has
even written a song about children with AIDS, with the refrain,
``these are the innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's campaign, however, was less focused. While the senator
had a few pet issues, particularly ``corruption'' in the
Clinton-Gore administration, and the threat that a Democratic
president would appoint liberal jurists to the Supreme Court, his
campaign mainly centered on the weight of his own experience as a
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's competition also limited his chances of success. Texas
Governor George W. Bush gained much of the Republican establishment
vote; Senator John McCain of Arizona is popular among Republican
centrists, and antiabortion candidates Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and
Alan Keyes are dividing the conservative Republican vote, noted
political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least Hatch had some credentials _ more than half of the
people in the race,'' Rothenberg said. But ``there wasn't much left
(of the vote) by the time he got in.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Utah law, Hatch can still run for reelection to the Senate
in November.

 &HT;    North Carolina sees its share of surprise storm
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Barely four months after being swamped by
record floods from back-to-back hurricanes, North Carolina was
smothered by record snowfall Tuesday_the second big snow in a week.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard was called in to help clear roads and rescue
stranded motorists. The Highway Patrol urged drivers to stay off
highways, warning that many of their own vehicles had been stranded
in snow drifts and tractor-trailers had jackknifed on state
highways.
</P>
<P>
   The patrol said troopers could respond only to extreme emergency
cases, leaving dozens of other motorists to fend for themselves if
they spun into snowdrifts or ditches.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpectedly severe storm forced many schools closed by last
week's snow to remain closed, and it knocked out power to about
300,000 homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the state, the snow was so deep Tuesday that it
blocked doorways and covered cars. Along the coast, residents
marveled at waves crashing onto snowy beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is weird, really,'' said Jeremy Larson, 21, front-desk
clerk at the Shell Island Resort Hotel in Wrightsville Beach.
``It's the first time I've seen snow stick to the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh lawyer Rob Holmes, 40, wore waist-high fishing waders to
visit his mother. He and his wife, Cindy, didn't bother to take
their two young children sledding because the snow was too deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sled would drop right through it,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's State Highway Patrol blamed at least one
traffic death on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of emergency Tuesday in the midst
of blizzard-like conditions in Raleigh, which recorded 20 inches of
snow at Raleigh-Durham International Airport. That broke the
17.9-inch record set in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, it was an awful lot of snow,'' said Ron
Humble, National Weather Service meteorologist in Raleigh. ``It was
a lot heavier than was expected.''
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the storm, National Weather Service computer
models had predicted four inches of snow. But the storm developed
into a powerful ``nor'easter'' that gained strength over the
Atlantic off Florida and barreled up the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Snow fell for about 17 hours Monday night and Tuesday in
Raleigh, creating deep snow that drifted in winds gusting above 30
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Power companies reported tens of thousands of outages Tuesday
morning, and the numbers grew as snow fell through the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Power &AMP; Light in Raleigh reported 145,000 outages,
mostly in the Sandhills area, including Asheboro, Sanford, Southern
Pines and Troy. Duke Power in Charlotte had more than 75,000
customers without power in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Electric Membership Corp., which handles
power service in many rural areas in the state, reported 65,000
outages statewide, mostly in Anson, Stanly, Moore and Union
counties. Thomas Allen, a delivery driver from Raleigh, compared
the storm to the intense hurricanes that swept through the state
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even get the front door open, it's that bad,'' he
said. ``There may be other snowstorms like this in Alaska or
something, but never in North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm paralyzed operations at Raleigh-Durham International
Airport, where flights were canceled until the snow moved out and
runways were cleared. With the storm traveling up the East Coast,
airport spokesman Mike Blanton said the weather could disturb
flight patterns for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy accumulation was widespread across the Piedmont and
eastern North Carolina, including the remote Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Employees measured seven inches on the terminal roof of the
Wilmington International Airport. Four to six inches fell on Rocky
Mount, including at Camp Floyd, the nickname for the government's
temporary housing site for Hurricane Floyd victims.
</P>
<P>
   The snow provided relief for the dreary conditions for 1,300
people living in camper trailers and mobile homes. ''This is a lot
of snow for this part of North Carolina, so they are having a good
time,'' said Camp Floyd manager Janice Gerald.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ditt, spokesman for the North Carolina Division of Emergency
Management, said he doubts the storm will delay beyond a day or two
the state's massive recovery from Floyd, North Carolina's worst
natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of this stuff is going to melt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Areas in the western mountains received little snow from the
storm, the weather service said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, driving was treacherous in many areas. The
state Department of Transportation sent out trucks set to dispense
60,000 tons of salt and sand to clear the roads, said Jerry Linder,
a county maintenance engineer with the DOT.
</P>
<P>
   Skies began clearing in the afternoon, turning roads slushy and
making snow great for snowballs and snowmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sledding is good when it is packed,'' said Spencer Smith,
44, of Greensboro. He pulled his eight-year-old daughter, Hannah,
on a sled.
</P>
<P>
   A recent transplant from Westchester County, N.Y., 38-year-old
David Reavis shoveled his Greensboro driveway. He praised city
road-scraping crews ''for making most of the roads passable by
noon.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow and ice has closed many schools_including Greensboro's_for
much of the past week and a half. Kids are getting bored, and
parents are going crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old James Carbia was ready for the snow to end so he
could get back to his first-grade class at General Greene
Elementary in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   James made a snowman, threw snowballs with the other kids, read
his favorite book and even talked his dad into making up math
questions for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done the last thing I could think of doing, and I'm
starting to get bored,'' he said.

VENTURE FIRM TARGETS YOUNG CAPITALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Forget the notion of a shoestring start-up. Even the
youngest technology companies are prompting venture capitalists to
open their wallets wider than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Polaris Venture Partners has raised an $800 million ``early
stage'' fund, four times the size of its last venture capital fund
and the biggest fund of its kind in the nation. The Waltham, Mass.
firm said it plans to stick to investments in young companies, but
the average investment it makes has jumped to about $15 million
from $5 million in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has changed the funding requirement for companies
dramatically in the last year,'' said Jonathan Flint, a founding
partner at Polaris. ``The whole ethos on the Net is, you have to
get big fast. It takes more capital.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a third fund for Polaris, a 3 1/2-year-old firm whose
biggest claim to fame is its backing of Akamai Technologies.
Akamai, the Web speed-boosting venture of a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology professor and his student, went public in October.
The Cambridge firm's stock has soared 974 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry investors and a booming IPO market have made Akamai and
other Web companies quick successes for investors. But not before
requiring significant backing by venture capitalists. Akamai, for
example, went through $100 million of financing in the 11 months
before it went public, Flint said.

   David Barry, senior analyst with Private Equity Analyst, a
Wellesley trade publication, said the size of Polaris's new fund
``speaks volumes on how the deal flow has changed.'' Ten million
dollars used to be a lot of money for a fledgling Internet firm,
Barry said. ``Now it's not uncommon to see $100 million or $200
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Polaris plans to finance 45 companies with its new fund over the
next 2 1/2 years. In its last fund, Polaris II, the firm funded 28
companies with $180 million. The firm also aims to expand its
``Greenhouse'' incubator program, which provides money, office
space, and other help for young firms.

STANFORD DEAN ESCHEWS PRESTIGIOUS JOB FOR CONN. DIOCESE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Kinnally has a top job with a good salary and lots of
power at one of America's most prestigious univerisities.
</P>
<P>
   But he is voluntarily walking away for a post with essentially
no income and no power in one of the most troubled cities in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   In a step that runs counter to many trends in American life,
Kinnally, the 39-year-old dean of admissions and financial aid at
Stanford University, has decided to quit his job to pursue a career
as a diocesan priest in Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnally's move has stunned the Stanford community. But the
decision is welcome news to a Catholic Church in America struggling
to find men willing to make promises of celibacy and obedience and
give their lives to the church.
</P>
<P>
   But his step also illustrates another important trend in the
Catholic ministry -- the average age, and the education levels, of
men choosing to become priests is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   The number of older men pursuing the priesthood isn't nearly
high enough to address a national shortage of priests, but it is
having an impact on seminaries and parishes as men with broad life
experiences, sometimes including raising children, join a calling
once entered by boys as young as 14.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Saint John Seminary in Boston has about
one-third as many seminarians as it did three decades ago, the Pope
John XXIII National Seminary in Weston, Mass., which caters to
older men pursuing priesthood as a second career, is enjoying
historic high levels of enrollment. The Weston seminary's current
student body _ the largest ever _ includes numerous doctors,
lawyers, and PhDs., and a significant fraction of its students were
once married.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a growing phenomenon,'' said Monsignor Francis Kelly,
the Weston seminary's rector. ``It's often hard for young people
today in our culture, with all its competing messages and values,
to focus on the kind of commitment and sacrifices that a priestly
ministry involves. ``It often seems that men need a little bit of
life experience to be able to come to a point where they can
comfortably start thinking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinnally's decision is one path followed by older men who choose
the priesthood -- he has felt the call for years, but only recently
decided he was ready to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no ephiphany, no lights, no signs... you don't hear
voices, you just have this thing tugging at you,'' Kinnally said.
``The call...comes to you in different ways, during the day when
you're doing your work, and also in prayer. ``My answer was always
`Not me. I can't do this. It's too hard.' But it doesn't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into an Irish Catholic family in Yonkers, N.Y., Kinnally
attended Mass regularly as a child, went to a Catholic high school
and a Catholic college (Manhattan College) before pursuing a lay
career as a college administrator.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a master's degree in English from New York
University, he held admissions jobs at Pace University, the State
University of New York at Purchase, the University of Bridgeport
and Sarah Lawrence College before joining Stanford in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His connection to Catholicism -- and to Bridgeport -- was
sustained through music.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 14, when his piano teacher moved out of town,
Kinnally taught himself to play the organ, and he has been playing
in churches ever since. Kinnally's introduction to Bridgeport came
when he took a job as music director of the cathedral there; he
also worked as a church musician in Irvington, N.Y., and he
accompanies and sings as a tenor with the chapel choir at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnally plans to leave Stanford in July and to enter St. John
Fisher Seminary in Stamford, Conn. in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still very unusual to leave this prestigious job with all
kinds of perks and all kinds of notoriety to do something so much
more simple and unobtrusive and almost silent in terms of the
public eye,'' said the Rev. Patrick LaBelle, the Catholic chaplain
at Stanford. ``People were absolutely stunned when he made the
announcement. You can't go anywhere without this being the topic of
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinnally said he is prepared for both celibacy and obedience,
the two promises priests must make. He said his administrative
skills will help when it is his job to run a parish, and he said he
is fully prepared to submit to the church's hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first questions you get when discerning a vocation
in the Catholic priesthood is, `Are you the kind of person who can
love more than one person, or do you need the intimacy with one
other person?' '' he said. ``I have many wonderful friendships, and
my energy is really in being there for my friends and doing the
work that I do. ... I'm going to be good at this, and this is
absolutely what I'm called to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinnally said he chose Bridgeport because of its small size and
its diversity. The diocese of Bridgeport includes some of the
wealthiest communities in the nation, as well as some of the
poorest, and is ethnically diverse, including growing Hispanic,
African-American and Haitian communities. The diocese, which covers
all of Fairfield County, serves 360,000 Catholics with 88 parishes,
300 priests, and 38 Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to hear gunshots every night, and that was scary, and I
worried about that city a lot,'' Kinally said. But the gospel tells
us everybody is God's people, and I'm ready, whatever I'm supposed
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He will enter a world of seminaries slowly being transformed by
the decisions of men like him to enter the priesthood relatively
late in life. Students in this year's entering class at Pope John
XXIII seminary include three physicians, a college administrator
from Wisconsin, three high school principals, a school
superintendent and an Air Force Academy instructor. Seven of the 20
entering students are widowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there were plenty of seminarians, some people thought
older men were less educable and would have shorter careers,'' said
Dean Hoge, a Catholic University sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is somewhat of a crisis, because we don't have
nearly enough ordinations to keep the church going as we know it,''
he said. ``But a number of older men are coming in, doctors,
lawyers, college professors and business executives, and people
love them because they're very capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinnally said he hopes his move will send a message to Stanford
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a teachable moment for students,'' he said. ``Here we
are in Silicon Valley, where so many students, even before they
graduate, can have a six-figure salary, and to see somebody who is
successful move on to something completely different -- I just hope
they think about that, listen very carefully to what they're called
to do, and have the courage to take a risk.''

 &HT;    Newspaper researches allegations of Gore's marijuana use
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Editors at The Tennessean found themselves in a
ticklish situation late last week: What to do about unproven
allegations of widespread marijuana use by Vice President Al Gore
when he worked at the Nashville newspaper in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision: Talk to everybody they could find who worked at
the newspaper with Gore and then write about it. The Tennessean
interviewed 36 journalists and then published three stories
Tuesday, one of them on Page 1A.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day investigation concluded there's no evidence of
rampant drug use by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Even a long-time critic said the newspaper succeeded in showing
that it can be fair to native son Gore while at the same time not
appearing to show him any favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a great job,'' said Bruce Dobie, editor the Nashville
Scene alternatively weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Reader reaction was mixed Tuesday, said David Green, the
newspaper's managing editor. Some of the dozen people who contacted
The Tennessean said they agreed with the paper's approach. Others
questioned the timing of the story, which was published the day
after Gore won the Iowa caucuses. Still others thought the story
should have been run last week, when the drug allegations first
surfaced on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, first revealed on a Web site devoted to the
reform of drug laws, concern John C. Warnecke Jr., a newsroom
employee at The Tennessean from 1968-71. Gore worked there from
1971-74 and 1975-76. He left when he announced his candidacy from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Warnecke said he and Gore were good friends until 1976, during
which time they smoked marijuana more than 200 times. He also
claims Gore pressured him to ``stonewall the press'' about it when
he ran for president in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has admitted since 1987, when the issue first surfaced, to
``infrequent and rare'' marijuana use that ended in 1972. When
asked by a reporter last week whether he smoked marijuana on a
daily basis after his return from Vietnam in May 1971, as Warnecke
claims, Gore answered, ``No. When I came back from Vietnam, yes,
but not to that extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials say they will have no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessean's probe found only one journalist of the 36
interviewed who said he saw Gore smoke marijuana. Several others,
including Tennessean Editor Frank Sutherland, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Jost, who worked at the newspaper from 1970-76 and then as a
Gore aide from 1977-80 and in Gore's 1988 presidential bid, said he
witnessed occasional marijuana use, all before 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not regularly,'' Jost said Tuesday from Washington,
where he works for Congressional Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland came under some criticism for declining to comment in
his own newspaper's investigation. Sutherland and Gore have been
friends for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore wants to talk about his private life, that's
fine,'' Sutherland told the newspaper. ``But I'm not going to talk
about my private life. That's nobody's business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville Scene's Dobie questioned Sutherland's continuing
friendship with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Sutherland has to decide whether he's a friend of the
vice president or a professional journalist honest with his
craft,'' Dobie said. ``It's difficult to maintain both of these
positions at once, which is what he's trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland acknowledged Tuesday it is difficult to balance both
interests. But he maintains he's done a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge you to compare our coverage with any other
newspaper in Tennessee,'' Sutherland said.
</P>
<P>
   Warnecke has an unlisted number in northern California and could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But some of his former colleagues questioned Warnecke's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warnecke is not credible,'' said Wendell ``Sonny'' Rawls, a
former Atlanta Journal-Constitution news executive who worked at
The Tennessean from 1967-71.
</P>
<P>
   Warnecke said in The Tennessean articles that he has come forth
now to clear his conscience for lying about the matter in 1987.
According to The Tennessean, Warnecke is now living on disability
payments for on-going depression that started before his work at
the newspaper. He told The Tennessean his therapist urged him to
come clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe this to apologize to them that I lied while Al was their
representative,'' Warnecke is quoted as saying. ``And this was not
right. I was really wrong. And I should take my lumps for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lied as a former reporter and I want to straighten it out.''
</P>

BUDGET SURPLUS EXPECTED TO GROW SUBSTANTIALLY OVER NEXT 10 YEARS

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Driven by the strong economy and the resulting
flood of tax revenues, the federal budget surplus will surge over
the next decade to levels that would have been inconceivable only a
few years ago, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report
made public on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under assumptions, including a deep cut in spending next year,
traditionally used to project the budget outlook, the surplus
outside of the Social Security system for the next 10 years would
total more than $1.9 trillion, nearly twice as much as estimated by
the budget office last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Using other assumptions that provide for higher spending levels,
the 10-year surplus projections outside of Social Security would
range from $838 billion to more than $1.8 trillion. The surplus in
the Social Security system, which is projected to turn into a deep
deficit within 20 years as the baby boom generation retires, was
estimated by the budget office at $2.3 trillion over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term budget projections have proven notoriously volatile
and unreliable. A decade ago, when deficits appeared immutable, no
one would have dared to predict that the government would be in
surplus today. But just as the long economic expansion has now
brightened the fiscal picture more than analysts had expected, so
too could a downturn darken it.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the new surplus numbers are qualified, they are
big and will effectively expand the parameters of an election-year
debate between the two parties over how best to use the bounty of
the nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the new estimates emerged, all the leading
presidential candidates had offered plans to divide the surplus
between tax cuts, spending programs, reducing the national debt and
putting Social Security and Medicare on a sounder footing for an
aging population. The sharp divisions between and within the
parties on the campaign trail mirror the political and ideological
clash in Washingon that has left Congress and the Clinton
administration deadlocked over fiscal policy for the last several
years.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the surplus estimates also allowed the
Republican majority in Congress to claim that it had stuck to its
pledge not to dip into Social Security money to pay for general
government operations during the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Under prior projections by the budget office, the spending bills
passed by Congress last year required borrowing $17 billion from
Social Security this year. But the new projections show that there
will be an operating surplus for this year of $23 billion, a swing
of $40 billion that insulates Republicans from charges of fiscal
irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will issue its own surplus
projections in two weeks. President Clinton has laid out an
ambitious series of tax and spending initiatives in the last few
weeks in an indication that the budget proposal he sends to
Congress next month will not be shy about putting the projected
surplus to use.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to bolster his case that spending increases in
an era of surpluses can coexist with fiscal prudence, Clinton said
on Tuesday that he intends to push for accelerated repayment of the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in the White House briefing room, Clinton said he
would offer a plan to pay off by 2013 the entire $3.6 trillion owed
by the federal government to the public in the form of Treasury
bonds. He did not provide any details. Last year, Clinton proposed
a similar plan to pay off the public debt by 2015, and House
Republicans are currently developing a plan that would also
eliminate the debt by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office projections goes only to 2010, but they show
that the debt would be reduced to $941 billion by that point if all
of the Social Security surpluses are used for debt reduction, as
both parties have more or less agreed to do.
</P>
<P>
   The political ramifications from the new surplus estimates could
be substantial. In Congress, Democrats said that with so much money
on the table it will be increasingly difficult for them to beat
back all Republican efforts to cut taxes. In particular, Democrats
are considering supporting some version of proposals by Republicans
to reduce the so-called marriage penalty paid by many two-income
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the bigger pot of money will increase the
pressure on them to agree to some version of Clinton's main
priority, an expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas will be able to claim that his big tax cut proposal is more
prudent than it looked when the surplus estimate was smaller. On
the Democratic side, former Sen. Bill Bradley might be less
vulnerable to assertions by Vice President Al Gore that his
health-care and poverty-fighting programs are budget-busters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In developing its projections, the budget office offered three
scenarios that provide a sense of what the government's books would
look like under different assumptions about spending levels.
</P>
<P>
   The main projection, yielding a non-Social Security surplus
estimate of $1.92 trillion over 10 years, uses assumptions that
have been standard for budget forecasting for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   It assumes that Congress and the administration will cut
spending for each of the next two years to meet spending limits
written into law in 1997, and then hold spending increases to the
rate of inflation for the rest of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties have shattered the spending caps each of the
last two years in all but the most technical sense. With the
surplus growing, there is almost no one on Capitol Hill who
advocates trying to meet the limits next year. Doing so would
require cutting outlays in annually appropriated programs _ the
third of the total federal budget that includes most operations
other than Social Security, Medicare and interest payments _ to
$579 billion next year from $606 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans support use of another set of numbers that
starts with current spending levels, but then assumes that spending
is frozen, without any adjustment for inflation, at that level for
the rest of the decade. Under such a scenario, the non-Social
Security surplus would total $1.86 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats said that a freeze is totally unrealistic,
especially since even the Republican-led Congress has regularly
voted for spending increases. Democrats tend to prefer the third
scenario, under which spending is assumed to start at current
levels, and then to grow at the inflation rate for the rest of the
decade. Under that scenario, the non-Social Security surplus over
10 years would be $838 billion, far less than under either of the
two other options.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, the Republican from New Mexico who is
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Republicans have not
yet decided which surplus projections to use in developing a budget
this year, and added that he might develop a fourth option. But he
said it is unlikely that there will be any effort to cut spending
to adhere to the limits set in 1997, suggesting that the caps will
be scrapped this year or reset at higher levels.

 &HT;    Heat is on Bradley in debate tonight
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Democrats Bill Bradley and Al Gore square off
tonight in their final debate before the New Hampshire primary,
with pressure on Bradley to regain momentum after Monday's loss to
Gore in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have scheduled only one event today in New
Hampshire before meeting at WMUR-TV studios for an hour's debate.
The debate begins at 9 p.m., following a Republican debate at the
same location that begins at 7 p.m. Both debates will be broadcast
live on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bradley and Gore campaigned in southern New
Hampshire in the midst of a blizzard that dumped a foot of snow on
much of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Both were greeted by cheering supporters _ and a handful of new
polls showing Gore opening up a lead over the former New Jersey
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the new polls showed Gore with a lead of between nine and
13 points, and a third showed the two deadlocked. Other recent
polls confirm a drift away from Bradley and toward Gore, putting
pressure on Bradley to deliver a strong performance tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine he's not feeling the pressure,'' said
Dartmouth College political scientist Richard Winters.
</P>
<P>
   One potentially troubling indicator for Bradley came from a new
Franklin Pierce College poll that found New Hampshire's independent
voters drifting toward the Republican primary. More than half of
independents said they planned to take GOP ballots, up from
one-third in the college's earlier poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley leads Gore among independents, and he is counting on
their support to counter Gore's advantage among Democratic
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that independents move away from the Democratic
primary, it's going to be tough sledding for Bradley,'' said Robin
Marra, director of the college's polling institute.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's message to New Hampshire voters Tuesday was pitched
directly toward independents. He called for an end to ``politics as
usual'' and cast himself as a visionary leader who is the best
qualified to ``guide the country to a prosperity that none of us
can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires the ability to see what's coming down the road . .
. so you can prepare the country,'' Bradley said. ``I've done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent the rest of the day in preparation for tonight's
debate. Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said the debate was no
more important then any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel any particular pressure,'' he said. ``There is
pressure on both.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, was still basking in his strong showing in
Monday's Iowa caucuses, where he bested Bradley 2 to 1. Speaking to
high school students in Manchester, Gore vowed not to take New
Hampshire for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just begun to fight for you,'' Gore said. ``We are not
taking a single vote for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized his energy throughout the day, telling reporters
he had had only an hour of sleep and was ``running on adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
   And he bowed to New Hampshire's reputation for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is a bastion of independent thinking,'' he said
in Manchester. ``Nobody tells them what to do. They make up their
own minds.''

 &HT;    McCain, Bush gear up for N.H. primary
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HENNIKER, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain welcomed Gov. George
W. Bush back to a snowy New Hampshire Tuesday with a frosty
challenge on taxes and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at a middle school and a college in a major winter
storm, McCain questioned the fairness of Bush's $483 billion tax
cut plan and said his own $237 billion proposal would give
middle-class Americans a needed break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great concern for the wealthy in America. Mr. (Bill)
Gates is on my mind every day. But you need tax cuts for your
family a lot more than he does,'' he told a student at New England
College. ``Thirty-eight percent of Gov. Bush's tax cuts go to the
wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. That's not what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush would finance his tax cuts from anticipated budget
surpluses. McCain, by contrast, would use most of the surplus to
shore up Social Security and pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former naval officer and prisoner of war in Vietnam,
also promised a ``steady hand on the tiller'' in foreign policy, a
theme also evoked in a new ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America is to lead, then America's leader must be prepared
for that challenge,'' McCain says.
</P>
<P>
   The ad never mentions Bush, but it states plainly, ``There's
only one man running for president who knows the military and
understands the world.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, said top campaign aides
had been waiting for the right moment to air the ad, perhaps a
foreign policy crisis. But with time running out before the New
Hampshire primary, they decided to run it now, believing it to be a
defining difference with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived in the Granite State early Tuesday morning. ``I'm
energized, I'm excited, my spirits are high and I really like my
chances,'' Bush said after an overnight flight to Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new CNN/USA Today poll gave McCain a 12-point lead
over Bush, 45 percent-33 percent. Publisher Steve Forbes, who
finished second in Iowa caucuses, received 12 percent in the poll,
which was conducted before the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed confidence that he can close the gap with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at a little bit of a time disadvantage up until now.
Now we're all going to be here the same number of days,'' Bush told
cheering supporters at a Manchester rally.
</P>
<P>
   At a stop in Bedford, Bush predicted, ``It is going to be a
spirited contest here.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, calling himself the ``authentic conservative'' in the
race, sought to capitalize on his unexpectedly strong showing in
Iowa with 30 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican establishment has met its match,'' Forbes said
at a news conference in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was not worried about his third-place standing
in the New Hampshire polls, because surveys in Iowa also showed him
doing poorly there.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, who finished last in Iowa, is considering
whether to pull out of the race, a senior aide said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a hard look,'' Kevin McGuiness told the New York
Times. ``The numbers do not send a strong signal, but no decision
has been made yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's departure would leave a five man contest, with Gary
Bauer and Alan Keyes still in the race.

WHITE HOUSE AGREES TO TALKS ON PUERTO RICO WEAPONS TRAINING
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: P.R., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House has agreed to a request by the
governor of Puerto Rico to step in and accelerate negotiations with
the Navy about resuming weapons training on its base on the island
of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   After the governor rejected the Navy's latest proposal to hold a
referendum on the issue, the White House agreed to the request
Monday night and invited Puerto Rico's top negotiator to resume
negotiations in Washington on Thursday. But White House officials
voiced support for the Navy's proposal to leave a final decision on
the base's future to the people of Vieques rather than to Gov.
Pedro J. Rossello.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy proposed last week that in three to 18 months a
referendum be held offering the citizens of Vieques a choice of
allowing the armed forces to resume live-fire training and receive
$40 million in community aid in gratitude, or closing the base
within five years. There would be no testing on the island, where
there is now a moratorium on live-fire exercises, until after the
referendum, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal is worse than the last one,'' said Alfonso
Aguilar, spokesman for the governor. ``We've only got a few weeks
left and we know the Navy is pressuring the president for a
decision before the moratorium ends in March.''
</P>
<P>
   The president suspended all military exercises on Vieques, a
small island in the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, in April, when a
civilian Puerto Rican guard was killed after Marine jets dropped
bombs that unintentionally hit an observation tower. That death
touched off protests that have led to the occupation of the base by
a group of more than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   In December the president halted live-fire military exercises
there and ordered an end to all exercises within five years.
Rossello immediately rejected that proposal, saying Puerto Rico
wanted a ban on bombing exercises on Vieques that could be legally
binding. The moratorium on exercises ends March 1.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Navy made its counterproposal of a referendum,
which has the backing of the president, a senior administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're suggesting the referendum is the way to go to give the
Navy a chance to present its plan and see what the will of the
people of Vieques really is,'' said a senior White House official.
``The Puerto Ricans need to understand that the president as
commander in chief must push forward the readiness of the armed
forces while weighing the concerns of the people of Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, the Navy and Marines have used the 900-acre
range on Vieques for their only comprehensive live-fire exercises
on the East Coast, involving amphibious landings, aerial
bombardments and naval gunfire. While the Navy calls the range its
``crown jewel'' because these joint exercises are necessary to
prepare the battle groups for deployment, the citizens of Vieques
have called the base unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello has said the bombardment of Vieques over more than 50
years has led to high unemployment, high rates of cancer and severe
damage to the island's wildlife and its fragile coral reef.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has admitted that it mishandled relations with the
people of Vieques and has asked for another chance. But the people
of Puerto Rico have put Vieques on the political agenda in the
presidential campaign and in New York state, which has a large
Puerto Rican population.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore sides with Puerto Rico in the debate, as
does Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Senate candidate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have backed the Navy and have scheduled
hearings in the House and Senate on legislation that would close
Roosevelt Roads, a large $3 billion naval station in Puerto Rico,
if the commonwealth refuses to allow the resumption of live-fire
training.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal was derided as scare tactics by Puerto Rico
officials who have asked that the Navy be excluded from the talks
on Thursday. ``We don't want to talk to the Navy anymore,'' Aguilar
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Angel Morey, the secretary of state for Puerto
Rico, will meet with John Podesta, the White House chief of staff,
and a defense department representative.

SNOWSTORMS SLOW DOWN GOP CAMPAIGNING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ George W. Bush and Steve Forbes, fresh from
their first- and second-place finishes in Iowa, started their
Republican presidential campaigns over Tuesday in a state with
different voter attitudes, a different political process and a
different front-runner in John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The snowstorm that blanketed the East Coast Tuesday forced the
candidates to cancel numerous events, delaying the seven-day sprint
between the Iowa caucuses Monday and the nation's first
presidential primary in New Hampshire on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush set a record with his 41 percent victory in the
Iowa caucuses on Monday, the Granite State presents a new set of
hurdles. The primary is less a test of organizational strength, as
the Iowa caucuses were, and more a test of whether the candidates'
messages appeal to the independent-minded voters in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the maverick senator from Arizona, has concentrated his
campaign almost entirely on New Hampshire and now consistently
leads the Texas governor in public-opinion polls by up to 9
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who collected 1 percent of the vote in
Iowa on Monday, was apparently preparing to drop out of the
presidential race. But a Washington news conference was postponed
until Wednesday because of the snow.
</P>
<P>
   For Forbes, the magazine mogul who won 30 percent in Iowa, it
means firing double-barreled assaults at his long-term target,
Bush, and now McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued his broadsides at Bush's $483 billion tax-cut
plan in a state where the humming economy has made tax cuts less of
a voter priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-eight percent of Governor Bush's tax cuts go to the
wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. That's not what I want to do,''
McCain told government students at New England College in Henniker.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's tax proposal wouldn't set aside enough of the
surplus to save Social Security and reduce the national debt. But
Bush disputed those claims in a new TV commercial that started
running Tuesday in South Carolina and Delaware, two other February
primary states.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes took deliberate aim at Bush, charging that he had broken
tax pledges in Texas. He said ``voters are tired of politics, the
same old same old. Making pledges, then breaking pledges after the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes appeared to be tailoring his message to New Hampshire
voters, who are far less concerned with social issues than Iowans.
Forbes did not discuss his opposition to abortion, a central
campaign theme in the more socially conservative Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and his in-state supporters warned that Forbes could
damage the party the way, they say, Forbes did with nominee Bob
Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., a Bush supporter, said, ``Steve Forbes
is still remembered here in this state for what he did to Bob Dole.
There's still a lot of residual feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told a news conference that Forbes' ``scorched-earth''
campaign in Arizona in 1996 made it difficult for Dole to carry
what is usually a Republican state in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that (Forbes) would hear the voices of many
responsible Republicans that this kind of campaigning will hurt
either me, or, if he were to turn his sights on John McCain, hurt
John McCain,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of New Hampshire are going to reject ugly
politics,'' Bush said. ``When it is all said and done, the
Republicans of New Hampshire want to win the White House, even
those who are not for me ultimately are going to rally around a
candidate who can win the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added abortion to the issues on which he drew a
distinction from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Tuesday that he would support changing the
Republican Party platform plank against abortion to allow
exceptions for victims of rape or incest or if the woman's life was
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it reflects the view of the majority of Republicans,''
the Arizona senator told reporters on his campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush oppose abortion rights. But the Texas governor
has so far refused to say that he would try to change the GOP
platform to allow any exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He aligned with Bush on describing what they considered Roe vs.
Wade's tenuous constitutionality. Bush last week called the 1973
landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion a
``constitutional reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, McCain called it a ``very unusual interpretation of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But neither candidate would promise that their Supreme Court
appointees would take anti-abortion stands, only that their
judicial picks would adhere to ``constitutional principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes advisers said that it wouldn't bother them to see McCain
win the state because they believe that a Bush defeat would weaken
him in other states where Forbes has strong organizations.
</P>
<P>
   However, political analysts argued that a strategy might be
overly optimistic and did not take into account that Forbes does
not have a strong base of supporters in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Bush emerged as the narrow victor in a
nonbinding straw poll of Alaska Republicans, edging out Forbes by
five votes.

BORDER PATROL AGENTS OFTEN STOP LEGAL RESIDENTS, CRITICS COMPLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Filemon Vela is a federal judge, but a
Border Patrol agent recently mistook him for an illegal immigrant
or a drug smuggler. Vela and three aides were driving on an
isolated road when the agent pulled them over. Why? Because, the
agent explained, there were too many people in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The agent apologized and moved on, but the mistake did not
surprise the area's highest elected official, the Cameron County
judge, Gilberto Hinojosa. An agent recently followed him closely
for 10 miles as his wife and baby sat in the back seat, Hinojosa
said. Another agent once refused to let him board an airplane to
Houston until he stated his citizenship, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like occupied territory,'' Hinojosa said. ``It does
not feel like we're in the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the country, there is no Border Patrol because there
is no border. Yet in Brownsville, a city near the mouth of the Rio
Grande, where store signs are often in Spanish and old men strum
Mexican ballads on the sidewalks, many legal residents believe that
the Border Patrol operates as a sort of super police force that can
stop anyone it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol has poured agents into southern Texas for more
than two years, nearly doubling its force as part of a broader
national strategy to choke off illegal immigration. Without
question, ``Operation Rio Grande'' has sharply cut the number of
undocumented migrants crossing through Brownsville. And many local
merchants and Brownsville's mayor credit the increased numbers of
agents for the city's recent drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   But in a place where nearly everyone is Hispanic, including the
local power structure, people like Hinojosa believe that everyone
is now a target, regardless of legal status. As agents flag
vehicles on highways, or question passengers at the local airport
or bus station, they often catch the right people. But also they
also stop the wrong people, maybe because of their car, or their
clothes, or, invariably, the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why were you stopped?'' asks the local joke. The answer:
``Driving while Mexican.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is hard to quantify, since statistics are not kept
on stops of legal citizens. Border Patrol officials say mistakes
are rare because agents are trained to distinguish undocumented
immigrants from legal residents. Rather than throwing out a wide
net, officials say, agents follow specific profiles to identify
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   But Hinojosa, a second-generation Mexican-American, said that
stops were a daily part of life that were not only insulting to
legal residents but also left them feeling intimidated. He said
many poorer, newer residents were stopped regularly but were too
fearful to complain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews here along the border, stories abound:
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Morales, who runs homeless shelters and soup kitchens in
nearby Harlingen, was stopped on his way to a religious conference
in San Antonio. Ninfa Ochoa-Krueger, who leads a group that works
with immigrant families, was pulled over four times as she and her
husband drove about 60 miles, from McAllen to Brownsville, to
celebrate their wedding anniversary. Linda Yanez, a state appellate
judge in McAllen, filed a complaint about two years ago after an
agent in the airport tried to stop her daughter from returning to
college in Houston, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question becomes whether the benefits of the Border Patrol
doing this outweigh what I consider to be the Border Patrol
violating our constitutional rights,'' said Yanez, a former
immigration lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For residents, there has always been a complicated coexistence
with the Border Patrol. In the four border counties of the lower
Rio Grande Valley, Hispanics make up 88 percent of the nearly 1
million legal residents. Many families are only a generation away
from Mexico and have relatives waiting for citizenship. Other
residents chafe at the undocumented children overcrowding local
schools or drawing public benefits, and applaud the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The buildup of the patrol began in the mid-1990s, and since then
the Clinton administration has more than doubled its size, to about
9,000 agents. Officials have carried out targeted interdiction
efforts, like ``Operation Gate Keeper'' in California and
``Operation Hold the Line'' in El Paso. In late 1997, the Border
Patrol began ``Operation Rio Grande'' in southern Texas, expanding
local manpower to about 1,200 agents from around 700, equipping
them with infrared cameras, helicopters, airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Juan Lopez, assistant patrol agent in charge at the Brownsville
office, described the agents as a ``human fence'' controlling their
section of the Rio Grande. In the past, huge numbers of people
crossed the river in Cameron County and nearby Hidalgo County. Now,
Lopez said, the number of illegal immigrants caught by agents has
fallen to 25,053 in the last fiscal year, from 66,135 in 1997 _
proof, he says, that fewer people are trying to cross here. There
have also been high-profile drug seizures. A recent one turned up
3,450 pounds of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said that the problem of stopping legal residents was
taken seriously and that newer agents from other regions of the
country often struggled to make distinctions. Agents are posted in
the airport and bus station and along highways, he said, for the
obvious reason that those are the routes that illegal immigrants
use. Lopez also noted that border agents had saved the lives of
several people who almost drowned in the Rio Grande as they tried
to enter the country illegally. By law, border agents must have a
``reasonable suspicion'' to stop someone. A person's appearance,
for example, is considered pertinent in establishing such
suspicion. The profile can vary, Lopez said, but there are obvious
indicators, like cars overloaded with passengers, proximity to the
river, type of car; for example, a van capable of carrying a lot of
people. Agents also respond to tipoffs.

BELICHICK LOSES BID TO SHED CONTRACT ON ANTITRUST GROUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the never-ending saga of ``Who Wants to Be Coach of
the Patriots?'' a federal judge Tuesday denied Bill Belichick's
request for a temporary restraining order that would have freed him
to negotiate with teams free from the shackles of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's attorney, Jeffrey Kessler, who had filed an
antitrust suit against the National Football League a day earlier,
claimed the league was unfairly restricting his client's ability to
make a living. Not so, ruled US District Judge John W. Bissell.
</P>
<P>
   So the Patriots are back where they started, still needing to
work out compensation with the New York Jets in order to hire
Belichick as coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the muck and mire of Boston weather _ symbolic of the
Patriots' coaching situation _ prevented coaching candidate Dom
Capers from getting into town for an interview. The Jacksonville
Jaguars defensive coordinator will try again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former Pittsburgh Steelers director of football operations Tom
Donahoe did make it to Bob Kraft's Boston office to interview for
the general manager's job. Donahoe interviewed for about three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   While vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier has been in
on some interviews, he will not be involved in the interviewing of
Capers.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots hire Donahoe, a name that may surface as a
coaching candidate is Steelers defensive coordinator Jim Haslett, a
close friend of Donahoe. Haslett, like Capers and Donahoe, is a
candidate for a job in New Orleans, although Donahoe's chances
there took a blow Tuesday when the Saints offered the GM position
to Seattle executive Randy Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Belichick are still indicating that he will coach
in the NFL in 2000, but the jobs are dwindling. Only New England,
Dallas, and New Orleans have head coaching openings. If the Saints
hire a GM, only the Patriots would give Belichick head coach and GM
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Bissell said in his finding that Belichick created the situation
he finds himself in and there would be irreparable harm if he sat
out a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bissell scheduled a conference call for Wednesday with lawyers
for Belichick and the Jets to determine whether an additional
hearing would be scheduled on Belichick's request for a permanent
injunction.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were represented at the hearing by Glenn Kurtz, who
argued that allowing Belichick to coach the division rival Patriots
would cause competive harm to the Jets because of Belichick's
intimate knowledge of New York's players and organization. The
Patriots know all about that, as Belichick has devised
extraordinary game plans against them, his former employers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling took the pressure off NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue, who had upheld Belichick's contract with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots must keep a close eye on the Saints situation
because Capers, who was an assistant in New Orleans for six years,
could be their front-runner. The Cowboys are looking for an
offensive head coach, but they're hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints have also interviewed Giants defensive coordinator
John Fox and Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis, and
they plan on interviewing Haslett and Falcons offensive line coach
Art Shell.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are far ahead of the Patriots in terms of preparing for
next season. They have named Al Groh head coach and the plan is to
make former Boston College coach Dan Henning offensive coordinator,
replacing Charlie Weis, who would go with Belichick. Groh is said
to be considering Cardinals defensive backs coach Larry Marmie or
Bills linebacker coach Chuck Lester for defensive coordinator.

 BROWNSVILLE, Texas: with passengers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Agents just don't go stopping people because they want to stop
them,'' Lopez said. ``There's always a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, border agents answer to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and do not have the same powers as a police
officer. They must limit their questioning to immigration issues
and are not supposed to ask questions like, ``Have you been
drinking?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not every local official is a critic. Brownsville's mayor,
Blanca Vela, said ``border bandits'' once slipped across the river
to steal from downtown merchants. Now, she said, crime is down as
border agents bicycle through downtown. Agents also have provided
backup for the local police on certain calls.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Vela, who has lived in Brownsville for 38 years,
encounters with border agents are simply part of life in the
Valley. ``I feel like, hey, if I'm not doing anything wrong, and
I'm asked, `Are you an American citizen?', I say, `Yes, sir,'''
said the mayor, who is married to Judge Vela.
</P>
<P>
   The huge presence is most noticeable along Military Highway, the
two-lane road winding west out of the city beside the Rio Grande.
Every night, after the farmers have left their soybean and onion
fields along the river, shifts of border agents in green and white
trucks arrive to patrol the dirt levees. Other agents sit in
camouflaged towers searching for interlopers with infrared cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Domanski, a receptionist at the county courthouse who
lives on Military Highway, said she sometimes counts Border Patrol
trucks on her ride home the way some bored motorists count cows.
Her record: 22. She said a border agent once stopped her as she
drove from her house to unlock her nearby church for services. On
another night, a border agent parked his truck in front of her
house with his headlights shining into her bedroom. Finally, at
midnight, she knocked on his window.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asleep!'' said Ms. Domanski, who is of Polish and
Mexican descent.
</P>
<P>
   In Cameron Park, a low-income community with a large population
of undocumented residents, border agents are a daily presence.
Local leaders say Cameron Park is often the first stopover for
illegal immigrants moving on to points north, as well as home to
several drug traffickers. Last May and June, border agents swept
in, promising to help law-abiding members of the community.
However, the Rev. Mike Seifert, a local Catholic priest, said the
agents instead stopped practically everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, everybody was suspected,'' he said. ``And everybody
is not the problem.'' Seifert said something must be done to stop
the drug runners, but but sweeps were not the issue. ``There's got
to be a more subtle way of handling this,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Vela has heard scores of immigration and drug cases. Yet when he
and his staff were stopped about four months ago, his stature did
not matter. They were halfway to Laredo and were passing through an
area known as a narcotics smuggling route. Three of the four
occupants in the vehicle were Hispanic, but Judge Vela said the
agent justified the stop because of the number of passengers in the
car. Vela said he had filed a complaint with the U.S, attorney,
calling for improved training of agents.
</P>
<P>
   Vela said he considered his case an exception. But he conceded
that it made him wonder how other people were treated. Once, while
waiting at the airport, he said he noticed that border agents were
stopping only Hispanics. ``I said, `Do you ever stop anybody who
isn't brown?''' he recalled. ``They said, `Yes, we do.' `Well, you
haven't since I've been here,' I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, the Border Patrol supervisor, said he, too, had been
stopped, many years ago. He said he was driving an old Crown
Victoria and ``looked like a mafioso.'' Then, he showed his Border
Patrol badge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I get offended?'' he asked. ``No, I don't. Those guys are
doing their job.''

   NEW YORK _ Different quarter. Same story.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. is in the middle of perhaps the most ambitious
corporate makeover in the land. Yet the financial results it posted
Tuesday were strikingly similar to those of the last three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, AT&AMP;T barely beat analysts' earnings estimates, this
time by 2 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Once again, though,
earnings were sharply lower than a year earlier, largely because of
AT&AMP;T's acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., the cable TV giant.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the robust growth of the company's consulting and
wireless units let AT&AMP;T post modest overall revenue growth. Once
again, AT&AMP;T's core unit that sells long-distance phone service to
consumers shrank in the face of a simmering price war and increased
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were not overly impressed. AT&AMP;T's stock rose 56.25
cents a share, to $51.125, on the New York Stock Exchange after
spending most of the day at a loss. Then again, that modest rise
could be seen as a victory for AT&AMP;T because the company's chief
financial officer told analysts in the morning that earnings for
the current quarter would be slightly lower than those of the final
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Though AT&AMP;T's earnings were slightly better than expected, some
analysts Tuesday called the report relatively unimpressive both
because of questions about how AT&AMP;T achieved its results and
disappointment over the less-than-spectacular revenue growth. The
company noted a reduction in its effective tax rate, to 33.4
percent from 37.1 percent in the last quarter of 1998, and some
analysts wondered whether the company beat expectations in part
because of that change. One analyst also said that AT&AMP;T's operating
income was less than expected and that the shortfall had been
offset by non-operating profits that were not completely
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges and gains as well as losses
associated with AT&AMP;T's interests in Cablevision Systems and the
Excite(AT)Home cable modem venture, AT&AMP;T reported earnings of $1.84
billion, or 57 cents a diluted share. That was down 16.2 percent
from earnings of 68 cents a share for the comparable period of
1998, but 2 cents higher than the 55 cents a share consensus
estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's results demonstrate we're delivering on our
commitments to investors while aggressively executing our long-term
growth strategy,'' C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman, said in a
statement. ``For the past two years, we've grown revenue
quarter-over-quarter, cut costs significantly and invested in
high-growth businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said, ``It's a little better than same old,
same old.''
</P>
<P>
   That was to some extent true in terms of revenue growth, but
perhaps not as true as some investors would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire IBM's global network
operation. Accounting as if that unit and Tele-Communications had
always been part of the company, AT&AMP;T reported revenue growth of
5.9 percent, to $16.33 billion from $15.42 billion in the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That was a lot better than some truly anemic growth rates AT&AMP;T
was posting just a few years ago, but still shy of the 6 percent
figure that many analysts considered AT&AMP;T's target. With the
overall telecommunications industry appearing to grow far more
quickly than AT&AMP;T, shifting the company's revenue growth into a
higher gear has been a priority for Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the IBM deal is completed and AT&AMP;T has made a strong
move into the cable television business, the road appears open for
AT&AMP;T to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and his team must focus on the mundane operational
details that will allow them to make their vision real, even as
they fight a rear-guard action against the regional Bell phone
companies that are infiltrating AT&AMP;T's core long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Strumingher, an analyst with Paine Webber, called 1999 ``a
real building year in which AT&AMP;T acquired the assets that will turn
it into one of the premier growth companies in the communications
sector.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T apparently plans to continue to build on those assets later
this week. Executives close to the company said Tuesday that the
company's data unit, led by Kathleen B. Earley, intends to announce
as soon as Thursday that it will expand its operation that manages
applications for corporate customers on AT&AMP;T's network.
</P>
<P>
   Including all charges and gains, AT&AMP;T formally reported earnings
of $1.15 billion, or 36 cents a diluted share, down from $1.99
billion, or 75 cents a share, during the comparable period of 1998.
Including the impact of AT&AMP;T's acquisitions, revenue rose to $16.33
billion, from $13.53 billion in the final quarter of 1998.

OPINIONS DIFFER ON AMOUNT HMO OWES INSTITUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State hospital officials said Tuesday Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care owes their institutions millions of dollars more than
Harvard Pilgrim estimates, and they fear a state-sanctioned rescue
plan for the HMO could leave them holding stacks of unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   While regulators announced that Harvard's finances have
stabilized and that at least 13 health care companies are
interested in buying or investing in the troubled HMO, the
Massachusetts Hospital Association said unpaid claims to the
hospitals could reach $300 million, compared with the $170 million
Harvard says it now owes.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators disputed the hospital association's numbers but
conceded they still don't have an accurate accounting of the
company's total liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly and Insurance Commissioner
Linda Ruthardt, who is the court-appointed receiver for Harvard
Pilgrim, said during a press conference Tuesday that they believe
the association's estimate is ``not right,'' but that they don't
know by how much.
</P>
<P>
   First Attorney General Dean Richlin said $300 million is too
high. ``We want to make sure Harvard only pays what it owes,'' he
said. ``We want to get to the real number but we don't know what it
is yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The current dispute includes:
</P>
<P>
   --One hospital that says it's owed an extra $1.2 million because
it didn't know it was required to add two letters to a seven-number
computer code when charging for certain physician services.
</P>
<P>
   --Hospitals that say claims were inappropriately denied by
Harvard _ sometimes because they failed to include a patient's
middle initial _ and wiped off the insurer's systems before the
appeal period was completed.
</P>
<P>
   --Hospitals that say Harvard is not counting charges for
services performed, but not billed for, before the state took over
the HMO on Jan. 4. Bruce Bullen, Harvard's chief operating officer,
however, said this amount is included in Harvard's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement between hospitals and insurers over billing
practices is nothing new, nor is it confined to Massachusetts
hospitals and Harvard Pilgrim. The two sides last year began
discussing ways to simplify billing.
</P>
<P>
   But the Harvard Pilgrim crisis is bringing into the open the
complexity _ and some say near impossibility _ of accurately
tracking charges for 1.1 million Harvard patients who fall under
about 200 different hospital and physician contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Getting an accurate picture of Harvard's debt is crucial not
only because it determines payments for struggling hospitals, but
because potential buyers need to know the insurer's liabilities and
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is how big a problem does Harvard have?'' said
one top hospital executive.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospital officials said they did not want to be identified
because they feared they would anger Harvard or the attorney
general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Richlin said state officials are not sure why the numbers are so
different. But he said it could be that the hospitals and Harvard
``count things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real complexity here and we just don't have a simple
answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullen said hospitals often bill what they believe a service
should cost, or their actual charges _ not the discounted rate
negotiated with Harvard for sending a large volume of patients to
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we are making an accurate estimate of what our
obligations are; we've done a very thorough job,'' he said.
``Hospitals are always interested in obtaining as much revenue as
they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Reichman, an analyst for Standard &AMP; Poor's, said
Massachusetts hospitals have been slow to build computer systems
that communicate with those at HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall managed care has not penetrated into the hospital
systems as it has in other major urban areas,'' he said. ``In areas
where hospitals have embraced managed care they put systems in
place where they can submit claims electronically _ and submit the
same numbers agreed upon in the contracts. But the hospitals in
Boston have a lot of clout.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital association is not wavering from its estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``No system is perfect,'' said Andrew Dreyfus, executive vice
president at the Massachusetts Hospital Association. ``But our
experience over the last few years is that health plans try to deny
claims or make slow payments to claims. That's one reason we're in
the situation we're in today. We have to be sure we don't resolve
Harvard Pilgrim's problems and leave a huge outstanding liability
to the hospitals.''

 &HT;    Clemons is big man on campus, gridiron
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charlie Clemons. Super Bowl linebacker. Principal's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: ``Class, I'd like you to welcome your substitute
teacher for today. Can you say good morning to Mr. Clemons? All 250
pounds of him?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' Clemons, formerly of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and the
Ottawa Rough Riders, chuckled with reporters Tuesday afternoon
recalling some of the questions he got doing some teaching back at
home in Griffin, Ga., during his offseasons from the Canadian
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Canada? What kind of football is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd walk in the classroom and they'd be awed by my size,''
said Clemons, who'd like to teach again once his football career is
over. ``Then they get into 'Do you play football?' We don't get
anything done that day. We talk about football the first couple
hours then I say 'Calm down, let's focus on the task at hand.' ``
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't know at the time was that as much teaching as
he was doing, Clemons was doing plenty of learning himself. Testing
his skills, his will, and his ability to withstand frigid weather,
Clemons played three years in Canada before Rams assistant coach
and vice-president for football operations Lynn Stiles, who was
then with the Kansas City Chiefs, stumbled upon Clemons and
eventually convinced Rams coach Dick Vermeil to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in junior college, two disappointing years at
the University of Georgia, three years in the CFL, and now finally
three years with the St. Louis Rams, Mr. Clemons' will be teaching
his greatest lesson on Sunday, playing on special teams and in
nickel situations for the Rams in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Field trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was instilled by my mother and father and all my peers, be
the type of person you are and you will always succeed,'' said
Clemons, who has 14 brothers and sisters making the 45-minute trip
north from Griffin for Sunday's game. ``That's what I did and
followed my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years at Northeast Oklahoma Junior College, Clemons
started at linebacker at Georgia, but played in the shadow of
linebacker Randall Godrey. He didn't hear from any NFL teams until
a week after the 1994 draft was over. After he'd left for Griffin
from Athens, he got word that a note had been taped to the door of
his apartment saying Buffalo wanted to give him a shot as a free
agent. By then, he'd already faxed his contract to Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The CFL) was a stepping stone,'' said Clemons who is married
and a father of three. ``I can't say anything negative about it
because it was a job. You can't complain about a job. I fed my
family with it and just stayed positive through the whole situation
and it worked out well for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In pass-happy, wide-open Canadian football, Clemons honed his
pass rushing skills, the same ones which earned him a job with the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two seasons with the Rams he was primarily a
special teams player. This season, playing a bigger role on
defense, he recorded a career highs in tackles (44), sacks (three),
and interceptions (one) and tied for the team lead in special teams
tackles (23).
</P>
<P>
   Clemons gives some of the credit to his cousin Jessie Tuggle,
the Pro Bowl linebacker for the Falcons, who went undrafted himself
out of Valdosta State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me look, it's not going to help to sit around and pout
about it,'' Clemons said. ``Take the bitter with the sweet and
continue to work hard on the field. Your teammates will understand
your importance on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Football fans in general understood after watching Clemons make
a pair of critical sacks in the Rams' two playoff games, including
the one Sunday which took Shaun King and the Bucs out of field goal
range on a critical third down play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I know is hard work,'' Clemons said. ``Now when I
look back, I wouldn't have it any other way because it's shown me
how to be a complete person, rather than just a sports figure. You
learn so many lessons in this business and that's one of the things
that will stick with me after football -the hard work, the
dedication, sticking with your heart and whatever you believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Class dismissed.

<P>
   BRITAIN: MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking Church of England committee recommended that the
divorced be permitted to remarry even if former spouses are still
living. The move would formalize what is now common practice and
would pave the way for the Prince of Wales to marry his longtime
companion, Camilla Parker Bowles, an event previously seen as
impossible for a future supreme governor of the church. To take
effect, the recommendation must be adopted by the church Synod,
which meets next year.

   BRITAIN: BELGIUM'S PINOCHET PLEA
</P>
<P>
   Belgium joined six rights groups in a move in the High Court to
keep Britain from letting Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 84, return home to
Chile. Belgium is seeking an order blocking his departure until he
is examined by Belgian doctors. Home Secretary Jack Straw has
refused to make public a report by four British doctors that found
the former dictator medically unfit to stand trial in Spain on
torture charges. Brussels has filed an extradition bid in behalf of
Chileans living in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: ASYLUM SEEKERS INCREASE
</P>
<P>
   More refugees sought asylum in Britain in 1999 than in any
previous year, the government said. With 89,700 refugees, Britain
had the highest number of asylum-seekers in Europe after Germany,
which had 95,300. The government said only a quarter of those who
applied, the highest number from Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka and China,
in that order, are expected to be granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA: HAIDER IN TALKS
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing Freedom Party, led by Joerg Haider, will begin
talks with the conservative, business-oriented Austrian Peoples
Party about forming a coalition government, the Peoples Party
leader announced. The parties virtually tied for second place in
October, but the Peoples Party was unable to form a government with
the winning Social Democrats. Haider opposes immigration and the
expansion of the European Union.

   GERMANY: JOINING LABOR FUND
</P>
<P>
   SKF of Sweden, the world's largest roller-bearing maker,
announced it would join the German compensation fund for Nazi-era
slave and forced laborers but that it had not yet decided how much
it would contribute. SKF had factories in Nazi Germany that used
forced labor. Germany agreed last month to pay victims $5.15

   President Ernesto Zedillo repeated an urgent plea to the
Congress, first issued a year ago, to approve laws opening the
electric power industry to private investment. He argued that tax
revenues cannot provide the billions of dollars in new capital the
industry needs. But the chairman of a congressional committee, who
opposes the initiative as an undesirable new selloff of public

On the same day, a gang fight in the tiny marketplace of the

THIRTEEN POTENTIAL INVESTORS LOOKING AT AILING HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thirteen potential investors have stepped forward to
kick the tires and look under the hood of Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care to decide if they want to pump capital into the financially
troubled health plan, or perhaps buy it outright, state officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly would not divulge the identities
of the interested parties, but said he expects within two weeks to
``be at the point where we'll be ready to make a decision'' about
the fate of Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   The potential rescuers have signed secrecy agreements so they
can examine Harvard Pilgrim records in a guarded room at the
attorney general's office. Reilly said they include both those who
would provide the cash to rehabilitate the nonprofit company and
those interested in buying it, possibly converting it into a
for-profit plan.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, state officials are not ready to say
what Harvard Pilgrim's total indebtedness is _ a crucial factor in
any rescue plan. They did say they disagreed with recent estimates
by investment analysts and Massachusetts hospitals that the HMO
owes as much as $300 million, and said they would have a better
idea of Harvard Pilgrim's debt by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there could be further surprises such as the $58.5
million in unexpected 1999 losses that tipped Harvard Pilgrim into
state receivership earlier this month, state insurance commissioner
Linda Ruthardt, the court-appointed receiver, said: ``How can you
know if there is going to be a surprise?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably near the end of the time when everyone is
walking on eggs,'' Ruthardt added, ``But we'd be fools to say we
know absolutely everything. We just can't promise we will not find
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and other Massachusetts officials also heard warnings
Tuesday from a Rhode Island delegation about the difficulties they
have faced in the wake of the bankruptcy of Harvard Pilgrim's
subsidiary there last fall _ and how the Rhode Island situation
could affect Massachusetts' efforts to salvage the region's biggest
HMO.
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Patrick Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat who led the
delegation, said in an interview that Reilly ``readily
acknowledged'' that the two states' Harvard Pilgrim dilemmas are
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he told Massachusetts officials that ``our problems
are your problems. There is no way to bring stability to the
situation in Massachusetts when you have volatility in Rhode
Island. Our experience should be a real lesson to Massachusetts
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible complication, observers said, might be a lawsuit
against the parent Harvard Pilgrim firm in federal court, filed by
Rhode Island's attorney general on behalf of hospitals and doctors
who say they are owed $60 million by the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would certainly have a chilling effect on anyone coming
forward as a potential investor'' in Harvard Pilgrim's
Massachusetts operations, said William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts
secretary of state, who attended a meeting with the Rhode Island
delegation along with House Speaker Thomas Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   One practical problem, Kennedy said, is that Rhode Island
officials have been unable to get data from Harvard Pilgrim needed
to pay 1999 bills to doctors and hospitals out of a $30 million
reserve fund the HMO set up. Reilly promised to help the Rhode
Island delegation get the needed information.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said large Massachusetts employers are apparently
sticking by Harvard Pilgrim instead of decamping to other insurers.
A weekly report of Harvard Pilgrim's membership levels shows the
health plan at roughly 1.1 million subscribers, a number that has
remained stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's slightly better than anticipated,'' showing that
``employers continue to show their support,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors hired by the state as well as Harvard Pilgrim's own
accounting firm are scheduled to finish reviewing the health plan's
1999 books by Thursday, giving regulators a higher level of comfort
about its true financial condition, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile accountants have concluded that Harvard Pilgrim's plan
to get back on track as a viable health plan is ``reasonable,''
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now our intention to test that in the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and investment bankers hired to broker a deal are
working furiously to meet a court-ordered deadline of Feb. 3.
Reilly said the four document rooms where interested investors are
poring over Harvard Pilgrim records will remain open 24 hours a day
until the review process in complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that will continue through the week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said he plans to file a court-ordered report on progress
toward a solution on Friday. He added that he would prefer an
infusion of capital in the form of a loan or other investment
rather than a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can restore Harvard Pilgrim to financial health, I think
we all agree that is a preferable way to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Service Employees Union, which represents health
care workers, petitioned the court to participate in the
receivership process. ``There's been a lot of clamor, but we're
concerned that the voice of the health care worker and the voice
for quality patient care has been lost in the din,'' said Rand
Wilson, a union spokesman.

2ND DIPLOMAT IS SUGGESTED FOR ARMS POST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Leading members of the Security Council,
deadlocked over the nomination of a new chief arms inspector for
Iraq, have apparently decided to ask Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to withdraw the name of Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat, and offer
the job to another Swedish disarmament expert, Hans Blix.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the decision could be announced within a day or
two, although the Security Council has not yet acted in any formal
way and the plan could be upset.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, 72, was the director-general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, a U.N. organization in Vienna, Austria, from 1981 to
1997. During that period he became a contentious figure among arms
control experts because the agency, which regularly inspected Iraqi
nuclear programs and fuel stockpiles, was accused of missing a
secret weapons program that did not come to light until after the
1991 war in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has since been considerably strengthened, diplomats
say, because nations that make up its governing board realized that
it had not been given enough power to conduct more intrusive
searches. Agency inspectors who missed the bomb project had in fact
been limited to looking at material Iraq had declared under the
1968 nonproliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 war, inspectors learned in Iraq that a country
could run a parallel bomb program completely out of sight while
fulfilling all the obligations associated with its peaceful nuclear
projects.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, the atomic agency had uncovered another
secret program in North Korea. Since 1994, when an agreement was
signed with the North Koreans to phase out that program in return
for foreign investment in peaceful reactors, the agency has had
inspectors permanently stationed in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, an expert in international and constitutional law, had
some differences with the U.N. Special Commission, UNSCOM, which
was created after the 1991 war to destroy Iraq's prohibited
biological and chemical weapons and missile systems, and the means
to make them.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM became what diplomats call the senior partner in the Iraq
inspection programs, with the atomic energy agency, which inspected
nuclear facilities, playing a secondary role. Ekeus was UNSCOM's
executive chairman for much of that time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the friction between UNSCOM and the atomic energy agency
_ and between Blix and Ekeus _ was the suggestion Blix made before
his retirement that at some point any inspection commission would
have to decide that it had found all it could find in prohibited
weapons and materials and could then move to long-term but rigorous
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM, on the other hand, was more determined under both Ekeus
and his successor, Richard Butler, to pursue all leads until
virtually every question was answered and every missing item found
or accounted for. The differences were heightened by the fact that
the atomic energy agency was a U.N. body staffed by organization
employees _ ``bureaucrats,'' in the eyes of UNSCOM's more
independent inspectors lent by governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis consistently trumpeted these differences to the
detriment of UNSCOM. If Iraq's past praise for the atomic energy
agency is any guide, the government of President Saddam Hussein
will have to think of new reasons for rejecting Blix as it rejected
the return of Ekeus.
</P>
<P>
   France, Russia and to some extent China opposed Ekeus' return.
Tuesday night, diplomats said that those three, and the United
States and Britain _ all five council members with vetos _ were
close to a formal agreement on Blix.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A potent winter storm stunned much of the East
Coast on Tuesday, crimping all but emergency government services
and entirely shutting down the capital's federal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The swift, dense storm roared north overnight to New England
from the Carolinas after burying Raleigh in well over a foot of
snow as the state's National Guard manned shovels to face a state
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Brandishing wind gusts of 40 miles per hour and burying the most
stricken areas in the Carolinas in 20 inches of snow, the storm's
severity took weather forecasters by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, businesses and airports were closed or severely
hampered in the thick swath of the storm. It stopped Philadelphia's
new mayor, John Street, from delivering his first budget address as
he took to the streets to deal instead with his first snow
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware legislative session was canceled, while Gov. James
B. Hunt of North Carolina declared a general emergency from snow
accumulations of more than 18 inches in the worst hit areas. ``This
is a dangerous storm and should be treated as such,'' he warned as
utility workers described hurricane-like damage in the storm's
wake.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, close to 200 motorists had to be rescued from
snowdrifts that paralyzed interstate highways. More than 200,000
homes were reported without power along the border of the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful, but it took us by surprise,'' said Karen
Duncan in York County, S.C., speaking from her new home that was
left in 50-degree heat after 10 inches of snow socked in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of ad hoc measures, a visiting Chinese military
delegation in Washington resorted to taking the Metro subway rather
than a motorcade to reach a high-level meeting with officials at
the Pentagon in Virginia. In South Carolina, children freed from
school in the snow-encrusted Midlands improvised sleds from the
boogy boards that they normally ply at the resort area's
beachfronts.
</P>
<P>
   LaGuardia Airport in New York closed, as did Washington's Reagan
National Airport and airports in Boston, Philadelphia and
Baltimore. At the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, runways
were under 17 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the Eastern Seaboard was paralyzed, the New York
City metropolitan area managed to escape the worst of the storm.
But more snow fell in the city than had been predicted: New York
City officials were told to expect only 1 to 3 inches, but up to 6
inches fell in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the extra measure of snow, thousands decided to spend the
day at home. There were 140,000 fewer commuters than normal by bus
or train between New Jersey and New York City. ``Everyone knows
that everyone else is home, so everyone has been e-mailing each
other just to check in and say hi,'' said Joan Gilbert, a public
relations consultant in Ossining, in Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, though, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani offered an upbeat
report, detailing the progress at clearing city streets, rattling
off statistics about the number of plows and salt trucks, even
offering reports on flight delays at Kennedy Airport and the lower
speed limit imposed on the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Snowbound and short of bureaucrats, the federal government was
declared closed in Washington on Tuesday morning as the capital
hardened into an icy still-life, out of bounds to all but the
hardiest pedestrians and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate all the white stuff since we don't have it,''
declared Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, speaking as a delighted
but cautious Mississippian. He yielded to the intense storm and cut
off the government's legislative deliberations soon after the
executive branch shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The executive branch had first attempted a partial work day
under the ``liberal leave'' option that lets individual workers try
to get to work or not. But this was soon abandoned in favor of an
outright shutdown, as the driving snows intensified after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   More than a foot of snow was measured in outlying suburbs where
many of the 250,000 federal workers live. The snow shutdown, the
first in four years, cost an estimated $60 million in lost labor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Overnight predictions had left the city expecting the storm to
be less intense and later in arriving than it proved to be; the
capital awoke to deep drifts and impassable roads. ``Everybody
involved in this would have preferred a longer lead time,''
conceded Dr. Louis Uccellini, director of the National Center for
Environmental Prediction, as the capital shifted to postmortem
critiques even before the snows ceased.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, work went forward on President Clinton's
final State of the Union address to be delivered Thursday. There
was play, too, when Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, could
not resist the drifts outside the West Wing and divided the staff
for a snowball fight.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours of steadily falling snow enforced a mood of
small-town serenity upon the capital, exemplified at the Senate
barbershop where two barbers showed up. They quietly snipped away,
talking about the weather with a few equally adventurous customers.
``Nobody told me not to work,'' one barber explained, speaking on
the condition of anonymity that seems to mark even the most
atypical business day at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The only other activity in sight was a news media stakeout
outside room 410 in the Cannon House office building. Reporters
slouched in a corridor clot of wintry mufti, awaiting the visiting
Cuban grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez, the refugee schoolboy at the
heart of the custody struggle raging between Havana and Miami's
Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't touch the snow, we only walked on it,'' one of the
grandmothers gently replied when the news conference, like most
discussions here Tuesday, finally got around to asking about the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked of it at a news conference at which he pledged
federal aid for the buried areas. ``I'm glad you all got here,'' he
told reporters, beaming as he added, ``I thought school was
canceled today.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House, a few tourists bucked the slanting snow
and stood on the base of the security fence to get a better look at
the white-on-white tableau. Officer Stephanie Clark of the U.S.
Park Police shooed them off the fence, then discovered her patrol
car was stuck in a curbside snowbank. ``This is one day where it's
not great to be a police officer,'' she muttered, fetching a shovel
from the trunk and digging the car out.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics continued as usual in snow-inured New
Hampshire as the primary contenders darted about with the help of
blade plows and political spinners. But in South Carolina, where
the contending is usually balmier, the deep snow stopped Elizabeth
Dole's rounds on behalf of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Blustery, icy snow lashed the capital Mall at midday when
Derrick Wooley, from Monterey, La., talked three of his friends
into venturing forth with him to experience what he exulted in
describing as the very first snowfall of his life. ``I love it,''
he said, chewing on some snow. ``Well, I find it makes me thirsty
stomping around in it,'' explained Wooley, a new arrival in town
who is a legislative intern at the American Association of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a hill,'' said his friend, Brian Shaifer, an
intern with the Organization of American States from Natchez,
Miss., another Southerner looking to attempt his very first
sledding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to talk them out of it,'' said Marisa Collins as
the group headed toward the meager slope of Capitol Hill,
brandishing slices of cardboard to serve as sleds. ``I'm from New
York; I've seen this stuff before.''

NOTING SHORTFALLS, U.S. RENEWS HEALTH GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration released a set of goals
Tuesday aimed at improving the health of the population over the
next decade, even as officials acknowledged that the country had
failed to meet 85 percent of targets set 10 years ago for concerns
like smoking, obesity and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the two-volume report, senior officials of the
Department of Health and Human Services said that the nation had
met only 15 percent of 319 targets established in 1990 and was
making progress on another 45 percent. In some areas, particularly
obesity, marijuana use among teen-agers, exercise and asthma and
diabetes, the health of the American people remained the same, or
in some cases worsened.
</P>
<P>
   The latest 10-year plan, when read alongside the most recent
status update on the previous goals, paints an uneven tableau of
the country's health. The reports indicated that while medical
advances and some behavioral changes had increased life expectancy
and improved the quality of life, much of the population refused to
follow two of the most basic recommendations by health
professionals: eat nutritious foods and exercise regularly.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the report described a population that was
sedentary, more prone to diabetes and asthma and simply fatter. It
is in these areas where health and human services officials have
had the most difficulty meeting their goals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials said the country had made progress in a number
of high-profile areas, like homicide and suicide rates, violence
among adolescents, drinking, use of illicit drugs, contraceptive
use, immunization rates and infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teen birth rate has fallen for seven years in a row; the
overall immunization rate for preschool children has increased to a
record 80 percent; tobacco and illicit drug use among teen-agers
has declined,'' said Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human
services. ``We've made major investments in the health of our
children, increased life expectancy and prenatal care. And we've
taken steps in the battle against disease, including AIDS and
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Healthy People 2010,'' was the latest in a series
of 10-year plans published by the government since 1980. It lays
out objectives on subjects as varied as oral hygiene, hearing
problems, cancer and stroke. The Health and Human Services
Department issues annual updates on the country's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The new goals call for 30 percent of adults to be exercising
regularly by 2010, a target that was supposed to have been met this
year. As of 1995, the last year for which complete figures are
available, 23 percent of adults engaged in light to moderate
exercise five times a week and 16 percent did so seven times
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that in 10 years they would like 85 percent of
students in grades nine through 12 to be engaging in physical
exercise at least three times a week. In 1997, 64 percent of
students were exercising that much.

 &HT;    Winter grabs hold of Eastern U.S.
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The mighty ``nor'easter'' that dropped 20 inches of
snow on Raleigh, forced cancellation of a global warming conference
in Washington and closed airports all along the East Coast will
move through Canada today, according to forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta, where thousands of residents were still without
electricity from Sunday's ice storm, was not out of the cold yet.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, a front that rained on Los Angeles on
Tuesday will bring another chance of snow, ice and sleet to
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   If that storm reaches Atlanta early Friday _ when forecasters
predict temperatures will be in the low 20s _ there could be snow.
And that pre-Super Bowl slushy cocktail could spill over into
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier it gets here, the more chance for frozen
precipitation,'' said Mark Tobin, a meteorologist for AccuWeather,
a private forecasting firm in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's winter blast closed airports in Washington, Boston,
Richmond, Raleigh, Philadelphia and Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept saying, `We haven't had winter,' '' said Richard
Jones, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Raleigh.
``I guess this will show them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, more than 300
flights _ about 10 percent of the traffic _ were canceled Tuesday
because of shutdowns to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Flights through Hartsfield may be affected today if snow can't
be removed from airports to the north. Travelers are advised to
contact their airline to see if their flights are canceled, delayed
or on time.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Conventions and Visitors Bureau reported area hotels
had rooms, although accommodations might be hard to find by week's
end because of Super Bowl bookings.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sieradzki, whose Decatur, Ga.-based company, Connection,
books reservations in Atlanta, said there were plenty of rooms
available for travelers stranded by the weather. ``The bulk of the
Super Bowl folks come Thursday, so they should have no problems,''
Sieradzki said.
</P>
<P>
   But some passengers in Atlanta were hoping to find a way to get
to the Northeast without staying over.
</P>
<P>
   Tanveelr Asgher, a Pakistani soccer ball manufacturer, missed a
meeting with a customer in New York but still hoped to catch one of
the few flights that were getting there Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't tell me if I can get a flight, so I'll just stay
here until I know,'' Asgher said. ``If not, my hotel told me they
had a room for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, the nation's rail passenger service, warned travelers to
expect delays along the Washington to Boston corridor. ``We may
cancel some trains,'' said Rick Remington, a spokesman in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The snowstorm shut most federal agencies in Washington,
including the Pentagon. But Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a
Wisconsin native, kept the Supreme Court open.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of U.S. Global Change decided to postpone its
scheduled symposium on the earth's warming climate. However,
spokesman Tony Socci cautioned that no single snowstorm _ no matter
how cold and miserable _ can be used to gauge long-term climatic
change.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, Pennsylvania Avenue was a ghostly, lonesome byway. TV
correspondents lined up on a strategic sidewalk so they could
report on the storm with the snowy U.S. Capitol dome in the
background. Presidential Press Secretary Joe Lockhart engaged
members of his staff in a snowball fight on the White House
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he had directed an emergency release of
home heating assistance funds for Alaska and the Northeast, ``which
have experienced the greatest hardships'' from the cold and rising
heating oil prices. In Tennessee, the main highway through the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, U.S. 441, remained closed.
Newfound Gap, the 5,500-foot-high pass, has been covered in a
``sheet of ice'' since Friday night, said park service spokeswoman
Nancy Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plow trucks can't get up there to scrape it because they
keep slipping on the ice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, at least one death was attributed to the
storm. Trooper Steve Everett said Audrey Napier, 20, of
Jacksonville, N.C., was killed when her car skidded on
sleet-slicked I-95 near the South Carolina border, crossed the
median and slammed head-on into a northbound tractor-trailer rig.
</P>
<P>
   Napier's passenger, 20-year-old Carlos Malcolm of Stone
Mountain, Ga., was transported to St. Eugene Hospital in Dillon,
S.C. He was listed in good condition Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Great Barrington, Mass., divers Tuesday searched the
Housatonic River for a girl who tumbled into the water during a
heavy snowstorm. Town Manager Burke LaClair said the girl fell in
with her brother on their way to a nearby school. The boy was
rescued and in good condition at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, overconfident drivers of four-wheel-drive sport
utility vehicles careened along the icy roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a special problem posed by SUV drivers who think they
are invincible. They're causing an inordinate number of accidents
and that's not counting what police in local municipalities are
having to deal with,'' said Maryland emergency management spokesman
Quentin Banks.
</P>
<P>
   While schools remained closed in many areas of the Carolinas and
north Georgia, life went on as normal at The Carnegie Deli on 7th
Avenue in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're walking, the wind and snow pushes you back a bit,''
cashier Patricia Cruz said Tuesday afternoon. ``But you can't do
anything but order a pastrami and corned beef. And save room for
cheesecake.''
</P>
<P>
   But when 20 inches of snow falls in the Deep South _ as it did
in Raleigh _ it's time to call out the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to say it's a typical storm, but it's not a record
breaker'' in the Northeast, said AccuWeather's Tobin. ``The fact
that it dumped so much snow in North Carolina, that's what it will
be remembered for. But the further north you go, the more of a
hindrance it is than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of Atlanta getting another frosty slap in the
face comes less than a week after an ice storm toppled Southern
pines all over Atlanta, knocking out power to a half-million
people. Less than 70,000 remained without electricity Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Even winter-worn Northerners had to make adjustments Tuesday.
Legislatures in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Delaware canceled
their daily sessions. Delaware Gov. Thomas Carper had to postpone
his State of the State address for a second time in a week because
of snow. And Philadelphia closed schools in the face of its worst
blizzard since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, where some places recorded 10 inches of snow,
Gov. Jim Hodges closed state offices in 34 counties. In North
Carolina, Gov. Jim Hunt called out the National Guard to clear
roads.
</P>
<P>
   How the storm was viewed depended on the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a winter wonderland,'' said Risa Alexander of Buffalo,
S.C., whose two young sons spent the day playing outdoors. Still,
``you can hear the trees just snapping and breaking'' under the
weight of the snow, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, former Atlanta resident Bob Bielan visited from
his new home in Portland, Maine. When he stopped to buy clothes in
Buckhead, it was 60 degrees. He returned to the Portland Regency
hotel he manages and was greeted by a temperature of minus-3.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bielan saw almost 6 inches of snow was on the ground
in the historic port city in Maine. The high: 26 degrees. A New
England native, he nonchalantly walked across the street in his
blue blazer with no top coat to enjoy a cup of green mountain
coffee in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, all the shops across from his hotel were closed,
except a salon and spa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' Bielan said. ``If it closes businesses and
people are sent home, then it's more than a blip on the radar
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   He concedes he's lost some of his winter nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older you get,'' Bielan said, ``the less eager you are to
go through these things. You don't want to fight this the rest of
your life.''

CANDIDATES TO FACE A LESS-CONSERVATIVE NEW HAMPSHIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Anyone flying into New Hampshire's largest
city can't help but notice the latest addition to the landscape, a
six-story concrete parking garage that towers over the airport
terminal.
</P>
<P>
   This $46 million structure opened last month to cater to one of
the fastest-growing airports in the nation. It is a visible sign of
the demographic changes that also have transformed the politics of
the state that will be the host to the first presidential primary
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Often stereotyped by its picture-postcard hamlets, crusty
conservatives and rugged White Mountains, New Hampshire has
increasingly become a haven for high-tech baby boomers who have
crowded into the southeastern corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   These new voters shop at the megamalls that hug the increasingly
clogged freeways, and work in the office parks that sprawl across
the outskirts of Manchester and Nashua. They also are more likely
to register as independents, who have eclipsed the Republicans as
the largest group of voters.
</P>
<P>
   This election season, the shift has bolstered the fortunes of
such reform-minded candidates as Republican John McCain and
Democrat Bill Bradley, who have challenged their party's
standard-bearers, George W. Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps explain the gradual transformation of this former
bastion of Republicanism into a two-party state. Democrats now
control the governorship and share power in the state Senate for
the first time in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is getting to be like the rest of New England,'' said Andy
Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire survey center,
which tracks voter attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while New Hampshire voters have traditionally had a
streak of libertarianism, the influx of newcomers, many of them
from nearby Massachusetts, appear to be making the state even more
socially tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   The state celebrated Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday for the
first time this year as an official state holiday. Last year,
lawmakers rescinded the state's longtime ban on adoptions by gay
couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is not as conservative right-wing as it was 10
to 15 years ago,'' said state Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathy
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, taxes still are a tough sell in a state that
has neither an income nor sales tax. Even Democratic Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen has signed a pledge not to establish an income tax and
vetoed such a tax when the state Senate approved one last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not really a Democrat's Democrat,'' said state GOP
Chairman Steve Duprey.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican chief agreed that the newcomers had
moderated the state somewhat, he said the state remains fiscally
conservative, a perception that may explain Bush's focus on tax
cuts when he campaigns in the stat~YW5R

 &HT;    Titans, Rams play 'meet &AMP; greet' with Super Bowl media
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As usual, the nuts came out at Super Bowl Picture Day.
</P>
<P>
   By the box. But they were only of the Macadamia variety,
thank-you presents from a Hawaiian radio reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans and St. Louis Rams took the field at the
Georgia Dome for an hour apiece Tuesday and talked and talked
without saying anything controversial.
</P>
<P>
   No one wore a dog collar as Falcons defensive back Ray Buchanan
did last year as more than 1,000 media members tried to pick them
apart. Not even Buchanan, who was doing some television work while
wearing a black leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   These were two sessions of relaxed quarterbacks and scrambling
media.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was more laid back than Titans offensive linemen
Craig Page, Zach Piller and Ian Rafferty, who lounged on their
elbows next to the booth holding wide receiver Yancey Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're guarding Yancey, he's got all that jewelry on,'' said
Page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making sure that platinum doesn't get ripped off,''
chimed in Piller. ``He's got about $100,000 worth of jewelry on.
It's worth more than our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Rafferty said the trio took some pictures with veteran Bruce
Matthews, and he held up a disposable camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst question I've heard so far is 'how does it feel it
be playing in the Super Bowl,' `` said Rafferty. ``Because I won't
be playing. We'll be standing behind the white line instead of
sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans coach Jeff Fisher was standing Tuesday, while an hour
later Rams coach Dick Vermeil was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who handled the media like a political candidate during
a debate, did have to deal with a detail from his past that he
hoped had been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked about his nickname from his playing days with the
Bears: ``Guppy.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach explained that Bob Fisher was a tight end his rookie
year. Since he was 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, and Fisher was 5-11 and
185 pounds, the tight end was called ``Fish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was called 'Small fish,' and that later became 'Guppy,'
`` said Fisher. Then he deadpanned, ``I'm happy to see it's just
resurfaced here after 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Buchanan other Atlanta Falcons also resurfaced at the
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Danny Kanell, working for a local TV station,
found an empty pocket next to Rams quarterback Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What advice do you have for a young quarterback like myself?''
asked Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you anything,'' Warner shot back..
</P>
<P>
   Then Kanell asked what Atlanta nightlife he'd be sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably going to lay low,'' Warner said. ``We want to try
to enjoy this.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the exchange, a sportswriter said of the
interviewer, ``Hey, who's that guy?''
</P>
<P>
   How quickly they forget.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Theismann, one of the former players turned broadcasters who
seem to be multiplying at Picture Day, said that current players
have become too vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because guys are making so much money they're scared to death
to say the wrong thing to lose all that money, wouldn't you?'' said
Theismann. ``Plus, I don't think a lot of guys want to take the
pressure on their shoulders. No guy wants to come out and say we're
going to beat this team, because in truth, it's not an individual
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   But they were game when asked to pick their favorite song, name
a Backstreet Boy or their favorite cartoon character or for
permission to sniff their underarms. That was a Comedy Central
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Faulk even tried to explain his mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're human beings,'' he said. ``We're moody. No one walks
around with a smile every day of their life. Sometimes I'm caught
in one of my bad moods. I'm just glad today's not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans defensive tackle Henry Ford, surveying the chaos, said he
felt weird standing on the field in his full uniform. ``I wish,''
he said, ``there was some tackling going on.''

THE DAY AFTER IOWA, WINNERS AND LOSERS ASSESS WHAT IT ALL MEANT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas finished first
in Monday's Iowa caucuses because he put together an alliance of
pragmatists and moralists, winning the support of nearly all the
participants in the Republican gatherings who said they were
looking for a winner and a significant share of those who said
moral values swayed their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore prevailed in the Democratic caucuses in
large part because he was the overwhelming choice of trade-union
members and their relatives and of those who said they had a
favorable impression of President Clinton as a person _ not quite
half the total. But those with a negative view of the president
preferred Gore's rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, by
a margin of more than 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Those were two of the more intriguing elements in the picture of
the caucus voting that emerged from polls taken by the Voter News
Service, a consortium of the television networks and The Associated
Press, as participants arrived for the meetings on Monday night.
About 1,700 Republican caucusgoers and about 1,100 Democrats were
interviewed; the margin of sampling error for the survey varied
from 3 to 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, there was a strikingly uniform response to
the two candidates across ideological lines, suggesting that
Bradley had failed in his effort to picture himself as an insurgent
with ``new ideas'' and to paint Gore as old hat. The vice president
pulled 61 percent of those who described themselves as liberals, 60
percent of those who called themselves moderates and 64 percent of
those who said they were conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of the participants cited ``new ideas'' as a
reason for voting as they did; 21 percent mentioned experience,
Gore's strong suit after a long career in the House, the Senate and
the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Bradley failed to convince most Iowa Democrats that
a national health care plan, for which he campaigned extensively,
was a top priority. A more urgent question for the caucusgoers,
according to the poll, was preserving Social Security and Medicare.
That was one of Gore's themes, which emerged from a successful
effort to retool his campaign after a slow start, and he benefited
enormously from emphasizing it.
</P>
<P>
   The figures also suggested, as had media commentators, that
Bradley suffered from his debates with Gore. Bradley won the votes
of less than a third of those who said they had watched the
televised confrontations very closely or somewhat closely, but he
gained the backing of 42 percent of those who said they paid
limited attention. In a debate here on Jan. 8, Bradley declined to
answer directly when his rival criticized his vote on a bill of
consequence to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's support was concentrated at the edges of the
electorate. Independents preferred him, but they constituted less
than 20 percent of the total participants. So did those with
incomes in excess of $75,000 a year, but they made up only 17
percent of the total. Bradley's best figures came among the 13
percent who expressed disapproval of Clinton's record. He won the
support of 62 percent of this group, as opposed to only 25 percent
for Gore, who is of course closely identified with the president's
policies, and 13 percent uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, some of Gore's strategists expressed concern
about the shape of the New Hampshire electorate, worrying that
Bradley might find traction among the young, highly paid,
well-educated employees of high-technology companies that are much
more numerous there than here. Perhaps so, but Gore ran reasonably
well among the young in Iowa, and for all Bradley's talk about
building his campaign on the support of those who were attending
caucuses for the first time, Gore took 59 percent of such
first-timers, compared with only 32 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   College students were a bright spot for Bradley, who held the
vice president to a draw in Johnson, Story and Poweshiek Counties,
the homes, respectively, of the University of Iowa, Iowa State
University and Grinnell College.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, Republican outsiders like Pat Robertson and Pat
Buchanan rode the enthusiasm of religious conservatives to potent
showings here. This time the dynamic was different. Bush, the
establishment candidate, emphasized his religious beliefs from the
start while avoiding almost until the end detailed comments on
divisive issues like abortion. Many longtime activists on the
religious right backed him strongly.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Bush clearly benefited from having three major
rivals, rather than just one, for the support of the religious
right. He won only 33 percent of that group's support, but the rest
was scattered among Steve Forbes (27 percent), Alan Keyes (23
percent), and Gary L. Bauer (16 percent). Had only one or two of
them been running, Bush's victory might have been less clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, which votes next Tuesday, has a much smaller
religious right. But its Republicans, like Iowa's, are very
conservative, and the conservatives here behaved much like the
religious right, giving Bush 40 percent of their votes and
parceling out the rest to Forbes (30), Keyes (17) and Bauer (10).
Obviously, the Bush camp is not eager to see Bauer or Keyes or both
withdraw in Forbes' favor, and so far at least they have given no
indication that they plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still in trouble with those who feel most profoundly
about abortion. Only 11 percent named that issue as a major element
in their voting decisions, so their votes were not decisive, but
Bush was able to win the backing of just 14 percent of them,
compared with 40 percent who declared for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bush does not want to alienate the independents and
other centrists he would need this fall, he said nothing about
abortion in his victory speech. But he clearly recognizes that he
needs to bolster his standing among those who care deeply about
moral values _ they totaled more than a third of the Republican
participants, and he was backed by only 37 percent of them _ and
some of his staff members think he should focus on corruption in
the Clinton administration and the president's private life. The
closest he came on Monday night was to proclaim ``the beginning of
the end of the Clinton era.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Threatened with an order from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives agreed
Tuesday to permit the 6-year-old boy to meet his Cuban grandmothers
privately Wednesday at a neutral location outside the family's
house.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after immigration officials ratcheted up the
pressure on the family, warning them in a letter that if they did
not agree to a meeting on neutral ground the agency could revoke
Elian's ``parole,'' or his temporary permission to remain in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers will meet Elian at 4 p.m. at the home of Sister
Jeanne O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University and a nun
belonging to the Dominican order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reiterated that the grandmothers will not be able to
take him with them at this time,'' said Carole Florman, a Justice
Department spokeswoman. Ms. Florman added that the INS's demand for
a meeting was not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Another Justice Department official said the family ``needed to
understand the seriousness'' of the meeting, which is why the
agency's letter was sternly worded.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Elian's grandmothers delivered tearful pleas
Tuesday to sympathetic lawmakers, who vowed to block legislation in
the House and Senate to make Elian a U.S. citizen. Outraged Senate
Democrats pledged to filibuster the Senate bill if it reached the
floor, which could happen as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton jumped into the fray, urging Congress to hold
off on such legislation until litigation concerning Elian is
resolved. Clinton also held out the possibility that he would veto
the citizenship measure if it clears Congress. ``Plainly,'' Clinton
said, ``he would have more economic opportunity in this country,
but all the evidence indicates that his father genuinely loved
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle in Miami, Lazaro Gonzalez, has sued the
federal government to block the boy's return to his father, arguing
that sending him back to Cuba is tantamount to child abuse. Elian's
mother and 10 others died when their makeshift boat capsized after
departing Cuba. Elian was picked up as he drifted on an inner tube
on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   By making Elian a citizen, lawmakers said they hope to remove
the immigration complications from the case, including the federal
lawsuit, and focus it solely on the custody issue. A second bill
that would make him a permanent resident is also expected to be
taken up by the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton expressed concern Tuesday that Congress' action may
set a hasty, complex precedent that has not been thoroughly
analyzed. ``I mean this sort of thing could happen again because
you have so many people coming to our shores from all these
different countries,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several sympathetic members of Congress, pledging to derail the
legislation, traveled to Capitol Hill despite Tuesday's snowstorm
and met with Elian's grandmothers, who camed bundled up in new
winter coats and boots. The grandmothers passed around a photo
album of their family in Cuba and beseeched the lawmakers to end
the delays barring their grandson from his homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, who dabbed at their eyes with balled-up
tissue, said they had been unable to see their grandson Monday
after their request for a neutral meeting place was declined by
their Miami relatives. The women said Gonzalez's home in the Little
Havana neighborhood of Miami, which has been ringed by
Cuban-American opponents of Fidel Castro day and night, would be
too fiery a location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked to have a neutral gathering with just the child,''
said Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother, following a
meeting with Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, who sits on the
immigration subcommittee. ``But they didn't accept that. They want
to have this in their house, full of people, and with a party. I'm
not up to a party. I just want to see my grandchild alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Rodriguez said she did not want to see Elian's Miami
relatives. ``They have offended me on the phone, they have offended
me on television,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has said he invited the grandmothers to visit Elian in
his home so the women could see where Elian lives and see that he
is loved.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a longtime advocate for lifting
the economic embargo against Cuba, decried the citizenship
legislation, calling it ``pathetic.'' And he, along with several
other Democrats and an influential Republican, Sen. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, said they hope to convince lawmakers not to offer the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy ought to go home and be with his father,'' Dodd said.
``It is shameful we're allowing it to become a national debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd added that Congress is ``allowing a group of people whose
animosity for an old man in Cuba to get in the way between a
father's love for his son and a son's love for his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel called the conversation with the grandmothers
``revealing'' and added that he would speak with Sen. Trent Lott,
the Republican majority leader, to convince him to abandon plans to
bring the legislation to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious to me that this was not a woman fleeing from a
tyrannical regime that was oppressing her and her family and her
six-year- old,'' Hagel said, noting the grandmothers' earlier
assertions that Elian's mother was forced to take the boat by
Elian's stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., and Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said they
would ask Clinton to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging support in Congress is difficult at this point, with
lawmakers on both sides of the issue saying they expect a messy
fight. ``I don't have illusions that this is a slam dunk,'' said
Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who has introduced one of the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail have embraced
the decision on Elian's future, turning the diplomatic tug-of-war
into an opportunity to vilify Castro and communism. But some
conservative Republicans, in keeping with their commitment to
family values, said they object to dividing a father and son and
are not expected to support the bill.

CHINESE GENERAL'S VISIT RAISES ONLY LIMITED HOPES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first visit here by a senior Chinese military
official since an American warplane bombed China's embassy in
Belgrade last May will produce only a modest series of military
exchanges in the next year, administration and defense officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have been eager to resume regular contacts
with their Chinese counterparts. The contacts began more than two
years ago but ended abruptly after the embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for more meaningful exchanges have dimmed,
however, because of China's lingering wariness about the intentions
of the American military and because of new congressional limits on
the type of military contacts the Pentagon can offer, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the relationship is going to resume in a more
carefully focused way on both sides,'' a senior military officer
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, the deputy chief of the People's
Liberation Army general staff, began meeting with senior defense
and State Department officials on Monday. The talks have already
covered some contentious issues, including the embassy bombing,
arms sales to Taiwan and the administration's plans to build
national and regional missile defense systems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Xiong's meetings continued Tuesday when he held ``defense
consultative talks'' with a delegation of Pentagon officials, led
by Walter B. Slocombe, the Defense Department's undersecretary for
policy. The general is scheduled to meet Secretary of Defense
William Cohen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings Tuesday went on despite the snowstorm that shut
most offices of the federal government, and prompted Xiong's
delegation to travel by subway from a hotel in Northern Virginia to
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently wary of congressional criticism of the general's visit
and, more generally, the administration's policy toward China,
officials at the White House and the Pentagon have so far played
down the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks so far have not been colored by the animosity
generated by the bombing of the embassy during NATO's air war
against Yugoslavia, some officials said. Three Chinese were killed
and 27 were injured in the bombing. The United States said it was
an accident, but for months Chinese officials angrily refused to
accept that explanation.
</P>
<P>
   With China's anger apparently having eased, American officials
are confident they can resume at least some exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Gen. Xiong would have come over here without
some expectation of coming up with a solid program'' for military
contacts, the senior officer said. ``And that's certainly the
expectation on our side.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officials said the talks would lay the groundwork for a
series of contacts, including visits by senior officials from both
countries, port calls by American warships and exchanges of
lower-level officers.
</P>
<P>
   Xiong, 60, is viewed as a hard-liner toward the United States. A
former chief of military intelligence, he once warned that China
could strike Los Angeles with nuclear weapons if the United States
intervened in a conflict over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon believes that regular contacts with Chinese
military leaders can ease tensions and avert confrontations like
the one in 1996, when China fired missiles into the Taiwan Straits
and the United States responded by sending two aircraft carriers to
the region.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes for increasing exchanges have run into congressional
opposition. Angered by allegations of Chinese spying on American
nuclear programs and illegal campaign donations to the Democrats in
1996, Republicans pushed through legislation prohibiting any
exchanges that would give Chinese officers ``inappropriate
exposure'' to American military expertise, not just on nuclear
weapons, but also on more mundane matters like supplying and
supporting operations.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has complicated efforts to include Chinese
officers in exchanges that Pentagon officials say would be
constructive, like an annual conference on logistics attended by
several other Asian countries.

 &HT;    AFC NOTEBOOK: XXII MVP Williams inspiration to McNair
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach and Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Titans quarterback Steve McNair will be asked about it
all
</P>
<P>
   week, and he's ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean to be a black quarterback starting in a Super
Bowl? How much was he inspired by what Doug Williams accomplished
with the Washington Redskins?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it a lot,'' McNair said Tuesday. ``It's a thing
that you gain a positive out of. I want to be in the same position
he was once he was here (in the Super Bowl). That's the situation,
and I look at it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the MVP of Super Bowl XXII in January 1988, when
the Redskins defeated Denver 42-10 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Doug definitely inspired me,'' McNair said. ``Even
playing against his alma mater, Grambling, was special to me. To
see what he was able to do at this level was a real inspiration for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who played at Alcorn State, also is prepared for a week
when the Titans will have to explain how they got to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that more people are citing ``The Immaculate
Deception'' _ a 75-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the
closing seconds against Buffalo in a wild-card game _ than
convincing playoff victories against Indianapolis and Jacksonville
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what people say about this ballclub, we're
finding a way to win,'' McNair said. ``We don't care about respect.
We're not trying to gain respect. We're not playing for respect.
We're playing for this organization to (win) the Super Bowl, and
we've been going against all odds all year. And that's when we play
our best, when our backs are against the wall and everybody's
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who's battling turf toe on his left foot, is still
wearing a boot. He's expected to practice at 3:30 p.m. today at
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, again
</P>
<P>
   Titans running back Eddie George and Rams left offensive tackle
Orlando Pace were teammates at Ohio State. Pace helped pave the way
in George's 1995 Heisman Trophy-winning campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an opportunity to play with one of the greatest tackles
in the game,'' George said. ``He's such a great athlete. He plays
basketball, and he could probably play pro basketball if he chose
to do that. He's not only a talented athlete, he's a great guy, and
I enjoyed playing behind him at Ohio State.''
</P>
<P>
   George left Ohio State in 1995 as the school's second career
leading rusher. Pace was an All-American during George's senior
season in '95 and the next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie and I are still good friends,'' Pace said. ``I saw him
(Monday) night. We are both happy and excited that we are here.
Unfortunately, one of us isn't going to get the win. We are both
happy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anatomy 101 Speaking of Pace, a reporter asked Titans offensive
tackle Brad Hopkins what he knew about the Rams' player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly nothing about Orlando Pace,'' Hopkins said. ``I
know he has a big head.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hopkins, one of the league's more underrated, and quotable,
players, wasn't talking about Pace's ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a big head,'' Hopkins said. ``See, my thing is I've
got a huge (behind).''
</P>
<P>
   Father-son combos
</P>
<P>
   Titans free safety Anthony Dorsett, who will make his second
start in place of injured Marcus Robertson, will become the first
son of a past Super Bowl starter to also start in the NFL title
game.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-year pro, Dorsett's father, Tony Dorsett, played in two
Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling,'' Anthony Dorsett said. ``My dad's
getting a lot of hype and I'm getting a lot of hype, so I think
someone needs to give us a commercial or something.'' ``We've
talked quite a bit in the last few days,'' the younger Dorsett
said. ``He's told me about the distractions and how to keep my mind
on the game and trying to stay focused on everything we need to do
to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   On the links
</P>
<P>
   Titans punter Craig Hentrich once played 18 holes of golf with
former NBA stars Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Hentrich, along with Titans kicker Al Del Greco and quarterbacks
Trent Dilfer of the Buccaneers and Casey Weldon of the Redskins, is
of the better golfers among NFL players. Del Greco has been chosen
by Golf Magazine as best golfer among athletes in other
professional sports and is a five-time winner (1993-96, 99) of the
NFL Cadillac Classics tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jordan and Barkley) are very nice guys,'' Hentrich said. ``I
remember shooting a 68 that day. I had six birdies and one double
bogey. To that point it was one of the greatest days of my life.''

HOUSTON INVESTOR GROUP TO FUND NEW HIGH-TECH FIRMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (EDITORS: Note first reference to David Gerhardt is in optional
trim.) 
 
By REBECCA MOWBRAY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A number of wealthy ``angel investors'' in Houston
formally are banding together to invest money in start-up
technology companies, filling a much-needed gap in early stage
equity financing and bringing Houston one step closer to becoming a
high-tech center.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Angel Network is expected to begin making $250,000
to $1 million investments in local technology companies within the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, Houston will join technology-oriented cities, such
as Austin, Dallas, San Diego and San Jose, Calif., in having an
organized forum to support entrepreneurs with high-tech ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Angel investors, a term that originated with the ``angels'' who
would swoop in to save Broadway plays, invest small amounts of
money in the technology companies that are too small or too
unproven to attract venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in start-ups is the highest-risk, but highest-reward
form of investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of high net-worth people in this city, but
there's no forum for them to hear about companies,'' said Paul
Frison, chief executive of the Houston Technology Center, which
organized the network over the last nine months. ``Most companies
who come to us need money to prove their concept. Seed capital is
not something that venture capitalists do. Their choices are
usually their family, neighbors, doctors, dentists, lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in Houston, where the city is spread out and where
investing in technology instead of oil is new, an organized forum
is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affirmation that there are more high-tech start-ups
being engendered every single day,'' said Dennis Murphree, a
venture capitalist whose firm is somewhat unusual in making very
small investments and will participate in the angel network.
``Since angels fund the vast majority of start-up companies, it's
imperative that the angels know where the companies are, and that
these companies know how to find the angels.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a huge gap in the amount of seed investment money
available to start-up companies, according to OffRoad Capital, a
San Francisco-based online investment vehicle formed last year to
bring private investors together to make $3 million to $15 million
investments in technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional sources of private equity funding _ investment banks
and venture capitalists _ serve about 2 percent of small-business
financing needs, OffRoad estimates. The lion's share of that seed
money _ $56 billion _ comes from informal networks of friends and
family, according to the Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial
Leadership's Global Entrepreneurship Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's angel network is expected to have about 50 people. It
is restricted to people who can afford to lose a wager if a company
flops _ individuals who have a net worth of at least $5 million or
have earned $500,000 in income over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   While the network will be an independent organization, the
Houston Technology Center will act as a broker for prospective
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the business of making recommendations for
investments, but we are introducing them to investments,'' Frison
said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies looking for money will fill out a standard, one-page
form that will be e-mailed to angel investors after the technology
center screens the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Investors then can go to a secure spot on the technology
center's Web site to see a full business plan, and if a number of
people are interested in seeing a presentation, the technology
center will organize it. Once each quarter, angels will meet for a
private lunch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OPTIONAL TRIM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pre-screening process is different from the procedure in
Austin, where companies can pay a fee to present their company
before the angel network. Doing much of the correspondence by
e-mail is different from how it is done in Dallas, which has
presentation lunches for angel investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is that in today's world, to wait a whole month
between meetings is not responsive enough,'' Frison said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Houston investors have been so eager to participate in an
angel network that they drive to Austin to take part in Texas Angel
Investors, said David Gerhardt, president of the Capital Network.
Since Gerhardt's organization started the network last March, it
has invested $14 million in Texas start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
END OPTIONAL TRIM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These angel investors often are techno-barons or seasoned
business executives whose mentorship to start-ups is as valuable as
the financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are smart technology investors. They provide a lot more
than money. They really are looking to roll up their sleeves and
help guide the companies. They'll write the check, but they also
want to help,'' Gerhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Without an organized forum, approaching private investors can be
bewildering, said Mary Wimbish, co-founder of a new liquid-waste
disposal company, Downstream Environmental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are not extremely wealthy and have lots of extra
cash lying around. You have to have people who are investors and
who have an entrepreneurial spirit, who want to take a risk instead
of putting their money in something more secure. It's a rare
individual,'' Wimbish said.

through before they got advice on how to make their pitch. However,
they just persuaded several wealthy investors to take a risk on
Downstream Environmental, and with their first installment,
$360,000 of a $1.8 million package, they've broken ground on a
small wastewater treatment facility in west Houston.

CANDIDATES, SNOW ARRIVE IN GRANITE STATE

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ As a muffling blanket of snow settled on the
first primary state, the two insurgent candidates, Republican John
McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley, Tuesday began a weeklong
campaigning blitz, hoping to reverse the strong Iowa showing by the
national front-runners with an appeal to New Hampshire's famously
independent nature.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, beaten 2-to-1 by Vice President Al Gore in Iowa, did
not switch to a tougher tone, as he has suggested he might and some
of his supporters think he must, now that his support in the
Granite State appears to be slipping.
</P>
<P>
   A new Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll finds Gore with a slender 48 to
42 percent lead among likely Democratic primary voters in New
Hampshire _ the first time since the Globe started polling the race
in August that either candidate has enjoyed a lead outside the
survey's 5 percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of shifting its emphasis on the eve of the last
candidate debate in New Hampshire _ Republican and Democratic
candidates will both clash in Manchester Wednesday _ the Bradley
campaign continued with a strategy launched in Iowa, dispatching
several political surrogates, including Senator Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, to complain that Gore's attacks on Bradley's positions
were untrue. Bradley confined himself to urging voters to send a
message that they are ``tired of attack politics.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, a visibly weary George W. Bush, who
celebrated his Iowa victory at a 2 a.m. rally at the Manchester
airport, slept late and worked out at a local Gold's Gym, preparing
for a much tougher fight than in Iowa. McCain, who did not actively
campaign in Iowa, is even in many polls here with the Texas
governor, while Steve Forbes, after a strong second-place Iowa
finish, planned to use his fortune for a statewide advertising
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an intense week of campaigning, but it was
a good beginning for New Hampshire to come in with a solid
victory,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Globe/WBZ poll that Bush, too, has his work cut out for
him if he is to win in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 400 likely Republican primary voters found that
GOP race remains a statistical tie, with the McCain holding a
slight 37 to 34 percent advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was taken Monday and Tuesday nights, with half the
sampling performed after the results of the Monday's Iowa caucuses
were known. The results suggest that Bush's convincing win in Iowa
has not, at least so far, affected his standing in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll found that Gore is apparently enjoying a lift from
his Iowa win. Polling taken just before the caucuses for the Globe
found the Gore-Bradley race a dead heat. Gore's move into a slight
lead appears to have begun only after the caucus results were
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that New Hampshire have been influenced somewhat by
Gore's large victory in Iowa and those who are undecided are
gravitating his way,'' said Gerry Chervinsky, president of KRC
Communications Research, which conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll offered little consolation for other candidates in the
Republican field. Publisher Steve Forbes, drew 11 percent support
in the survey, down from his 14 percent showing in a January 5-6
Globe/WBZ poll. Former Ambassador Alan Keyes drew 8 percent in the
new poll, up from 5 percent in the earlier survey but still far out
of the running. Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, who plans to drop out of
the race Wednesday, drew 2 percent in the new poll; former Reagan
administration official Gary Bauer, 1.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates arriving from Iowa were greeted Tuesday by a
surprise winter snowstorm, which carpeted the countryside in a
dazzling white. The storm slowed down motorcades, delayed flights
from Iowa and provided the perfect New Hampshire backdrop for
photos.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stopped his entourage at Dunkin' Donuts to pick up coffee
for city workers operating the snowplows. Bradley insisted on
taking a few quick questions from reporters outside _ rather than
inside _ Alvirne High School in Hudson to take advantage of the
wintry effect. And McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' bus fell
victim to the weather and stalled on the road to Hillsborough,
forcing the Arizona senator onto a backup bus. Keyes, who is
running ads here and hoping for a bounce from his strong Iowa
showing, was delayed in coming here due to flight cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side of the primary, the Bradley campaign
continued to promise a new attitude, even as the campaign focused
on old grievances with Gore _ the vice presidents criticisms of
Bradley's record on farm relief votes and hsi questioning of
Bradley's views on Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey asserted that an ad Gore ran in Iowa criticizing
Bradley's farm record cost Bradley enough votes to keep him below
the 40 percent he needed to meet his campaign target for the Iowa
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ad, while inaccurate, was effective,'' Kerrey said. ``But
it's important because it sets up an opportunity for Bill to talk
about trust and how you acquire trust. You don't acquire trust by
misrepresenting. You may win, but winning doesn't necessarily give
you the authority to do the things you would like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   James Shannon, the former congressman from Massachusetts and a
Bradley campaign official, also set out on a mission to set
reporters straight about Gore, but was turned away from
Manchester's West High School by the Secret Service when he tried
to enter the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's not going to get away with what he got away with in
Iowa,'' declared Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley didn't change his own tone, and Gore showed no signs
of backing away from his criticism of Bradley's health care plan
during a rally at West High. Gore's state chairman, William H.
Shaheen, fumed at accusations from the Bradley camp that Gore was
misrepresenting Bradley's record and suggested that Bradley's
complaints indicate a lack of the kind of personal fortitude a
president needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Bradley can't take criticism on his health care plan,
then he doesn't deserve to be president,'' Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore began his effort to bask in the glow of New
Hampshire's economy, which has boomed during the Clinton-Gore
years. In a takeoff of the question that Bradley posed to Iowa
farmers, Gore said, ``The question that ought to be answered in
this election is not whether or not we're better off than seven
years ago. We know that we are, the question is can we do even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, in his appearances, tried to counter Gore on the
economy, touting his own record of leadership on tax, trade and
budget matters. Bradley stressed his work in the Senate to address
the budget deficit, create the framework for the GATT agreement on
international trade, and help establish the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While most candidates tried to control their message of the day,
McCain continued his long pattern of taking any and all questions
from the voters.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting in Hillsborough, Pamela Veenstra, 51,
said she was one such undecided voter, leaning toward McCain but
concerned that three Supreme Court justices the next president will
appoint could take away abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about life and the life of all women who might get
pregnant in a situation that's very, very bad for them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ultimately won her vote, saying he would not impose a
litmus test _ for any issue, including abortion _ on Supreme Court
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, McCain, who is antiabortion, said, if
elected, he would seek to change the Republican Party platform to
make exceptions to terminate pregnancy in cases of rape, incest and
when a mother's life is in danger. Bush has said he does not want
to change the plank.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Bush continued to follow the Gore campaign playbook as
he stole McCain's lines the way Gore often takes Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with Larry King on CNN, Bush said people
should devote themselves to ``causes greater than their own self
interest,'' a theme in McCain's best-selling book ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' and a phrase he constantly utters on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday night, after hearing he won the Iowa caucus, Bush
said in his speech that the country should honor ``the greatest
generation,'' a reference to World War II veterans McCain
frequently embraces. McCain, however, is careful to credit news
anchor Tom Brokaw's book title of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the candidates, Forbes most noticeably altered his
message as he moved from socially conservative Iowa voters to more
moderate New Englanders. Among Iowans, Forbes emphasized positions
like his opposition to abortion and assisted suicide. But here the
millionaire publisher intends to hammer his chief rivals on the
issue of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the tax code ``an abomination,'' Forbes has proposed a
17 percent flat tax and the abolition of the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he ridiculed Bush and McCain's tax plans as too modest.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes told workers that Bush and McCain ``propose the same old,
same old _ keeping the code, keeping the IRS as it is, giving you
little tax cuts phased in five years or eight years down the road,
making you go through hoops and loops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why trim around the edges?'' Forbes told reporters.
``Obviously, I am the strong anti-tax candidate.''

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Steve Forbes
arrived here in darkness early Tuesday from Iowa, to join Sen. John
McCain in a quickly developing three-way race for New Hampshire's
primary and perhaps for the Republican presidential nomination
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also arrived before dawn, but after an
hour of sleep was campaigning from a Hudson coffee shop to show he
would work tirelessly here.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the trouncing he suffered at the hands of Gore in
the Democratic caucuses in Iowa, Bill Bradley insisted he would
change nothing in his approach and not go on the attack against
Gore. Instead, a prominent supporter, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., took
up the burden of accusing Gore of distortions and untruths.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 200,000 people voted Monday night in the Iowa
caucuses, but the results and the attendant media attention provide
the backdrop for the next phase of the campaign _ a one-week sprint
to the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In fact one of the major issues that influenced the Republican
part of the Iowa race, abortion, seems not to have receded as the
candidates reached New Hampshire. But unlike Iowa, many of the
independent-minded voters in this pro-abortion rights state worry
that the candidates' positions on abortion are too strident.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, McCain was asked about his position on abortion several
times, and one of his answers pointed to another distinction
between him and Bush. He said that he favored changing the
Republican platform so that its call for a constitutional amendment
to ban abortion would include an exception for cases involving
rape, incest and the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said last week that he was comfortable with the current
language of the party's platform, which does not mention the
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Mccain skipped the Iowa caucuses, and is running about even with
Bush in most polls here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments about abortion last week were largely prompted
by the criticism he was hearing from Forbes, who was courting the
votes of religious conservatives in Iowa, and the results there on
Monday seemed to have vindicated Forbes' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the billionaire publisher, finished second in the
caucuses, but his 30 percent total was a surprise. His campaign
manager, Bill Dal Col, said in an interview that the Forbes
advertising campaign would be stepped up sharply, and made it clear
Forbes would position himself as the only true conservative who
could defeat Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the strongest anti-tax message, pro-life message,
pro-school-choice message,'' he said. While Forbes has been barely
out of single digits in polls showing Bush and McCain neck and
neck, his campaign has more going for it than his checkbook and his
second-place finish in Iowa. Steve Duprey, the Republican state
chairman, said Forbes had built a real organization and had
attended ``every sheriff's picnic for the last three years.''
</P>
<P>
   While the leading candidates arrived in good weather, a blizzard
hit at dawn, leading Bradley to cancel one event and causing
McCain's bus to slide off the road without any injuries or damage.
Even so, Alan Keyes, the third-place finisher in Iowa with 14
percent, was worse off. Stuck in Detroit after the airport in
Boston closed, he missed a scheduled fund-raising event in Keene.
</P>
<P>
   Even that was not the most extreme consequence of the bad
weather. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who finished dead last in Iowa,
was unable to hold a news conference in Washington at which he
planned to withdraw from the Republican race. He rescheduled his
farewell appearance for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore's coffee shop interviews with every morning show he
could find, he held a rally at a Manchester high school and bought
coffee and doughnuts and delivered them to Manchester snowplow
crews. Then he filled in for his snowbound daughter, Karenna, at an
MTV rally.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush's statement last week that the Supreme Court
had overreached its authority in deciding Roe vs. Wade _ Gore said
``he's against a woman's right to choose. There is no mistaking
that.'' He added: ``Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell both couched
for his private assurances on this issue, so it shouldn't be
surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore reaffirmed his own support for abortion rights at West High
School and again with the MTV crowd at New Hampshire College.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in his only public appearance of the day, tried to play
to New Hampshire's independent reputation as a reason not to follow
the example of Iowa, where Gore beat him by 2-to-1. At a high
school in Hudson, he said ``It's great to be back in New Hampshire.
It's great to be back in a state where independence is championed,
where voters listen to the presidential candidates, where people
make up their own minds based upon what they see and feel about a
presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spoke at Alvirne High School in Hudson, and he left his
student audience silently squirming as he explained his record on
tax reform and third world debt.
</P>
<P>
   But much earlier in the day _ about 2:30 a.m. _ he had a more
enthusiastic student audience at a raucous airport rally to greet
him. The students, many from Bradley's alma mater of Princeton, had
numerals painted on their faces: ``65'' for his graduation year and
``00'' through ``03'' for their own.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's arrival was more orderly. He stood on a stage with his
New Hampshire supporters, with his campaign bus in the background
and then gave television interviews. Forbes and Gore just got in
their buses and went off to bed without any formal welcome.

</P>
<P>
   Although recent polls have shown that the abortion question was
not among the most pressing of issues for New Hampshire
Republicans, the attention the issue has drawn in Iowa seems to
have carried over some to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In one of McCain's town hall meetings Tuesday, Pam Veenstra, 51,
a graphic artist, told McCain that she was an independent and, ``I
really like you and I would really like to vote for you. `'
</P>
<P>
   She said her Democratic friends had warned her that the Arizona
senator would appoint Supreme Court judges who would ``make it
impossible for a woman to have the right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain told her he was ``pro-life and I have a position that's
the position of my party. I believe it's based _ I know it's based
_ on the belief that life begins at conception.'' He also told her
that he would not use a litmus test in nominating Supreme Court
judges but would ``consider their record as to their adherence to
the Constitution of the United States,'' a position similar to
Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, McCain was asked about abortion in an
interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' He said the Republican
platform should include language allowing for exceptions to an
abortion ban that would cover cases of incest and rape and those
where the mother's life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion plank has been a sensitive issue for Republicans
since it was first drafted at the 1984 Republican convention. It
was changed in 1992 to remove the exception for rape, incest and
the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also pressed about his views on abortion in a separate
interview on ``Good Morning America.'' He acknowledged that a ban
on abortion would mean that doctors could be criminally prosecuted.
At the same time he tried to make an abortion ban seem unlikely and
said he did not think women themselves would likely be subject to
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the doctor should be criminally prosecuted, Bush
replied, ``if abortions are illegal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' answered the reporter, Jack Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Bush said. ``I mean, that's a huge if.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This country needs a president who can lead us to
understanding a life. There's a lot of people who disagree with
what you just said, and there's good people on both sides of this
issue. The real fundamental question is, can our party and our
nation have a president who leads us to respect life?''

MEDICAID SMOKERS SEEK SHARE OF STATES' TOBACCO SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With 46 states beginning to receive payments from
their $206 billion settlement with the nation's leading cigarette
makers, a legal fight is emerging over whether some smokers are
themselves entitled to any of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in eight states are preparing to file coordinated
class-action lawsuits on Wednesday maintaining that under federal
law, any settlement to the states above the amount they paid
through Medicaid for treatment of smoking-related diseases should
go to Medicaid recipients who suffered from those illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 46 states that were parties to the settlement,
reached in 1998, plan payments to smokers. And many have begun
using the money less for smoking-related programs like antitobacco
education for youths than for initiatives like tax cuts and
construction of roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits similar to those being filed on Wednesday have already
been brought recently in states including California, Florida,
Montana, Texas and Wisconsin. Those cases have so far yielded
conflicting results, with one court ruling in favor of the state's
position but another suggesting that the smokers might have valid
claims under federal Medicaid law. In any event, lawyers say these
initial, lower-court skirmishes are not particularly meaningful:
the big questions of law posed by the suits, they say, will be
resolved by the appellate courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the latest chapter in the tobacco wars, and it is over
the forgotten class in those wars,'' said G. Kendrick Macdowell, a
lawyer at the Washington firm of Patton Boggs, which is
coordinating the new round of cases with lawyers from around the
country. ``These are cases about the least fortunate and most
vulnerable in our society who exhausted their savings to become
eligible for Medicaid, who assigned their claims to recover
expenses to the states and who are entitled to a portion of
recovery under federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   But state attorneys general around the nation and lawyers who
worked for the states in developing the settlement say the new
plaintiffs will have to clear high hurdles to prevail. States are
generally protected from most kinds of federal lawsuits for money
damages by the 11th Amendment, which confers sovereign immunity, a
defense that the Supreme Court has been steadily expanding.
Moreover, the states have begun maintaining that the tobacco
settlement was not intended to reimburse them for their Medicaid
expenses but instead resolved claims of antitrust, consumer fraud
and racketeering violations by the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck,'' said James E. Tierney, the attorney general of
Maine from 1980 to 1990, who was a consultant to many state
officials during the tobacco settlement talks. ``There's lots of
evidence that the settlement was not for Medicaid reimbursement.
The attorneys general sued the tobacco companies as lawbreakers:
this was a law-enforcement action, not a reimbursement
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement calls for the $206 billion to be paid to the
states over 25 years. When it was reached, the states vowed to use
much of the proceeds for antismoking efforts, including programs to
educate teen-agers about the hazards of cigarettes. But the
National Conference of State Legislatures says that only about 8
percent of the settlement's first payments have been budgeted for
antismoking campaigns. The rest is going for general government
expenses or to help finance tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the states have missed an historic opportunity
for using the proceeds of the settlement to reduce tobacco abuse,''
said Matthew L. Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
Kids, a Washington advocacy group. ``Of the 30 states which have so
far dealt with the tobacco money, 8 have provided enough new
funding for effective comprehensive tobacco prevention. Eleven
other states have dedicated funds for tobacco prevention, but
significantly less than the amount recommended by the Centers for
Disease Control.''
</P>
<P>
   The suits to be filed on Wednesday will be in Georgia, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Vermont and West Virginia. None of the lawyers who are bringing the
suits against the states were among the group of plaintiffs'
lawyers who helped the states win the settlement with the tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing the classes of Medicaid recipients say they
will not know either the size of the potential damages or the
number of members of any given class until they begin the
fact-finding phase of the cases. But they say billions of dollars
may ultimately be at stake for millions of American smokers who
were on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Medicaid law on which the class-action suits are
being hung requires the states to pursue any third parties who are
responsible for injuries that require medical expenses. The
proceeds of that pursuit are supposed to go first to cover state
expenses, second to cover federal contributions to Medicaid and
third to any individuals harmed by the third parties. Led by Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, Congress adopted an appropriations
bill last year that waived the federal government's interest in any
proceeds of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Now many state officials are maintaining that although the early
state lawsuits against the tobacco companies sought Medicaid
reimbursement, most of the later ones did not, and that the final
settlement resolved only accusations of fraud, racketeering and
antitrust violations and is therefore not subject to the federal
Medicaid reimbursement provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Last September a federal court in Wisconsin ruled in favor of
the state, saying the suit against it was barred by the 11th
Amendment, which generally prohibits federal suits against a state
by citizens of that state or any other state for monetary damages.
But the sovereign immunity defense, while strong, is not ironclad,
and the case has been appealed. It is set to be heard later this
year by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In California, meanwhile, lawyers have brought a similar suit in
a state court, partly in an effort to avoid having to cope with the
sovereign immunity defense. In that case, the court has issued a
tentative ruling suggesting that the plaintiffs have a valid claim.
A more detailed ruling by the state court is expected in the next
few days; the losing side is certain to appeal.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Elusive and unpredictable, President Laurent
Kabila of Congo kept the United Nations guessing about whether he
would attend a special Security Council session on the war in his
country almost until his plane landed Friday night, disgorging the
largest of seven presidential parties for what has become an
impromptu African summit.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided to come, however, Kabila and his advisers are
making the most of his first visit to the United States to try to
give his government a new image. Kabila, a radical of the Che
Guevara period and mold who finally fought his way to power in 1997
in what was then called Zaire, overthrowing the dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko, has acquired a record of strong-arm politics,
suppression of the press and human rights abuses that he will not
allow the United Nations to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, with the help of a Washington lobbyist, John
Aycoth, Kabila has sought out reporters and television producers.
He portrays Congo as a country that, after struggling for years to
cope with the vast flow of refugees fleeing the Tutsi-Hutu violence
in Rwanda, was then besieged by turncoat governments in Rwanda and
Uganda, countries it once counted as allies and which now support
rebels trying to oust Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   He urges American officials to stop supporting his enemies in
the interests of peace. He has convinced himself that the Clinton
administration is listening.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Kabila met for three hours with six fellow African
presidents and Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He says he is ready to
cooperate to end the war in Congo, he told reporters over
breakfast, because another year of war would devastate his country.
</P>
<P>
   Before they leave later this week, the African leaders assembled
here are expected to endorse a call to revive a dormant peace
agreement signed last July in Lusaka, Zambia. With that agreement
back on track, diplomats say, there can be serious talk about
creating a U.N. peacekeeping force for one of the world's most
complex recent wars.
</P>
<P>
   For Kabila, there is more riding on this trip than image,
diplomats and other experts on Africa say. Increasingly isolated at
home and abroad, Kabila needs help. His last, best chance,
diplomats say, is international guarantees that all sides can be
disarmed in the Congo war, which is draining the economies of other
countries drawn into it _ and contributing, through troops from
around the region, to the spread of AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said Tuesday that Kabila faces a sharply
narrowing support base. In military terms, this diplomat said, he
has become almost exclusively dependent on the Zimbabweans under
President Robert Mugabe, although he also gets some help from
Angola and Namibia, and draws recruits from the former Hutu
militias of Rwanda driven out of the country into Congo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war is costing all the countries of the region,'' the
Western diplomat said. ``Mugabe wants out but can only get out with
a face-saving exit. There were economic interests, and a lot of
business deals were cut in Congo. But the costs of engagement in
the war are becoming greater than the economic gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that on the other side of the war, Rwanda and Uganda
are also feeling the pinch.
</P>
<P>
   When Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. representative at the United
Nations and this month's Security Council president, toured Africa
in December and asked all the nations involved in the war in Congo
to come to New York for a special session of the council, most
accepted with alacrity. Getting Kabila to come was more difficult,
Holbrooke said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Kabila this meeting would have had a completely
different context because it would not have had the president,
whether you like him or not, of the country we were discussing, and
that would have reduced the value of the meeting,'' Holbrooke said.
``Our goal here is to prevent this war in Congo from metastasizing
into the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke enlisted Mugabe, Annan, President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos of Angola, and the U.S. ambassador in Congo, William Swing,
to prevail on Kabila not to let this opportunity pass.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Tempelsman, chairman of the Corporate Council on Africa,
a private business group that promotes investment and development,
said that Kabila may have calculated that he had more to lose by
staying away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one has to step back and say, what are his options?''
said Tempelsman, who has extensive mining interests in Africa. ``He
would have been facing the condemnation of the international
community for not wanting to even appear. I think it's essential
for his people and it's essential for him to come to some
resolution of this conflict. His own power base at home is eroding.
He came in with promise and great hope and unfortunately he has not
been able to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that it is too soon to know if there will be
long-term gains from the meeting Holbrooke pulled together. ``Some
people say that the risks of getting involved in such a difficult
effort _ and failing _ are so great that we can't risk national
prestige,'' Holbrooke said Tuesday. ``I think that is a Cold War
view.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Corporate Council on Africa, Tempelsman said that the
Cold War was over in Africa too, and that leaders now realize that
the old backers are gone and that the decisions made by African
leaders will have consequences that they will have to deal with
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the world is sympathetic and encouraging, but the
leadership has to come from within,'' he said. ``If success is
achieved here, that will be a very important, a very major
breakthrough.'' Among other achievements, he said, it will make
Africa more attractive to the investors its countries seek.

PAKISTANIS LOST CONTROL OF MILITANTS, U.S. HINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, the militant group that the
Clinton administration believes was responsible for the hijacking
of an Indian Airlines jet last month, emerged in the early 1990s as
a movement dedicated to operations in Kashmir against Indian troops
and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the group is supported by
Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence, an arm of the government
that combines military and intelligence functions, and has been
used by the Pakistani military in Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan
territory that remains the biggest point of contention between
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   As militant Islamic political parties gain increasing power in
Pakistan, the group _ often referred to by its acronym HUM _ has
been able to extend its influence, administration officials and
experts on Pakistan said. And the hijacking last month was an
illustration, officials said, of a group that appeared to have
gotten out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1999 report on global terrorism, the State Department
said that the group, led by Fazlur Rehman Khalil, had been linked
to Osama bin Laden, who has been implicated in the bombing of two
American Embassies in Africa in 1998. The group, which claims to
have several thousand armed supporters in Pakistan, operated
terrorist training camps in eastern Afghanistan and suffered
casualties during the 1998 missile strikes by the United States
against bin Laden's training camps in Khost, Afghanistan. Because
of those casualties, Khalil warned that Harkat ul-Mujahedeen would
take revenge against the United States, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit by three senior Clinton administration officials
to Pakistan last week, the leader of the country's new military
government, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, was asked to shut down Harkat
ul-Mujahedeen. But the Pakistani leader declined to do so even
though his government condemned the hijacking, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As an excuse for not taking action, Musharraf and other
government officials expressed concern about how the fundamentalist
Islamic parties in Pakistan would respond to a clampdown on the
group. The fundamentalist parties, the best known of which is
Jamaat-e-Islami, regularly accuse the government of selling out to
the United States. The banning of Harkat ul-Mujahedeen by the
government could galvanize street demonstrations of the kind the
government dreads, experts on Pakistan said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is considering stopping in Pakistan as part of
a trip to India and Bangladesh in late March, and part of the
purpose of last week's visit to Islamabad by the American
delegation was to assess the prospects for such a visit. Musharraf
ousted civilian leaders last October, and Washington has been
asking for a timetable on the restoration of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In their talks with the Pakistanis, the administration officials
did not assert that the government had supported the specific act
of the hijacking, officials said. ``We do not have reason to
believe that the government of Pakistan had foreknowledge,
supported or helped carry out this terrorist hijacking,'' the State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been concerned for some time about links between the
government of Pakistan and a number of groups operating in Kashmir,
including Harkat ul-Mujahedeen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani government, in a statement from its foreign
office, said it was ``opposed to all forms of terrorism including
hijacking.'' The government said that Pakistani laws called for the
``harshest penalty'' against hijacking and that suspects would be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has repeatedly asserted that the Pakistani
government was behind the hijacking of the Indian Airlines jet,
which ended after India agreed to exchange three leaders of Harkat
ul-Mujahedeen for the 155 hostages. Administration officials said
on Tuesday that the Indian government had provided Washington with
information to support India's claims. This information would be
``taken into account'' as Washington continued to make its own
determinations about the hijacking, an administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what control the government has over Harkat
ul-Mujahedeen is hard to determine, administration officials and
experts on Pakistan said. ``I can believe that the guys who did the
hijacking came from HUM; it's hard to believe that ISI instigated
the hijacking,'' said Thomas W. Simons Jr., a former American
ambassador to Pakistan, referring to the Interservices
Intelligence. ``But it's clear that the government is not exerting
the kind of control it ought to have over a group that the
government supports.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration came to the judgment that Harkat
ul-Mujahedeen was involved in the hijacking in the aftermath of the
takeover, as details emerged about where the hijackers went and who
arranged their escape, officials said.

SOUTHWEST JOINS MOVE TO FUEL SURCHARGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Southwest Airlines finally joined other carriers
Tuesday as it increased fares to help offset the rising cost of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is based on how far passengers fly. One-way flights
of up to 600 miles rose by $2; one-way flights of 601 to 900 miles
rose by $3; and one-way flights of more than 900 miles rose by $4.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines, including Houston-based Continental, took a
different approach.
</P>
<P>
   They levied ``fuel surcharges'' effective for travel starting
Feb. 1 of $20 a round-trip flight or $10 a one-way flight.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has been hard hit by the increased oil prices.
Carriers industrywide have reported fourth-quarter 1999 earnings
that declined over the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Southwest said its jet-fuel cost per gallon
averaged 67 cents in the fourth quarter of 1999 vs. 43 cents in the
fourth quarter of 1998. This week, Southwest said, jet fuel costs
are averaging about 82 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 18, Continental said that if jet-fuel prices remain at
high levels, it could post a loss for this year's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Continental began the industry move to add fuel
surcharges. There had been some question about whether it would
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Fare increases typically are rescinded if competitors don't
match. However, major airlines typically won't pull back increases
if Southwest doesn't go along.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, most major airlines matched in whole or in part.
For example, Northwest Airlines imposed the surcharge, but
rescinded its increase on routes where it competes with low-fare
carriers, such as Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's action by Southwest may cause Northwest to put the
surcharge back on some routes. Or, Northwest could stick by its
decision to pull back on the surcharges, which would pressure other
airlines to follow that course.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday it seemed likely that the surcharge will
remain.
</P>
<P>
   The surcharge is positive for the industry, said Ray Neidl, ING
Barings airline analyst.
</P>
<P>
   However, even with the charge, he estimated that airlines will
recoup no more than 20 percent of the fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   If fuel prices remain where they are, Neidl said, he expects
first-quarter losses for many airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Trippler, who tracks consumer airline issues for the
1Travel.com Web site, said he prefers Southwest's distance-based
approach.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, Trippler said, that other carriers could decide
to scuttle their surcharges in favor of an increase similar to
Southwest's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't begrudge increased fares because of fuel,'' he said.
``Let's be a little more reasonable about it.''

AIR TIME: OXYGEN, A NEW CABLE CHANNEL FOR WOMEN, GETS READY
FOR  LIFT-OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: In 6th graf, O2/O2 should be set as O subscript 2 slash O 
 subscript 2)

 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Geraldine Laybourne of Oxygen, the new
cable TV network that premieres February 2, wants to reach women on
their computers at work, on TV at home, on their laptops on the
plane _ anywhere she can.
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne and her creative team of powerhouse producers, Marcy
Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach (``Roseanne,'' ``The Cosby
Show''), along with business partner Oprah Winfrey, are aiming the
seven-days-a-week interactive network at the educated 35ish crowd,
with original programming drawn from real life _ and not a sitcom
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a different animal,'' Laybourne said last week after a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded world of women's programming _ including
Lifetime, hit network shows such as NBC's ``Providence'' and CBS'
``Judging Amy'' _ only the fittest will survive. Laybourne thinks
Oxygen, starting out with an ambitious 55 hours of original
programming, has what it takes. It's a risky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne, 52, a former educator and the creative force who
changed children's TV during her 16 years at Nickelodeon by
introducing humor, irony and real-life issues into the schedule,
was also president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks, where she was
chairwoman of Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   She thought up the name Oxygen, she has said, after waking up
one morning gulping in air. The network was originally scheduled to
premiere in January, but the connection between 02/02, as in
February 2, and O2/O2 (get it?) was too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a chance to start this when women are feeling
independent and comfortable with themselves,'' Laybourne said. ``As
TV gets slicker and slicker, the question is, how do you get closer
to people?''
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen's answer: with a sense of humor, plenty of reality
checks, a strong Web presence (oxygen.com) and powerful investors,
including America Online and Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft.
The Oprah factor certainly can't hurt _ Winfrey is starting her own
magazine, O, in the spring. And a 30-second spot is planned for the
second quarter of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The actual TV presence of the network is its weakest link. In
this case viewers may initially come from the Web site, which
features travel, parenting, home decorating articles and essays on
issues of interest to women. Oxygen is using the site as a tool to
extend what women are talking about to television.
</P>
<P>
   The network will premiere in only about 10 million homes
(without the New York or Los Angeles markets) _ barely breathing in
comparison with its top competitor, Lifetime, which skews to a
slightly older audience and is seen in 75 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen will be carried by AT&AMP;T Cable in some Bay Area cities,
concentrated mostly in the South and East bays.

</P>
<P>
   The Oxygen day starts with ``Inhale,'' a power yoga program, at
6 a.m. and concludes with ``Exhale'' at 10 p.m., an informal
interview show with Candice Bergen. ``X-Chromosome'' (10:30 p.m.
weekends), sophisticated animated segments overseen by Laybourne's
filmmaker husband, Kit, are the first prime-time animated strips
for women. They're drawn from real-life stories about
relationships, friendship, careers and family.
</P>
<P>
   The network's signature prime-time show, ``Pure Oxygen'' (8 p.m.
weekdays), is a two-hour block hosted by three multicultural female
hosts who will introduce segments on parenting, business, health,
style and home.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday nights at 8, Winfrey hosts ``Oprah Goes Online,'' a
12-part series in which the most influential woman in television
learns how to turn on a computer with the help of two good-looking
techies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah had never visited her own Web site; she looked at all
her e-mails printed out on paper,'' Mandabach said. ``Oprah was
afraid to do this because she said, `I'm embarrassed; I've missed
the boat.' Candice Bergen doesn't know how to operate a computer
either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally convinced Oprah to do this,'' Carsey said. ``We
told her, hey come on, people ... know all about you. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Other programming includes a daily documentary film block, a
weekly late-night talk and variety show, and a weekend ``Pajama
Party'' talk and variety show that could be perceived as
condescending. ``I don't think any of us think that we're doing
anything that's too `girly' or `huggy,''' Laybourne responded.
</P>
<P>
   For teens, there's an afternoon program called ``Trackers'' that
lets young people tell stories from their own points of view by
putting tiny ``lipstick'' digital cameras into their hands and
sending them out to report on their peers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Su Chin Pak of San Francisco, one of the three ``Trackers''
co-hosts, has done teen shows on KGO (Channel 7), KRON (Channel 4)
and ZDTV.

<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday mornings, Oxygen takes viewers on a two-hour
shopping spree, with online and real-life shopping tips and product
reviews. Mandabach introduced this segment to TV critics in
Pasadena by saying, ``And then on the weekends, of course, what do
we want to do? We wake up. We want to shop.'' There were groans
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   She recovered with the announcement that there will also be
Saturday afternoon sports programming with ``We Sweat,'' a two-hour
block of sporting events, profiles, play-by-play and analysis.
``We've bought a bunch of rights, and you'll be seeing a bunch of
stuff you haven't ever seen before,'' Mandabach said.
</P>
<P>
   When Lifetime, the original ``television for women'' network,
was introduced nearly 16 years ago, women were still finding their
comfort levels combing the worlds of business and parenthood. And
while the network became successful and influential in women's
political issues, it was heavy on escapist fare and short on Web
content.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime has picked up a sense of humor only recently, and
Laybourne says she won't make that mistake at her network. ``This
is my personal mission to prove to the world, once and for all,
that yes, women do have a sense of humor,'' she told the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women get their comedy out of everyday life,'' she said later,
``and we wanted a sense of humor to manifest itself almost
everywhere through the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne said she and her partners never argued during the
planning stages, each allowing the other to have a say. ``I would
characterize my partners in the following way,'' Laybourne said.
``Marcy has the ability to cut through all the peripheral issues
and ask the profound question, `So what?' and Caryn has the ability
to have the sparkplug ideas that seemingly come from absolutely
nowhere but take things in an entirely new direction. I'm the stern
schoolmarm. My job is to make sure everybody gets heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerry immediately took the pressure off all of us,'' said
Mandabach, ``by stating that we would be programming in blocks with
themes, rather than half-hour sitcoms or hourlong dramas. We talked
a lot about leading with our ears, that this would be also have to
be an aural medium with a lot of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they have to get the message out there. The network has not
yet struck a financial deal with cable operators in some large
cities, but Laybourne projects that the network will be in 50
million homes by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier in the press tour, Lifetime CEO Carole Black
announced the latest plans at her network: a new daily newscast,
two new prime-time drama series and a spiffed-up Web site with new
animation.
</P>
<P>
   She learned a lot of this strategy from Laybourne, who preceded
her at the network. ``I am going to be the unsung hero of
Lifetime,'' Laybourne said with a laugh. Or its worst nightmare.

THEY STIR THE SOUL AND LEAVE A RINGING IN THE EARS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Maybe it is the belfry of the Church of the Nativity of
the Mother of God, but it is still cold as hell. Some 60 feet up a
corkscrew staircase so narrow that your shoulders brush the cobbled
walls during the stumbling ascent, a north wind tears beneath the
arches supporting a blue onion dome, pauses to flash-freeze any
bare skin it can find, then whips away.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury is somewhere below zero, but a thermometer would be
redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Mikhailovich Dorokhin, clad only in pants, a loose ski
sweater and mittens, is concerned, but not about himself. ``When
it's this cold,'' he says evenly, ``you have to be very careful,
because you can break the bell. You have to ring softly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a disheveled Bernstein taking the podium, Dorokhin then
mounted a slim plank platform, planted a foot securely on a wooden
pedal, raised his arms to the ropes and proceeded to make not
music, but a miracle _ or at least, something akin to one.
</P>
<P>
   For there is nothing else quite like the sound of hand-rung
Russian church bells. Unchanged for centuries, embalmed in the
amber of Russian Orthodox Church tradition, it is a 4/4-time blend
of dirge, railroad-crossing clanger and shattering wine goblet, a
disharmonious sweetness that assails the ears and, once inside,
makes a beeline to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Dorokhin is one of two ringers at the Church of the Nativity,
and of scores, if not hundreds, in Moscow proper. Most are unpaid
newcomers to an art that stretches back to Russia's founding. What
they create and give away, no loudspeakered belfry and Muzak peal
can duplicate, nor can money buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cacophonous and at the same time hypnotic'' is how the
historian James Billington described bell-ringing in his classic
study of Russian cultural history, ``The Icon and the Axe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's peace in the soul,'' said Dorokhin, 29, who has been
ringing the 14 copper and tin bells of the Church of the Nativity
for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, it is an affirmation _ a religious celebration
of death and resurrection, and a secular paean to the triumph of
good over evil. For however mystical their peals, the real miracle
of the bells at the Church of the Nativity, as with church bells
all over Russia, is that they ring at all.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 70 years, during nearly the entire span of Soviet
rule, Russian Orthodox belfries labored under an enforced silence.
One of the early aftershocks of the Great October Socialist
Revolution in 1917 was the seizing and destruction of church bells
across Russia, followed _ astoundingly _ by an outright ban on
church-bell ringing.
</P>
<P>
   That ban prevailed, and Russian belfries stood largely gagged,
until Mikhail Gorbachev began lifting restrictions on religion in
1989. The Communists razed many churches; in others the altars were
pointedly converted into toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Nativity met a gentler fate. Its bells were
carted off, and the vacant building became a holding pen for circus
lions. Not until 1993, after decades of silence and lost dignity,
did the church regain its parishioners and its voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could almost call it a zoo,'' Dorokhin said. It was, he
said, a shameful era.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Moscow is fairly awash in bells, so much so that one
man recently wrote a Moscow newspaper to complain that the racket
was keeping his daughter awake nights. In truth, bell ringers are
fairly restrained most days, either chiming the hour or emitting a
modest clang to mark the beginning and end of weekday services.
</P>
<P>
   But Sundays and religious holidays are another matter. On those
days the ringers get something of a free rein, performing 10- and
15-minute solos after ordinary services and pealing throughout the
day on special holidays like Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Dorokhin spent about 10 minutes at his job, one
foot keeping time on pedals connected to two large bells. His
hands, and even his elbows, pulled and strummed ropes tied to
lesser chimes. His mouth hung half open, lessening the pressure
from the bells' sound waves against his eardrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound depends on many factors,'' he said afterward, ``like
the form of the bell, the shape of the tongue, the makeup of the
alloy. It even depends on the humidity in the air. When it's cold,
like this, it sounds better. When it's more humid, the sound is
muffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a musician, I can express myself. I can ring them strong,
and I can ring them soft. It's like an art.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who have never heard them, that is not so easy to
explain. Suffice it to say that Russian church bells are to Western
ones as blini are to a Denny's pancake stack: the same thing,
prepared by wholly different rules.
</P>
<P>
   Western church bells rock back and forth, hitting their clappers
at their apogees. Russian bells are stationary, and the ringer
strikes them by pulling the tongue with a rope. Western bells are
frequently harmonized; Russian ones are carefully tuned, but
harmony is coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Western bells ring out ``Silent Night'' and ``Rock of Ages.'' In
Russian bell music, rhythm is everything. A Russian Orthodox church
bell would not be caught dead playing a melody.
</P>
<P>
   A Western bell would not be caught dead, period, of course;
Western bells are inanimate hunks of metal. Not so Russian bells,
which have been endowed by their creators for centuries with names,
personalities and, it once was said, the ability to speak straight
to God.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Russians have had a love-hate affair with their bells
since the first ones came from Byzantium in the 800s. That stems in
part from the Orthodox Church's central role in Russian social
life.
</P>
<P>
   In the church, where musical instruments are prohibited and the
choral repertoire is derived from chants, the bells have always
been an essential element _ a melange of jazz combo, church
bulletin and time clock.
</P>
<P>
   Church doctrine and local priests prescribe the order of strikes
for certain events: one note to call worshippers to the service, a
high-to-low-note procession for funerals, low to high for a
baptism. But within those bounds a ringer was free to improvise the
number of strikes and the rhythm as he wished, with the result that
many ringers seldom play the same sequence twice.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone question the passion in this relationship, consider
this: after Dmitri, the son and heir to Ivan the Terrible, died in
1591, his throat slit, a bell was heard to ring by itself. The bell
immediately was given 100 lashes with a whip, its ears were cut off
so that it could not be hung and it was imprisoned in a windowless
room in a monastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia people consider that each bell has a soul,''
Dorokhin said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorokhin says he enjoys the creative freedom, but that is not
what led him to become a bell ringer. An economist for a credit
card company on weekdays, he was not all that musically inclined.
Nor did he care much for Russian Orthodox services, which require
worshippers to stand on bare marble floors for most of the two-hour
liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Church of the Nativity, which he regularly passed on the
way to his studies, somehow drew him in, and he soon found himself
practicing four nights a week at a Moscow church and bell museum
rigged with training bells for aspiring ringers.
</P>
<P>
   After three months of bell-ringing theory, practice and history,
he returned to try his hand on the Church of the Nativity's bells,
and he never looked back. Like many Russians, he finds the rhythmic
clanging to be a spiritual tonic. ``If I have some problems before
the church and don't know how to decide them,'' he said, ``the next
day, after ringing the bells, I know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The bells can be heard on The New York Times on the Web:

BUSH AGENTS REACT QUICKLY TO `THREATENING' PROTESTER 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ As Gov. George W. Bush arrived in New
Hampshire before dawn Tuesday, an altercation led his state
security detail to whisk a man quickly across an airplane hanger
and throw him up against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The man _ identified by a companion and by a Bush spokesman as
Alex Papali of Boston _ had been handing out humorous political
brochures moments before the incident. ``Billionaires for Bush,
because inequality is not growing fast enough,'' the flier said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was shaking voters' hands at a rope line when the man
stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, the fellow walked up at the very end of
the rally and grabbed a hold of my hand that I put out to shake,
and he wouldn't let go. He kept clinging on there, grabbing harder
and harder,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't shake loose. I finally muscled up and jerked
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said after he got his hand loose, the man started gesturing
at his face. Bush spokesman Mindy Tucker said the man was poking
his finger at Bush's face and cursing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very threatening gesture. The agents responded
properly and got him out of there,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that, despite the incident, he is not worried
about his personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because I've got really fine DPS (Texas Department of
Public Safety) agents. I'm a hard campaigner. I was a little
startled last night by this person's reaction,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the man was detained at the Wiggins Aviation hanger
until he could be formally identified and then was released from
custody.

FORBES, PLAYING DOWN ABORTION, TAKES ANTI-TAX MESSAGE NORTH 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.H., Iowa)  (jw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ After gaining a solid second-place finish in
the Iowa caucuses with the support of Christian conservatives and
abortion opponents, Steve Forbes swept enthusiastically across New
Hampshire on Tuesday, trumpeting his anti-tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Nashua, a factory in Hooksett and a
rally Tuesday night at a restaurant in Portsmouth, Forbes ridiculed
what he called the convoluted tax-cut proposals of Gov. George W.
Bush and Sen. John McCain and emphasized his proposal to scrap the
tax code altogether and replace it with a low flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``That code is going to go in the dustbin of history,'' he told
about 150 supporters at the Portsmouth rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to the heart of the problem,'' Forbes said in an
interview Tuesday afternoon. Bush and McCain, he said, are ``the
timid twins of taxation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes staff holds that the anti-tax theme will play
especially well in a state that has a long tradition of opposing
taxation and that has refused to adopt either a state income tax or
a sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Bush and McCain splitting the moderate and liberal
vote,'' said Greg Muller, Forbes' communications director. ``It's a
big anti-tax state, and, among conservatives, we will be the clear
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that conservatives are uniting behind my candidacy,''
Forbes said in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   But he is de-emphasizing his strong stand against abortion,
which helped him with Christian conservatives in Iowa but is less
popular here. Forbes won 30 percent of the vote in the Iowa
caucuses; Bush had 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state is a different arena,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dal Col, his campaign manager, said, ``With our good
showing in Iowa, we are confident that Bush, the liberal, will come
in No. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been endorsed by The Union Leader, New Hampshire's
largest and most influential newspaper. The paper's endorsement was
instrumental in Patrick Buchanan's victory over Bob Dole in the
1996 Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a front-page editorial in The Union Leader proclaimed,
``Forbes is true heir to Reagan's legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show Forbes with 10 percent to 15 percent of
the Republican vote, well behind Bush and McCain who who have about
35 percent apiece. Forbes said he was banking on the record in New
Hampshire, where many voters traditionally make up their minds the
week before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Forbes suggested he would step up his
television advertising campaign here. But he refused to say how
much he would spend or whether his commercials would directly
criticize Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep our opponents guessing,'' he said. But then he
added, ``We don't do things by half measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Forbes' advertisements here included sharp
attacks on Dole, a tactic that may have weakened Dole and
contributed to his defeat in the Republican primary. Forbes
finished a distant fourth in that race with 12 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa this year, his advertisements criticized Bush but were
not nearly as harsh as those against Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The only new commercial that Forbes broadcast Tuesday did not
mention his opponents but showed him in front of a crowd in Iowa
with a headline across the screen reading, ``Forbes Finishes Strong
Second.''

2 BIG ASIAN PHONE COMPANIES IN MERGER TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In the great race to open the world's
telecommunications markets, Asia has lagged well behind the United
States and Europe. Its leaders have been reluctant to tear down
barriers, while the leading phone companies have been wallflowers
in the industry's global mating dance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a sign that Asia may be getting into the swing,
Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. and Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT have
confirmed that they are in merger negotiations. An executive
involved in the talks said Tuesday that the companies hoped to
announce a deal by the end of next week, creating one of Asia's
largest carriers, with a market capitalization of $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Telecommunications and Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT are the
dominant local telephone companies in their areas. A merger of the
two would be a striking corporate alliance between proud cities
that compete fiercely to be the region's financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ravitch, a managing director at Goldman, Sachs, which is
advising Singapore Telecom, said: ``If Asia is going to mature and
stop being a junior player to the U.S. and Europe, it's going to
have to develop pan-Asian companies, the way you have pan-European
companies. This company will be an equal of other global telecom
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such assertions, the companies are acting mostly for
defensive reasons. Singapore Telecom's stock has been battered
since the Singapore government announced last week that it would
open the local phone market to competition. Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT,
controlled by Cable &AMP; Wireless of Britain, has been hurt by new
competition in Hong Kong's lucrative international long-distance
market.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the parent company has been eager to dispose of its 54
percent stake in its Hong Kong subsidiary for months. Although
Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT had been one of its British parent company's
's crown jewels _ at one time generating the bulk of its profit _
the company no longer fits into Cable &AMP; Wireless' strategy of
becoming a provider of Internet and data services to multinational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms being discussed, Cable &AMP; Wireless would receive
roughly a 20 percent stake in the company, plus more than $4
billion in cash. The Singapore government, which owns 80 percent of
Singapore Telecom, would be the largest shareholder, with roughly a
40 percent stake. The Chinese government, which owns 5.5 percent of
Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT through China Telecom, would retain a small
stake.
</P>
<P>
   This mixed ownership raises sensitive political issues _ not
least whether Hong Kong would be willing to accept having its main
local phone provider majority-owned by Singapore. Executives
involved in the talks said Hong Kong had indicated it would be open
to such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The companies must also secure the support of Beijing. One
executive said the Chinese would probably prefer a company
controlled by Singapore to one controlled in London. Cable &AMP;
Wireless sold the 5 percent stake to China Telecom in 1997, the
year this former British colony reverted to Chinese rule.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the face of it, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT and Singapore Telecom
would seem to be a close match. They each serve small _ until
recently, well-protected _ markets. They each have hundreds of
multinational corporate customers and operate large cellular
operations. But some analysts questioned the wisdom of merging two
monopoly companies nearly 1,600 miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``What cost savings could they possibly have?'' asked Dylan
Tinker, a telecommunications analyst at Deutsche Securities here.
``They can't share infrastructure; they can't share labor costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinker said a merger would not necessarily solve the companies'
individual shortcomings. Neither company has had a successful
record of expanding into the Internet or other high-speed
interactive communications and information services.
</P>
<P>
   Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT signed up fewer than 100,000 subscribers
for its interactive television service, iTV. In November, it
announced a venture with Star TV, the satellite television network
owned by News Corp., which it hopes will revive its effort to offer
television programming over telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Managing a cross-border company in Asia could also be fraught
with risk. Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT is run by Linus Cheung, a
strong-willed chief executive, while Singapore Telecom is run by
Lee Hsien Yang, the second son of Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of
modern Singapore and still a powerful force there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an awkward, unwieldy beast from the
management perspective,'' an executive at a rival carrier said.
</P>
<P>
   More important than the deal may be the message. Industry
executives said the merger talks reflected a recognition by Asian
governments that they could no longer run their phone markets like
isolated fiefs. Asian countries were among the holdouts in the
lengthy negotiations that led to a World Trade Organization
agreement in 1997 opening the global telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, the region has begun to yield.
Singapore had agreed to license only one company to offer local and
long-distance service in competition with Singapore Telecom. But in
a remarkable reversal, the government last week threw open the
market to an unlimited number of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hong Kong's government paid Cable &AMP; Wireless $864
million to terminate its exclusive franchise in the international
long-distance market. Analysts estimate that the loss of
long-distance traffic will reduce Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT's profit by
50 percent this year, and a further 50 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two sides negotiated in Hong Kong today, rivals were
circling. Level 3 Communications, an American long-distance
carrier, announced plans to lay an undersea cable between Hong Kong
and Japan. Its purpose is to offer voice and data communications to
the same companies served by Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, where the market has been liberalized, there has
been a huge restructuring of the major companies,'' said Steve
Liddell, chief executive for Asian operations at Level 3. ``Now,
we're seeing the same thing happen among the monopoly players in
Asia.''

VICE CHAIRMAN OF FIDELITY TO RETIRE NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Gary Burkhead, the longtime right-hand man to the owner of
Fidelity Investments, Edward C. Johnson III, said Tuesday that he
would retire Feb. 1 as vice chairman of the company.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation comes three years after he was replaced as
Fidelity's top investment executive, only to be assigned a few
months later to revive its struggling retailing and discount
brokerage businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhead, 58, will continue as a director of Fidelity's parent,
FMR Corp., a privately held company whose largest shareholder is
Johnson's daughter, Abby, 38.
</P>
<P>
   He will be succeeded in most duties by Gail J. McGovern, 47,
whom Burkhead recruited in September 1998 from AT&AMP;T, where she was
in charge of its $26 billion residential long-distance business.
Ms. McGovern will serve on the Fidelity operating committee, the
group of senior executives who run the Boston-based concern.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGovern will be in charge of Fidelity corporate advertising
as well as the brokerage and retail mutual funds business, but will
not run the back-office and institutional brokerage operations that
had been under Burkhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last year and a half we have improved market
position,'' Ms. McGovern said. ``We are now No. 1 in online
accounts with 3.2 million accounts, and a strong No. 2 to Schwab in
online account assets under management.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her main focus would be to enhance the quality of
service to investors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fidelity also had another shift Tuesday as Stephen A. Cone, 49,
resigned as president of retail and corporate marketing to become
worldwide managing director of global retail marketing for the SSB
Citi Asset Management Group of Citigroup. Cone said that he had
decided to take the new job after two years of commuting weekly by
jet to Boston from his Manhattan apartment, before word got around
that Burkhead would retire.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhead said that after 35 years of working six-day and
seven-day weeks, and after successfully fighting prostate cancer
three years ago, he wanted to spend more time with his family, to
pursue investments in small Internet start-ups and serve on some
corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   He said that 35 years ago he promised his wife he would work a
normal workweek in five years ``and then every five years I would
say only five more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Burkhead was replaced as head of investments by
Robert C. Pozen, Fidelity's general counsel. But a few months later
he was named head of the troubled retail unit, which was suffering
from increased competition from the rapidly proliferating number of
mutual funds and weak performance by its discount brokerage unit.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said Tuesday, Fidelity's brokerage business has
grown to 21,000 trades a day from 7,000; the flows of new money
being invested by customers grew to $44.5 billion last year from
$10 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I committed to Ned to make sure that these businesses were
running well and successfully,'' he said of Johnson. ``We built a
strong organization over a couple of years and our results have
improved dramatically by any measure, and we are very well
positioned for future growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit still needs improvement, though, according to Eric
Kobren, a former Fidelity marketing executive who now publishes the
Fidelity Insight newsletter, which tracks the company's funds.
While the institutional and retirement business thrive ``retail
continues to be the weakest leg of the stool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Dion Jr., publisher of the competing Fidelity Independent
Advisor newsletter, said: ``Burkhead has been there for a very long
time and was the right-hand man of the Johnson family. He made a
tremendous amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion predicted a solid improvement in retail operations this
year, largely because several Fidelity growth funds outperformed
the market last year and this should attract new customers and
increase investments from existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   When Burkhead joined Fidelity in March 1983 it had $23 billion
in assets and 2,100 employees. Fidelity now manages about $950
billion and employs 30,000 people. A third of them worked under
Burkhead.
</P>
<P>
   He had previously been an executive vice president of Equitable
Life Assurance Society, now known as Axa Financial. &QL;

A TIMELY DVORAK FROM HARNONCOURT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DVORAK: SYMPHONY NO. 7, `THE WILD DOVE'  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, conducted by Nikolaus
Harnoncourt. Teldec 3984-21278-2; CD. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As if further proof were needed to refute the canard that
conductors of period-instrument ensembles cannot lead modern
orchestras effectively, along comes a Dvorak CD from Nikolaus
Harnoncourt.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of
Amsterdam (which plays in Carnegie Hall on Feb. 9 and 10),
Harnoncourt brings passion, charm and force not only to the
composer's familiar Seventh Symphony but also to ``The Wild Dove,''
a symphonic poem less well known.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded in concert in 1998, the symphony opens grippingly, as
Harnoncourt and the orchestra plunge into a first movement flush
with sweeping string and brass figures and limpid woodwind accents.
In the stately Adagio, Harnoncourt coaxes sweet, meditative tones
from the players.
</P>
<P>
   The famous waltzlike Scherzo finds the conductor punctuating the
lush sound of the Concertgebouw's strings with fiery bursts from
the brasses in an emotional rendering. For the finale, he draws
piquant playing from the orchestra, which on this occasion
withholds nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carlo Maria Giulini's incandescent account with the London
Philharmonic on EMI/Angel and Istvan Kertesz's idiomatic version
with the London Symphony on Decca/London, Harnoncourt's performance
will surely win the hearts of the many listeners enraptured by this
work. And a good thing, for the Giulini recording is out of print
and the Kertesz is available only in a box set.
</P>
<P>
   A studio recording of ``The Wild Dove'' only slightly less
spontaneous rounds out the CD. At just 20 minutes, it is a rather
mean makeweight, yet a vibrant performance lends the piece drama
and apt pathos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAURIDSEN: `LUX AETERNA,' OTHER WORKS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Master Chorale, conducted by Paul Salamunovich.
Rubedo Canis Musica RCM 19705; CD. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The life of a choral composer does not elicit much envy these
days. Unless that composer is Morten Lauridsen, who not only enjoys
the respect of music directors throughout America but also has at
his disposal the Los Angeles Master Chorale, one of America's top
vocal ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   On this CD, the Master Chorale performs five works by Lauridsen,
three recorded for the first time. All receive mellifluous and
devoted readings under the pointed direction of Paul Salamunovich.
</P>
<P>
   The album's title, ``Lux Aeterna,'' comes from the 1997 work
that opens the CD, but perpetual light shines on all the settings.
Churls will insist that a quasi-pop sensibility mars Lauridsen's
efforts, but such criticism ignores the music's potency.
</P>
<P>
   And though unabashed religiosity stands at the center of ``Lux
Aeterna,'' ``Ave Maria'' (1997) and ``O Magnum Mysterium'' (1994),
all sung in Latin, a different sort of beauty characterizes ``Les
Chansons des Roses'' (1993) and ``Midwinter Songs'' (1990), which
use poetry for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The extroverted ``Chansons des Roses,'' sung in French and based
on five Rilke texts, focus on flowers. The more melancholy
``Midwinter Songs,'' set to English words by Robert Graves, pay
musical homage to the English Renaissance and Aaron Copland.
</P>
<P>
   As for the sound, the CDs spacious acoustics prove alternately
grand and intimate. &QL;

   `DESTINY' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1997; directed by Youssef Chahine. &QL;

<P>

   In 12th-century Andalusia, still ruled by the Moors, many were
the ways to get at the caliph, Al Mansour (Mahmoud Hemeida).
``Flatter him until he bursts,'' says a man in the street. A
liberal philosophically, the caliph rules sternly.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, his French adversaries would prefer him burned at
the stake. But in a tale extolling freedom of expression, Al
Mansour stands as good a chance of being talked to death.
</P>
<P>
   How they talk in Andalusia _ of knowledge and error, of God's
wisdom, of insularity and intolerance, of the inviolability of
convictions. And when they are not talking and arguing, they are
singing and dancing and juggling chairs during wild production
numbers in Gypsy camps.
</P>
<P>
   One entertaining virtue of this film is that it aspires to
global sweep while never straying far from the fireside or the
caliph's court. Beyond, if only in feverish references, lies the
rest of Europe. And across the Mediterranean is Egypt, a potential
haven for Andalusian thought.
</P>
<P>
   Armies of various persuasions are referred to but never seen
except in the viewer's mind's eye, which nicely eliminates the need
for more medieval head-bashing on screen. Besides, there are
smaller, more interesting fish to fry at home, where hearts are
ablaze and the caliph is faced with spiritual and political
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are exploiting religion and you're letting them,'' says
Averroes (Nour el-Cherif), the great Spanish-Arabian philosopher
and adviser to Al Mansour. Holding that reason and faith can
coexist, Averroes has angered an Islamic sect, which plays into the
schemes of Sheik Riad, a trusted but treacherous figure who has
allied himself with the fundamentalists. in a plan to take control
from the caliph.
</P>
<P>
   Al Mansour has another problem: his two sons, in whom he is
monumentally disappointed. The elder is a disciple of Averroes,
which is laudable as far as it goes but, in the caliph's view,
hardly prepares one for the realities of leadership. The younger
son, pretty much a total loss, prefers to sing and dance with his
Gypsy friends.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the lad is picked off by his father's fundamentalist
enemies and indoctrinated to the edge of no return. In more secular
fashion, Sheik Riad pressures the caliph, who takes an almost
fatally long time to realize that the man is an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then there is an assassination or an attempted one.
Bloodshed is graphic but employed sparingly. ``Every throat I cut
takes me closer to paradise,'' says a fundamentalist. Averroes,
conversely, speaks through the piles of books he writes on all
matters from Aristotle to ``The Incoherence of Incoherence.''
</P>
<P>
   Churned out 200 years before Gutenberg, the books assume central
importance when the caliph, by now retracting his open-mindedness,
orders them to be burned. But Averroes's many students, scribbling
in secret grottoes, make copies, which are spirited away to foreign
lands. ``Smuggling books. What decadence,'' someone remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Chahine's movie was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1997
and later had a theatrical run. An Egyptian director with an
extensive oeuvre, he shot ``Destiny'' in Lebanon and Syria, and in
the opening credits he acknowledges the assistance of the Syrian
ministries of culture, information and transportation. ``Who said
Syrian ministers aren't interested in freedom of expression?'' he
once told an interviewer. Best not to argue.

AT THE END OF A CENTURY, A WHISPER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ For their New Year's Eve concert here at the
Philharmonie, the Berlin Philharmonic and its conductor, Claudio
Abbado, came up with an extraordinary program that worked
extraordinarily well: seven finales in a row, to mark the passing
of the year and, depending on how you count, the century.
</P>
<P>
   It made one think about endings and about finales and, indeed,
about the ending of the finale, for the latest finale in the
sequence was the one from Prokofiev's ``Alexander Nevsky,'' written
shortly before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Beginnings of finales mattered, too. Beethoven's Seventh
Symphony provided a good finale with which to start: a finale with
an appropriately upbeat character. Then each finale had to begin
all over again after an emphatic conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The last movement of Dvorak's Eighth Symphony was probably
picked to show off the orchestra's wonderful principal flutist,
Emmanuel Pahud, who certainly played his solos with exceptional
fluency, dexterity and poise, but its opening fanfare for trumpets
also worked to set things rolling in the aftermath of the
Beethoven. In the same way, the horn solo that begins the finale to
Mahler's Fifth Symphony succeeded as a reinitiation after the
Dvorak.
</P>
<P>
   Each subsequent finale brought something new: a new musical
world, following three Central European classics, in the
Russianness and bell sounds of the last movement from Stravinsky's
``Firebird''; voices in the bacchanal from Ravel's ``Daphnis and
Chloe''; voices with words in the resounding final chorus of
``Alexander Nevsky''; and a speaking soloist in the spooky music
that leads into the grand sunrise of Schoenberg's ``Gurrelieder,''
the last movement well chosen to be the finale of finales.
</P>
<P>
   Only as a monument to the close of the 20th century was this
program not entirely satisfactory, for it had two excerpts from the
century before and none at all from the last three-fifths of the
century in question. So perhaps another orchestra somewhere will
devise a comprehensive concert of 20th-century finales to play when
the century is decisively over at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   That will be a difficult job. Finales are made not so much for
performers, who can see when the piece is going to end, as for
audiences, who cannot, and who also need to be roused to applaud.
Accordingly, the great age of the finale was the great age of the
public concert, from the end of the 18th century to the early
decades of the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Once music moved into the worlds of radio and records, so that
people could listen at a distance in time and space from the
performance, without any obligation to respond audibly, and either
alone or in small groups, the practical necessity of the finale
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine how disconcerted a 19th-century audience,
knowing only public concerts, would have been by a finale that
contradicted expectations of speed and common spirit, as, most
notably, the finale of Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique'' Symphony did.
</P>
<P>
   But heard in privacy, the quiet, slow, intimate finale may be
more telling, and the conditions of electronic listening also
benefit the kind of closing gesture that has been favored by
contemporary masters like Elliott Carter and Gyorgy Ligeti: the
throwaway.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes in music, interlocking with the development of
private or semiprivate listening, have also worked against the
boisterous conclusion. One is the compromising of the tonal system.
When compositions had to end in the key from which they had set
out, the eventual return was a moment that could take strong
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece where the sense of key is weaker, or absent
altogether, there is no such goal to be reached, no comparable
occasion of homecoming. Composers have therefore had to find other
ways to end, whether with a joke, a gradual dissolve, an abrupt
tearing, an adagio that lifts the music into timelessness or, as so
often in Stravinsky, a sequence of solemn harmonies like the
chiming of bells. These work fine, but they do not make for the
jubilant achievement characteristic of the 19th-century symphonic
finale.
</P>
<P>
   There are other difficulties for programmers of 20th-century
finales. One is that many composers in the last hundred years have
wanted to present their music seamlessly, so that there is no
finale _ or heard another way, the whole piece is a finale, from
the moment it begins. The bigger works of Harrison Birtwistle, for
instance, sound like 30-minute finales, works raging and stuttering
toward an end.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many of the great orchestral compositions of the last few
decades do not use a standard lineup. To go from the last movement
of Pierre Boulez's ``Pli Selon Pli'' to the last of Messiaen's ``Et
Exspecto Resur-rectionem Mortuorum'' would be apt on expressive
grounds, since both are symphonic meditations on death, but the
stage setup would have to be totally reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the underlying problem is that we are no longer so
certain of progress, no longer so sure that _ even within the 40
minutes or so of a symphony _ things are going to get better and
end happily.
</P>
<P>
   A program of finales that came forward from the 1930s would be
bound to encounter discontent, irony, pessimism and prayer as well
as the alarming forced jollity of so many of Shostakovich's last
movements. It would probably not generate the exultation created by
the Berlin concert: by the program, and not only by the orchestra's
supreme musicianship and discipline. But it might provide a whole
other set of reasons for us to wish ourselves well in a new era.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Only a few days from representing the city of
Nashville and the state of Tennessee, Bruce Matthews will not paint
a gaudy ``H'' on his forehead for the Super Bowl. That is too
flamboyant for an offensive lineman, but he will be thinking about
the city that sustains him still.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an allegiance that's hard to let go,'' he said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A religious man who now refers to the new home as ``the land of
milk and honey,'' Matthews did not favor the journey his team has
taken _ four stadiums, three different cities, in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he now holds the record for the most consecutive
games, 200, Matthews was not there for the entire 37 years of the
Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, have a feel for the city, from those
frustrating Sundays, 14 years of them, as he tried to keep the
behemoths from getting to his quarterback. Even when rumors said
the franchise was in trouble, he renewed his contract in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to leave Houston,'' he said on Tuesday. ``I was
a free agent and I re-signed with the Oilers, and we went up to
play Washington, and it was announced they were moving the team. I
got a little hot, I admit.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of negotiating, the Oilers moved. They played
their last game in Houston in 1996, and then played a year in the
Liberty Bowl in Memphis in 1997 and a year at Vanderbilt Stadium in
Nashville before finally reaching the Adelphia Coliseum this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept holding a golden carrot up for us,'' Matthews said,
admitting, ``There was part of me that resisted Nashville.
Nashville was a hard sell for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers and running backs can funnel their furies into
reactions, but offensive linemen must buy into the system, or the
center will literally not hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an effort to put Houston behind me,'' he conceded on
Tuesday. ``The first year, I moved up and my family came up for
weekends. Last year they came up full time _ during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Most athletes do not feel the pain of franchise shifts, except
for the personal annoyance of moving. How many old Brooklyn Dodgers
or Quebec Nordiques or Minneapolis Lakers felt more than nostalgia
for the vacated cities?
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Matthews put aside his sadness, and kept slugging. The
only games he has missed, early in his career, were when he held
out. This year he passed Jackie Slater of the old Los Angeles Rams
_ and what ever became of them? _ for consecutive games played. He
is proud of his own durability, as well that of his older brother,
Clay, who played linebacker for the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my brother _ all-time no-shows,'' Matthews said,
meaning neither of them had appeared in a Super Bowl, until now,
nor had their father, also Clay Matthews, who played a few years
for San Francisco in the '50s before there was such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   The father would demonstrate wrestling moves on Bruce in the
family living room, and the two brothers were equally competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a baseball game where we threw darts at a
two-by-four, and you won if you caught a dart,'' Matthews said.
``It was a great game _ until the first beanball. Then that game
was retired by my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews added: ``In basketball, he would tell me he would let
me win one but he just couldn't do it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he and his brother lasted so long, Matthews said: ``My
special diet of cheeseburgers and soda isn't going to do it. The
good Lord just gave us bodies that could take a pounding.''
</P>
<P>
   His closest call came in 1997 when ``a guy from Pittsburgh fell
down on my leg and tweaked my ACL. On Tuesday I definitely didn't
feel good about my chances, but we have a great training staff, and
my prayers helped.''

   When Matthews broke Slater's record, it dawned on his teammates
that he must be old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I'm an old man, but all of a sudden I was,''
Matthews said. ``It puzzled me. What was the date when I got old?''
</P>
<P>
   It boggles the players to realize that Matthews had been a
teammate of their coach, Jeff Fisher, back at USC. The talk about
age frightens Matthews because ``I've been playing football since I
was a kid. I am still a kid, really.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be a kid, but he has a history. He will be playing this
Super Bowl for the Tennessee Titans, but also for Houston. What
with all the playoff games, he has not been home recently, but, he
said, ``A lot of fans in Houston are enjoying it.'' From this
distance, he knows. &QL;

   WINTERTHUR, Del. _ The robust eight-gallon jar was both
impressive and puzzling: slightly larger than a basketball and
richly glazed in greens and browns, it bore the neat signature of
Dave, a slave who was a poet and master potter in Edgefield, S.C.,
in the 19th century, the first African-American to sign his
ceramics. But the date incised on the stoneware was difficult to
decipher.
</P>
<P>
   Was the year 1852 or 1832, Jill Beute Koverman, a curator
assistant at the Atlanta History Center, was asked when the jar was
donated in 1995. ``If the date was 1832, the jar would have been
the earliest signed pot by Dave,'' she said. ``But you couldn't
tell by the numbers because they were linked at the top and not too
clear, as if the date was written in haste. I had to find out for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Koverman did just that, making Dave a major research
project for the next three years. She moved to Columbia, S.C., and
became a graduate research fellow and later a curator at the
McKissick Museum of the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   She studied every pertinent document _ probate records, census
reports, mortgages, contracts, inventories and newspaper articles _
to verify all the known facts about Dave, eliminate mistakes and
add substantially to his story. She confirmed what she was told
early on by two ceramics experts whom she had consulted about the
jar's date: it was 1852, not 1832.
</P>
<P>
   Dave then became the subject of both her master's thesis and a
traveling exhibition of his work organized by her in 1998 at the
McKissick Museum. The show's title quotes a line from a poem on a
pot by Dave in the Smithsonian: ```I made this jar ...' The Life
and Works of the Enslaved African-American Potter, Dave.'' It will
open here next weekend at the Henry Francis duPont Winterthur
Museum and remain through June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Dave and his pots seems remarkable. His jars,
jugs, churns and pitchers are handsomely proportioned and are often
huge: two on view are nearly two feet tall. All are gloriously
glazed in greens, grays or browns, colors that merge in varying
intensity on the surfaces of some pots and come alive in runny
patterns that shimmer with a seeming wetness.
</P>
<P>
   The subtle differences in the textures and colors on these
pieces recall the medieval ash-glazed pots produced at Shigaraki,
Japan. The way in which they are displayed in the showcases
enhances the power of the abstract colorations: three or more
vessels are placed close together, much as they might have been
when they emerged from the kilns in the potteries where Dave
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Dave was a prolific potter. Mrs. Koverman estimates that he made
more than 40,000 pieces over his lifetime, 24 of which are in the
exhibition (along with seven pieces made by others in the same
period).
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave was a large man, probably more than 6 feet tall, who had
remarkable potting skills,'' she said. ``He was able to move 50 to
60 pounds of wet clay on and off the wheel to produce one of his
smaller, 10-gallon pieces. But his largest works, which were 29
inches high and held up to 40 gallons, must have required awesome
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Dave produced the largest pieces, he may have been
physically impaired. Mrs. Koverman said that oral histories taken
in the 1930s by the director of the Charleston Museum, the first
museum to collect Dave's works, revealed that he had lost a leg in
a railroad accident by the 1840s.
</P>
<P>
   But Dave's greatest challenges _ and achievements _ were never
merely physical. He was born into slavery about 1800, and his name
first appears in an 1818 mortgage, listed as a slave of Harvey
Drake, a ceramics producer with partners in the community of
Pottersville, one mile northeast of Edgefield. Dave worked for
Drake and was lent to colleagues in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The record is not clear on how Dave learned to read or write. He
was possibly taught by Drake or by one of Drake's partners, Abner
Landrum, who was also the publisher of The Edgefield Hive, a weekly
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum may have taught Dave to read and write so that he could
work for him, possibly as a typesetter. Dave's earliest writing did
not appear until 1834, two years after Landrum had left the area
and a year after Drake's death. By then Dave had been sold to
Drake's brother Reuben and a partner, who were also pottery
producers.
</P>
<P>
   That year it became illegal for slaves to be taught to read or
write. ``And if slaves were caught reading or writing, they might
be whipped severely, they might have lost fingers or might have
been sold,'' Mrs. Koverman said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as is known, Dave was never punished for his writing,
most of which was done while he was the slave of Lewis Miles, who
owned him on and off after 1840 until he was freed at the end of
the Civil War. Then he took the family name of Drake. He was listed
as ``David Drake, turner,'' in the 1870 federal census; a decade
later, his name was gone from the census.
</P>
<P>
   Dave was a man of extraordinary courage, intelligence and wit.
He risked his life to sign his pots and to write verses, serious
and humorous, on them. On an 1860 jar, he quoted Revelations: ``I
saw a leopard &AMP; lion's face, then I felt the need of grace.'' But
on an 1857 piece, he yearned for loved ones, writing, ``I wonder
where is all my relations/Friendship to all in every nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Koverman wondered, too, where Dave's relations are today:
``Does anything else survive to tell us more about this amazing
man?''

YES, THE RICH ARE DIFFERENT (MOSTLY BRITISH)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A slim, tanned, handsome jazz buff, sailor and ski bum who
approaches life with an amused, arched-eyebrow arrogance, Jude Law
as Dickie Greenleaf, the wastrel heir to a shipping fortune in
``The Talented Ripley,'' is the purest example of an upper-class
American golden boy to appear in the movies in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   His female counterpart in Anthony Minghella's portrait of rich
young Americans abroad in the late 1950s is Cate Blanchett's
Meredith Logue, a textile heiress bouncing around from one swell
European hotel to another.
</P>
<P>
   Dickie and Meredith could be characters straight out of an F.
Scott Fitzgerald novel. And as viewed through the eyes of Tom
Ripley (Matt Damon), a chameleon-like poseur who learns how to
impersonate Dickie, they seem to embody Fitzgerald's wistful
observation that the rich are different from you and me. By rich,
Fitzgerald meant not only having money but also the prep-school
educated, manor-born attitudes he encountered as a Princeton
undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   So isn't it odd that the actors playing characters who exemplify
the American upper class are British ( Law) and Australian (Ms.
Blanchett)? And what does it say about Hollywood's view of
``society'' that Gwyneth Paltrow, the American actress playing
Dickie's socialite girlfriend Marge Sherwood, should lack her
co-stars' supercilious airs?
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Paltrow won an Academy Award for ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' pop culture pundits have anointed her the heiress to
privileged Hollywood princesses like Grace Kelly and Audrey
Hepburn. But if you compare Ms. Paltrow with Ms. Blanchett or
Kristin Scott Thomas (a British actress of unbreachable hauteur),
she seems to be playing with the image rather than embodying it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paltrow's mystique illustrates Hollywood's ambivalence about
Anglophilia. That ambivalence has everything to do with class
consciousness and our immigrant society's residual sense of
inferiority to an older, class-bound society. We may be richer than
the British, but our money is still new.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's fondness for casting British actors as upper-class
Americans belongs to a long and duplicitous Hollywood tradition of
pretending to erase class differences while actually celebrating
them. Might it be that Hollywood actors, unwilling or unable to
portray the upper class in our supposedly classless society, are
relieved to let the British do it for them and take the heat? For
as much as snobs are envied, no one likes them very much. And
stars' careers demand likability.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why Daniel Day-Lewis, that most refined of British
actors, was cast as Newland Archer in Martin Scorsese's screen
version of Edith Wharton's ``Age of Innocence.'' Further back,
``Gone With the Wind,'' that ultimate American soap opera of
aristocracy brought to ruin, had two British actors, Vivien Leigh
and Leslie Howard, representing the flower of Southern womanhood
and the lost dream of Confederate ``honor,'' respectively. Their
Southern accents, especially Howard's, were softened and
Anglicized.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's ambivalence about aristocracy may also be a case of
craving something in which you don't really believe. On the one
hand, our national mythology proclaims this country to be the land
of opportunity. It's a place where a wealthy rap star like Sean
(Puffy) Combs can rub shoulders with a socialite like Brooke Astor
and live like a latter-day Gatsby on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a country that elevates the Kennedys to American
royalty and mourns the death of Princess Diana as though she were
our own.
</P>
<P>
   The trick for Hollywood has been to find a way to feed our
daydreams of pseudo-royal status without alienating a mass
audience. One way of doing this has been to give us homegrown
royals with the common touch.
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Hepburn with her patrician Mid-Atlantic accent
radiates an upper-crust hauteur, but she is also the embodiment of
a thorny, no-frills Yankee. Portraying socialites, Hollywood stars
like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, Lauren Bacall
and Elizabeth Taylor have all lent their characters a common touch.
Take Ms. Bacall, whose la-di-dah diction never obliterates a
vestige of Noo Yawk.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Hollywood ever came to creating fantasy princesses
whose roots didn't show was during the 1950s when Grace Kelly and
Audrey Hepburn (the daughter of an English banker and a Dutch
baroness) ruled, speaking in cultivated voices whose accents were
British-inflected without actually seeming British.
</P>
<P>
   The perils of seeming too British are evident most recently in
the unsuccessful promotion of two English actresses _ Julia Ormond
and especially Ms. Scott Thomas _ as upper-class ideals. After
``The English Patient,'' in which she and her fellow Briton Ralph
Fiennes embodied an Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch dream of aristocratic
passion and international style, Ms. Scott Thomas was romantically
paired with Robert Redford (in ``The Horse Whisperer'') and
Harrison Ford (in ``Random Hearts''), but her high-toned demeanor
comes across as chilly.
</P>
<P>
   Among men, an upper-class British accent raises the dreaded
specter of effeminacy. Our pioneer macho society has always looked
askance at men who appeared too-too. One reason Cary Grant (ne
Archie Leach) became the one British actor accepted as upper class
by an American mass audience was the roughness beneath his suavity.
Born into poverty in Bristol, England, he retained an English
accent that was working class, not Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   To be accepted as real men on the screen, American golden boys
have had to be cowboys as well as gentlemen. The ultimate example
is Robert Redford, whose blond hair and mild-mannered sincerity
suggest good breeding but who also seems at home on the range.
</P>
<P>
   If Law is to become the international star that some have
predicted, he'd better hop on a horse and maybe strap on a gun for
good measure. And he should keep polishing that American accent.

 Ann Wilson Lloyd's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
an exhibition of art with religious themes at the Aldrich Museum in
Connecticut.  
 By ANN WILSON LLOYD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Like a slightly daft forensic detective, the British
artist Cornelia Parker gathers evidence from moldering cultural
artifacts. Tarnish from Davy Crockett's knife, a feather from
Sigmund Freud's couch, dust from the grooves of a phonograph record
that belonged to Adolf Hitler, all become loaded icons once she
gets hold of them.
</P>
<P>
   Through precise presentations and mind-spinning titles, Ms.
Parker cleverly turns the trivial into secular relics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker's first American museum survey exhibition opens here
on Wednesday at the Institute of Contemporary Art and runs through
April 9. Among the 60 or so works on view will be ``Shared Fate,''
an installation of bread, newspapers, a necktie, shoelaces, etc.,
which have been whacked by the same guillotine that beheaded Marie
Antoinette. In the work's subtitle, she credits Madame Tussaud's
Wax Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``They show the guillotine in their Chamber of Horrors,'' Ms.
Parker says. ``It is the real thing _ the same blade that cut off
Marie Antoinette's head, but people don't really see it; the lights
and dummies are more sensational.'' She muses that her use of it
might be the first action the blade has seen since the French
Revolution. ``It was very weird to run my finger along its edge.
Two hundred years of rusting had made it very blunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The guillotine's ignoble fate is emblematic of Ms. Parker's art.
She seeks out objects so culturally laden _ with celebrity,
notoriety, myth, tragedy, memory _ that they are hidden in plain
sight; taken for granted, reduced to cliche. With the hope that
some weak, evocative flame within them might be fanned, she
attempts resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass (Colder, Darker, Matter)'' was the spectacular sculptural
installation she showed as a finalist for the 1997 Turner Prize,
Britain's most distinguished contemporary-art award. The piece,
which was seen in New York in 1998 but is not in the Boston show,
is a delicate, intricate mobile of filament-suspended charcoal
fragments from a Texas church destroyed by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Parker appreciates the obvious irony of a church
devastated by an act of God, her transformation of rubble into what
looks like a cosmological burst visually rechannels both the irony
and the poignancy of charred remains.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker's success lies beyond irony, in her ability to create
conceptual and formal beauty out of nothing much. Her tarnish
works, for instance, are mere smudge marks on handkerchiefs,
mounted and framed, but they recall minimalist gestural drawing in
the vein of Cy Twombly. She calls them little Turin shrouds, or
ghostly shades of the famed objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk of tarnished reputations, and while I'm not making
work that's issue-based, the tarnish itself has its own built-in
references,'' she says. ``I call this series `Stolen Thunder,'
because I'm stealing people's reputations, or borrowing their pain,
for my own purposes. But by polishing, I'm also leaving things in a
better state, taking something the owners didn't want. It's the
same with the burnt church, the rubble needed clearing away.''
Within unwanted remains, she says, ``I'm seeking the inverse of the
monument, the shadow of it, the subconscious of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a project rife with poetic irony, Ms. Parker pays inverted
homage to the British artist J.M.W Turner. Looking for whatever
conservators might remove when cleaning and repairing paintings at
the Tate Gallery in London, she came upon a pile of mellowed canvas
margins and liners that had been removed from Turner paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Turner painted his masterpieces, he double-stretched the
canvases, so there was an extra canvas behind the painted one,''
she says. ``In the 1970s, they restretched his works, removing the
liners. These have beautiful patina on them from spending 150 years
with their backs to the wall, and marks from stretcher bars through
the middle that make them look like Rothko paintings. I asked for
some, restretched them and hung them like a series of Rothkos.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker then took her cheeky idea a step further. She asked
the Tate, which already owned several of her art works, to
reacquire their own conservation-department castoffs as a new
collection of pieces by Cornelia Parker. So now, on view in Boston,
her ``Room for Margins'' is credited as officially on loan from the
Tate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty Pieces of Silver,'' another piece from the Tate's
collection, is just as irreverent. For it, Ms. Parker scouted
jumble sales and thrift shops for silver-plated household items _
chafing dishes, candelabras, trays and trumpets. Once collected,
she laid them in a road and hired a steamroller to flatten them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These objects already had individual histories as personal
memorials or household monuments,'' she says. ``Many of them were
engraved. So I decided to give them all one history, killing them
all off at once in a quite interesting cartoon death. I then
resurrected them by suspending them just above the floor. The title
alludes to the betrayal of Christ by Judas; all these objects were
betrayed by me.''
</P>
<P>
   In her series ``Avoided Objects,'' she explores possibilities
beyond the object. Pondering the negative of sound, Ms. Parker
seized upon the threads of vinyl cut out of record grooves. The
negative of words she embodies in the tiny threads of metal from an
engraver's shop. For her ``Pornographic Drawings,'' she took porn
videotapes that had been confiscated and smashed by British customs
agents, disolved the tapes in a ferric-oxide ink and made Rorschach
blots.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker is often linked with the young British artists who
were recently featured in the ``Sensation'' show at the Brooklyn
Museum, though, at 43, she is a decade older and, unlike many of
them, did not attend Goldsmiths College, the popular London art
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her work is within a less strictly British milieu than
theirs,'' says Jessica Morgan, the curator of the exhibition and a
fellow Briton. ``I think of her work as sensational, but less
strategically so, more sincere. Her use of found objects, in
particular, references a broader art history and conveys rich
associations beyond the art world, into history, literature and
social customs, rather than just being art about art.''

A ROCK MUSIC `PAPA' FINDS CALMER WATERS AS A CHILDREN'S HOST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment the surviving members of the Mamas and the Papas came
onstage two years ago to sing an old hit song and accept induction
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a certain group of mothers and
fathers in the television audience surely did a double take.
</P>
<P>
   For there on the screen, now getting on in years, were the rock
band's founder and chief songwriter, John Phillips; the singer (and
Papa John's ex-wife) Michelle Phillips, and, belting out the lead
vocals ... the Harbor Master.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, rock music fans with long memories may have known him as
Denny Doherty, once the buoyant tenor for one of the most popular,
tuneful and harmonically sophisticated bands of the '60s. But to
the parents (and babysitters) of preschoolers, the man singing
``California Dreamin''' that January night on VH1, the graying one
with the sea captain's beard, the longshoreman's build and the
mirthful eyes, is the host and voice of the children's television
series ``Theodore Tugboat.''
</P>
<P>
   As moments of recognition go, this one may not have risen quite
to the level of shock. It was not as if, say, Mister Rogers had
been caught moonlighting on late-night television as a stand-up
comic. Still, to the ``Theodore'' crowd, the Harbor Master had to
seem a long way from home.
</P>
<P>
   Home is Big Harbor, a safe haven of age-appropriate low-tech
animation where the water is calm and where life brings rarely more
than a ripple of trouble. It's where the sweet-natured, somewhat
guileless Theodore lives and works with his seaworthy pals Emily,
Hank, George and Foduck.
</P>
<P>
   There, everything mechanical that you might expect to find in a
harbor has a personality, a voice and an instructive way of dealing
with emotional issues that are relevant not only to tugboats,
barges, container ships, fishing vessels, wharves, loading cranes
and buoys, but to children too.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, the only human in the show, introduces each 15-minute
segment, narrates the action and provides all the voices before
reappearing for a few closing words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get too heavy or too deep or too moralistic,'' he
said of the series, a Canadian Broadcasting Corp. production that
is also shown on 195 PBS affiliates (WLIW in the New York area) and
in 80 countries. ``They're basic little good-bad, right-wrong,
up-down, hot-cold sorts of learning experiences for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   If Doherty's late-middle-age incarnation _ he's 59 _ is
surprising for a veteran rocker, it's not unique. Ringo Starr had a
similar children's television gig with the ``Shining Time Station''
series on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have read the autobiographies of John Phillips and
Michelle Phillips, or watched the VH1 ``Behind the Scenes''
dirty-laundry documentary on the group, or listened to Doherty talk
freely about his wayward youth, his kindly uncle guise may seem a
shade unlikely. The band's story, after all, is not one that's
entirely suitable for children.
</P>
<P>
   From 1965 to 1968, the Mamas and the Papas, the first popular
rock group after the British invasion to include women, sounded
smoothly in synch, producing six albums and a clutch of Top 40 hits
(``Monday, Monday,'' ``Dedicated to the One I Love,'' ``Go Where
You Wanna Go''). But their personal lives were an intramural mess.
John Phillips had left a wife and two children to marry Michelle
Gilliam, a 16-year-old ``California nymph,'' as Doherty recalls her
now.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the group formed, she and Doherty began an affair,
which didn't long remain a secret from Phillips, who wound up
writing about his wife's infidelity in songs like ``I Saw Her
Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fourth member of the group, the one with the
full-bodied voice and figure, Cass Elliot, fell hard for Doherty,
but her love went devastatingly unrequited. Eventually, Ms.
Phillips spurned both Phillips and Doherty and took other lovers,
only to be kicked out of the group for a while. The backdrop to all
this was the usual one for '60s California rock: luxuries, drugs
and, in Doherty's case, alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did in the morning and the last thing I did
at night was have a blast of rum,'' he said, over coffee, at the
Paramount Hotel on a recent visit to New York; he is a recovering
alcoholic now, he said, and has not had a drink for years. Liquor
even had a part in the band's music. ``Oh, yeah,'' Doherty said,
``in the dressing rooms, before a show would start. That's how the
stuff was recorded, so it sounded exactly the same as it did in the
studio.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the band's tangled web of love and sex, ``it was an
untenable situation,'' he said. ``Cass wanted me, I wanted
Michelle, John wanted Michelle, Michelle wanted me, she wanted her
freedom. ...'' Yet for all the betrayals and heartbreak, there were
bonds that were not easily severed: Doherty and Phillips would
nurse their wounds as roommates; John and Michelle Phillips would
briefly reunite and have a child, and Doherty remained devoted to
Mama Cass as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The group may have dissolved long ago, but Doherty concedes that
he has never truly escaped its shadow. Indeed, he has been reliving
it on stage in a one-man show, ``Dream a Little Dream: The Nearly
True Story of the Mamas and the Papas,'' which he mounted last
summer in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he was born, the son of a
hard-drinking marine pipe fitter.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which reopens this spring in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
chronicles his career in words, music and pictures, ending in 1974,
the year Cass Elliot died of a heart attack at 33 in London while
pursuing acting and a solo singing career.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty still grieves for Mama Cass, and bristles at the memory
of how her death was portrayed in the press: that she had choked on
a ham sandwich. ``What is a Jewish girl eating ham for anyway?'' he
said. ``It didn't happen. Her poor old heart just quit.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all his memories are sour. They were young, after all,
and so was their world. ``I was in New York in '62,'' he recalled,
``where Bob Dylan was shuffling around and handing out sheets of
paper with `Blowin' in the Wind' on it. I told him to get lost: `Go
away, you creepy kid!' I swear to God it happened. And Woody Allen
was doing stand-up, and Bill Cosby's putting chairs on tables,
doing stand-up. David Crosby and his brother were in a group.
Stephen Stills is in a group. Everybody was on the street in
Greenwich Village. I met John and Michelle; they were in the
Journeymen. Cass was in the Big Three. I'm in the Halifax Three.''
</P>
<P>
   Halifax. Though he says he is the only one of his family who
ever left home, he never put it entirely behind him. After the
group broke up, he moved to New York, performed in a failed
Broadway musical, an Andy Warhol production called ``The Man in the
Moon,'' married and had two children and then moved back to
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s the family packed up again, for New Jersey,
while Doherty helped John Phillips briefly revitalize the Mamas and
the Papas with the singer Spanky McFarlane and Phillips' daughter
Mackenzie. After that, it was back to Halifax once more and finally
to Toronto. There he tapes his ``Theodore'' segments and makes his
home as he approaches 60, now a grandfather and a widower. His wife
of 25 years, Jeanette Doherty, died of ovarian cancer a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, his children's show has brought him full circle.
Its harbor scenes _ mainly of boats scooting around by remote
control on wheels that are hidden in shallow water _ are shot in a
big tank in Halifax. He remembers his sentimental surprise at
discovering that the set was housed in the building where he had
gone to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I go into my Grade 5 classroom,'' he said. ``Everybody had
a favorite classroom during school. Mine was Grade 5. It had
windows you could get up and sit in on rainy days. So I go in and
it's the master model-builder's workshop. This is where they build
the models of all the tugboats and everything in the harbor. And
I'm standing in my Grade 5 classroom with a model in my hand and it
dawns on me: I've been all over the world. I've, you know, received
the accolades, the gold records and the Grammys and the `Oh, you're
wonderful and aren't you great' and on and on and on. And I'm
standing here in my Grade 5 classroom playing with a tub toy. And I
went: `Thank you, God. Thank you very much.' It brings you right
back down to earth, you know. Life has a way of doing that.''

LAKERS EAGER TO USE NEW PRACTICE FACILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Flailing on the court, the Lakers at least can
savor some good news off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the news (begin ital)is(end ital) a court. The Lakers,
with fingers crossed, are targeting mid-February for a
long-anticipated move to their new practice facility in El Segundo.
</P>
<P>
   Laker officials, still operating out of the Forum, hope to move
into their new offices around All-Star weekend, Feb. 12. The
practice court, weight room and other facilities for the players
and coaches should be ready shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to have our move completed by the conclusion of
All-Star weekend,'' said general manager Mitch Kupchak, ``and I
knock on wood as I say that. There's still a lot of work to get
done, but they're moving very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The $24 million HealthSouth Training Center, a campus that also
houses the Kings (who moved in last week), was supposed to be ready
by October or November. Target move-in dates have come and gone
several times since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd be in much earlier, so it's been a little
frustrating. It's like putting off Christmas,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers organization has been split between three sites ever
since they began playing at Staples Center in November.
Administrative offices remain at the Forum (which has since been
sold to the Kings). Practices are mostly held down the road at L.A.
Southwest College, and occasionally at the Forum, while game-day
shootarounds are at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   At HealthSouth, the Lakers will have two full-length courts,
with an intersecting main court that simulates the floor at Staples
Center. The Lakers maintain a satellite office at Staples, but
day-to-day operations will be headquartered at HealthSouth, in
upstairs offices that overlook the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a source of pride, I think, that we'll all share,''
Kupchak said. ``To have your own court, dedicated to your team...
if players want to come by on their own and shoot at any point in
time or come in early or stay late, they can walk into an empty
gym.''
</P>
<P>
   The center includes an amphitheater for game-film sessions, a
weight room and a hydrotherapy pool used for rehabilitating
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, for Tyronn Lue (who just had knee surgery), that
will be an incredible benefit for him, to be able to go to
practices or meetings, and then walk 15 feet for state-of-the-art
therapy,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping: The Lakers have lost four of their last six games to
follow a 16-game winning streak, but the results shouldn't be
entirely surprising. The four teams they lost to were a combined
111-53 (.677) through Monday's games and included two division
leaders (Utah and Indiana) and the team with the second-best record
in the league (Portland).
</P>
<P>
   All four losses were decided late in the fourth quarter or, in
the loss to Utah, overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have nothing to hang our heads about,'' Kobe Bryant
said. ``We have to keep fighting. We can't be down on ourselves.
That's just nonsense.... We haven't been as high (emotionally) as
we were. But we just have to respond to the challenge. It's a long
season. We're not playing for right now. We're playing for
championship time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson gave his team the day off Tuesday. The Lakers
don't play again until Friday, when they play host to Milwaukee.

   Justice Department Issues Rebuttal to Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft jointly
issued a stinging and disdainful rebuttal to the company's legal
arguments last week that it had not violated the nation's antitrust
laws. In a 30-page document filed with federal district court in
Washington, the Justice Department and the states characterized
Microsoft's arguments as a strained effort at knocking down legal
``strawmen.'' Concluding arguments in the antitrust case have been
scheduled for Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge has ruled that Microsoft must conform to
standards set by Sun Microsystems when it sells products that use
Sun's Java programming language.

   Procter Meets Earnings Estimates
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, a day after deciding against a bid for
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, reported second-quarter
earnings that were little changed from a year earlier but still met
analysts' expectations. Shares of Procter &AMP; Gamble, which is based
in Cincinnati, fell $5.375, to $97.50.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said its earnings more than doubled last
quarter as its customers poured money into the firm and its
corporate clients continued to sell stocks and bonds and buy other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products and Johnson &AMP; Johnson reported
fourth-quarter profits that matched Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Confidence Sets Record
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence rose to a record level so far in January.
Abundant jobs, a rising stock market and an uneventful change to
the year 2000 helped drive up the consumer confidence index to
144.7 in January, its highest level in 32 years.

   Qualcomm Expects Shipments to Dip
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm, the wireless technology company, warned that shipments
of cellular telephones and chips may dip in the second quarter,
sending its shares plunging $16 in after-hours trading. The warning
came as Qualcomm reported earnings that beat the expectations of
analysts by a penny.

   Chase Settles Privacy Case
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Bank and a Denver-based Internet company will no
longer routinely share personal or financial information about
their customers with other companies under a settlement announced

to the attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, had violated their stated

   Merging Led Zeppelin and Sinatra
</P>
<P>
   When the newly created AOL-Time Warner further consolidated its
pop power by announcing plans this week to merge with EMI Group, it
was a message about content. EMI's catalog includes the Beatles,
the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra and Garth Brooks.
If made available for direct digital download online alongside
Warner Music's superstars (from Madonna to Led Zeppelin to the
Eagles), this could hasten public acceptance of the music computer
file as an alternative to the CD.

WYNTON MARSALIS: JAZZMAN ON THE RUN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime during the last year, those of us who were on the
mailing list of Columbia Records ran for cover. It was raining CDs
by Wynton Marsalis. By the end of 1999, Marsalis had released some
20 hours of music on 15 CDs, a heroic effort called ``Swinging Into
the 21st'' that still has not emptied Columbia's vaults of his
material.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been anything like that sort of effusion in the
history of jazz, and to achieve it Marsalis cut his earnings per
album from $1 million to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The move produced some head scratching among jazz industry
watchers, who wondered what could possibly have inspired it. Some
thought it might be a way of getting Marsalis out of a contract,
making him a free agent in the marketplace; in fact, Marsalis has
been without a contract at Columbia since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Others speculated that Marsalis was trying to upstage his
brother Branford, who had been appointed creative consultant of
Columbia Jazz. Still others saw an effort to block the release of
work by rival artists on the label. And some believe Marsalis has a
need to be in the news and wanted to define in his own manner the
changing of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of this conjecture has a basis in fact, the deluge
of 15 CDs provides an opportunity to assess Marsalis' career, its
laudable ambition as well as its flaws. Over the last 20 years,
through his considerable skills as a conservator and popularizer,
he has become the public face of jazz in America.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Marsalis has used Duke Ellington as a standard
against which he judges himself, and he has produced an immense
amount of work for someone who has not yet reached 40. Like
Ellington and John Coltrane, he seems to be willing himself into
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   And like a man suddenly conscious of his mortality, Marsalis
seems intent on pouring everything he knows into his art. The
upshot is that while showing the breadth of his knowledge and
interests, he has not always achieved what he set out to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis' penchant for being the center of attention isn't
anything new. Even as a teen-ager in youth orchestras in his native
New Orleans he was regarded as a symbol of a renaissance in the
city's jazz scene. By the time Marsalis started touring in Art
Blakey's band in the late 1970s, jazz critics were passing around
reports of the blazing young trumpeter, as yet unrecorded, whom
they had heard at a jazz festival here or there.
</P>
<P>
   (Many of these same critics would later savage him with a
vengeance that at times seemed personal.) Marsalis, intentionally
or not, has always had a way of making himself felt as living,
breathing history on two feet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when he released his first recordings, he
made sure one of them was classical, showing off his obvious gifts
as a musician and underscoring his timing _ he appeared, remember,
during a period in which speculation over the death of jazz was
rampant. In the intervening 20 odd years, Marsalis has seen himself
both sainted and vilified. He has gone from being the child
mastermind of a musical revolution in mainstream jazz to something
of an irrelevancy, his glory days as the leader of the vanguard
long over and his innovations codified.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone from being a young musician at play in the fields of
jazz to the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. And though
Jazz at Lincoln Center does not have much effect on jazz's daily
workings, it has arguably more access to, and influence over, the
workings of American high culture than any other such institution.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Marsalis has championed a vision of jazz that is
at the same time deeply radical and deeply conservative, placing
the music securely in black American culture. He took his cues from
the writers Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray, arguing that black
culture deserved investigation and elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis applied those ideas to the music of his elders with a
real understanding of their achievements. His most influential
album is ``Black Codes From the Underground''; his near operatic
``Blood on the Fields'' is about slavery; and a three-CD set called
``Soul Gestures in Southern Blue'' takes on both jazz's
fundamentally black nature and the political and social
relationship between African-American and the larger American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on black culture has not made Marsalis popular, in
part because Negritude and the black idiom are not particularly
popular in some intellectual circles these days; one need only look
to recent books emphasizing the contributions of whites to jazz and
the grant-giving organizations' shyness of mainstream jazz
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis' stand at Lincoln Center, his celebration of mostly
black composers and band leaders, has led him into conflict with
critics who have tried to shame the program into their own vision
of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But Marsalis' dedication to the conservative strain that runs
through jazz _ the idea that what came before you has to be
absorbed before you can move on _ is the defining quality of his
work, and it has kept him in a nearly permanent state of learning.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis' early understanding of Miles Davis, and later of
Armstrong, Coltrane and Ellington, has dictated his various changes
of styles. But his synthetic compositions, sometimes brilliant, in
which the styles of his heroes are piled up on one another, are
occasionally obscured by the shadows of the originals. It is the
curse of all who wander into the desert of pastiche.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Marsalis' adherence to the black idiom, he became a bit like
the painters Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood: a fine craftsman
who clearly had something to say about the American condition _ in
fact, was obsessed with it _ and who had applied his intellectual
power to one theme, in his case black American culture.
</P>
<P>
   But that rich well has seemed at times to imprison him, as if he
were spending so much time with the rhetoric of an idea that he was
not letting his innate musicality shine through.
</P>
<P>
   Along came the 15 CDs, and they show what Marsalis has been
doing over the last decade. A good portion of the music is an
outgrowth of his work at Lincoln Center, including interpretations
of Thelonious Monk and Jelly Roll Morton recorded recently. There
is an as yet unreleased piece by his septet called the ``Marciac''
Suite, a tribute to the town in France where Marsalis regularly
performs.
</P>
<P>
   There are string quartets and music for ballets. There are
extended works, including ``Big Train,'' a work steeped in black
culture, and ``Reeltime,'' film music that was never used. And
there's a seven-CD set, ``Live at the Village Vanguard,'' that
captures Marsalis' working group, the septet, in all its glory from
1991 through 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the live music that Marsalis' imagination ignites. He
and the group play everything from the long composition ``Citi
Movement'' to some pieces with New Orleans grooves to others by
Monk and standards like ``Embraceable You'' and ``Winter
Wonderland.'' What's immediately evident is the thought that he has
applied to the mainstream jazz group.
</P>
<P>
   Tempos regularly change, in contrast to the usual monotony, and
various eras of jazz mingle, with Marsalis taking long virtuoso
solos on a tune like ``Cherokee,'' while the piece ``Buggy Ride''
features masterly writing loaded with riffs and breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The rhythm sections move from the oceanic ease of the John
Coltrane Quartet of the middle 1960s to the rhythmic precision of
Ellington's orchestra of the same time. It's both casual and
formal. Sometimes the compositions take the forefront, sometimes
the improvisations. It's simultaneously historical and modern, and
in the small group Marsalis sounds at ease and unforced; he is
having fun, and the improvisations, with their wit and connective
intelligence, are bursting with ideas.
</P>
<P>
   While Marsalis' long pieces have plenty to offer, it is those
with the small groups that allow him the most control; the
compositions fit the context, and everything sounds appropriate,
well-edited.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the rest of the albums come off as well. The reworking
of pieces by Monk at times sounds precious, as if the music had
been made pretty against its will. The music of Jelly Roll Morton
stands up better, taut and elegant. The ``Marciac'' Suite has
gorgeous compositional ideas and thick, glowing harmonies. ``Big
Train,'' an ambitious long-form composition dedicated to the place
of the train in black American culture, suffers from a bad case of
splintering, with all sorts of ideas breaking off from the whole.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to fault ambition and striving. Marsalis has produced
an extraordinary body of work over a short time. But there are
suggestions in his writing, in its occasional overreliance on music
borrowed from his idols, that Marsalis' creative energy is running
low, that the cost of constant production has been losing track of
his own voice.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Marsalis' obeisance to his idols has not freed him
to be himself. Charlie Parker is supposed to have said that a jazz
musician should learn everything possible, then forget it all. What
he meant was that to be creative, a musician first has to
understand the past, then erase it so as to find an original voice.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that by slowing his pursuit of greatness, with
more time to rid himself of other people's ideas, Marsalis might
get closer to his goal than by running the race he's running now.

<P>
   It's the summer of 1969 and Herman D. Washington, a 9-year-old
black boy from Harlem, has just stepped off the bus in the upstate
town of Fairview, N.Y., where he is to spend a charity-sponsored
vacation with a local family. He is not thrilled at the prospect,
and the greeting he receives does nothing to increase his
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody here to take care of you,'' says Abel Shaddick,
the irascible owner of a Jewish delicatessen in ``A Storm in
Summer,'' the Showtime remake of Rod Serling's 1970 teleplay.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Abel, played by Peter Falk, has been left holding
the bag for his nephew, who, in an inebriated moment of
civic-mindedness, signed up to sponsor Herman (Aaron Meeks) and
then skipped town. Abel is not inclined to give up the long,
solitary hours he spends mourning his dead son in order to
entertain a smart-mouthed ``slum child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Between a 70-year-old Jew and a 9-year-old black boy,'' he
explains to Gloria Ross (Nastassja Kinski), the woman responsible
for this foundering good deed, ``there's not what you would call a
mutuality of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Storm in Summer,'' directed by Robert Wise, is the 41st
movie that Showtime has produced for family audiences in the last
five years. Its themes of racism, anti-Semitism and hard-won
friendship are typical for these movies, which Showtime, in an
effort to attract both younger viewers and their parents, now
promotes under the banner Original Pictures for All Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Gang violence, illness, homosexuality and the Holocaust are
among the subjects that surface, with lighter fare like ``Sabrina,
the Teen-age Witch'' occasionally mixed in.
</P>
<P>
   In February, in recognition of Black History Month, the station
will show two movies: ``A Storm in Summer'' next Sunday and, on
Feb. 20, ``The Wishing Tree,'' the story of a lawyer, played by
Alfre Woodard, who reluctantly revisits the scene of her humble
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Showtime is virtually alone among cable and broadcast
networks in exploring weighty issues in regularly scheduled feature
films aimed primarily at youngsters age 8 and older. While
children's television is a lucrative niche market _ the popularity
of Nickelodeon, Fox Family and the Disney Channel attest to that _
most original programming for young audiences comes in half-hour
series or educational specials, said Larry Gerbrandt, a senior
analyst at Paul Kagan Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime's family movies are ``a lot like the old ABC afternoon
specials but for a far hipper crowd,'' said Robert J. Thompson, the
director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at
Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   The Showtime movies, he said, usually manage to get around
stereotypical ideas of what substantive family programming should
be: an unreal world in which there is no swearing, no sex and no
social inequities, and the only disharmony is that provoked by a
neighborhood bully, an indifferent girlfriend or a lost dog.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, may be the programming that some parents want,
but most young viewers would find it ``dreadfully square.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real world, let's face it, is not family-friendly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Serling would have understood his point. In the late '50s
and '60s, when Serling wrote many of his scripts _ his ``Twilight
Zone'' series ran from 1959 to 1965 _ television was not the place
to confront issues of the day; most programming was,
family-friendly _ but often in the worst possible way. (```Gomer
Pyle, U.S.M.C.' was about as close as you were going to get to the
Vietnam War,'' Thompson observed.)
</P>
<P>
   In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, Serling commented that
if, as a television writer, you had ``the temerity to try to
dramatize a theme that involves any particular social controversy
currently extant, then you're in deep trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Things began to change in the early '70s, right around the time
NBC broadcast the original ``Storm in Summer.'' With its blunt
social commentary, the teleplay was well-received _ Peter Ustinov
won an Emmy for his performance as Abel Shaddick.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, television would undergo profound change,
as shows like ``Mayberry R.F.D.'' were replaced by comparatively
realistic programs like ``All in the Family'' and ``M.-A.-S.-H.''
Later, with programs like ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' and ``Friends''
dominating the networks' schedules _ and ratings _ ``wholesome''
prime-time programming suitable for the under-14 crowd became
increasingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   Now, young audiences, especially 8- to 14-year-olds, which
Showtime is particularly interested in attracting, are a specialty
market.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Foley, an executive vice president who helps oversee
Showtime's family programming, finds that developing films for a
premium cable company allows unusual creative freedom. Quite often,
she said, Showtime's family movies turn out to be stories ``that
commercial networks can't or wouldn't choose to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what happened with ``A Storm in Summer.'' When
Renee Valente, an executive producer of the show, dug up Serling's
script several years ago, she was convinced that the story was
still relevant. But the major networks found it far from
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from one to the other,'' she said, ``and they all said
the same thing: `We can't do this. There's no longer this kind of
discrimination.' I couldn't believe my ears.''

 UNDATED: my ears.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By default, the script landed on the desk of Jerry Offsay, the
president of programming at Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Los Angeles, he said: ``Does it
have the broadest appeal? No. Is it the most commercial film you
can make? Probably not. But then we can afford to gamble on these
movies in a way that broadcasters can't because we don't have
advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Which also means that Showtime does not have to worry about how
many viewers are watching any one program.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they have to do is keep you happy enough with the variety
of programming so that you don't cancel Showtime,'' Thompson said.
In a sense, he said, these movies are the cover charge the company
pays to allow Showtime, which also broadcasts a good bit of adult
programming _ some of it quite steamy _ into the living rooms of
subscribers with kids.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it appears that the family films, along with the other
original programming that Offsay initiated when he joined the
network in 1994, are paying off. Subscriptions for Showtime
Networks (including Showtime, the Movie Channel and Flix) have
risen from 14.8 million subscribers in 1995 to 22.3 million as of
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Showtime's budget for family projects is modest _ between $2
million and $3 million for each movie. ``You're not going to see an
expensive space adventure on Showtime,'' Ms. Foley said. To keep
costs down, she said, the company often films in Canada. ``A Storm
in Summer,'' for example, was shot in Vancouver in 22 days.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the movies have earned accolades. The 1998 film
``The Island on Bird Street,'' about a boy struggling to survive in
a Warsaw ghetto during World War II, won three Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   Such themes have attracted some big names. James Earl Jones
starred in last year's ``Summer's End''; Jon Voight directed and
starred in ``The Tin Soldier'' in 1995; Ruby Dee plays Herman's
grandmother in ``A Storm in Summer''; and Dustin Hoffman was an
executive producer of ``The Devil's Arithmetic,'' last year's film
about a teen-age girl who is transported back in time to a Polish
concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wise, the director of ``The Sound of Music,'' and ``West
Side Story'' (with Jerome Robbins as co-director) said that he had
agreed to do ``A Storm in Summer'' _ his first television movie _
because he loved the story. ``I'm not willing to take on a project
without some kind of moral theme,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, neither Ms. Foley nor Offsay wants to be
heavy-handed. ``I hate to think that we're putting ourselves in the
role of teacher,'' Ms. Foley said. ``What we hope to provide is
entertainment that will allow our younger viewers to ask
provocative questions.''
</P>
<P>
   While many television experts think that Showtime's effort to
market these films to children and their parents is admirable, they
wonder whether such a broad audience is realistic. The question
becomes crucial for films like ``The Devil's Arithmetic,'' which
Showtime gave a TVPG rating for violence and brief nudity.
</P>
<P>
   For young viewers, such movies practically require adult
involvement. Yet the cozy idea of Mom and Dad and the youngsters
gathered around the TV set as if it were the family hearth is, the
experts say, outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that they're doing this now when the multi-TV
household is on the rise and people are much more isolated in their
exposure to media,'' said Katharine Heintz-Knowles, who analyzes
programming for organizations like Children Now, an advocacy group
in California. ``They'll have to be creative enough to include a
message that is clear enough for younger children to understand but
not so obvious that it's uninteresting for older viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Offsay conceded as much. ``Statistics tell us that Dad's
watching sports in one room, the teen-age son is watching wrestling
in another,'' he said. ``But then you have to ask which came first:
did families stop watching television together because there were
more sets in the house or because there was nothing for them to
watch as a family?''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner remembers a
play early in the season when he went to the line and realized that
one of his receivers was out of position.
</P>
<P>
   As Warner gestured for the receiver to shift to the right, the
quarterback heard a voice from behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should go left,'' Marshall Faulk, the halfback, said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, in his first year as a starter, realized that Faulk was
right. But then Warner thought the tight end should take a step
back off the line. He started to wave his hand in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stays there,'' Faulk said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner nodded his head, confident that Faulk was right. He
snapped the ball and ran the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we got a first down,'' Warner said Tuesday. ``Marshall
doesn't just know his assignments, he knows everybody's assignments
in the offense. When I was still absorbing pieces of the offense,
he was a second set of eyes behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he knows what he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk is not only a player who makes the high-flying Rams go,
with 1,381 yards rushing and 1,048 yards receiving this season, but
he can also tell you the blocking schemes and reads of every
lineman on any play, the sight adjustments and the pattern
responsibilities of the receivers and the quarterback's progression
of reads in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rams' coaches conduct meetings, Faulk listens and takes
notes on the instructions of the line coach, the quarterbacks
coach, the running backs coach and the receivers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't just want to know what everybody has to do; I want to
know why,'' Faulk said. ``When you know why, you know more. The
knowledge relaxes me. When I know what everybody is trying to do, I
can run a certain way to make a block work. I can run a pass
pattern a certain way to make it easier for the quarterback to see
me in the scheme of the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro football is all about playing faster. You play faster when
you know more.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, when Tennessee Coach Jeff Fisher was asked
Tuesday what he feared most about the Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV on
Sunday, he said, ``Marshall Faulk.''
</P>
<P>
   Told this, the assured and polite Faulk didn't pretend to
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run the ball, I catch the ball and I'm the guy who makes the
blitz reads,'' Faulk said. ``I'm a big part of the offense even
when I'm not touching the ball. That's a good assessment by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk's story with the Rams this season is one of a player who
dominated defenses so completely _ with that elusive combination of
speed and smarts _ that one can only wonder how St. Louis acquired
him for second-round and fifth-round draft picks. But that is all
the Rams had to give to Indianapolis for a player the Colts
acquired in 1994 with the second overall pick of the National
Football League draft.
</P>
<P>
   When Faulk was traded last winter _ without much fanfare or
bidding from other teams _ the rumors out of Indianapolis described
Faulk as a moody and a sometimes gloomy presence on a team that won
just three games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, 26, didn't deny that all that losing bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am moody,'' he said. ``I'm very moody when I don't do well
and the team is losing. I think I deserve to be moody. We're human
beings.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Louis, where the Rams have lost only three games, there
has been more time to be jovial, although Faulk maintained Tuesday
that he still has what he calls ``bad mood'' days. But his
teammates have come to appreciate a player whose knowledge of the
offense and incredibly quick feet have blended well with a team
built around quick reactions and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never considered the acquisition of Marshall a gamble,''
Rams Coach Dick Vermeil said. ``We only wondered if we could get
the most out of him. Because we all knew he was a player of immense
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who is only 5-foot-10 and 210 pounds, had his fifth
1,000-yard rushing season with the Rams, a team that doesn't run a
lot of routine, straight-ahead running plays. Indeed, the Rams try
to set up the run by passing.
</P>
<P>
   But Faulk, with his slashing, cut-back running style, was a
natural for the St. Louis attack. And since teams were fearful that
Faulk would become a pass receiver, they often brought in an extra
defensive back in place of a linebacker, which made running the
ball easier if Faulk got past the front line, too.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who averaged 5.5 yards a rushing carry and led the Rams
in pass receptions with 87, became the threat that all of the Rams'
other weapons played off. He stood in the backfield and analyzed
every play, thinking of the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is my best attribute,'' Faulk said. ``I can see
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even what is wrong on any given play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just football,'' Faulk said, smiling. ``It's not that
hard to understand if you keep your eyes open.''
</P>

FISHER VAULTS INTO THE LIMELIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shortly before Tennessee was to play heavily favored
Jacksonville last Sunday, players from the Titans squeezed into
their meeting-room chairs, expecting the normal fare of football
gobbledygook. Then Coach Jeff Fisher, the most underrated tactician
in football and a man who knows how to push his team's buttons, ran
the videotape, and on the screen were images of Jaguars players
doing their version of a Super Bowl shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Jaguars had shot a video in which they danced and
sang about going to the championship game, even before the American
Football Conference title game against Tennessee. The video was for
a charity event, but it will go down as one of the more serious
blunders of the season. Once Fisher discovered the mistake
Jacksonville had made, he jumped at the chance, like Derek Jeter
swinging at a fat curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he showed the Jacksonville tape in the meeting, I
laughed,'' the veteran offensive lineman Bruce Matthews said. ``I
thought it was kind of a silly thing to do. I've seen that stuff a
hundred times, coaches using those kinds of ploys. Then I looked
around the room, and could tell it struck a chord. It was clear
what Jeff did really worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is his striking motivational tactics, his brilliant
defensive schemes, like the one that shut down first Indianapolis'
Peyton Manning and then the vaunted Jaguars, or his
straight-shooting approach with players, Fisher is stepping out of
the shadows to finally earn acclaim as one of the top coaches in
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's timing could not be better. His contract runs out after
next season, and the Titans are almost sure to extend it. But they
will have to pay. Fisher earns about $1 million a season, but
because of his berth in Super Bowl XXXIV, his salary will most
likely double. But clearly, he is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why players really like him?'' tackle Brad Hopkins
asked. ``He never lies to you. He never tells you a load of
garbage. He communicates well. He'll go out and say, `Kick that
player in the crotch or smack him in the mouth.' He's not
politically correct. Players love that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher began learning how to be a head coach as an NFL player. A
seventh-round pick of the Chicago Bears, Fisher was a solid
defensive back and an excellent punt returner. He earned a Super
Bowl ring in 1985 with the Bears, despite spending the year on
injured reserve with an ankle injury. ``I was one of the few
players that knew I was going to be a coach once my playing days
ended,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fisher never forgot his days with the Bears. Once he began
coaching, he remembered what he liked and disliked about the
coaches he played for, taking only the positives and applying them.
Fisher has an extensive background, beginning as a defensive
backfield coach with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1986-88. That was
followed by a promotion to defensive coordinator from 1988-90.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher worked closely with former Eagles coach Buddy Ryan, one
of the smartest defensive minds in the history of the game.
Fisher's Titans run the vaunted ``46'' defense, which Ryan refined
with the Bears and the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was later the defensive coordinator with the Rams (1991),
the defensive backs coach with San Francisco (1992-93) and then the
defensive coordinator with the Houston Oilers. He was named head
coach of Oilers in 1994, and the franchise moved to Tennessee in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   All of that moving helped Fisher extensively, allowing him to
work with a number of different systems and players.
</P>
<P>
   His game tactics and practice habits are becoming legendary.
Fisher is a stickler for details. He will practice certain defenses
or plays over and over, sometimes puzzling and annoying his
players.
</P>
<P>
   Until it all pays off, like in the Titans' first playoff game
against Buffalo. Fisher ordered the Titans to practice their
now-famous lateral play, over and over, all season. It worked in
the game against the Bills, going for the game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee General Manager Floyd Reese said: ``Becoming a good
head coach is like becoming a good player. It takes hard work. You
have to learn the job. The thing that has been encouraging to me is
that he continues to get better. Where does he go from here? I
think he'll just keep growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has come a long way from when players first saw him, and
didn't know quite what to make of the 5-foot-10 head coach. When
Hopkins first spotted Fisher, he said he first thought: ``Who is
this guy? The kicker?''
</P>
<P>
   No one thinks that anymore. Far from it.

COMMENTARY: BEWARE GUYS NAMED JUNIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore wants to be the person who says how things
go. But if you wanna be boss, you gotta be willing to whack some
people. You gotta get Bill Bradley to donate his kneecaps. You
gotta put your (expletive) rivals in a Luca Brasi situation.
Bradley may have run Jersey once, but he was never a made guy in
the administration. He never reached the heights.
</P>
<P>
   So Al Gore is hardening his position. Bradley can show some
(expletive) respect and drop out ... or it's gonna be a rainy night
in Lyndhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew, with all the candidates promising to run positive and
upbeat campaigns, that Al Gore would turn into Tony Soprano _ a
thoughtful and increasingly self-aware family man who always does
what he has to do?
</P>
<P>
   Who knew that those polite and upright Iowans would reject the
polite and upright Bill Bradley?
</P>
<P>
   This week the Iowa caucuses and the Golden Globes made it
official: Thuggery is chic.
</P>
<P>
   The homely caucuses and the glittery Hollywood awards have more
in common than you might think. As my friend Eric Mink, the TV
critic of The New York Daily News, puts it: ``They're both phony
events concocted almost entirely for media exposure. They're
decided by a tiny number of wholly unrepresentative people with
dubious to nonexistent credentials. The politicians and celebrities
kiss up to the voters. The results are objectively worthless, but
they are granted self-fulfilling significance by the media as
supposed bellwethers of the more legitimate contests that follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Winners Al and Tony both have rivals nicknamed Junior. They both
have the Teamsters on their side, and savor new technology _ Tony's
soldiers hijacked a truckload of DVD players. They both have health
care plans. Tony's involves setting up fake clinics and billing the
insurance companies for phony MRI's.
</P>
<P>
   They both care about values. ``Nowadays there are no values,''
Tony frets to his shrink, about how mob captains will no longer go
to prison rather than break the code of silence. ``Guys today have
no room for the penal experience.''
</P>
<P>
   And they appreciate therapy, even though they are in businesses
that traditionally scorned sharing inner feelings. (``What they
didn't know,'' Tony says, ``is once they got Gary Cooper in touch
with his feelings they wouldn't be able to shut him up.'')
</P>
<P>
   The veneer of suburban domesticity in Tony Soprano's life _
watching his daughter's volleyball games, barbecuing sausages for
his pals _ is interrupted by random, self-interested acts of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Gore added verbal roughhouse to his touchy-feely
campaign, pounding Bradley as an insensitive man who would ``tear
down'' Medicaid and who betrayed farmers by voting against a 1993
flood-relief amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most dramatic change has been Al Gore's
transformation from wooden soldier to junkyard dog,'' Time
marveled. The magazine observed that the Gore aide Carter Eskew,
whose ad campaign derailed the administration's attempts for a
tobacco deal, ``has fostered Gore's instinct to go for the
jugular.'' (Or, as the Soprano capos cajole a man with a broken
leg, ``Do you want to go for a walk on the rocks?'')
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek recounts how Gore surrounded himself with Washington's
version of ``cold-blooded'' made men: ``He knew what he wanted: a
posse of the `Unforgiven,' who care more about winning than being
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing rough, Al Gore brings to mind Tony Soprano. But the
Bushes have been dubbed ``the WASP Corleones.'' Those who do not
abide by the Bush code _ either you're with us or you're not _ may
find themselves summering with the fishes.
</P>
<P>
   This race, despite its posturing about civility, is really about
revenge. Bill Clinton wants to avenge himself on the Republicans.
And W. wants to avenge his father's loss in 1992. Vendetta 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa had only just crowned Bush and Gore when the vice president
clipped his Republican rival as a threat to the economy and
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   So now we go to the mattresses: a war of restitution by the sons
of two established families, each surrounded by ruthless capos.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the ratings will increase.

BAD HAIR DAYS CAN LOWER SELF ESTEEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A bad hair day can leave your self-esteem as flat
as your curls, while good hair can make you feel as slick as a
handful of pomade, according to a Yale University study.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that people who think their hair looks bad
consequently feel less capable, less smart, less sociable and more
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see that, especially with women. Their whole feeling
is in the way they look. It's their security,'' said Deanna Dorse,
33, a hair stylist in the suburban Los Angeles community of
Woodland Hills. ``It sounds terribly shallow, but that's the kind
of world we live in. It's a superficial world.''
</P>
<P>
   But the study shows that men might be even more frazzled by the
frizzies than are women. Men suffering through a bad haircut or an
unruly cowlick were more likely than womeen to feel less smart or
capable, according to an Associated Press account of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultural truism is men are not affected by their
appearance,'' said Marianne LaFrance, the Yale professor who
conducted the study. ``This is not just the domain of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Spence, a 22-year-old actress from Burbank, said she
thinks some of the respondents are overreacting, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep my feet planted firmly on the ground whether
I'm bald or have hair to the floor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosie Rost, a hair stylist for 30 years, said the findings
make perfect sense. She works with chemotherapy patients who have
lost their hair, and sees how stylish wigs can transform their
moods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they've got cancer and they're focusing on their hair,''
said Rost, owner of Hair House in Woodland Hills. ``Hair is really
important. If you've had a bad haircut, you know what I'm talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sheila Altman of Woodland Hills knows just how important
</P>
<P>
   she temporarily lost her hair last year during a bout of
shingles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we're attractive or not, we need to feel attractive,
and I think hair is a big part of that,'' said the 53-year-old
property manager.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers surveyed 60 men and 60 women from 17 to 30, most of
them Yale students. About half were white, 21 percent were Asian, 9
percent were African-American and 3 percent were Latino.
</P>
<P>
   They were separated into three groups. The first group was told
to think about times when they had bad hair, the second was told to
think about faulty product packages, to get them in a bad mood, and
the third was told to not think about anything negative.
</P>
<P>
   The groups were tested for self-esteem and self-judgment, and
the bad hair group scored lower than the others.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by Procter &AMP; Gamble, the manufacturer of
shampoo and other beauty products.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Nehoray, 31, a builder from Sherman Oaks agreed that
people's looks can affect their moods, but the extent varies
widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a hockey player and you show up to bash a bunch of
guys heads, you probably couldn't care less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nehoray's friend Lucas Valadez, 35, of Long Beach, seems to fall
in the ``couldn't care less'' category, even though his own curly
hair cascades to the middle of his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a bad hair day, I just wear a cap,'' he said.

<P>
   Apparel and footwear factories overseas have slowly improved
working conditions in response to a highly vocal anti-sweatshop
movement, labor rights advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from college students and other opponents of sweatshops
has led some factories that make goods for industry giants like
Nike and the Gap to cut back on child labor, to use less dangerous
chemicals and to require fewer employees to work 80-hour weeks,
according to groups that monitor such factories.
</P>
<P>
   These changes, labor advocates say, could signal the beginning
of a broad improvement in conditions for low-paid apparel workers
in Asian and Latin American factories after four decades in which
the trend has been for American companies to transfer production
overseas in search of ever-cheaper labor.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates stress that the improvements have been spotty, and
that serious problems remain at factories from Honduras to Hong
Kong. Wages are often too low to feed a family, factory air is
often filled with chemicals and many managers refuse to let sick
employees leave work to get medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some improvement on the ground, but nowhere
near significant enough,'' said Charles Kernaghan, executive
director of the National Labor Committee, a leading anti-sweatshop
group.
</P>
<P>
   At many factories, labor rights advocates say, managers have
stopped hitting workers, have improved ventilation and have stopped
requiring workers to obtain permission before going to the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Sweatshop opponents praise some companies, like Liz Claiborne,
for improving conditions, while accusing others, like Wal-Mart, of
being slow to ensure changes at the overseas factories that produce
their apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some steps have been taken, but I don't think one can say that
conditions have improved in any wholesale way,'' said Pharis
Harvey, executive director of the International Labor Rights Fund,
a watchdog group in Washington. ``A number of companies that
produce globally are watching much more carefully to deal with
problems before they become embarrassing public problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-sweatshop movement has put many apparel makers, like
the Gap and Kathie Lee Gifford, on the defensive by picketing in
front of stores, holding sit-ins at colleges and bombarding
companies with letters.
</P>
<P>
   The movement, one of the nation's largest to push for changes
since the 1960s, includes church and consumer groups, labor unions,
human rights organizations and college, high school and even
middle-school students. The movement's leaders often note that
sweatshops are not just found overseas; many remain in New York,
Los Angeles and other American cities.
</P>
<P>
   The movement sprung up partly because the International Labor
Organization, a United Nations agency, and American labor unions
are virtually powerless to improve conditions in Third World
factories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At December's protests in Seattle, conditions in such factories
were a major focus, with many demonstrators demanding that trade
treaties punish countries that permit violations of minimum labor
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel industry executives say that with shoppers hunting for
bargains, they face intense pressure to produce goods as cheaply as
possible, encouraging many to turn to substandard factories. And
some economists say sweatshops are a necessary first step for
developing countries seeking to raise living standards through
exports.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate executives acknowledge that the anti-sweatshop
movement's efforts are paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Knight, chairman of Nike, the world's largest footwear
maker, said the movement has gotten his company to accelerate
efforts to improve conditions. ``It probably speeded up some things
that we might have done anyway,'' said Knight, whose company uses
565 footwear and apparel factories employing 500,000 workers in 46
countries. ``Basically the workers in footwear factories, not just
our factories, are better off today than two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In one significant move, Nike and its rival Reebok are requiring
the many Asian factories that produce for them to stop using
petroleum-based adhesives that cause damage to the liver, kidney
and central nervous system in favor of safer water-based adhesives.
</P>
<P>
   Labor rights experts point to many improvements. Five years ago,
monitoring groups say, apparel factories in Honduras often employed
children under 14, but now it is rare to find workers under 16. In
Indonesia, managers no longer systematically squash unionization
efforts or have the leaders of such efforts jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Claiborne, the Gap and Reebok have all hired respected human
rights groups to monitor a handful of their factories.
Anti-sweatshop advocates say these organizations are tougher, more
credible monitors than the corporate auditing firms usually used
for monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-sweatshop movement has improved working conditions,''
said Apo Leong, executive director of the Asia Monitor Research
Center, a labor rights group based in Hong Kong. ``We're seeing the
multinationals putting pressure on their contractors and
subsequently conditions have improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Leong noted that factories in China were using less child labor
and prison labor. But he said grave problems remained throughout
Asia. He said that China often imprisoned union organizers, that
many Nike and Reebok plants still lacked adequate ventilation and
that many factories in Cambodia had deplorable health and safety
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sweatshop opponents point to other problems. Jeffrey Ballinger,
executive director of Press for Change, a labor rights group, said
wages paid by Nike's Indonesian factories had fallen in recent
years, after accounting for inflation, an assertion the company
denies. ``After a five-year struggle, wages are behind where they
were,'' Ballinger said. ``They're below what is considered
necessary to meet the minimum needs of a single adult.''
</P>
<P>
   In Central America, many female workers at apparel factories
complain that managers touch them improperly or demand sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee said, ``While we're
seeing progress on cleaner bathrooms, better ventilation, less
yelling at workers, there are two places where progress seems to
grind to a halt: the effort to form unions and the effort to have
wage increases.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent development is the formation of the Fair Labor
Association, a White House-backed group of human rights
organizations and companies, including L.L. Bean, Nike and Reebok.
This group is setting up a monitoring system to inspect overseas
factories to get them to meet minimum labor standards, like not
hiring children under 15 and not requiring employees to work more
than 60 hours a week. Companies that comply can sew ``No Sweat''
labels onto their apparel to reassure consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Many campus groups criticize this association for not requiring
factories to pay a living wage and favoring scheduled inspections
over surprise visits. These campus groups insist that the Fair
Labor Association is pro-corporate and will paper over deplorable
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The association's members defend it as the first serious
corporate-backed effort to inspect apparel factories systematically
and to put teeth behind basic labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Karp, Liz Claiborne's general counsel and chairwoman of
the Fair Labor Association, said the association would have
rigorous monitoring and the financial wherewithal to ensure regular
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see quite meaningful change in the industry
once this is up and running,'' she said.

A GET-WELL WISH FROM ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the first times I met Derrick Thomas was a few
days before Christmas nine years ago. He asked me to ride with him
to a Kansas City hotel. There was something there he wanted to
share.
</P>
<P>
   In a ballroom he had rented, there were more than 50 children
who were part of his Third and Long program, a group Thomas had
formed to help young people with reading and writing, in
particular, and boost their self-esteem in general.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the children wore Kansas City Chiefs jerseys with No.
58, Thomas' number. It was a festive time. He knew most of the
children by first name. He walked around the room visiting with
them, sharing a part of his vision for their lives and for his own:
to walk proudly, head high, to master the craft of reading and
writing and to dream and be willing to pay the price to make those
dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas stopped to lovingly embrace one child who looked into his
eyes and said: ``Thank you. I love you.'' Thomas fought back tears
and later said, ``I have never sacked a quarterback or won a game
that meant more than these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a car accident in Kansas City on Sunday that for now
has left Thomas partly paralyzed, his dream is to walk again. To
walk into a room and be able to lift children once again and to
tell the story of how he overcame the deepest adversity in his 33
years.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Super Bowl XXXIV, the Titans and the Rams heard the news
about Thomas and dealt with it in a variety of ways. Some could
barely talk about it. Others did, shaking their heads, wondering
how a man so big and so strong, whom many of them had tried to
block or elude, could be struck so suddenly and swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   They know that he was the National Football League's Man of the
Year in 1993, the most prestigious character award that an NFL
player can win. They know he is a nine-time Pro Bowl player and one
of the most dynamic pass rushers in pro football history.
</P>
<P>
   They also realize, on the brink of playing in the biggest game
of their lives, that in a blink, this type of accident, on the
field or off of it, could happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us has just been favored so far,'' Titans tight end
Jackie Harris said. ``Guys don't really want to talk about it a
lot, how we take so much punishment in this game and how we're so
big and strong but so fragile just like any other human. Derrick's
situation throws your football mortality smack into your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Rams safety Devin Bush said: ``Derrick is from Miami. I'm from
Miami, so there is a natural connection there. What a great thing
it is to be able to play in the Super Bowl, but now, also, we are
reminded of what a great thing it is just to be able to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans running back Rodney Thomas said: ``What if I walk a few
feet from right here and fall from a heart attack or just drop
dead? What have I done with my life? Have I been a servant of God
and helped to save lives? Life is full of tragedies, of ups and
downs and joy and pain. It's so important in light of Derrick to
see things as they are, whether you are age 10, 20 or 60. For me,
this is a time to really believe that Derrick will walk again and
to believe in miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Rams safety Todd Lyght said he had already sent Thomas a card
and that he would visit him after the Super Bowl. Titans cornerback
Denard Walker said he grew up in Texas watching Thomas, viewing him
as a ``pioneer.'' Rams linebacker Mike Jones remembers riding on a
plane with Thomas a couple of years ago and the quality and depth
of their conversation and how he found Thomas to be ``inspiring,
full of wisdom and a pro's pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Two players here at the Super Bowl were profoundly affected by
the news: Titans safety Marcus Robertson and Rams receiver Isaac
Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 27, Robertson left his home on his motorcycle and had
traveled less than a mile when he hit a slick spot and crashed. His
helmet was not strapped. His head bounced once on the street with
the helmet on and again after the helmet had flown off, scarring
his face. Robertson would miss the Titans' next game but would play
in Tennessee's three playoff games. On Sunday at Jacksonville,
however, he broke his left ankle and will miss the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at my situation, and it is bittersweet,'' Robertson
said. ``I'm going to have to change hats for the Super Bowl and
help as a coach with my teammates in any way I can. It's
frustrating, but when I think about Derrick, I know I am blessed.
And really, we both are. We could both be boxes somewhere right
now. Sure, I've got the scars still on my face and they will stay
there, no plastic surgery, because these scars will be my testimony
of God's love and grace to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and his girlfriend were traveling back to St. Louis from
an Indiana-Missouri college basketball game in Columbia, Mo., on
Dec. 7, when the back left tire on his car blew out. Bruce slammed
on the breaks and the car began to spin as it ran off the road and
started rolling. His girlfriend was not seriously injured and Bruce
survived without a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called on the name of Jesus and just waited for the car to
stop tumbling,'' Bruce said. ``Five firefighters helped us out of
the car and it was smashed. I wasn't wearing a seat belt and the
windows in the car exploded. Now, I don't get up in the mornings
worrying about anything. I pray for Derrick. My heart goes out to
him and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   It is third-and-long for Derrick Thomas now, a sensitive, caring
and intelligent man who walked proudly. We share his dream.

IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, NEW MESSAGES AND NEW CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.H., Iowa, Minn.)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Despite their justifiable jubilation after
first-place finishes in Iowa, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush confront unexpectedly complicated terrain here in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   This state may ultimately provide more of a test of their appeal
and their political adaptability than the low turnout caucuses that
began this year's presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived in New Hampshire facing not one opponent, as he had
expected with Sen. John McCain, but two, with Steve Forbes
emboldened by his strong second-place finish in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Although this could end up playing to Bush's advantage by
dividing his opposition, it places him in the immediate position of
having to confront an attack from two sides of the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the dynamic is simpler, but not without hazards. While
his campaign hopes he can build steam from his easy win in Iowa, he
lacks the built-in benefits he enjoyed there, in particular, a
foundation of support from organized labor. In addition, polls show
that Bill Bradley is far more competitive with Gore here and that
many more voters are inclined to embrace his message as a fresh,
reform-minded alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously trying to dampen expectations, Gore acknowledged as
much when he arrived here early Tuesday morning and instantly took
to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire doesn't take its lead from anywhere else,'' he
declared. ``You make your own decisions, and I'm asking for your
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made a similar point, though obviously from a different
perspective. ``New Hampshire is a bastion of independent
thinking,'' he said. ``Nobody tells them what to do. They make up
their own minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their challenges, Gore and Bush are, of course, in
the most enviable positions, because success in this state is
critical for Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have the resources and the institutional support
in their parties to survive a defeat here. That would be more
difficult for McCain, who skipped Iowa altogether so he could
concentrate on New Hampshire, or Bradley, who has always counted
New Hampshire as a state he should win. They have had their best
showings in polls in this state.
</P>
<P>
   By finishing a distant second after Gore in Iowa, where he
stumped vigorously, Bradley faces even more pressure in this state,
as even Bradley's own supporters acknowledged this week. ``Bill
needs to have a credible showing in Iowa and to win in New
Hampshire,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Murphy, a Democratic strategist in Washington, said Gore's
victory in Iowa so changed perceptions that a win here by Bradley
would boost his prospects far more than had he performed better in
the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is now set up to take a fall if he doesn't win in New
Hampshire,'' Murphy said. ``Since the consensus is that Gore will
win, if Bradley can pull off a win his campaign will be quickly
revived.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in their victory speeches in Iowa on Monday night, Bush and
Gore, mindful that they face an entirely different electorate in
New Hampshire, were sounding new themes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, instead of talking about farmers and flood relief, focused
on the economy and asked voters if they were better off now than
four years ago, a tribute to the economic concerns that have long
framed politics in this state. It is a message designed to
capitalize on the accomplishments of the Clinton administration on
the eve of the president's State of the Union message, which has
ended up being propitiously timed for Clinton's protege.
</P>
<P>
   As he celebrated his victory in Iowa, Bush declared, ``The
message worked here, and the message is going to work in New
Hampshire as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, the Texas governor shed the more direct
appeals to conservatives he had made in recent days and, reaching
out to the more secular, libertarian and independent voters in New
Hampshire, presented himself as the most electable and mainstream
candidate. Bush's task is arguably more complicated because he has
the challenge of running against two opponents, both of them
potent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been assiduously preparing for this week in New
Hampshire, presenting himself as both the political reformer, an
appeal that could draw independent voters, and the more responsible
steward of the nation's foreign policy. Meanwhile, Forbes, with his
vast personal wealth and history here of running sharp-edged
advertisements, has been attacking Bush as not sufficiently
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unlike the challenge faced here by Bob Dole in 1996
when he was buffeted on one side by Patrick Buchanan, who ended up
winning the New Hampshire primary, and the other by Lamar
Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee who came close to
finishing ahead of Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said they considered McCain more of a threat,
both because he is seen as a more credible candidate and because
some voters continue to bear ill-will toward Forbes for the attacks
he used against Dole in 1996. Accordingly, Bush intends to be
particularly aggressive in trying to discredit McCain.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The front-runners are not the only ones facing some difficult
political calculations. Bradley is under increasing pressure to
show some assertiveness and to stand up to Gore, who has criticized
him with obvious effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has thus far resisted, for instance, Tuesday,
speaking for nearly 40 minutes without once mentioning the name of
his opponent. Even some supporters said they were concerned that in
his concession speech on Monday, Bradley seemed defeated and
unprepared for the kind of political scrapping that he might need
to do to win here this week.
</P>
<P>
   That may be good news for McCain. While he may not have gained
or lost anything from the Republican outcome in Iowa, he may have
been helped by Bradley's defeat, because some independents who were
inclined to vote for Bradley may now support McCain.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bush, despite his victory on Monday, finds himself
in the unlikely position of not being viewed as the front-runner _
at least in this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush comes into New Hampshire as an underdog,'' said Q.
Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster.

   NEW YORK _ Democrats in Albany, N.Y., plan to thwart an attempt
by the Republican State Committee to knock Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., off the presidential primary ballot in much of upstate New
York, injecting a new level of partisanship into what had largely
been a feud among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of Democratic legislative leaders, the
Democrats on the State Board of Elections are expected to vote
Wednesday to allow McCain to appear on the March 7 Republican
ballot in eight upstate congressional districts, officials said
Tuesday. The board has two Democrats and two Republicans, and it
takes three votes to bar McCain from the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to vote to leave him on the ballot,'' said
state Sen. Martin Connor of Brooklyn, the Democratic leader.
Connor, an election lawyer who is an informal adviser to the two
Democratic board members, Carol Berman and Evelyn Aquila, said they
could change their minds at the last moment, but he doubted they
would.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a presidential campaign, we ought to put all the
legitimate candidates on the ballot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other state Democratic leaders have expressed similar views. But
it is also clear that the Democrats have enjoyed watching the
increasingly rancorous dispute over the primary between McCain and
the state party, which is staunchly backing Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is suing separately in federal court to overturn the
election rules, has accused Gov. George Pataki and other party
leaders of using strong-arm tactics to deny voters more choices.
Pataki and the leaders have said the rules are reasonable and are
an impediment only if a candidate does not cultivate ties at the
grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' apparent decision marks an unusual break with
tradition at the state board, where both sides have tended to
respect the wishes of party leaders when it comes to primaries. But
in this case, leading Democrats, who are lining up behind Vice
President Al Gore, recognize that a contentious New York Republican
primary with McCain on the ballot could wound Bush, which might
make him more vulnerable in November if he is the eventual nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges by the Republican State Committee in the eight
upstate districts are part of a broad assault against the McCain
petitions across New York. In all, the party has sought to knock
McCain off the ballot in 16 of the state's 31 congressional
districts. It has so far succeeded in three _ two in New York City
and one in Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   The state board has no jurisdiction over those three districts,
where local boards of elections referee petition challenges. It has
jurisdiction over the petitions in any congressional district that
crosses county lines, like the eight upstate districts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans plan to appeal the state board's decision in court.
But the Democrats' stance draws more attention to what is often
criticized as a labyrinthine Republican primary system in New York,
where campaigns are required to gather signatures on petitions in
all 31 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, petitions and signatures can be disqualified
for technical reasons, and candidates can appear on the ballot in
some districts and not others.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, after a challenge by the state party, the New York City
Board of Elections disqualified McCain from the ballot in the 12th
congressional district in Brooklyn. In the last few days, it threw
out 74 signatures from the district. Tuesday, it invalidated two
more, putting McCain one below the minimum number needed. The
McCain campaign is planning a court appeal of the board's ruling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the board, said its members were
not available for comment. To block the petition challenges, the
Democrats could either abstain or vote no. Either way, the
Republicans would not have the three votes necessary to validate
the petition challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The board's four members are appointed by the governor on the
recommendation of Republican and Democratic party and legislative
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats in New York used to have a similar primary system,
but have made it somewhat easier for candidates to qualify for the
ballot in recent years, though their campaigns are still required
to gather signatures. Both major contenders this year, Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, will be on the ballot
across the state.

UH PROFESSOR USES `INGENUITY' TO KEEP RADIO SHOWS GOING FOR 12
YEARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (EDITORS: ``Lienhard'' is cq in first graf. ``Last week'' in graf
31 is cq as of Jan. 26.) 
 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Today, lotus petals and high tech.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine more unlikely openings to a radio program
than those that Dr. John Lienhard uses to start his nationally
syndicated ``The Engines of Our Ingenuity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we invent the helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet National Public Radio listeners from Alaska to Connecticut
and Armed Forces Radio listeners around the world tune in daily to
the four-minute show, knowing they will be entertained and
enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, necessity, invention and the Siege of Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   This month is the 12th anniversary of the University of
Houston-KUHF (88.7 FM)-produced show ``about the machines that make
our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity produced
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That specific-sounding motto embraces the broad range of human
experience and knowledge that Lienhard works into his polished
gems. Lienhard believes that the show's subjects _ technology,
culture and history _ are not compartmentalized studies separate
from our lives, but are the essence of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is culture,'' Lienhard says. ``That's something
I've said from the beginning. This program is about culture and
what is culture. Culture is an aggregate of what we make and do and
think. Technology is culture is technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech talk is enough to make the average person run for cover.
But far from being tedious, Lienhard's talks are mini-versions of
the kind of lectures you always hoped your best professor would
give, offering insight and surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no surprise, I don't think there can be
learning,'' he says in his familiar, thoughtful voice. ``Maybe
surprise is the core of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does a joke work?'' Then he deadpans: ``Paper clips are
the larval stage of coat hangers.'' When it gets a laugh, he smiles
with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Lienhard is an educator. He's been
teaching most of his life. But is ``The Engines of Our Ingenuity''
education or entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   ``You are certainly doing something that you hope will reach and
touch an audience,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I an entertainer when I go into the classroom? A large
proportion of my colleagues would say, `No, an educator is not an
entertainer.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet, you want to reach people. You want to expose what you
see as great beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lienhard, 69, looks more like a professor than a showman. Born
in St. Paul, Minn., the son of a newspaperman and a singer on early
radio, he had some early difficulties to overcome before being able
to teach, much less perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dyslexic,'' Lienhard says. ``Not only was I unable to
read, I was unable to talk. I had a terrible stutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I made things. I made model airplanes, I made treehouses, I
made guns. Anything I could think of. It was a world that grew up
spatially, visually, under my fingers. Yet I lived in a world that
valued the written and spoken word very highly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gradually learned to read and write. I got around the
stammer, though in moments of stress, it will still come to the
surface. Finally on this radio show, I managed to fuse that
essential tension that marked my whole early life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lienhard comes across as an intelligent, warm personality over
the airwaves. He's the same in person. He is, as any of his
listeners would assume, a delightful conversationalist:
inquisitive, imaginative, eager and able to discuss anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is, in the literal sense, a renaissance man,'' KUHF general
manager John Proffitt says. ``He knows more about more things than
anyone I've known in my life. He can take abstract and complex
topics and make them readily understandable. And enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, because Lienhard's program just flashed past
the 1,500-episode mark _ he now has done 1,515 to be exact _ with
no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   It's a milestone Lienhard never imagined when he began the show,
which first went on the air in 1988. Then, as now, he was a
University of Houston professor in thermal sciences. He happened to
sing in the choir at St. John the Divine Episcopal Church with
Proffitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the idea on a Friday night, wrote two episodes and ran
them past John. He liked them and said, `Let's go with it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned up in the dean's office on Monday. I had the
boilerplate (concept) pretty well designed. I had three episodes
written by then.''
</P>
<P>
   To Lienhard's dismay, Proffitt wanted five shows a week, which
was necessary to offer the series to other stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `I can't do this more than once a week,''' Lienhard
says. But he agreed to write 65 episodes. When the show went on the
air, it was soon picked up by other stations, and there was no
going back. Lienhard did 195 programs the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a 50-50 mix of reruns and new programs, Lienhard now
writes and records 130 shows annually. He estimates that he spends
about 10 hours on each program.
</P>
<P>
   Where does he get his ideas? Everywhere. A recent program (No.
1511) on the different levels of technology came about when a
fellow professor suggested that Lienhard read a magazine piece on
the self-cleaning properties of the lotus blossom. One idea led to
another until he had a show.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing the shows, Lienhard still teaches at UH _
this spring he will teach cultural history; in the fall, he'll
teach graduate thermodynamics. He is a popular public speaker but
has cut back to about 50 talks a year.
</P>
<P>
   And he maintains most of the show's Web site
(www.uh.edu/engines/jhlbio.htm), including answering e-mail. The
Web site, which has the full text of all 1,515 programs, received
almost 48,000 hits last week.
</P>
<P>
   Lienhard has had several collections of his shows published on
CD and tape, and this spring, his book ``The Engines of Our
Ingenuity _ An Engineer Looks at Technology and Culture'' will be
published by Oxford Press.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps him going? Well, he's a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm proud of anything, it is that I think I have shaped in
a lot of people's minds a new sense of history and how the
technological muse has worked through history,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that I am now writing programs differently because I
am writing for an audience I have helped to educate. And boy that
feels good.''

 Firm Hedges Its Bets With Strategic Alliances  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; These days it is not unheard of for individuals to make more in
the stock market than they do on the job. The same can be said for
some companies.
<P>
   Take Alliance Semiconductor Corp. of Santa Clara, for example.
N. Damodar ``Dan'' Reddy started the company in 1985 to manufacture
semiconductor memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been tough. Over the past four years, annual sales
have skidded to $48 million from $201 million. And over the past
three years, the company has racked up nearly $83 million in
combined operating losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Alliance Semiconductor, which trades for $16.875 a share,
still has a stock market value of $711.4 million, and Reddy and
some analysts think that is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The company just reported its first quarterly profit in nearly
four years. But Alliance's main lure is that its investments in
other public companies are worth $1.34 billion (or nearly $32 per
share).
</P>
<P>
   Even after paying corporate taxes on its investment gains,
Alliance would be worth around $850 million without giving any
value to its own operations. Plus it holds $21 million in cash and
has invested $20 million in 15 networking, communication and
Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for publicly traded companies to sell for
less than the value of their underlying assets. For example, real
estate investment trusts recently have been selling for an average
of about 20 percent below their net asset value. One reason for the
discount is that their holdings are buildings and land that might
be hard to sell in a hurry. But what's unusual in Alliance's case
is that it's selling at such a steep discount to its net asset or
book value, when its main assets are shares in other public
companies that are easy to track.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance Semiconductor founder and CEO Reddy, 62, didn't start
out thinking about making money on investments.
</P>
<P>
   Reddy moved from Hyderabad, India, to Fargo, N.D., to get a
master's degree in electrical engineering, and then went on to work
for a string of companies including Sylvania, RCA, Fairchild, Four
Phase and Synertek. In 1983 he was hired as CEO of a startup called
Modular Semiconductor before becoming an entrepreneur two years
later when he started Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to focus on producing high-performance, high-volume
memory chips. But rather than build his own manufacturing facility,
which today would cost about $2 billion, Reddy decided to invest in
the fabrication facilities of other companies in return for a piece
of the ownership and guaranteed use of the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance went though bankruptcy reorganization in the early
1990s and re-emerged as a public company in 1995. It raised $185
million from its stock sales and used most of the proceeds to
invest in three offshore semiconductor foundries.
</P>
<P>
   However, the market for memory chips is very cyclical, and
Alliance has been hurt by oversupply of and falling prices for its
random access memory devices. As it turned out, Alliance has fared
much better on its investments in production facilities than
actually making products. In the past year, the company has enjoyed
impressive returns on these investments:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Chartered Semiconductor.  &LR; In 1995, it invested $51.6 million
in Chartered Semiconductor in Singapore in return for an initial 4
percent ownership stake and a guaranteed 15 percent share of
production. Chartered went public last November, and Alliance's
current 1.7 percent stake is worth $198 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; United Semiconductor Corp. &LR;  In 1996, Alliance invested $57.5
million for a 20 percent ownership stake in United Semiconductor
Corp. in Taiwan and 25 percent share of the plant's capacity. Its
joint venture partners included United Microelectronics Corp.
(UMC), Taiwan's second largest semiconductor-maker. Last June, UMC
agreed to buy all of United Semiconductor and Alliance received
247.7 million shares of UMC, which are now worth $923.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; United Silicon Inc. &LR;  In 1997, Alliance invested $16.8 million
in this Taiwan silicon foundry for a 4 percent ownership stake and
3.7 percent of the plant's capacity. In this deal, Alliance also
partnered with UMC. Last June, UMC agreed to buy out Alliance's
interest in USI for 35.6 million UMC shares now worth $132.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Broadcom Corp. &LR;  In 1998, Alliance invested $2 million for an
initial 48 percent stake in Maverick Networks, a San Jose startup
that specialized in semiconductors with networking applications.
Last year, Broadcom acquired Maverick, and Alliance received
583,000 shares of Broadcom for its stake in Maverick. Even after
selling nearly half of the shares, Alliance holds 306,000 Broadcom
shares worth $86.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance also has invested $20 million in 15 networking and
communication startups and it plans to allocate as much as $115
million to new investments this year.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance can sell half of its UMC shares in June and the balance
within four years, but Reddy said he is was  &LR; not necessarily going
to unload because the semiconductor industry currently looks
bright.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance's networking and telecommunications equipment customers
include 3Com, Nortel, IBM, Alcatel, Siemens, Nokia and Toshiba, and
Reddy foresees ``worldwide shortages of production capacity.`` He
asks, ``Why sell at this point?''
</P>
<P>
   Alliance is hardly alone in forming its own internal venture
capital funds as a way to spot interesting technologies, forge
strategic alliances and make some money at the same time. Intel
Corp. has invested in 182 companies, according to VentureOne in San
Francisco. Cisco Systems has invested in 65 companies, including 42
in California. And CMGI has become a $28 billion holding company of
hot Internet investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see our investment in startups as a way to out-source
research and development spending,'' said Reddy.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few analysts follow Alliance, and their opinions are
split. Soundview Financial analyst Scott Randall has a ``hold'' on
Alliance. Although the company reported its first profit since
March 1996, he notes that since UMC acquired Alliance's ownership
stakes in two silicon foundries, Alliance will no longer be able to
report profits from these production plants.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Needham &AMP; Co. analyst Tad LaFountain has a
``strong buy'' on Alliance. He is not impressed by Alliance's
earnings so much as its holdings in Chartered, UMC and Broadcom.
Although these stocks have benefited from investor's euphoria for
high-tech issues and Alliance cannot quickly liquidate its position
in UMC even if it wanted to, LaFountain figures Alliance is worth
$25 a share, compared with to  &LR; its current $16.875.
</P>
<P>
   Another fan of Alliance is Rick Rich  &LR; Schottenfeld, general
partner of a hedge fund of the same name in New York. ``Most people
who invest in technology are interested in momentum and growth,''
said Schottenfeld. ``We look at value.''
</P>
<P>
   He figures that Alliance's holding in UMC alone are worth about
$11 a share. He also likes the fact that ``Alliance is trying to
turn into a company spawner. Investing in Alliance is like
investing in a little venture fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Another company that which  &LR; Schottenfeld likes that also is
investing in hot startups and planning to spin them off as public
companies is MRV Communications in Chatsworth (Los Angeles County).
The maker of fiber-optic components, which has become an incubator
for startups, has major stakes in about 10 networking and
telecommunications businesses
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than waiting for IPOs, I like to do venture investing
in the public markets and find companies where the pieces are worth
more than the whole,'' said Schottenfeld.

 Profits Jump 63%, But Chevron Still Plans Job Cuts  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Despite posting a 63-percent increase in quarterly earnings amid
sky-high oil prices, Chevron Corp. said it was proceeding with
plans to cut some 3,500 jobs, or almost 10 percent of its
workforce.
<P>
   ``We're starting 2000 in a much different environment than we
started 1999,'' said Dawn Soper-Lyon, a Chevron spokeswoman. ``But
the price of oil fluctuates and we use a conservative estimate
about the long-term price.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco oil giant reported fourth-quarter profit of
$819 million ($1.24 a share), compared with $503 million (76 cents)
a year earlier. The latest results were a penny-per-share higher
than analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   However, investors were looking for Chevron to do even better,
and the company's stock dipped 25 cents yesterday to close at
$88.56.
</P>
<P>
   Dave O'Reilly, Chevron's chief executive, said in a statement
that the firm's solid performance is attributable to ``a rebound in
crude oil prices that began last spring.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries have resulted in oil prices soaring to their
highest level in almost nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Chevron said it is moving ahead with plans to cut $500
million from the company's cost structure. These plans will include
laying off approximately 3,500 workers by mid-2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone in the industry thinks current oil prices
are sustainable,'' said Matthew Warburton, an analyst at Warburg
Dillon Read in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As rival Exxon Mobil benefits from the merger of Exxon Corp. and
Mobil Corp., he said Chevron must look within for cost savings to
remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil yesterday reported a 34-percent increase in
quarterly earnings _ its first results since the merged company
came into being last November. Its stock slid 19 cents to $84.06.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Chevron will see strong earnings this year,''
Warburton predicted. ``Longer term, we think they'll be below
sector growth because of a lack of merger synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron said its fourth-quarter revenue climbed 50 percent to
$10.98 billion from $7.28 billion a year ago. Crude prices nearly
doubled in the interval to about $24.50 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron said higher raw material costs, coupled with snafus at
its Richmond refinery, caused U.S. refining earnings to fall 55
percent to $73 million. The company posted a loss of $79 million on
its international refining operations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, profit from oil exploration more than doubled
to $840 million.

   Direct Hit Chairman Gary Culliss said Direct Hit had been
planning to premiere debut  &LR; a package of its own for corporate Web
pages before the acquisition was announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Culliss and Mike Cassidy said they founded Direct Hit with the
intention of eventually selling it. However, in December the
Natick, Mass., company filed for an initial public stock offering,
to be underwritten by Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that what the Ask Jeeves folks had accomplished
would fit quite nicely with our plans,'' Culliss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really strategic acquisition for (Ask Jeeves) as it
takes them a step ahead of the competition in terms of searches
over the Web,'' said Ben Rose, an analyst at Adams Harkness and
Hill, a Boston, Mass., investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves expects $8 million to $10 million in additional
revenue over the next year from Direct Hit. Much of that money will
come from the fees Direct Hit will get from other search engines,
some of which are Ask Jeeves competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves' two consumer Web sites combined ranked 29th in
popularity among all Web sites in December, according to the
Internet ranking firm Media Metrix. Direct Hit's Web page,
www.directhit.com, ranked 47th, but its results are used on the
Microsoft Network, ranked third, and other popular sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves' stock closed up $5 at $104, and moved as high as
$117.50 in after-hours trading. The Emeryville company went public
in July at $14 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves will issue 5.12 million unregistered shares to
acquire Direct Hit. Its acquisition is expected to be completed
during the first quarter of 2000.

 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   Delinquents Can Cut an IRS Deal 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: My business is delinquent on paying some taxes and I am
interested in strategies for negotiating with the IRS.
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The kinder, gentler Internal Revenue Service has information on
reaching installment agreements and has a streamlined process if
your total tax obligations are $25,000 or less. (The amount was
increased from $10,000 last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Check out www.irs.gov Web site or ask for IRS Form 9465. It
discusses how to execute an installment agreement, including
allowances for housing, auto and other living expenses, which vary
according to where you live.
</P>
<P>
   If you can pay off the amount owed within five years, the IRS is
more flexible in what it will allow for living expenses, according
to Kip Dellinger, a CPA with the Los Angeles firm Duitchcq &LR; 
Franklin &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger also is co-author of ``Offer in Compromise Process:
Insights and Strategy'' (CCH Inc., $45). This book could be useful
if you want to take the next step and negotiate an ``offer in
compromise'' with the IRS to settle your delinquent payments.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the IRS to give you  &LR; a break usually requires
circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control, such as a medical
crisis. ``It's not good enough to say you simply spent the money
and don't have it,'' Dellinger says.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Manual 5.8 spells out all the rules for offers
in compromise. Dellinger's book also goes through the process and
has the appropriate forms.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful of some firms that specialize in helping delinquent
taxpayers work out deals with the IRS. Dellinger says they often
charge a few hundred dollars to prepare an offer in compromise that
they know won't be accepted by the IRS. If you owe substantial back
taxes, you probably should consult a qualified CPA or attorney.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Seeking VCs
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: Recently, a venture capitalist partner and I were in the
final stages of acquiring a small publishing company
(nonelectronic) but he had to pull out because of problems with
other investments.
</P>
<P>
   I have been through lots of material on the Web as well as the
business section of the library and have spoken to many VCs and
investment bankers. Not surprisingly, my deal is too small ($1.5
million), too traditional and uncomplicated (no dot-com, no
mezzanine, no bio-tech) to interest those I spoke to so far. How
can I find an adviser who knows the financial community well enough
to suggest some suitable partners?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR; a  &LR; A: The simple truth is that getting venture capital for a very
small, low-tech business is almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   CapitalKey Advisors, an Internet investment bank that counsels
small companies on getting private equity, reports that venture
capital firms invest in only about 1out of every 25 prospects. Some
local VCs say the odds are more like 1 in a 100.
</P>
<P>
   You might check out CapitalKey (www.capitalkey.com), which
tracks more than 3,000 venture capital and private equity funds'
investing criteria as well as their current and past investments.
The firm, which is based in New York, recently set up an office in
Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Managing partner Steve Turner thinks you might have better luck
approaching someone who has deep interest rather than just deep
pockets. Perhaps someone who already owns or has invested in a
publishing business ``might want to add titles, lower printing
costs or gain marketing synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Because your deal is both small and has no sexy Internet angle,
it might be outside the realm of traditional venture capital
investors, says Len Batterson, CEO of vcapital.com, which links
investors with entrepreneurs. If you haven't done so already, he
suggests that you seek advice from other businesses of similar size
as well as accountants, lawyers and loan officers that have
serviced small publishing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check out the various matchmaking services on the
Internet that help introduce entrepreneurs to angel investors.
These include vcapital.com, garage.com, the U.S. Small Business
Administration's Angel Capital Electronic Network
(https://ace-net.sr.unh.edu/pub) and the Angel Law Forum of San
Francisco's Niesar &AMP; Diamond law firm (www.ndlaw.com).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Women's Biz Center
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Entrepreneurship Center in San Francisco will launch
today a Women's Business Center in partnership with the U.S. Small
Business Administration. It will provide classes in business
development, peer support groups, business incubation and other
resources to entrepreneurial Bay Area women.

SURPRISE SNOWSTORM PARALYZES MUCH OF EAST COAST, INCLUDING
CAPITAL

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A potent winter storm stunned much of the East
Coast on Tuesday, crimping all but emergency government services
and entirely shutting down the capital's federal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The swift, dense storm roared north overnight to New England
from the Carolinas after burying Raleigh in well over a foot of
snow as the state's National Guard manned shovels to face a state
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Brandishing wind gusts of 40 miles per hour and burying the most
stricken areas in the Carolinas in 20 inches of snow, the storm's
severity took weather forecasters by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, businesses and airports were closed or severely
hampered in the thick swath of the storm. It stopped Philadelphia's
new mayor, John Street, from delivering his first budget address as
he took to the streets to deal instead with his first snow
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware legislative session was canceled, while Gov. James
B. Hunt of North Carolina declared a general emergency from snow
accumulations of more than 18 inches in the worst hit areas. ``This
is a dangerous storm and should be treated as such,'' he warned as
utility workers described hurricane-like damage in the storm's
wake.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, close to 200 motorists had to be rescued from
snowdrifts that paralyzed interstate highways. More than 200,000
homes were reported without power along the border of the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful, but it took us by surprise,'' said Karen
Duncan in York County, S.C., speaking from her new home that was
left in 50-degree heat after 10 inches of snow socked in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of ad hoc measures, a visiting Chinese military
delegation in Washington resorted to taking the Metro subway rather
than a motorcade to reach a high-level meeting with officials at
the Pentagon in Virginia. In South Carolina, children freed from
school in the snow-encrusted Midlands improvised sleds from the
boogy boards that they normally ply at the resort area's
beachfronts.
</P>
<P>
   LaGuardia Airport in New York closed, as did Reagan National
Airport across the Potomac River from Washington and airports in
Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore. At the Raleigh-Durham
International Airport, runways were under 17 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the Eastern Seaboard was paralyzed, the New York
City metropolitan area managed to escape the worst of the storm.
But more snow fell in the city than had been predicted: New York
City officials were told to expect only 1 to 3 inches, but up to 6
inches fell in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the extra measure of snow, thousands decided to spend the
day at home. There were 140,000 fewer commuters than normal by bus
or train between New Jersey and New York City. ``Everyone knows
that everyone else is home, so everyone has been e-mailing each
other just to check in and say hi,'' said Joan Gilbert, a public
relations consultant in Ossining, in Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, though, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani offered an upbeat
report, detailing the progress at clearing city streets, rattling
off statistics about the number of plows and salt trucks, even
offering reports on flight delays at Kennedy Airport and the lower
speed limit imposed on the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Snowbound and short of bureaucrats, the federal government was
declared closed in Washington on Tuesday morning as the capital
hardened into an icy still-life, out of bounds to all but the
hardiest pedestrians and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate all the white stuff since we don't have it,''
declared Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, speaking as a delighted
but cautious Mississippian. He yielded to the intense storm and cut
off the government's legislative deliberations soon after the
executive branch shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The executive branch had first attempted a partial work day
under the ``liberal leave'' option that lets individual workers try
to get to work or not. But this was soon abandoned in favor of an
outright shutdown, as the driving snows intensified after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   More than a foot of snow was measured in outlying suburbs where
many of the 250,000 federal workers live. The snow shutdown, the
first in four years, cost an estimated $60 million in lost labor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Overnight predictions had left the city expecting the storm to
be less intense and later in arriving than it proved to be; the
capital awoke to deep drifts and impassable roads. ``Everybody
involved in this would have preferred a longer lead time,''
conceded Dr. Louis Uccellini, director of the National Center for
Environmental Prediction, as the capital shifted to postmortem
critiques even before the snows ceased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, work went forward on President Clinton's
final State of the Union address to be delivered Thursday. There
was play, too, when Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, could
not resist the drifts outside the West Wing and divided the staff
for a snowball fight.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours of steadily falling snow enforced a mood of
small-town serenity upon the capital, exemplified at the Senate
barbershop where two barbers showed up. They quietly snipped away,
talking about the weather with a few equally adventurous customers.
``Nobody told me not to work,'' one barber explained, speaking on
the condition of anonymity that seems to mark even the most
atypical business day at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The only other activity in sight was a news media stakeout
outside room 410 in the Cannon House office building. Reporters
slouched in a corridor clot of wintry mufti, awaiting the visiting
Cuban grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez, the refugee schoolboy at the
heart of the custody struggle raging between Havana and Miami's
Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't touch the snow, we only walked on it,'' one of the
grandmothers gently replied when the news conference, like most
discussions here Tuesday, finally got around to asking about the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked of it at a news conference at which he pledged
federal aid for the buried areas. ``I'm glad you all got here,'' he
told reporters, beaming as he added, ``I thought school was
canceled today.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House, a few tourists bucked the slanting snow
and stood on the base of the security fence to get a better look at
the white-on-white tableau. Officer Stephanie Clark of the U.S.
Park Police shooed them off the fence, then discovered her patrol
car was stuck in a curbside snowbank. ``This is one day where it's
not great to be a police officer,'' she muttered, fetching a shovel
from the trunk and digging the car out.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics continued as usual in snow-inured New
Hampshire as the primary contenders darted about with the help of
blade plows and political spinners. But in South Carolina, where
the contending is usually balmier, the deep snow stopped Elizabeth
Dole's rounds on behalf of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Blustery, icy snow lashed the capital Mall at midday when
Derrick Wooley, from Monterey, La., talked three of his friends
into venturing forth with him to experience what he exulted in
describing as the very first snowfall of his life. ``I love it,''
he said, chewing on some snow. ``Well, I find it makes me thirsty
stomping around in it,'' explained Wooley, a new arrival in town
who is a legislative intern at the American Association of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a hill,'' said his friend, Brian Shaifer, an
intern with the Organization of American States from Natchez,
Miss., another Southerner looking to attempt his very first
sledding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to talk them out of it,'' said Marisa Collins as
the group headed toward the meager slope of Capitol Hill,
brandishing slices of cardboard to serve as sleds. ``I'm from New
York; I've seen this stuff before.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NAVRATILOVA STILL GOES OWN WAY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was just a couple of months ago that Martina Navratilova
glanced at her flight instructor's seat and was hit with the
stunning realization that it was empty. It was too late to back
out, though. She was at 8,000 feet, flying solo again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely petrified, like my last Wimbledon, when I was
stone-faced before the match,'' she said. ``But a lot of it was the
same, the concentration and the focus, forcing myself to stay in
the now, get over the fear.''
</P>
<P>
   She made four successful landings that day in Aspen, secured her
pilot's license, the way she earned her way into the International
Tennis Hall of Fame. She made it, first-year eligible, by staying
true to herself, grounded in belief that she could soar.
</P>
<P>
   This emotionally vulnerable woman who ran from the Communists
and came out of the closet and hard to the net was seldom
confronted with an issue she did not have a deft volley for. They
do not make professional athletes much like Navratilova anymore.
They do not grow risk takers. Our superstars are now incorrigibly
centrist, corporate and careful.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Navratilova said Tuesday at a Manhattan news conference to
announce the Hall of Fame's class of 2000, ``Coached to not offend
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, she was uncoachable, costing herself millions in
endorsements over a career that netted 18 Grand Slam singles titles
and a record 1,438 singles match victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave it a thought,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This somehow played out to her advantage, as she established her
legacy with conviction. People always knew who she was, what she
stood for. She made a lasting impression in more than one court, as
86-year-old Robert Kelleher, a fellow inductee, came to report.
</P>
<P>
   As a tennis administrator, Kelleher was something of an activist
himself, instrumental in clearing the way for Open tennis in 1968.
He went on to become a U.S. district court judge in Los Angeles.
Tuesday, he read a note for Navratilova from one of his colleagues,
Terry Hatter, who happened to be the chief justice who swore
Navratilova in as a U.S. citizen on July 21, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' Hatter wrote. ``It worked.''
</P>
<P>
   From the time she was that chubby and frightened Czech teen-ager
who explained her defection to Howard Cosell at the 1976 U.S. Open
in Forest Hills, she steered through the turbulence of isolation.
She conquered her very visible doubts and fears. She landed the
plane. It all worked out, except for that last Wimbledon final
against Conchita Martinez in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King, one of her coaches, coined the aforementioned
phrase _ stay in the now _ for Navratilova that summer. The fading
and retiring legend listened intently, and stormed to the final.
Her focus was waning, however. King recalled Tuesday how
Navratilova blanked out on the prematch advice to cover Martinez's
backhand cross-court pass. She lost the match, but won more hearts.
On her way out, she bent down and plucked a few blades of grass
from tennis' most hallowed turf. She keeps them with more expensive
but less valuable jewels, in a box, brown and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova will be enshrined next summer in Newport, R.I.,
along with Kelleher and Malcolm Anderson, a 1950's Australian star.
She laughed when asked if she would write an induction speech
longer than the state of address given last summer by another
emotional southpaw, John McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten minutes, and I'm off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova could always say a lot in a relatively short period.
She took a few moments Tuesday to rebuke those Grand Slam
tournaments, apart from the U.S. Open, that do not pay equal prize
money to women. She railed against the mistreatment of animals, a
cause she holds near and dear. Then she could not resist a take on
America's favorite madman in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of John Rocker, and now he's a household name,''
she said. ``He's either a bigot and a racist or a very stupid man,
but he doesn't need a psychologist. I'm sure he'll cash in. They'll
always forgive a man faster than a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially a woman who doesn't fit the Madison Avenue mold.
Tuesday, Navratilova said that of all the current women's players,
she most enjoys the cunning style of her namesake, Martina Hingis.
This was ironic, in that Hingis' stated views on lesbianism have
fallen far short of enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova at that moment was talking tennis, though, and while
on the subject, she lamented the dearth of serve-and-volley play in
this era of baseline sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players mature earlier,'' she said. ``And that's where
they stay, because it's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by their parents, polished by their agents, they play it
that way, on court and off. Navratilova always had her own healthy
entourage of advisers and friends, but history will maintain that
all she ever wanted from them was a thumbs-up, a green light, a
sign that the runway was still as clear as the day she defected
from home.
</P>
<P>
   Stay in the now, they told her. Challenge the body. Go to the
net. Fly the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards will outweigh the risk. &QL;

2ND DIPLOMAT IS SUGGESTED FOR ARMS POST 
</HEADLINE>

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Leading members of the Security Council,
deadlocked over the nomination of a new chief arms inspector for
Iraq, have apparently decided to ask Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to withdraw the name of Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat, and offer
the job to another Swedish disarmament expert, Hans Blix.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the decision could be announced within a day or
two, although the Security Council has not yet acted in any formal
way and the plan could be upset.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, 72, was the director-general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, a U.N. organization in Vienna, Austria, from 1981 to
1997. During that period he became a contentious figure among arms
control experts because the agency, which regularly inspected Iraqi
nuclear programs and fuel stockpiles, was accused of failing to
detect a secret weapons program that did not come to light until
after the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has since been considerably strengthened, diplomats
say, because nations that make up its governing board realized that
it had not been given enough power to conduct more intrusive
searches. Agency inspectors who missed the bomb project had in fact
been limited to looking at material Iraq had declared under the
1968 nonproliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Those materials covered by the 1968 treaty, including natural
and low-enriched uranium, still remaining in Iraq were inspected by
the agency this week.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 war, inspectors learned in Iraq that a country
could run a parallel bomb program completely out of sight while
fulfilling all the obligations associated with its peaceful nuclear
projects.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, the atomic agency had uncovered another
secret program in North Korea. Since 1994, when an agreement was
signed with the North Koreans to phase out that program in return
for foreign investment in peaceful reactors, the agency has had
inspectors permanently stationed in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, an expert in international and constitutional law, had
some differences with the U.N. Special Commission, UNSCOM, which
was created after the 1991 war to destroy Iraq's prohibited
biological and chemical weapons and missile systems, and the means
to make them.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM became what diplomats call the senior partner in the Iraq
inspection programs, with the atomic energy agency, which inspected
nuclear facilities, playing a secondary role. Ekeus was UNSCOM's
executive chairman for much of that time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the friction between UNSCOM and the atomic energy agency
_ and between Blix and Ekeus _ was the suggestion Blix made before
his retirement that at some point any inspection commission would
have to decide that it had found all it could find in prohibited
weapons and materials and could then move to long-term but rigorous
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM, on the other hand, was more determined under both Ekeus
and his successor, Richard Butler, to pursue all leads until
virtually every question was answered and every missing item found
or accounted for. The differences were heightened by the fact that
the atomic energy agency was a U.N. body staffed by organization
employees _ ``bureaucrats,'' in the eyes of UNSCOM's more
independent inspectors lent by governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis consistently trumpeted these differences to the
detriment of UNSCOM. If Iraq's past praise for the atomic energy
agency is any guide, the government of President Saddam Hussein
will have to think of new reasons for rejecting Blix as it rejected
the return of Ekeus.
</P>
<P>
   France, Russia and to some extent China opposed Ekeus' return.
Tuesday night, diplomats said that those three, and the United
States and Britain _ all five council members with vetos _ were
close to a formal agreement on Blix.

<P>
   Broadway actress.'' Sounds almost quaint, doesn't it? A career
better suited to another era, a job like ``footman'' or
``linotypist,'' that once held a secure position in the working
world and now seems a rather dubious path to gainful employment.
</P>
<P>
   With the slow decline of the Broadway play, and the dearth of
musical roles for women over 50, a middle-aged actress expecting to
find steady, varying work on Broadway might be a candidate for some
sort of professional intervention.
</P>
<P>
   So what is to be made of the unconventional trajectory of Blair
Brown, the erstwhile star of television sitcoms (``The Days and
Nights of Molly Dodd'') and of movies (``Altered States'') who has
reinvented herself as, gulp, a Broadway actress?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she scored a critical triumph in ``Cabaret,''
replacing Mary Louise Wilson as the dowdy landlady, Fraulein
Schneider, and surprising audiences with the suppleness of her
voice. This month, she moved back to Broadway in another singing
role as Gretta Conroy, the nostalgic wife in Richard Nelson and
Shaun Davey's musical adaptation of ``The Dead,'' the story by
James Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly as quickly as you can say ``Equity contract,'' she is
heading into rehearsals for ``Copenhagen,'' Michael Frayn's
cerebral London play about German and Danish nuclear physicists
that opens on Broadway on April 11.
</P>
<P>
   So rare is Ms. Brown's theatrical long run that it is difficult
to recall the last time a major American actress hopped from a lead
role in a new musical to a new play in a single Broadway season.
And that she has accomplished it in such dramatic hard times makes
it all the more unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more aware of this than the classically trained Ms.
Brown, who has appeared on the stage from time to time in notable
productions, like the Public Theater's ``Threepenny Opera'' with
Raul Julia in 1976 and David Hare's controversially short-lived
``Secret Rapture'' on Broadway in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm hitting my stride,'' she said with a laugh the
other day in her Manhattan apartment. ``You start to feel richer
and richer, and you know you have more and more to give.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until her role in Tom Stoppard's ``Arcadia'' at
Lincoln Center Theater in 1995 that she settled into a serious
stage career, a return that has earned her increasingly admiring
notices. Of her work in ``Cabaret,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New
York Times that, in her ``beautifully simple, direct and rich
performance'' she discovered ``shades of feeling that are entirely
new to this production.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her work on Broadway, Ms. Brown has been taking
some theatrical risks farther afield, playing, for example,
Marguerite Gautier last summer in a highly praised revival of
Tennessee Williams' ``Camino Real'' at the Williamstown Theater
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the last year and a half has seen doors flying open,''
said Ms. Brown, who is forthright in a playful sort of way when
supplying her age _ ``the same as the president's'' (he is 53).
``It's a time in your life when you figure you're about to be
tossed, when you think, God, I feel doors closing just when I feel
as if I'm coming into my prime.''
</P>
<P>
   Doors seem to have swung wildly in the career of Ms. Brown, who
remains best known for the four years she spent in the late 1980s
and early '90s playing lovable, procastinating Molly on the NBC
series that became a cult hit when it shifted to Lifetime on cable.
Before that, though, came an active movie career, and the prospect
of a level of stardom that she never quite achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was right after Blythe,'' as in Danner, is how Ms. Brown
describes herself on the producers' flow chart of actresses who
went through marquee moments in Hollywood before Hollywood moved on
to the next young actress.
</P>
<P>
   But as Ms. Brown acknowledges, she may not have been
sufficiently hungry, or perhaps not enough of a specific type, to
sustain a top-tier movie presence in the 1980s. ``You're sort of on
every list, which means you're sort of on no list,'' she said,
sipping English tea in the living room of the brownstone apartment
that she shares with her son, Robert, 17.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, who never married, had Robert with the actor
Richard Jordan, who died of a brain tumor a few years ago. It was
partly because of her desire to bring up her son in New York City
that the focus of her career shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more to her life than show business,'' said
Gregory Mosher, the former artistic director of Lincoln Center
Theater and one of the producers of ``The Dead.'' Mosher, who has
known Ms. Brown for 20 years, said politics has always been a
passion they shared: he remembered bumping into her in New
Hampshire in 1992, when on the spur of the moment she had bundled
up Robert and gone to campaign for Bill Clinton in the Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took responsibility for her life and her career,'' Mosher
added. ``And I have never heard her say a mean thing about anyone,
well, maybe not never, but she's always funny when she does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she is being cast regularly, she views the theater as
her natural domain. ``I do think there are different kinds of
actors,'' she said. ``Jennifer Jason Leigh'' _ with whom she
appeared in ``Cabaret'' _ ``loved doing a play, but she adores
doing movies, she lives and breathes them.'' Ms. Brown, on the
other hand, said she never felt that burning need.
</P>
<P>
   Her initial goal was the stage. She attended the National
Theater School of Canada after graduating from the Madeira School
in the Washington suburbs where she grew up, and spent several
years appearing in classical theater in Canada, including, at the
age of 21, a Shakespeare Festival season in Stratford, Ontario,
where she played bit parts in ``The School for Scandal'' and ``The
Merchant of Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot, but I was a terrible ingenue,'' Ms. Brown
said. ``It was really torture, a really unhappy company. And it
didn't matter how bad they were, but they always hired directors
with English accents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown does not go in much for deep analysis of her acting
ability. That is partly because she is highly self-critical. In
fact, she had such difficulty seeing herself on the screen that she
could not face watching the daily rushes on a movie set. ``I see
someone else,'' she said. ``I see me in an idealized form that
isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Theater, of course, offers other worries, but even when she was
busiest with film work, she would think of returning to the stage.
She was asked, for example, to try out to replace Bernadette Peters
in the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway production of ``Sunday in
the Park With George.'' But, she said, ``I didn't have the nerve to
audition for it.''
</P>
<P>
   What she has discovered in more recent years is a new
fearlessness when it comes to singing for a job, as well as an
appreciation for what happens to a dramatic performance in a long
stage run: ``You're like a Clydesdale by the end _ stronger and
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   As an actress, Ms. Brown has often impressed smart people in the
theater, most famously the British playwright David Hare, with whom
she was romantically involved for several years. In a 1989
television interview recently broadcast again in Britain, Hare
declared, ``The only actress I've written for is Blair Brown.''
(Years later, he would write ``Amy's View'' for Judi Dench.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With Blair,'' he added, ``for whom I wrote `The Secret
Rapture' and for whom I wrote `Strapless,' I have responded to
something in her which is a sense of practical, everyday goodness
in her performances.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown speaks a bit wistfully of Hare, with whom, she said,
she is no longer in contact: ``I miss his friendship,'' she said,
and with that, made it clear that she would say no more on the
subject. But if Hare sensed something dependably generous in her
earlier work, then that attribute has been transformed into
something deeper now, an evolution that can be detected in the
progressively more complex stage performances she has been
providing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arcadia'' was clearly just a re-entry point; her turn as
Hannah Jarvis, a landscape historian, was a bit stiff and did not
seem an ideal fit. By ``Cabaret,'' though, last spring, she seemed
more comfortable. She brought a tragic element to Fraulein
Schneider, a lonely German woman who ultimately rejects a Jewish
suitor out of a kind of cowardice: Fraulein Schneider cannot face
the brutal consequences of marrying a Jew in Nazi Germany. There
was, all over Ms. Brown's portrayal, an aura of mournful
foreknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has never minded reading for a part in a play, a
musical audition was always more intimidating. ``It seemed so tough
and cutthroat,'' she said. When, however, her agent was asked a
year and a half ago, ``Does Blair sing?'' and then called her and
asked, ``Do you sing?'' Ms. Brown got up the nerve to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the music,'' she said, about John Kander and Fred Ebb's
``Cabaret,'' ``and I went and sat in my car and learned the songs
from the CD.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, a bit of a shock to see the woman who played
perky Molly Dodd wearing a mask of fear and longing onstage. And
now again, in ``The Dead,'' she is at the emotional core of a large
ensemble piece, playing a wife in late-1890s Ireland whose memory
of an innocent love from long ago exposes a tender element of
misunderstanding in her marriage to Gabriel Conroy, portrayed by
Christopher Walken. The memory is jogged at a Dublin Christmas
party when she takes notice of a young man in a series of glances
that are misinterpreted by her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's tapped into the sensuality,'' said the
playwright, Nelson, who took over the direction during rehearsals
before the opening in the fall at Playwrights Horizons. ``It's
about someone who is middle-aged who taps into a youthful sexual
passion. She has to be sexy, which she can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, who talks easily on a range of subjects, from the
filmic style of Ken Russell (who directed her in ``Altered
States'') to the political prospects of Hillary Clinton, says that
a life in the theater gives her room for a life outside the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like living in my own house,'' she said. ``When you are in a
movie, it's you and the movie.'' But she's also under no illusion
that her streak couldn't come to a halt after ``Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good timing,'' she said. ``I could have come in
two years later, and none of these things would have happened. In
this business, you're always waiting for the ax to fall.''

HOW LONG, IS TOO LONG?

 (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many operas, including great ones, are routinely criticized for
being too long. Puccini's ``Tosca,'' a miracle of dramatic
streamlining, is conceded to be just right, but ``Madama
Butterfly,'' which is not that much longer, is thought to have dead
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's ``Siegfried'' is way too long, detractors say, and even
many partisans concede as much, not to mention tenors who take on
the exhausting title role, the most demanding in opera. Yet
``Goetterdaemmerung,'' an even longer work, is generally felt to be
gripping theater.
</P>
<P>
   The question came up again recently in the critical debate over
John Harbison's ``Great Gatsby,'' which just finished its premiere
run at the Metropolitan Opera. Those who admired the work were
taken with the music itself, which at its best revealed Harbison's
imagination, ingenuity, sense of color, keen ear for pungent
harmony and skill at evoking jazz and pop music of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The severest critics thought the score faceless and boring.
Others found it an honorable effort but lacking in the kind of
vitality and musical profile that can create character and propel
action. Essentially, they felt, the opera was too draggy, too long.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, whether a musical work is an appropriate length
would seem to be a completely subjective judgment, especially in
concert music. Schumann, an astute critic, famously referred to the
``heavenly lengths'' of Schubert's great chamber works and piano
sonatas. Was he being a touch facetious? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But what he probably meant was that Schubert's concert works
inhabited some cosmic realm where normal time frames are
irrelevant. Still, those who acknowledge the ethereal beauties of,
say, Schubert's late String Quartet in G yet fault the work for its
run-on use of sonata form certainly have a point.
</P>
<P>
   With opera, on the other hand, there are more objective ways to
evaluate whether a score rambles on. Operas are music theater
works, after all, and opera composers from Monteverdi to William
Bolcom have faced the same issues with regard to dramatic pacing
and musical content: when to prod the action along, when to let a
moment linger, when to animate some dialogue or prolong it
lyrically, when to let song alone convey the story, when to diffuse
dramatic intensity with a snappy dance or a good gag.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway-musical composers contend with these questions, too,
but opera relies on music to do a lot of dramatic heavy lifting.
And historically, it has taken audiences time to adjust to a
composer's dramatic sense. Debussy's astonishing ``Pelleas et
Melisande'' struck many of the composer's uncomprehending
contemporaries as musically radical and dramatically inert.
</P>
<P>
   So length and pacing remain, finally, subjective calls. It's
interesting, though, to consider examples of long operas that do
not seem so in the opera house, and shorter operas that can make
for a ponderous evening if you are not on the same wavelength as
the composer.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's last opera, ``Parsifal,'' contains about four and a
quarter hours of music. Add two generous intermissions, and you
have an evening of almost six hours. But ``Parsifal'' is like a
medieval mystery play, a legend of spiritual suffering and
religious redemption. If you can let the transfixing music take you
to this metaphysical sphere, you adjust to Wagner time, and the
opera not only proves riveting but also seems the length it must
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg,'' Wagner's only comic opera,
is almost exactly the same length as ``Parsifal.'' Yet this story
of a guild of mastersingers in the medieval German city, simple
tradesmen by profession but artists by passion, moves with the
Wagnerian equivalent of superb comic timing. I can think of only
one thing I would cut, and not because of the time it adds.
</P>
<P>
   In Act II, the cobbler Hans Sachs, the most respected
mastersinger, helps the upstart knight Walther write a song for the
annual contest, in which the prize includes the hand of Pogner the
goldsmith's lovely daughter, Eva. We hear the Prize Song as it is
constructed, phrase by phrase. Later in the act, Walther sees Eva
and, overcome, sings his song for her straight through.
</P>
<P>
   This somewhat spoils the effect of the song in the third act,
where it should come upon Eva, and the mastersingers who are
judging the contest, as a revelation. You could argue that the
first performance is private and the second, more lavishly
orchestrated one is public. My guess is that Wagner knew he had a
hit tune here and could not help milking it.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting Wagner, as was once commonly done, is a risky
proposition. His operatic structures are so deliberately conceived
that cutting out bits here and there disrupts the flow and can
actually make the operas seem longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Der Rosenkavalier,'' Richard Strauss' most popular opera,
which just returned to the Met with a cast headed by Susan Graham
and Renee Fleming, runs (minus two intermissions) about 3 hours 10
minutes and includes some of the most beautiful moments in all of
music. Yet as a stage work and a musical score, the opera drags; it
could easily lose a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   The intimate scenes between the married, middle-aged Marschallin
and the 17-year-old Count Octavian, with whom she is having an
affair that she knows will end, are musically glorious and deeply
affecting. But the scenes with the oafish Baron Ochs are filled
with galumphing Germanic humor. Toward the end of the last act,
after a plot to expose the Baron's lechery succeeds, it seems to
take forever to get the humiliated man off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pelleas et Melisande,'' which returns to the Met in April, is
an interesting case. Debussy hewed closely to Maeterlinck's
Symbolist play about a fatefully attracted young couple in an
imaginary kingdom. The music is subdued, static, self-contained. By
every common standard of musical drama, the score, running about 2
hours 45 minutes, is too long and placid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I am hardly the only listener who finds it mesmerizing.
Debussy's music is powerfully ambiguous: are the opening soft, slow
parallel chords in the orchestra ethereal or erotic? Every nonevent
in the opera seems charged with implications. Because Debussy keeps
you guessing, you are engrossed. But admittedly, some people find
the work ponderous.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil Thomson's ``Lord Byron,'' his third and last opera, is
also revealing in terms of length and pacing. It was commissioned
by the Met, and Thomson assumed that the company wanted something
suitably grand. So he expanded his original conception, devised
with the librettist Jack Larson, to Met proportions, adding a large
chorus, a children's chorus and even, later on, a ballet (his
String Quartet No. 2, orchestrated).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the Met never produced ``Lord Byron,'' which received its
premiere at the Juilliard School in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The production overwhelmed the intimate Juilliard Theater. The
reviews were mixed. Some were quite favorable. Others, especially
Harold Schonberg's influential piece in The New York Times, were
aggressively negative. Thomson, crushed, was seized with the idea
that its two-hour length was the problem. He cut the score before
it was published. When a concert performance was arranged in 1985,
he cut it still more, lopping nearly 30 minutes from the original
work and reducing its three acts to two.
</P>
<P>
   The trims just made matters worse. ``Lord Byron'' in its
original form is not too long. The challenge of the work is its
unusual dramatic perspective. The story concerns the friends and
relatives of the famous poet who, after his death, are trying to
have him admitted to Poet's Corner at Westminster Abbey. Byron has
left behind a torrid memoir. Should it be made public or destroyed?
</P>
<P>
   As his wife, sister, publisher and friends read chapters, events
from Byron's life are presented rather like flashbacks. Larson
briefly considered calling the opera ``About Byron,'' and although
the phrase would have made a terrible title, it describes the
nature of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, of course, may simply be that as a composer, Thomson
was not Debussy or Wagner. But the score has a striking musical and
verbal clarity. ``Lord Byron'' is a witty, conversational, at times
intense, and immensely literate opera. Cutting the score diminishes
it.
</P>
<P>
   Harbison might consider the lesson of ``Lord Byron'' as he
contemplates alterations to ``The Great Gatsby,'' which will be
presented by the Lyric Opera of Chicago next season and eventually
return to the Met. I find the music continually rewarding. The
lazy, lapping duet for the two women friends, Daisy and Jordan, is
haunting. The extended ensemble scenes are intricate and richly
textured. The mix of vernacular and modern musical styles is almost
always seamless. Playing through the piano-vocal score at the
keyboard affords musical pleasures on every page.
</P>
<P>
   On the stage, the opera does seem overextended and, in places,
dramatically miscalculated. At roughly 2 hours 40 minutes, the
score is long, at least by most modern sensibilities. The
suggestion from critics that Harbison should have cut the F. Scott
Fitzgerald novel more brutally is sound. The opening scene of the
second act, a second party at Gatsby's house, is probably
redundant. After Gatsby is shot and killed, Nick's wistfully
romantic aria (``Held by the West''), sung to the jaded Jordan,
undermines the effect of Gatsby's long soliloquy, delivered just
before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Even the overture is not quite right. It begins with gritty,
needling chords and jittery rhythms, then segues into one of
Harbison's jaunty '20s dance tunes. The effect is disarming, but
the dance goes on too long. The next episode in the overture, where
the vernacular music starts to blend eerily, and brilliantly, with
an astringently chromatic recollection of the opening material,
would be more powerful if it came sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, during the performances I attended, whenever my interest
in the stage drama would start to wane, something wonderful
happened in the music.
</P>
<P>
   Harbison may have erred in writing his own libretto. On the
page, it reads fine. But he lacked a collaborator who, in the great
tradition of opera, could have challenged his musical decisions.
``Gee, John,'' the librettist might have said, ``I never thought
that this single page of text would take so much music. Is this
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Harbison is a real composer, and it was satisfying to hear
an opera so full of musical substance. The recent heritage of
American opera offers far too many examples of weak scores attached
to theatrical, obvious, topical or gimmicky scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, as with ``Parsifal,'' ``Pelleas et Melisande'' and
``Der Rosenkavalier,'' it may take time, decades even, for opera
audiences to figure out whether Harbison has gotten it right in
terms of pacing and length after all. This presumes, of course,
that the work will stay around for a while. It deserves to.

AN ARCHITECT'S MOMENT OF RECKONING ARRIVES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, one of the burning questions in American architecture
has been: Will Peter Eisenman find himself before the world finds
Peter Eisenman? By himself, I don't mean Eisenman's personality. I
mean his attitude toward his medium.
</P>
<P>
   Can he finally place architecture above the external sources _
linguistics; semiotics; structuralist philosophy _ he has relied on
over the years? By the world, I don't mean popular acclaim, of the
kind that Frank Gehry has achieved in recent years. I mean
curiosity on the part of a public that has been slow to recognize
its stake in Eisenman's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   What has kept this question hanging in the air is the
oppositional stance Eisenman has maintained toward mainstream
architecture over the years, and the public's natural inclination
to resent what it correctly perceives as a critique of mainstream
values. Eisenman has defined his position in theoretical, abstract
and academic terms that defy comprehension by a general audience.
The audience, in turn, has responded by wondering why it should
care.
</P>
<P>
   Six recent projects _ two in New York, two in Berlin, one in
Paris, one in Santiago de Campostela, Spain _ suggest that a moment
of mutual reckoning has arrived. Contact would be too strong a word
for it. Closer encounters may come when one or more of these
designs is actually built.
</P>
<P>
   But the clustering of six major projects within so small a time
frame, the range and clarity of their designs, and (not least) the
degree of public support it has taken to bring three of them to the
point of likely realization, all indicate a shift in the
relationship between Eisenman's inner and outer worlds. In this
defining moment, Eisenman's aesthetic intentions are not that hard
to unpack. All six designs will be examined here in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Eisenman was one of two finalists in a competition to
design the Musee du Quai Branly in Paris, a presidential grand
projet that will house tribal artifacts originally collected for
the Musee d'Ethnographie du Trocadero. In December, the commission
was awarded to the French architect Jean Nouvel. Long live Nouvel.
</P>
<P>
   But Eisenman's was the best design to come out of his office
thus far. Even unbuilt, it brings into focus the philosophical
issues Eisenman's work addresses and his increasing success in
conveying them in architectural terms.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has a spectacular site on the Left Bank of the Seine,
just north of the Eiffel Tower and the Champs de Mars. The
sprawling Palais de Chaillot is visible on the Right Bank, directly
opposite the tower. With the river as one edge, the site is bounded
on the other by the Rue de l'Universite, a principal artery of the
fabled, aristocratic district of the Faubourg Saint Germain.
</P>
<P>
   Parisian grands projets are like Sarah Bernhardt's farewell
tours. Each project is described as the last, but they keep on
coming. The future Musee du Quai Branly is known worldwide not only
for its tribal masks but also for the impact they made on Picasso
and other artists in the years before World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenman's design can also be seen as a tribal mask, a shaman's
disguise for the tribe of modern Paris. It plays upon the
convention of the Cartesian grid, the face of reason that the city
has presented to the world since the 18th century, when the
philosophes ushered in the French tribal tradition of critical
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is a legacy of that tradition. It is an artifact of
classical science and its methodologies: collecting and classifying
objects; creating categories and grids to organize them. But the
museum is also a relic of the colonial era. Its collection is based
on objects gathered from French territories in Africa and Oceania
before the empire shrank to the beaches of Saint Barts.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenman's design reflects the idea that these two legacies are
intertwined. It conveys the view that the European heritage of
cultural and scientific knowledge cannot be separated from the will
to dominate and exploit non-European civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   This view derives from Michel Foucault, the philosopher who
trained his eye on the historical relationship between intellectual
enterprise and political power. Foucault's quarrel was not with
scientific objectivity per se, but with the use of it to disguise
political self-interest. Think, for example, of the military
hardware presented as technological achievement at the
Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Eisenman building can thus be seen as both a mask and an
unmasking. It presents the contorted face of classical science to
Paris, a city where the history of science has come under close
intellectual scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   This mask turns its face toward the sky. As with the convention
center Eisenman designed for Columbus, Ohio, the museum's roof is
treated as a fifth facade. A highly articulated expanse of
curvilinear contour, the roof would function as the building's main
facade. Its four elevations would be largely obscured by existing
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from above, the roof seems to be squeezed out from
existing buildings on either end of the site, as if they were two
pasta machines facing each other for a lasagne-making contest.
Strands of the raw noodle have been pulled apart, allowing views
into the interior through the metal frames that serve as skylights
for the galleries below.
</P>
<P>
   The frames echo the iron lacework of the Eiffel Tower overhead,
and with it the great feats of 19th-century engineering from which
modern architecture later arose. The frames also express the
Cartesian grid form that holds the key to the meaning of this and
other Eisenman designs. The form is an homage to Rene Descartes,
the Parisian philosopher to whom modern rationality can be traced.
But the metal grids of the skylights are twisted, warped, curved.
This homage seeks to undermine Descartes as well as praise him.
</P>
<P>
   The sinuous curves of the roof bring to mind another milestone
in modern science: the anatomy lesson. The building is a muscle
mass _ a leg or torso _ laid bare on an operating table of urban
scale. For Eisenman, the reference is to Leonardo's anatomical
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   For me, Thomas Eakins' 1875 painting ``The Gross Clinic'' comes
more readily to mind. The esteemed surgeon is depicted with scalpel
in hand and bloody fingers as he performs an incision for the
benefit of students ringed in the amphitheater above.
</P>
<P>
   Like the emergence of engineering as an aesthetic ideal, Eakins'
painting represents the rise of what the art historian Linda
Nochlin has called the Realist virtues: honesty, contemporaneity,
truth, directness and authenticity. With far more immediacy than
the Neo-Classical paintings of the 18th century, Eakins illustrates
the transmission of Enlightenment values from the old world to the
new. Eisenman, an American architect captivated by Continental
ideas, proposes to ship them back again.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the museum's design is analogic. Paris is a
living urban body. The design explores its physical structure _
rail lines, highways, river, quais, older buildings _ and its
mythology as the beacon of reason enlightening the world.
</P>
<P>
   The building is a prosthetic device, inserted to maintain the
body's well-being. Presidential projects have performed this
surgical function in contemporary Paris since the Pompidou Center.
</P>
<P>
   The configuration of the museum's galleries corresponds to the
form of the building's roof. The grid of the classical museum
enfilade is warped into long, serpentine shapes that suggest an
organic context. The intention is to free tribal artifacts from the
strict taxonomy of the Western grid.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the warping is meant to liberate Western thought
from Cartesian objectivity. Almost a century ago, Eisenman points
out in a text he wrote for the competition, Picasso came away from
the Musee de l'Ethnographie with the inspiration for ``Les
Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' That painting used tribal imagery to
assault Western ideas of representation.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenman wants to re-engage that imagery at a time when the
boundaries between the West and the Other have broken down. Why
should African objects be sorted into our grids? Why not the other
way around?
</P>
<P>
   The roof is conceived as a park. Landscaped portions would be
located in the roof's valleys, which reach down to street level and
gradually taper upward. The goal is less to provide green, open
space than to enable people to explore on foot the roof's
undulating geometry. Their movement across the surface dissolves
the grid in four dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   By now, it should be clear that Eisenman can no longer be
regarded as the pure formalist he was once assumed to be. More than
that, the Paris project reveals the extent to which the traditional
opposition of form and content has ceased to matter.
</P>
<P>
   The project is rich with content _ allusion, metaphor and
mutable imagery. It is, at the same time, a powerful abstract form.
The design's content derives from the meanings with which the grid
has been culturally saturated: objectivity, rationality and
science, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   In distorting the grid, Eisenman produces abstract shapes that
people will or will not find pleasing. He is also warping the
meanings that derive from the grid, including the perceptual
framework that helps to shape aesthetic response. That framework
encourages dualistic ways of seeing. New versus Old. Curved versus
Straight. Figure versus Ground. Abstraction versus Representation.
Eisenman's disturbance of that framework calls these dualisms into
question.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time content has appeared in Eisenman's
work. His early projects, like House VI in Cornwall, Conn., were
packed with Noam Chomsky's theories of an innate deep structure in
language. Eisenman's later projects rely heavily on Jacques
Derrida's concept of logocentrism. These theoretical sources remain
embedded in Eisenman's approach. He still relies on a conceptual
framework to generate formal ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But he has supplemented these fundamentals with an open-ended
invitation to let other meanings flow in. Eisenman has acknowledged
some references, like the influence of Descartes and Picasso. Other
images _ dueling pasta machines, for example _ occur entirely as a
viewer's projections. But the design's fluidity invites them, as
clouds do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, other forms could convey such meanings equally well,
and the form of this particular building might well remain the same
if it housed a shopping mall, a convention center, a performing
arts complex or any other program you can think of.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? Eisenman's distortion of the grid has broad
application. The Cartesian model permeates modern ways of thinking
and the institutions that have grown from them, from the private
house to the museum, the library, the factory and the big city
plan. All buildings designed on the grid are content-laden, whether
their architects intend it or not. That includes most Western
buildings designed since the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The grid is a useful device for differentiation. For creating
binary ways of thinking, it can't be beat. East-West. Up-Down.
Form-Content. 0-1. But for those who think that architecture today
should be collapsing dualisms, not just reinforcing them, Eisenman
is breaking ground.

FROM PLUMBING PROBLEMS TO MEDICAL EVACUATIONS, INTERNATIONAL SOS
CAN HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION warning: also sent with `f' code)  
 (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 C.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was doing the old Dallas quick-step one day last week, huffing
a half-mile between gates at the nation's most aerobically
demanding airport to lunge for a connecting flight whose tail fin
could be seen gliding away just as I reached the counter, where the
ticket agent wore a look that said, ha-ha.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, this would have generated a foul and self-pitying
mood, except that I had been speaking just the day before with
Arnaud Vaissie, the president of International SOS Ltd., a company
based in Philadelphia that provides emergency services, medical and
logistical, to corporate business travelers. And suddenly the
prospect of an unanticipated layover of an extra couple of hours
didn't seem so terrible, considering some of the things that can go
really wrong on a business trip.
</P>
<P>
   Take the hijacking in December of that Indian Airlines plane,
whose passengers were held hostage in Afghanistan. Imagine being on
 &UR; that &LR;  leg of a business trip. Three clients of Vaissie's company
were.
</P>
<P>
   International SOS dispatched a medical team to treat the clients
when they were released. In a typical travel emergency, the company
also takes care of details like retrieving luggage, rescheduling
missed connections, and making sure that business meetings are
canceled with appropriate explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hijacking was such a mega-situation that everything else
disappeared except the medical need,'' said Vaissie, who himself
spends about a third of his time traveling on business. ``Missing a
business meeting in Frankfurt was not a big factor here. It's rare
that we're not involved when there is a major international
incident _ bombings, terrorism, coups, civil disasters. But most of
our business is less dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Several basic trends drive a company like International SOS,
which began operations in 1974 and now has 2,500 employees and
emergency offices that operate around the clock in more than 30
cities, from Houston to Hanoi. An illness, accident or other
emergency is usually more complicated to deal with when someone is
traveling or living temporarily abroad for business. And
international business travel is increasing sharply. An American
Express survey indicates a growth of about 30 percent this year,
with a far wider range of destinations as economic interests
connect around the world.
</P>
<P>
   While it is more true in Europe than in the United States, ``the
need to actually be there is certainly the case in Asia, where you
typically have just one big city for doing business in each
country,'' Vaissie said. ``People want to know you, look at your
face and see if you are genuine before doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   His clients, mostly major multinational corporations, but also
including airlines, hotels and cruise ships, pay a retainer based
on their size to have access to emergency offices worldwide, where
500 doctors and nurses are on staff. There are extra charges for
extraordinary services like evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   People working abroad on emergencies necessarily develop good
local networks. Arranging a sudden medical evacuation from China,
for example, requires dealing successfully with potentially
indignant local doctors, but also with political officials who can
expedite exit clearances, and even with military types whose
approval might be crucial for clearing air space for an emergency
charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we deal with the medical interests of a traveler we also
deal with the logistics of the situation,'' Vaissie said. ``We have
developed the capability of dealing with the nonmedical components
which are key to making things happen. The medical outcome is
completely linked to the quality of the logistics involved. Our
people have their contacts. We can access things that basically are
closed to everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical evacuations, coups and terrorist incidents aside,
International SOS will even do such tasks as put up bail if a
corporate vice president for sales gets jammed up with a little
unpleasantness involving the gendarmes in, say, Tangier.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought all the adventure had gone out of the world. Yet
here we have an organization where a case of appendicitis is
suddenly fraught with international intrigue and derring-do. John
Le Carre may be old hat, but dangerous, exotic adventure lives on,
as a component of the corporate bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   It is at least something romantic to mull over the next time
you're stranded in Atlanta blinking helplessly at the departures
screen. A smart thriller writer with an eye on airport paperback
sales could clean up in the suddenly exciting business-travel
genre.
</P>
<P>
   Though it had not occurred to him before, Vaissie suddenly
grasped the movie possibilities. Think James Bond meets ``The Man
in the Gray Flannel Suit.'' ``A modern sense of adventure,''
Vaissie said. ``Business people are going all over, to the most
impossible places on the earth, to more and more remote
locations.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a corporate executive he had some thoughts on the
narrative arc: ``The point of the whole thing is making sure
adventure is going to be mastered, if you will. To make adventure
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that among the minor details a regional International
SOS office can take care of are helping to get prescriptions
refilled or even arranging for a plumber to come to your house if
the pipes burst while you are out there tending to the business of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't exactly the stuff of thrillers, lamentably. ``Our
people have the right phone numbers and local contacts,'' Vaissie
said. ``They can find a plumber at night. It's very mundane.'' &QL;

ENHANCED TV HAS THAT MILLIONAIRE FEEL TO IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regis Philbin is sitting across from you, you're sweating
bullets, the studio lights are spinning and you're out of
lifelines.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: For $1 million ... it's the fourth quarter of Super Bowl
XXXIV. Who will St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner turn to on
third-and-five at the Tennessee Titans' 15? A: Marshall Faulk. B:
Isaac Bruce. C: Ricky Proehl. D: Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: Regis, I know this. It's C, Ricky Proehl.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: Final answer?
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: Final answer.
</P>
<P>
   The online feature known as Enhanced TV is not exactly Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire _ ABC's popular television quiz show. But the
concept that viewers want to interact with a game-show-like
production makes its similar in some respects.
</P>
<P>
   On the Millionaire show, contestants answer questions for big
bucks. Since its launch in September, Enhanced TV _ accessible
through ESPN.com, NFL.com and Superbowl.com, as well as Disney's
GO.com site _ has given more than 2.2 million contestants a chance
to answer trivia and make play-call guesses against others online
users for points.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Enhanced TV developers are using Super Bowl XXXIV on
Sunday as a backdrop to boost their product's new features (more
multimedia and player options) while frequently dropping the
Internet industry's buzzword _ convergence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making the push for true convergence,'' said Jonathan
Leess, executive producer of Enhanced TV.
</P>
<P>
   In its current state, Enhanced TV is far from converged. Use of
the technology requires keeping the TV and computer close. While
watching the game live on TV, contestants must access the Enhanced
TV site and divide their attention among two windows _ one where
the users choose who gets the ball and another for live statistics.
Factor in another window for trivia questions and it's a test for
anyone's attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Enhanced TV research shows a typical user remains
logged into the service for an average of 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the enjoyment of the game, as a user on the Internet,
that much more intense,'' said Aram Sinnreich, consumer content
analyst for Jupiter Communications, an Internet industry watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Leess, who plans to make a media presentation of the site
Wednesday, said he expects further integration to make Enhanced TV
on a single screen in the next few years. It's not only tough on
the viewers, but hard to sell, Leess said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to go back and forth is not a way to go,'' he said.
``And the advertisers don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers might like Enhanced TV's coming project. The
company, a Disney subsidiary that works out of Los Angeles and New
York, is working with ABC producers on the Millionaire show and
will have an interactive online version by late February or early
March, Leess said.
</P>
<P>
   DOT.COM COMMERCIALS: Expect at least a dozen commercials at this
Super Bowl with Internet connections, though none has to do with
sports. The closest hint of sports might be Austin-based
Netpliance, which kicks off its national branding campaign with
three 30-second commercials. Advertising Age's site (www.adage.com)
predicts the Cowboys cheerleaders to show off the company's
home-friendly Web devices.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S NOT REN AND STIMPY, BUT ... Here's a new cartoon: the
adventures of a 43-year-old NFL quarterback. Pseudo Programs
(www.pseudo.com), a New York-based producer of interactive
Internet-only video programming, plans to debut QB Toons at 5 p.m.
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   QB Toons premiers with Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Warren
Moon. The episode features Moon as he recalls playing in his first
organized football game as a 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Expect more of the same. Pseudo and the NFL Quarterback Club
reached an agreement in the fall to launch a lifestyle-oriented pro
football channel on Pseudo.com featuring the quarterback club's 44
members, including the Cowboys' Troy Aikman. In exchange, NFL QB
Club invested in Pseudo.com and put Bernie Kosar on the company's
board.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Pseudo.com debuted the hidden drumming talents
of Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie. His band, The Flutie
Gang, performed the song off their new compact disc, ``Ramblin'
Scramblin' Man'' on Pseudo.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know about that famous Hail Mary pass, but who knew
Flutie could rock out to ``Proud Mary,'' too?'' said Tony Asnes,
Pseudo Programs president.
</P>
<P>
   SUPER SITES: Here is what the big-media sites have planned for
Super Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   CNNSI.com: Atlanta-based site benefits from local information.
Besides the usual exhaustive data, features include access to the
swanky Sports Illustrated and Turner Sports party, live chats, live
video streaming of news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   CBS SportsLine: Analysis and scouting reports, interactivity,
live game stats.
</P>
<P>
   FOXSports.com: Daily 15- to 20-minute Webcasts, live halftime
Webcast, columns by on-air Fox personalities, daily chat sessions,
fantasy games.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBCSports.com: Jay Novacek's Super Bowl picks, send e-mail to
Giants coach Jim Fassel and vote for the Super Bowl winner.

AIR TIME: OXYGEN, A NEW CABLE CHANNEL FOR WOMEN, GETS READY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Geraldine Laybourne of Oxygen, the new
cable TV network that premieres February 2, wants to reach women on
their computers at work, on TV at home, on their laptops on the
plane _ anywhere she can.
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne and her creative team of powerhouse producers, Marcy
Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach (``Roseanne,'' ``The Cosby
Show''), along with business partner Oprah Winfrey, are aiming the
seven-days-a-week interactive network at the educated 35ish crowd,
with original programming drawn from real life _ and not a sitcom
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a different animal,'' Laybourne said last week after a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded world of women's programming _ including
Lifetime, hit network shows such as NBC's ``Providence'' and CBS'
``Judging Amy'' _ only the fittest will survive. Laybourne thinks
Oxygen, starting out with an ambitious 55 hours of original
programming, has what it takes. It's a risky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne, 52, a former educator and the creative force who
changed children's TV during her 16 years at Nickelodeon by
introducing humor, irony and real-life issues into the schedule,
was also president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks, where she was
chairwoman of Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   She thought up the name Oxygen, she has said, after waking up
one morning gulping in air. The network was originally scheduled to
premiere in January, but the connection between 02/02, as in
February 2, and O2/O2 (get it?) was too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a chance to start this when women are feeling
independent and comfortable with themselves,'' Laybourne said. ``As
TV gets slicker and slicker, the question is, how do you get closer
to people?''
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen's answer: with a sense of humor, plenty of reality
checks, a strong Web presence (oxygen.com) and powerful investors,
including America Online and Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft.
The Oprah factor certainly can't hurt _ Winfrey is starting her own
magazine, O, in the spring. And a 30-second spot is planned for the
second quarter of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The actual TV presence of the network is its weakest link. In
this case viewers may initially come from the Web site, which
features travel, parenting, home decorating articles and essays on
issues of interest to women. Oxygen is using the site as a tool to
extend what women are talking about to television.
</P>
<P>
   The network will premiere in only about 10 million homes
(without the New York or Los Angeles markets) _ barely breathing in
comparison with its top competitor, Lifetime, which skews to a
slightly older audience and is seen in 75 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen will be carried by AT&AMP;T Cable in some Bay Area cities,
concentrated mostly in the South and East bays.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Oxygen day starts with ``Inhale,'' a power yoga program, at
6 a.m. and concludes with ``Exhale'' at 10 p.m., an informal
interview show with Candice Bergen. ``X-Chromosome'' (10:30 p.m.
weekends), sophisticated animated segments overseen by Laybourne's
filmmaker husband, Kit, are the first prime-time animated strips
for women. They're drawn from real-life stories about
relationships, friendship, careers and family.
</P>
<P>
   The network's signature prime-time show, ``Pure Oxygen'' (8 p.m.
weekdays), is a two-hour block hosted by three multicultural female
hosts who will introduce segments on parenting, business, health,
style and home.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday nights at 8, Winfrey hosts ``Oprah Goes Online,'' a
12-part series in which the most influential woman in television
learns how to turn on a computer with the help of two good-looking
techies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah had never visited her own Web site; she looked at all
her e-mails printed out on paper,'' Mandabach said. ``Oprah was
afraid to do this because she said, `I'm embarrassed; I've missed
the boat.' Candice Bergen doesn't know how to operate a computer
either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally convinced Oprah to do this,'' Carsey said. ``We
told her, hey come on, people ... know all about you. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Other programming includes a daily documentary film block, a
weekly late-night talk and variety show, and a weekend ``Pajama
Party'' talk and variety show that could be perceived as
condescending. ``I don't think any of us think that we're doing
anything that's too `girly' or `huggy,''' Laybourne responded.
</P>
<P>
   For teens, there's an afternoon program called ``Trackers'' that
lets young people tell stories from their own points of view by
putting tiny ``lipstick'' digital cameras into their hands and
sending them out to report on their peers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Su Chin Pak of San Francisco, one of the three ``Trackers''
co-hosts, has done teen shows on KGO (Channel 7), KRON (Channel 4)
and ZDTV.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday mornings, Oxygen takes viewers on a two-hour
shopping spree, with online and real-life shopping tips and product
reviews. Mandabach introduced this segment to TV critics in
Pasadena by saying, ``And then on the weekends, of course, what do
we want to do? We wake up. We want to shop.'' There were groans
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   She recovered with the announcement that there will also be
Saturday afternoon sports programming with ``We Sweat,'' a two-hour
block of sporting events, profiles, play-by-play and analysis.
``We've bought a bunch of rights, and you'll be seeing a bunch of
stuff you haven't ever seen before,'' Mandabach said.
</P>
<P>
   When Lifetime, the original ``television for women'' network,
was introduced nearly 16 years ago, women were still finding their
comfort levels combing the worlds of business and parenthood. And
while the network became successful and influential in women's
political issues, it was heavy on escapist fare and short on Web
content.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime has picked up a sense of humor only recently, and
Laybourne says she won't make that mistake at her network. ``This
is my personal mission to prove to the world, once and for all,
that yes, women do have a sense of humor,'' she told the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women get their comedy out of everyday life,'' she said later,
``and we wanted a sense of humor to manifest itself almost
everywhere through the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne said she and her partners never argued during the
planning stages, each allowing the other to have a say. ``I would
characterize my partners in the following way,'' Laybourne said.
``Marcy has the ability to cut through all the peripheral issues
and ask the profound question, `So what?' and Caryn has the ability
to have the sparkplug ideas that seemingly come from absolutely
nowhere but take things in an entirely new direction. I'm the stern
schoolmarm. My job is to make sure everybody gets heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerry immediately took the pressure off all of us,'' said
Mandabach, ``by stating that we would be programming in blocks with
themes, rather than half-hour sitcoms or hourlong dramas. We talked
a lot about leading with our ears, that this would be also have to
be an aural medium with a lot of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they have to get the message out there. The network has not
yet struck a financial deal with cable operators in some large
cities, but Laybourne projects that the network will be in 50
million homes by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier in the press tour, Lifetime CEO Carole Black
announced the latest plans at her network: a new daily newscast,
two new prime-time drama series and a spiffed-up Web site with new
animation.
</P>
<P>
   She learned a lot of this strategy from Laybourne, who preceded
her at the network. ``I am going to be the unsung hero of
Lifetime,'' Laybourne said with a laugh. Or its worst nightmare.

MERRILL LYNCH EARNINGS MORE THAN DOUBLES IN FOURTH QUARTER TO $764
MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's biggest brokerage
firm, said Tuesday that its earnings more than doubled last quarter
as its customers poured money into the firm and its corporate
clients continued to sell stocks and bonds and buy other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, whose stock has lagged behind those of its competitors
since it racked up big bond-trading losses in late 1998, reported
that its net income rose to $764 million, or $1.80 a diluted share,
in the fourth quarter, from $359 million, or 86 cents a share, in
the fourth quarter of 1998. The results easily exceeded analysts'
consensus estimate of $1.39 a share, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's stock rose $5, to $80.6875 a share, on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Like its competitors, Merrill benefited from a roaring market
for sales of new stock and a boom in mergers and acquisitions
around the world, especially in Europe. Its revenue from investment
banking, including fees for underwriting and for advising on
mergers, increased 36 percent to $1.13 billion, from $824 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, if the investment banking parts of these businesses
didn't put up huge numbers, that would have been a
disappointment,'' said Steve Galbraith, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``The number of new assets, now that was genuinely
a positive surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, which is in a race against a variety of
financial-services companies to gather investors' assets, said it
took in $36 billion from new and existing clients, including
corporations, last quarter. That was even more than the $33 billion
in new assets at the Charles Schwab Corp., the online brokerage
firm that caters to individual investors and has been growing much
faster than traditional brokerage firms for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers built almost month by month by month'' last
quarter and the growth rate has accelerated in January, said John
L. Steffens, a vice chairman who oversees Merrill's force of 14,000
brokers. About $6 billion of the new money went into a new type of
account, called Unlimited Advantage, that Merrill introduced last
summer, offering unlimited stock trades for an annual fee based on
assets.
</P>
<P>
   That account, a response to the popular low-commission
electronic brokerage firms that have proliferated on the Internet,
is the latest step in Merrill's gradual transition away from a
dependence on transaction commissions. So, Merrill executives are
pleased to have ended the year with about $63 billion in Unlimited
Advantage accounts, even though about 70 percent of that money was
shifted from other accounts at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The new account ``is clearly more competitive with Schwab,''
Steffens said. He added that Merrill had used it to attract some
active traders, including ``some fairly decent-sized ones,'' away
from electronic brokers that compete on price.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Eberling, an analyst at Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP;
Thornton, said: ``For a firm that is supposed to be stuck in
neutral and a sales force that is supposed to be shellshocked by
the speed of change, this shows that there is life. Now, you've
seen that these models aren't dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Within nine months, Merrill could be deriving more of its
revenue from recurring fees than from commissions, Eberling said.
</P>
<P>
   Eberling is recommending purchase of Merrill's stock because he
thinks it is relatively cheap and management is taking many of the
right steps to recover from some expensive acquisitions it made
overseas and its late embrace of electronic brokerage. ``We're
going to see them hunker down, digest a lot of the acquisitions
they've made and keep pulling in assets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shift, commissions still accounted for the biggest
part of Merrill's revenue gain, amounting to $1.74 billion last
quarter, up 22 percent from $1.42 billion a year before. Over all,
the firm's net revenue _ total revenue minus interest expense _
rose 44 percent, to $5.9 billion, in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from principal transactions, or trading, more than
tripled from a depressed level a year earlier but fell 25 percent
from the third quarter of 1998. Most of the decline was caused by a
slowdown and general weakness in the bond markets late in the year,
said E. Stanley O'Neal, Merrill's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We produced spectacular results in the fourth quarter despite
a significant dropoff in debt-markets trading,'' O'Neal said. But
he stressed that last quarter bore no similarity to Merrill's
troubled period in the fall of 1998. ``There were no substantial
losses, just a slowdown in revenues,'' he said. &QL;

COMPAQ, STRUGGLING WITH ITS PAST, MEETS ANALYST EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Texas)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Compaq Computer Corp., trying to convince
investors that it is putting the problems of last year behind it,
reported fourth-quarter profits Tuesday that were in line with
analyst expectations, and its chief executive predicted that
revenue would grow by at least 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston personal computer manufacturer posted net income of
19 cents a share for the quarter, which, after deducting an
investment gain of about 3 cents a share, matched the consensus
Wall Street estimate of 16 cents. That compares with a profit of 43
cents a share during the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq released the results after the close of trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. Its stock rose 62.5 cents a share, to $33,
during the trading session but fell $2 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new chief executive, Michael Capellas, predicted
that revenue growth would be spurred this year by huge spending on
Internet infrastructure, and he said during a conference call that
he was ``very comfortable'' with Wall Street estimates of full-year
2000 earnings of $1.08 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq executives also said that they expected the unit that
sells personal computers to businesses to return to profitability
this year. And they added that expense reductions were far from
complete, noting that the company had so far cut only 1,900 jobs
out of a planned reduction of 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of those cuts are expected to occur by the end of the
first half of this year, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been struggling to digest its acquisition of Digital
Equipment Corp. while it faces tough competition from the Dell
Computer Corp. and other direct-sellers of personal computers.
Compaq has been working to boost its direct sales of PCs, and
executives expect to discuss those efforts in more detail during a
meeting with analysts in Houston on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a stock like this, much is based on hope about the
future, and he is off to a credible start,'' said Richard Chu, an
analyst at S.G. Cowen in Boston, referring to Capellas. Chu added
that the company's $10.5 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter
was ``comforting,'' even if it was lower than the $10.9 billion the
company reported during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCarthy, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in
New York, said it was too early to tell how well Capellas' strategy
was working. ``This is a company that remains in transition, but I
think the sequential trends are encouraging, both from a revenue
standpoint and operating expense control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The continued buildup of Internet infrastructure and the release
of the Windows 2000 operating system will be compelling demand
drivers, and Compaq is in a better position to benefit from those
trends than it was a year ago, McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think 2000 will be the year for Capellas to really prove
himself,'' McCarthy added.

QUALCOMM WARNING SENDS ITS SHARES DOWN AFTER HOURS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.)  (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Qualcomm Inc., the highflying wireless technology
company, warned on Tuesday that shipments of cellular telephones
and chips may dip in the second quarter, sending its shares
downward in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came as Qualcomm, based in San Diego, reported
earnings that beat analysts' estimates by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm reported its results after the close of the market.
Qualcomm shares, which were the best-performing stock on the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index last year, closed Tuesday at $149, up
$8.9375, but then dropped as low as $133 in after-hours trading.
Qualcomm shares have been as high as $200 in the last 52 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm developed code-division multiple access, or CDMA, the
fastest-growing standard for digital cell phones. Qualcomm
generates revenue primarily by collecting royalties from companies
that use its code and by selling chips to cell phone makers.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, which ended Dec. 26 and was the first of its
fiscal year, Qualcomm reported earnings of $177 million, or 23
cents a diluted share, up from $49 million, or 8 cents a share,
reported in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenue rose
19 percent, to $1.12 billion, from $941.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The period a year earlier included revenues from a CDMA wireless
business that was sold during the third quarter of fiscal 1999.
Excluding nonrecurring charges and operating results associated
with the Qualcomm Consumer Products business that the Kyocera Corp.
agreed to purchase last month, Qualcomm said it had pro forma
earnings per share of 27 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 24 cents, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial. The so-called whisper number was 28
cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quarter, we took three major steps to sharpen our focus
on wireless Internet access, the next major market for
communications and CDMA,'' Irwin Jacobs, Qualcomm's chairman, said
in a statement. ``We believe that the sale of our phone business,
along with the sale of the wireless infrastructure business last
year, will support continuing improvements in our financial
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm said it expected shipments of its phone chips in the
second quarter of fiscal 2000 to be lower than the first quarter
because of seasonal factors and inventory balancing by customers
resulting from continued shortages of other phone components. In
addition, the company said phone shipments in the second quarter of
fiscal 2000 might be lower than in the first quarter of fiscal 2000
because of seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the consumer products division and various charges,
Qualcomm said that it expected second-quarter earnings to meet or
exceed 25 cents, and that it was confident it would meet analysts'
forecasts for fiscal 2000.

JUDGE ALLOWS MURDER TRIAL OF FOUR OFFICERS TO BE TELEVISED  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., S.D.)  (mk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trial of the four New York City police officers charged with
killing Amadou Diallo will be televised, a state judge ruled
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Justice Joseph C. Teresi of state Supreme Court
in Albany, N.Y., who is presiding over the case, ruled that a 1952
statute banning cameras in New York courtrooms was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   He also referred to the relocation of the trial, already a
source of contention, from the Bronx to Albany. ``The denial of
access to the vast majority will accomplish nothing but more
divisiveness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No appeal of the justice's ruling is expected, so without a
higher court ruling, the future of the New York statute beyond this
courtroom remains undecided. The state is one of only three, along
with Mississippi and South Dakota, that ban all recording and
broadcasting of trials. Legal experts said that the decision would
not be binding on any other state judges, but could be an
influential precedent for them to cite on similar motions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is sure to provide fodder for the debate over
cameras in courtrooms. News organizations and First Amendment
lawyers have long argued that it is unconstitutional to bar
cameras, and that televised trials give the public a better
understanding of the judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of televised trials point to examples like the
O.J. Simpson criminal trial in Los Angeles to argue that cameras
create a circuslike atmosphere. Some defense lawyers say they
believe the cameras infringe on the rights of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection, which will not be televised under the ruling, is
scheduled to begin on Monday in the Diallo case, in which four
officers are charged with murder and reckless endangerment. Their
lawyers have not disputed that the officers killed Diallo, an
unarmed street vendor, in a hail of 41 bullets in the Bronx on Feb.
4, but have indicated that the officers believed he had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to allow the case to be televised was filed by the
Courtroom Television Network, which will serve as the pool camera
for other networks seeking to televise parts of the trial. The
cable network, which broadcasts trials nationally with commercial
sponsorship, plans to cover the entire trial.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, one of the lawyers who filed the motion on behalf
of Court TV, said he believed it was the first time in the state or
country that a judge had ruled that a ban on cameras in the
courtroom was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The determination that cameras ought to be allowed in this
case at the very beginning of the 21st century has symbolic impact
as well,'' Abrams said. ``It was anachronistic for New York state _
the media capital of the country _ to be one of the few states to
have a flat ban on cameras in its courtrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a 10-year experiment that ended in 1997, civil and
criminal trials were permitted to be televised in New York state.
Among the defendants whose trials were televised were Joel
Steinberg, who was convicted of beating his illegally adopted
daughter to death, and Colin Ferguson, who was convicted in 1995 of
murdering six passengers on the Long Island Rail Road.. Legislators
cited the Simpson trial, among other reasons, when they refused to
renew the camera experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Four New York state judicial reports found that the presence of
cameras in the courtrooms had not impeded the administration of
justice and recommended allowing such coverage. Forty-seven states
make some provision for cameras in the courtroom. Television
coverage of all federal court proceedings is effectively banned.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Teresi strongly criticized the state
Legislature for allowing that experiment to lapse, calling it ``a
monument to politically created procrastination and inaction.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   News organizations had little reason to expect a friendly
decision from Teresi, who had earlier denied their request to
unseal some motions in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very significant that this particular trial judge would
permit the trial to be broadcast in the face of the Legislature's
very recent rejection of cameras in the courtroom and given this
particular case,'' said Steven Zeidman, the director of the Fund
for the Modern Courts, a nonpartisan monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Anne Williams, the justice who was to preside over the
trial in the Bronx, had previously rejected a motion by the
Regional News Network to televise the trial. In apparent deference
to her ruling, Teresi said that the Court TV motion was different
because it had been brought under the U.S. Constitution as well as
the New York state constitution, and because of ``the change of
circumstances since that decision, namely the change of venue.''
</P>
<P>
   His ruling was unequivocal. ``There is no doubt that the First
Amendment of the United States Constitution requires that all
criminal trials must be open to the press and public, absent
compelling and clearly articulated reasons for closing such
proceedings,'' he wrote. But he was careful to state that he was
not saying that there was an absolute right to televise all
proceedings; rather, he said, an absolute ban was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers accepted the decision. ``If the judge believes
this is a case that should be televised in the interest of justice,
I can't argue with that,'' James J. Culleton, the lawyer for
Officer Richard Murphy, said. His client, he said, was very happy
with the decision. ``Once he testifies, the public will learn that
his actions were both reasonable and justified,'' Culleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen C. Worth, one of the lawyers for Officer Edward
McMellon, said of his client: ``He appreciates as do I that a
public viewing of this entire trial is in his best interest.'' But
Worth added that his client was concerned about having his picture
repeatedly broadcast, fearing for his and his family's safety.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney, said
that office favored televising trials as a rule, and particularly
in this case. ``When the location of the trial is 150 miles from
the community where the alleged crime was committed, cameras are
that much more necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision seems to reflect a growing consensus in New York's
legal community that cameras should be permitted in courtrooms.
Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye has generally favored cameras in the
courtroom, but officials said Tuesday that it would be
inappropriate for her to comment on a pending matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Diallo case, the state attorney general, Eliot L.
Spitzer, had declined to defend the statute against Court TV's
motion. Tuesday, his spokesman, Scott Brown, said, ``We're very
pleased that there will be cameras in the court because we feel
it's an important part of instilling public confidence in the
judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Teresi's decision in the Diallo case could fall if a media
organization moved to televise another trial, and an appellate
court with jurisdiction over Teresi's court ruled that the statute
was indeed constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zeidman of the court monitoring group noted that the
justice had a difficult task in balancing the education of the
public with the defendants' right to a fair trial. Indeed, for the
defense witnesses, the prospect of a nationwide television audience
could have the unsettling effect of making reluctant witnesses even
more so.
</P>
<P>
   But under the rules that were in effect when the state's 10-year
experiment in televising trials ended, and which Teresi indicated
would again be applicable, some witnesses _ although not the
defendants _ may request that their images not be televised.

CALVIN KLEIN MAY BE ITALIAN TAKEOVER TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Hoping to inject momentum into its textile and
fashion business, one of Italy's major fashion holding companies is
looking carefully at Calvin Klein Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio Romiti, chief executive of Holding di Partecipazioni
Industriali SpA, known here as HdP, said Calvin Klein could be an
attractive purchase if it is capable of generating new business.
</P>
<P>
   Romiti is leading an overhaul of HdP. The acquisition of a name
like Calvin Klein _ whose products an HdP unit has made under
license for two decades _ would give fresh energy to develop brands
HdP already owns, like Valentino and Fila, and offset the losses of
such licensed brands as Armani.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Calvin Klein and his partner Barry Schwartz hired
Lazard Freres to explore strategic moves, including an alliance or
a possible sale. But Romiti, in an interview, said it would be one
to two months before HdP decided whether to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   The chances that HdP will succeed in acquiring Calvin Klein are
hardly predictable. As the fashion industry on both sides of the
Atlantic consolidates, prominent names have become sought-after
commodities. Industry executives say Italian groups keen on
acquisitions, like Gucci and Prada, could also be interested.
</P>
<P>
   Romiti, 50, said HdP had the means for acquisitions and was
interested in accessories, furs and shoes. Losses the company will
report for 1999 are largely attributable to the cost of revamping,
amounting to $52 million, while its total cash reserves are
equivalent to $523 million. HdP also has assets it could sell to
raise further cash, and no debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our potential for leverage is considerable,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the sense of urgency is real. HdP was set up in 1997 by the
Italian investment bank Mediobanca and investors close to Fiat's
Agnelli family to manage businesses in the publishing and fashion
industries. HdP, with total revenue of $3.2 billion, is in no
immediate crisis. Its strength, though, lies mainly in its
publishing businesses, including Rizzoli, which produces books,
newspapers and magazines, and has been pushed up by investor
enthusiasm for anything remotely related to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But HdP's apparel businesses, and notably its principal holding,
a company called Gruppo Finanziario Tessile SpA, or GFT, have
encountered trouble. In the 1980s, GFT was instrumental in bringing
the demand for Italian designer fashions to the United States _
where its sales grew to more than $300 million in 1989, from about
$7 million at the start of the decade _ with licensed designer
names like Armani and Valentino. But by 1993 the growth had stopped
and GFT was saddled with $250 million of debt. Mediobanca, a chief
creditor, took it over.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to restore GFT to profitability have been hampered by
the industry rush to merge into ever-larger groups with stables of
in-house brands, including design, production and distribution
systems. ``They remained an industrial manufacturer for others,''
said Vittorio Giulini, owner of Liola, a prominent knitwear
manufacturer and president of Milan's clothing fair association.
``Today, this is not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the industry trend, HdP itself embarked on an
acquisitions campaign. In early 1998, it paid $300 million for
control of the Rome-based fashion house Valentino. But the holding
company has encountered trouble integrating and managing its new
properties. Eight months after the Valentino acquisition,
Valentino's managing director, Roland Bohler, quit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, GFT was burdened by severe weakness in its licensed
Emanuel brand of women's wear, which caused roughly $40 million in
losses. Early last year, Emanuel's owner, Ferragamo, took it off
GFT's hands, preferring to manage the brand itself. Around the same
time, however, Giorgio Armani announced it would take another
licensed line, the Armani women's wear collection, from GFT, and
Armani is now in the process of deciding whether to withdraw its
men's line as well. Armani accounts for $210 million of GFT's $758
million in revenue, Romiti said, almost 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say the test for HdP will be its ability to
fill the gap left by Armani and to move away from licensing to
management of its own brands. ``The emerging large groups are
vertically organized,'' said Piero Costa of the trade group Sistema
Moda Italia, meaning that they directly manage the design,
manufacture and distribution of their brands.
</P>
<P>
   Romiti said the reorganization of GFT is about complete with the
creation of separate profit centers for the group's brands _
including Calvin Klein licensed products; Sahza, a women's line it
owns, and Joseph Abboud _ and a trimmed-down central unit for
operations like finance and purchasing, plus a unit to manage GFT's
own stores.
</P>
<P>
   With this groundwork done, he said, the future means ``growing
internally, focusing on Valentino, plus some other acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They might not be Italian.''

RAMS REMEMBER THEIR L.A. ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN   
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dick Vermeil says these Rams would have been a
surefire Hollywood hit.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Bruce says he misses the night life in Los Angeles, but
not the small crowds.
</P>
<P>
   D'Marco Farr says he misses the opportunity to take in newly
released movies, but he has settled down into the slower-paced St.
Louis lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lyle says he yearns for the warm weather and the beaches,
but that he's finally adjusted to playing football in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Lyght says Southern California has become such an integral
part of his life that he still resides in the offseason in the home
he owns in Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   They're called the St. Louis Rams now, but those who worked for
the team when they were known as the Los Angeles Rams haven't
forgotten the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Ram team would have been huge in L.A.,'' said Vermeil,
the Rams coach, early Tuesday afternoon as he addressed a segment
of the media swarm at the Georgia Dome. ``We're exciting. We score
quickly. There's seldom a dull moment with us. L.A.'s a city that
loves a winner. L.A.'s a city that loves dynamic entertainment.
L.A.'s a city that would have loved these Rams.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil was a Rams assistant under George Allen in 1969, under
Tommy Prothro in 1971 and 1972 and under Chuck Knox in 1973 before
taking over the head coaching job at UCLA for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He still has strong ties to Los Angeles, and can only wistfully
reflect on the disappointments he endured in his previous tenures
with the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish when I was with the Rams as an assistant that we
could have enjoyed this Super Bowl experience,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, we didn't. It seemed like either the Minnesota
Vikings or Dallas Cowboys always wound up ruining our season. But I
have a feeling a lot of old Ram fans in L.A. are rooting for us. At
least the ones I hear from are.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only four players remaining on the Rams _ Bruce,
Lyght, Farr and Lyle _ who were on the active roster during the
team's final season in Southern California, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. will forever remain my roots in professional football,''
said Farr, the 6-foot-1, 280-pound defensive tackle from the
University of Washington who Knox signed as a free agent in 1994.
``You feel a little bad that the fans in L.A. aren't able to enjoy
this. But if we still were in L.A., the St. Louis fans wouldn't be
enjoying this. And I'd definitely feel bad for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis is totally different than L.A. It's much more of a
community thing. Everyone in the whole area is behind us. It just
wasn't like that in L.A. But I haven't forgotten where we came
from. And I miss going to all the big movies out in L.A. But we're
a St. Louis proposition now. And so am I. I live back there now.
It's a calmer, more tranquil existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce, who's single, admits he misses the hip evening spots of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. was a lot more fun,'' said Bruce, the dynamic receiver
who was the Rams' top rookie in their final season in Orange
County. ``There was so much more to do, but there also is one other
big difference between L.A. and St. Louis: 62,000 fans. We're
always sold out in St. Louis. That wasn't the case when we were in
Anaheim. We drew some pretty puny crowds that last season there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get a lot of calls from fans in L.A.,'' said Lyght,
the Rams Pro Bowl cornerback, who was a first-round draft pick out
of Notre Dame in 1991. ``The Melonheads (the name of a rabid group
of L.A. Rams rooters) even have attended our playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis obviously has been very supportive of us. I can't
say enough good things about their fans. In L.A., the fans were
very fickle. If we won, they'd come out. If we lost, they didn't
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not surprising to me that L.A. still doesn't have
a football team. The people just have too many other choices out
there. I know because I still live there. That's not the case in
St. Louis. You're definitely limited in your choices of things to
do. That's one reason why we've become so wildly popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, of course, is that these Rams have been rolling up
points in record numbers against everyone in the NFL except the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I found the move to St. Louis to be
very tough,'' said Lyle, the talented safety who joined the team in
1994 as a third-round draft pick from Virginia. ``I love the L.A.
weather and the whole scene out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis is a more family-oriented place, and much more
conservative. L.A. is much more free, and people are more given to
experiment in different things. There are definitely things I miss
about L.A. But the support we've received in St. Louis has been
overwhelming. We just didn't get that out in L.A. because I'm sure
people have so many other alternatives. I like St. Louis. But it
isn't L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Rams players emerged from their Georgia Dome dressing
quarters and began walking to their designated interview areas, a
former Rams star receiver, Jack Snow, now a broadcaster with the
team, stood on the sidelines and cooly observed the scene through
his sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got to experience this with the Rams,'' he said
softly. ``We definitely had some teams good enough to make it to
the Super Bowl in the late 1960s and mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, you feel sad L.A. isn't enjoying this. But it's a
different time. And the team now belongs to St. Louis. Who could
ever have imagined?''

FOUR AMERICANS WALTZ INTO THE SEMIFINAL ROUND
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ On the eve of Australia Day, this
nation's annual celebration of independence, it felt more like the
Fourth of July at Melbourne Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans Jennifer Capriati and Lindsay Davenport won in
straight sets Tuesday to set up a women's semifinal, and Andre
Agassi and Pete Sampras did the same to set up a men's semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Though Agassi finished last year ranked No. 1 and Sampras at No.
3, Sampras defeated Agassi in all four matches they played that
really mattered in 1999. His only loss came in the round-robin
segment of the year-end championships he ended up winning, and one
of the victories was worth the Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the greatest big-situation, big-match players who
have ever played the game, and his record certainly shows that,''
Agassi said. ``Every time we're playing, it's at a stage of the
tournament when he's probably the least vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi looked anything but vulnerable against the unseeded
Hicham Arazi of Morocco, winning by 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 in 1 hour 32
minutes. He handled the varied pace and moods Arazi conjured up
with the same brutally efficient and frequently spectacular ease
that he handled Mark Philippoussis' enormous power in the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was not quite so brilliant in his 7-5, 6-3, 6-3 victory
over unseeded Chris Woodruff, who hails from Knoxville, Tenn., but
he did hit a high percentage of first serves in play for the second
straight match, which bodes well for his encounter with Agassi on
this quick court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was playing one-on-one with Michael Jordan,''
Woodruff said. ``He brought the A game today. He came ready to play
from the first ball. I didn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sampras holds a 17-11 edge in their career meetings,
Agassi defeated Sampras in the 1995 Australian Open final, his sole
title here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stands on the baseline and is basically looking you in the
eye and saying, `Ace me!''' Sampras said. ``And if you don't ace
him, he is going to pounce on that second serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said of Sampras: ``With Pete, there's a certain respect
that goes along with playing him that makes you focus even more.
With the respect comes a level of anticipation and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other men's quarterfinals, to be played Wednesday,
Nicolas Kiefer was scheduled to face Magnus Norman, and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov was scheduled to face another Moroccan, unseeded Younes
el-Aynaoui.
</P>
<P>
   While Agassi, Sampras and Davenport played outdoors Tuesday,
Capriati played indoors on the same court earlier after Open
organizers decided to close the roof above the newly renamed Rod
Laver Arena because of light rain.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Davenport was overwhelming in a 6-1, 6-2
defeat of Julie Halard-Decugis of France.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati required only 55 minutes to defeat Ai Sugiyama, 6-0,
6-2. Sugiyama's whose nervous play bore little resemblance to her
performances last week. She walked on the court with her left thigh
wrapped tightly, just as she had before her upset of fourth-seeded
Mary Pierce on Sunday, but she did not move or control the ball
nearly as well. That was partly because of the pressure and largely
because of Capriati.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Capriati, 23, has even handled the inevitable allusions to her
past with grace and good humor and demonstrated an ability to
express herself confidently in public, which has seldom been
apparent until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I've stopped thinking about what the world was
going to think of me,'' she said. ``That's a big step maybe in my
progress here. That's also because I changed my attitude. If I lost
a match, I wasn't just going to be destroyed by it or devastated.
There is always the next opportunity to go back and work on what I
did wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she kept coming back to the game despite the problems
her early involvement at the highest level had created for her, she
answered: ``Obviously, I didn't accomplish everything that I want.
If I would have stopped, it would have been a really short career.
So I thought I had a lot more tennis left in me, and that's what I
wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   She will be ranked in the top 20 for the first time in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   The other semifinalists will be determined Wednesday, when
top-seeded Martina Hingis faces Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Yelena
Likhovtseva plays Conchita Martinez.

MEETING SET FOR CUBAN BOY, GRANDMOTHERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and the grandmothers of Elian
Gonzalez on Tuesday pleaded for GOP lawmakers not to intervene in
his case, and federal officials forced the boy's Florida relatives
to set up a visit between the two women and the 6-year-old Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said late Tuesday that the relatives, who
have had custody of the boy since he was rescued at sea in
November, agreed to meet with the grandmothers on Wednesday. The
grandmothers planned to leave Washington for Miami Wednesday
morning if blizzard conditions abated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joined the grandmothers Tuesday in a plea to Republican
lawmakers to allow the courts to decide whether the boy should be
returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``He belongs in Cuba,'' Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal
grandmother, told reporters following a meeting on Capitol Hill
with Democratic lawmakers who are trying to head off Republican
efforts in Congress to grant U.S. citizenship to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was born in Cuba, and he is a Cuban citizen,'' a tearful
Quintana said after meeting with Democratic Reps. Sheila Jackson
Lee of Houston and James McGovern of Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton did not meet with Quintana and the boy's
maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, he accused Republicans in a
news conference of playing politics with the boy's immigration
case, and he said he ``would not rule out'' vetoing any bill that
attempts to grant citizenship to Elian before the courts act.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, I would like to see this court case played out
before the Congress takes action,'' Clinton said, when asked about
Elian's case.
</P>
<P>
   The small boy was found clinging to an inner tube in the Florida
Straits two months ago, after his mother apparently drowned along
with 10 other Cubans while attempting to cross from Cuba to the
Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   He has since been placed in the custody of relatives in Miami.
But Elian has become embroiled in a political tug of war with his
father and the Cuban government of Fidel Castro on one side
demanding his return, and Cuban American exiles backed by
conservative Republicans on the other side doing everything they
can to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Although careful not to appear as if it is siding with Havana,
the Clinton administration is nonetheless backing a recent decision
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service ordering Elian to be
reunited with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made after an INS review of the case determined
that the boy would be better off with his father, who was unaware
that his ex-wife had left Cuba with his son until he was notified
by relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials concluded that the boy had a close relationship
with his father, and that he apparently spent more time with his
father in Cuba than with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The INS decision has prompted a federal lawsuit from the
relatives in Miami, who have enlisted the support of Cuban exile
groups and GOP lawmakers to help them make their case. Sen. Connie
Mack, R-Fla., and others have further complicated the case by
introducing legislation in Congress that would grant U.S.
citizenship to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters through an interpreter, Rodriguez said
that granting American citizenship to her grandson would only make
the situation ``more painful'' for his father and the rest of his
family in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back tears, she said she was still hopeful that Elian
would be allowed to return to Cuba with his grandmothers. The
grandmothers tried to meet with Elian in Miami Monday evening, but
the boy's Miami relatives refused to allow the women to meet with
their grandson alone in a ``neutral meeting place.'' The Miami
relatives insisted that the meeting take place in their home and in
their presence.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials notified the Miami relatives by letter that they
had to allow the boy to meet alone with his granmothers by
Wednesday or risk losing temporary custody of him until the case is
settled.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration order set a meeting at 4 p.m. at the Miami Beach
home of Barry University President Jeanne O'Laughlin, a sister in
the Dominican order.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the meantime, called for all sides in the case to
remain calm, to put aside their own political views on Cuba and to
think about ``what is right for the child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can really know for sure, I suppose, what terrible and
probably not fully conscious burdens that child has already
sustained because he lost his mother and because now he's being
competed for in a way that is unusual for a 6-year-old child,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just somehow wish that whatever is best for this child could
be done. I know there are people who genuinely disagree about that
because plainly he would have more economic opportunity in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, however, Republicans were pressing ahead with
their plans to block the INS' legal authority in the case and to
circumvent the federal courts as well by making Elian a citizen.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., scheduled debate and a
possible vote on Mack's bill in the Senate for Wednesday, and the
House was expected to take up a similar measure next week.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a move by Jackson Lee and other Democrats in the
House to bring up legislation calling for the boy to be repatriated
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason for legislation to give Elian citizenship at
this time,'' said Jackson Lee, the ranking Democrat on the House
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration. She suggested that Clinton
veto any citizenship measure, if it comes to that, so the case can
remain under INS jurisdiction.

BILL WOULD CURB DORM ROOM VISITS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   (Phoenix) - Do boys belong in girls' dorm rooms?
</P>
<P>
   Not if it's after midnight or before 6 a.m. _ unless they're
relatives or it's finals week.
</P>
<P>
   That's the opinion of three state legislators who want to crack
down on opposite-sex visits in state university dormitories. The
bill also would prohibit alco hol and pets from dorm rooms.
</P>
<P>
   To enforce those rules, stu dents' rooms would be randomly
inspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mixing the sexes room by room is not very conducive to the
learning process,'' said Rep. Jean McGrath, R-Glendale, one of the
bill's three sponsors. ``This bill returns a level of sanity to
their living quarters, which they do not have right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good to a certain point,'' said Erik Olson, a
19-year-old business major at Arizona State
University. &UR; ``Basically, any thing can go on here.''
</P>
<P>
   But most students said the proposal is out of step with campus
life. They note that when campus libraries close, typically at
midnight, they have nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten p.m. is just when I'm opening my books,'' ASU junior
Danelle Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, also sponsored by Reps. Barbara Blewster and Mark
Anderson, passed its first committee vote Tuesday, 4-2, along party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   It now goes to the rules com mittee and then to the House floor
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Although universities nation ally have been cracking down on
campus alcohol use, few have imposed visitation rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not very common and certainly not by a legislature,''
said Gary Schwarzmueller, exec utive director of the Association of
College and University Hous ing Officers International. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ When Al Gore moved his campaign headquarters to
Nashville, close to his family's hometown of Carthage in Tennessee,
he lost some of his most loyal Washington-based staff who refused
to move south.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the losses, however, turned to gains, and one of these
was Donna Brazile, who took over last October as his campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
   With a reputation for tough tactics that sometimes take her into
ethically risky territory, Brazile immediately brought an attacking
ruthlessness to his campaign that it had lacked until then.
</P>
<P>
   A woman, and black, Brazile brought these ``minority'' elements
to a campaign team that was conspicuously male and white.
</P>
<P>
   She immediately attracted attention in her own right, and within
a couple of weeks her sturdy and determined features had replaced
those of Naomi Wolf, Gore's controversial feminist adviser, in his
news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   One of Brazile's first actions as campaign manager, in fact, was
to cut Wolf's fee in half.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile, who is in her early 40s, is respected as one of the
most experienced organizers in the Democratic Party. A native of
New Orleans and a graduate of Louisiana State University, she is a
longstanding protege of Rev. Jesse Jackson and has combined
political work with a lectureship in politics at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   She was deputy national field director for Michael Dukakis in
the 1988 presidential campaign. But that was not an entirely happy
experience: She was forced to resign after suggesting that
Dukakis's Republican opponent, then-Vice President George Bush, had
been unfaithful to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sent his son and campaign coordinator, George W. _ now the
Republican front-runner, and the candidate Brazile is likely to be
campaigning against if she successfully steers Gore to the
Democratic nomination _ out to deny the allegation, which he did
with eminent success.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile has applied scarcely less controversial methods in her
new client's campaign. Three weeks ago, she accused the Republican
Party of using eminent blacks such as General Colin Powell, the
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as window-dressing to
boost their anti-racist credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was reported to have telephoned Powell to apologize, but
the charge itself was not withdrawn. &QL;

KILMER RECALLS SUPER BOWL EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCONNELL  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Kilmer's advice to this year's Super Bowl teams: Be sure
to bring your ``A'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer, the former Citrus High, Citrus College and UCLA star,
speaks from experience. He was the losing quarterback in one of the
most storied Super Bowls ever 1973's Super Bowl VII, which matched
Don Shula's undefeated Miami Dolphins against George Allen's
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it was not a well-played game,'' Kilmer said of
the Dolphins' 14-7 victory at the Coliseum which wrapped up the
only undefeated season in NFL history. ``Those were two great
teams, and two great coaches, but the game itself wasn't much from
a fans' standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer points out that the Redskins entered the game as 2 1/2-
point favorites, and had knocked off the Dallas Cowboys, the
defending Super Bowl champions, in the NFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense allowed only two field goals in our two NFC
playoff wins,'' Kilmer said. ``So we were real confident going
in.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Kilmer and the 'Skins never got untracked. Miami took a
14-0 lead in the second quarter and the Washington offense never
did find the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were flat,'' Kilmer said. ``I don't know why, but we did
not play very well. They changed all their defensive schemes, and
just shut us down. Still, we should have been able to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I don't know if it was because of the two-week
layoff, the weird starting time of the game (it was the only Super
Bowl to kick off at noon, local time), or because we were TOO
confident. We just didn't have the same intensity and focus we had
in our 26-3 playoff win over Dallas which put us into the Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer, who played 15 years in the NFL, finds that most fans
remember him from that one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, they replay the thing on ESPN Classics all the
time,'' Kilmer said. ``I never watch, but I guess a lot of fans do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish we had played our game. It was a great thrill to
have played in a Super Bowl, but to this day it still eats at me
that we didn't show the fans the real Redskins. For me personally,
it was rough because I played an awful game, threw three
interceptions and overthrew a wide-open receiver in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I am glad to have played in the game, but I regret not
having played better.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen always regarded the 1972 Redskins as his best team. They
went 16-2 prior to the loss in the Super Bowl. He felt the two-week
layoff before the game and the Super Bowl media hoopla took the
edge off his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have played Miami the week after we beat Dallas,
we would have won,'' Allen, now deceased, said in a 1990 interview.
``Players love a routine, and hate distractions. Our routine was
disrupted, and the coaching staff didn't do a good job of keeping
the distractions to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's a funny thing. Since that Super Bowl I've got
to know a lot of the Dolphins players, including Jake Scott, who
was the MVP of that game. And they tell me the same thing, that
they were uptight for the game and didn't play their best ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Shula was a great coach, and so was George Allen. But up
to that point, Shula had the reputation as a coach who had never
won the big game. So he was under a lot of pressure. And the Miami
players were under a lot of pressure because of their winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast, Allen had that reputation of a guy who would
always find a way to win. As I said, we were very, very confident
going in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if there was a key to the game, it was the fact that
they had played in the Super Bowl the year before and did a better
job than our guys of shutting out all that pre-game garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer likes the Rams in this year's game, but admits it is an
intriguing matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to like the Rams, since the game is being played in
Atlanta in a dome on artificial turf. The Rams are used to all
those things, the Titans aren't. I think the Rams will settle down,
go back to playing their game, and just go right after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I like the fact that Tennessee has overcome a lot to
get here. I think if there is a key to the game, it will be Steve
McNair, the Titans' quarterback. If the Rams contain him, keep him
in the pocket, he can't beat 'em. But if he gets loose, if he's
able to scramble, things are going to be very interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange things can happen in a Super Bowl. Believe me, I
know.''

BUDGET SURPLUS EXPECTED TO GROW SUBSTANTIALLY OVER NEXT 10 YEARS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Driven by the strong economy and the resulting
flood of tax revenues, the federal budget surplus will surge over
the next decade to levels that would have been inconceivable only a
few years ago, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report
made public on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under assumptions, including a deep cut in spending next year,
traditionally used to project the budget outlook, the surplus
outside of the Social Security system for the next 10 years would
total more than $1.9 trillion, nearly twice as much as estimated by
the budget office last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Using other assumptions that provide for higher spending levels,
the 10-year surplus projections outside of Social Security would
range from $838 billion to more than $1.8 trillion. The surplus in
the Social Security system, which is projected to turn into a deep
deficit within 20 years as the baby boom generation retires, was
estimated by the budget office at $2.3 trillion over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term budget projections have proven notoriously volatile
and unreliable. A decade ago, when deficits appeared immutable, no
one would have dared to predict that the government would be in
surplus today. But just as the long economic expansion has now
brightened the fiscal picture more than analysts had expected, so
too could a downturn darken it.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the new surplus numbers are qualified, they are
big and will effectively expand the parameters of an election-year
debate between the two parties over how best to use the bounty of
the nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the new estimates emerged, all the leading
presidential candidates had offered plans to divide the surplus
between tax cuts, spending programs, reducing the national debt and
putting Social Security and Medicare on a sounder footing for an
aging population. The sharp divisions between and within the
parties on the campaign trail mirror the political and ideological
clash in Washingon that has left Congress and the Clinton
administration deadlocked over fiscal policy for the last several
years.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the surplus estimates also allowed the
Republican majority in Congress to claim that it had stuck to its
pledge not to dip into Social Security money to pay for general
government operations during the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Under prior projections by the budget office, the spending bills
passed by Congress last year required borrowing $17 billion from
Social Security this year. But the new projections show that there
will be an operating surplus for this year of $23 billion, a swing
of $40 billion that insulates Republicans from charges of fiscal
irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will issue its own surplus
projections in two weeks. President Clinton has laid out an
ambitious series of tax and spending initiatives in the last few
weeks in an indication that the budget proposal he sends to
Congress next month will not be shy about putting the projected
surplus to use.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to bolster his case that spending increases in
an era of surpluses can coexist with fiscal prudence, Clinton said
on Tuesday that he intends to push for accelerated repayment of the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in the White House briefing room, Clinton said he
would offer a plan to pay off by 2013 the entire $3.6 trillion owed
by the federal government to the public in the form of Treasury
bonds. He did not provide any details. Last year, Clinton proposed
a similar plan to pay off the public debt by 2015, and House
Republicans are currently developing a plan that would also
eliminate the debt by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   The total national debt of $5.7 trillion includes both the
public debt and more than $2 trillion owed by the government to the
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office projections goes only to 2010, but they show
that the debt would be reduced to $941 billion by that point if all
of the Social Security surpluses are used for debt reduction, as
both parties have more or less agreed to do.
</P>
<P>
   The political ramifications from the new surplus estimates could
be substantial. In Congress, Democrats said that with so much money
on the table it will be increasingly difficult for them to beat
back all Republican efforts to cut taxes. In particular, Democrats
are considering supporting some version of proposals by Republicans
to reduce the so-called marriage penalty paid by many two-income
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the bigger pot of money will increase the
pressure on them to agree to some version of Clinton's main
priority, an expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas will be able to claim that his big tax cut proposal is more
prudent than it looked when the surplus estimate was smaller. On
the Democratic side, former Sen. Bill Bradley might be less
vulnerable to assertions by Vice President Al Gore that his
health-care and poverty-fighting programs are budget-busters.

 WASHINGTON: budget-busters.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In developing its projections, the budget office offered three
scenarios that provide a sense of what the government's books would
look like under different assumptions about spending levels.
</P>
<P>
   The main projection, yielding a non-Social Security surplus
estimate of $1.92 trillion over 10 years, uses assumptions that
have been standard for budget forecasting for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   It assumes that Congress and the administration will cut
spending for each of the next two years to meet spending limits
written into law in 1997, and then hold spending increases to the
rate of inflation for the rest of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties have shattered the spending caps each of the
last two years in all but the most technical sense. With the
surplus growing, there is almost no one on Capitol Hill who
advocates trying to meet the limits next year. Doing so would
require cutting outlays in annually appropriated programs _ the
third of the total federal budget that includes most operations
other than Social Security, Medicare and interest payments _ to
$579 billion next year from $606 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans support use of another set of numbers that
starts with current spending levels, but then assumes that spending
is frozen, without any adjustment for inflation, at that level for
the rest of the decade. Under such a scenario, the non-Social
Security surplus would total $1.86 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats said that a freeze is totally unrealistic,
especially since even the Republican-led Congress has regularly
voted for spending increases. Democrats tend to prefer the third
scenario, under which spending is assumed to start at current
levels, and then to grow at the inflation rate for the rest of the
decade. Under that scenario, the non-Social Security surplus over
10 years would be $838 billion, far less than under either of the
two other options.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, the Republican from New Mexico who is
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Republicans have not
yet decided which surplus projections to use in developing a budget
this year, and added that he might develop a fourth option. But he
said it is unlikely that there will be any effort to cut spending
to adhere to the limits set in 1997, suggesting that the caps will
be scrapped this year or reset at higher levels.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Threatened with an order from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives agreed
Tuesday to permit the 6-year-old boy to meet his Cuban grandmothers
privately Wednesday at a neutral location outside the family's
house.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after immigration officials ratcheted up the
pressure on the family, warning them in a letter that if they did
not agree to a meeting on neutral ground the agency could revoke
Elian's ``parole,'' or his temporary permission to remain in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers will meet Elian at 4 p.m. at the home of Sister
Jeanne O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University and a nun
belonging to the Dominican order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reiterated that the grandmothers will not be able to
take him with them at this time,'' said Carole Florman, a Justice
Department spokeswoman. Ms. Florman added that the INS's demand for
a meeting was not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Another Justice Department official said the family ``needed to
understand the seriousness'' of the meeting, which is why the INS's
letter was sternly worded.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decisions on how to deal with the
case have been made within the Justice Department by Attorney
General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, the immigration
commissioner, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been mostly those two,'' said a senior Justice Department
official, asserting that the White House had not been involved
directly in decision-making in the case. ``We have kept them
informed,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``But we haven't sought or received any input from them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Elian's grandmothers delivered tearful pleas
Tuesday to sympathetic lawmakers, who vowed to block legislation in
the House and Senate to make Elian a U.S. citizen. Outraged Senate
Democrats pledged to filibuster the Senate bill if it reached the
floor, which could happen as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton jumped into the fray, urging Congress to hold
off on such legislation until litigation concerning Elian is
resolved. Clinton also held out the possibility that he would veto
the citizenship measure if it clears Congress. ``Plainly,'' Clinton
said, ``he would have more economic opportunity in this country,
but all the evidence indicates that his father genuinely loved
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle in Miami, Lazaro Gonzalez, has sued the
federal government to block the boy's return to his father, arguing
that sending him back to Cuba is tantamount to child abuse. Elian's
mother and 10 others died when their makeshift boat capsized after
departing Cuba. Elian was picked up as he drifted on an inner tube
on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   By making Elian a citizen, lawmakers said they hope to remove
the immigration complications from the case, including the federal
lawsuit, and focus it solely on the custody issue. A second bill
that would make him a permanent resident is also expected to be
taken up by the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton expressed concern Tuesday that Congress' action may
set a hasty, complex precedent that has not been thoroughly
analyzed. ``I mean this sort of thing could happen again because
you have so many people coming to our shores from all these
different countries,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several sympathetic members of Congress, pledging to derail the
legislation, traveled to Capitol Hill despite Tuesday's snowstorm
and met with Elian's grandmothers, who camed bundled up in new
winter coats and boots. The grandmothers passed around a photo
album of their family in Cuba and beseeched the lawmakers to end
the delays barring their grandson from his homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers, who dabbed at their eyes with balled-up
tissue, said they had been unable to see their grandson Monday
after their request for a neutral meeting place was declined by
their Miami relatives. The women said Gonzalez's home in the Little
Havana neighborhood of Miami, which has been ringed by
Cuban-American opponents of Fidel Castro day and night, would be
too fiery a location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked to have a neutral gathering with just the child,''
said Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother, following a
meeting with Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, who sits on the
immigration subcommittee. ``But they didn't accept that. They want
to have this in their house, full of people, and with a party. I'm
not up to a party. I just want to see my grandchild alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Rodriguez said she did not want to see Elian's Miami
relatives. ``They have offended me on the phone, they have offended
me on television,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has said he invited the grandmothers to visit Elian in
his home so the women could see where Elian lives and see that he
is loved.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a longtime advocate for lifting
the economic embargo against Cuba, decried the citizenship
legislation, calling it ``pathetic.'' And he, along with several
other Democrats and an influential Republican, Sen. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, said they hope to convince lawmakers not to offer the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy ought to go home and be with his father,'' Dodd said.
``It is shameful we're allowing it to become a national debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd added that Congress is ``allowing a group of people whose
animosity for an old man in Cuba to get in the way between a
father's love for his son and a son's love for his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel called the conversation with the grandmothers
``revealing'' and added that he would speak with Sen. Trent Lott,
the Republican majority leader, to convince him to abandon plans to
bring the legislation to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious to me that this was not a woman fleeing from a
tyrannical regime that was oppressing her and her family and her
six-year- old,'' Hagel said, noting the grandmothers' earlier
assertions that Elian's mother was forced to take the boat by
Elian's stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., and Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said they
would ask Clinton to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging support in Congress is difficult at this point, with
lawmakers on both sides of the issue saying they expect a messy
fight. ``I don't have illusions that this is a slam dunk,'' said
Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who has introduced one of the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail have embraced
the decision on Elian's future, turning the diplomatic tug-of-war
into an opportunity to vilify Castro and communism. But some
conservative Republicans, in keeping with their commitment to
family values, said they object to dividing a father and son and
are not expected to support the bill.

TOP LINES NEED TO PRODUCE FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS -- Even with their six-game losing streak in December, Ki
ngs coach Andy Murray never looked worse than he did after last
Thursday 5-2 loss to the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that he was tired of talking about the Stars 21-game
unbeaten streak against the Kings. What drained him was the way
some of h is top players vanished during critical moments of an
important Western Conference game. There was Bryan Smolinski, who
did not even take a shot against the Stars. There was Ziggy Palffy,
who was held without a point just two days after a two-goal game
against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get more consistency out of our top lines,'' Murray
repeated before the club left for tonight's game against the Dallas
Stars. ``Some nights it just doesn't seem like they are out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray has pointed several times this season to the Kings lack
of playoff experience as an ingredient to their inconsistency,
especially on the road where the team is 1-7-1 since opening the
season 8-3-3. Palffy has never played in the postseason. Smolinski
hasn't been there in four years. Their effort on the defensive end
also has been scrutinized. But Murray points to Stars forward Mike
Modano as a player who overcame similar shortcomings to become one
of the league's top players.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was an assistant with the Minnesota North Stars when
Modano was establishing himself in the early 1990s. ``I'm sure
there were a lot of conversations between Mike and Bob Gainey,''
said Murray, referring to the Stars' GM and former captain of
Stanley Cup champions in Montreal. ``The Stars also have surrounded
him with vete ran players who have been there, like Brett Hull. Now
he's one of the leaders. It's all part of matur ing.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano was a 50-goal scorer during the 1993-94 season, the Stars
first in Dallas, but was considered one dimensional. Now he has
made th e All-Star team the past two seasons and won a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Quick Whistles: The Kings open a three-game trip tonight that
also will take them to Nashville on Thursday and Toronto on
Saturday. None of the games will be televised. ..... Stephane
Fiset, who Sunday played his best game in goal since before
bruising his right hand Nov. 6, will start tonight against Dallas.
... Veteran left-winger Bill Huard, s igned in November to add
toughness to the club, was traded to the expansion Atlanta
Thrashers on Tuesday for future considerations. Huard played three
games with the Kings and 14 with minor league Lowell, Mass.

LAKERS EAGER TO USE NEW PRACTICE FACILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Flailing on the court, the Lakers at least can
savor some good news off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the news (begin ital)is(end ital) a court. The Lakers,
with fingers crossed, are targeting mid-February for a
long-anticipated move to their new practice facility in El Segundo.
</P>
<P>
   Laker officials, still operating out of the Forum, hope to move
into their new offices around All-Star weekend, Feb. 12. The
practice court, weight room and other facilities for the players
and coaches should be ready shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to have our move completed by the conclusion of
All-Star weekend,'' said general manager Mitch Kupchak, ``and I
knock on wood as I say that. There's still a lot of work to get
done, but they're moving very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The $24 million HealthSouth Training Center, a campus that also
houses the Kings (who moved in last week), was supposed to be ready
by October or November. Target move-in dates have come and gone
several times since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd be in much earlier, so it's been a little
frustrating. It's like putting off Christmas,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers organization has been split between three sites ever
since they began playing at Staples Center in November.
Administrative offices remain at the Forum (which has since been
sold to the Kings). Practices are mostly held down the road at L.A.
Southwest College, and occasionally at the Forum, while game-day
shootarounds are at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   At HealthSouth, the Lakers will have two full-length courts,
with an intersecting main court that simulates the floor at Staples
Center. The Lakers maintain a satellite office at Staples, but
day-to-day operations will be headquartered at HealthSouth, in
upstairs offices that overlook the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a source of pride, I think, that we'll all share,''
Kupchak said. ``To have your own court, dedicated to your team...
if players want to come by on their own and shoot at any point in
time or come in early or stay late, they can walk into an empty
gym.''
</P>
<P>
   The center includes an amphitheater for game-film sessions, a
weight room and a hydrotherapy pool used for rehabilitating
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, for Tyronn Lue (who just had knee surgery), that
will be an incredible benefit for him, to be able to go to
practices or meetings, and then walk 15 feet for state-of-the-art
therapy,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping: The Lakers have lost four of their last six games to
follow a 16-game winning streak, but the results shouldn't be
entirely surprising. The four teams they lost to were a combined
111-53 (.677) through Monday's games and included two division
leaders (Utah and Indiana) and the team with the second-best record
in the league (Portland).
</P>
<P>
   All four losses were decided late in the fourth quarter or, in
the loss to Utah, overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have nothing to hang our heads about,'' Kobe Bryant
said. ``We have to keep fighting. We can't be down on ourselves.
That's just nonsense.... We haven't been as high (emotionally) as
we were. But we just have to respond to the challenge. It's a long
season. We're not playing for right now. We're playing for
championship time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson gave his team the day off Tuesday. The Lakers
don't play again until Friday, when they play host to Milwaukee.

CAMPAIGN STRATEGY STATUS QUO FOR GORE; BRADLEY DECRYING `ATTACK
POLITICS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Looking for traction in snowbound New Hampshire,
Bill Bradley says he is banking on a high-minded, innocent kind of
politics ``where what you believe is more important than your
tactics, where what you are for is worth more than what you are
against.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bradley campaign showed Tuesday that it is willing to
practice some old-style, traditional politicking in an attempt to
return the spark to his effort against Vice President Al Gore in
the Democratic presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley arrived in New Hampshire before dawn Tuesday,
after Gore's nearly 2-to-1 victory over Bradley in the Iowa
caucuses Monday. Gore's victory there had been long predicted, but
surveys in the nation's first primary state show the Democrats
even.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted Gore was welcomed by hundreds of screaming students
at West High School in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all of the voters of New Hampshire to know that I know
New Hampshire doesn't take its cue or lead from anywhere else, and
I'm asking you for your vote and your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a California-based political analyst who
has observed the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, was asked late
Monday in Des Moines if Gore had to do anything differently over
the next week before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary: ``It doesn't
look like it. The next move is Bradley's. Gore just sits back and
waits. Why should he change his strategy?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it seemed as if Gore were already looking ahead to the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took shots at Bradley's health care plan and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's ``huge, risky tax scheme,'' as well as the
philosophy of the other Republicans in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Republican candidates are concerned, let me just ask
you, do you believe that we should defend a woman's right to
choose? Do you believe, as George W. Bush said he believes, that a
proposal to have the United States provide leadership on cleaning
up the environment is extremism?'' he asked. ``I believe now is the
time to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's strategy for New Hampshire's primary became clearer
through the snow flurries Tuesday: Decry ``attack politics'' in
hopes that the generally sanguine electorate will convert a
seething disgust with politics into votes for a politician who
holds himself above the fray. But at the same time, use surrogates
to attack the attacks of the attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speech at the high school was rambling and often
technical, making the children sleepy or restless and providing
less than a dramatic moment for his New Hampshire stretch run. But
the speech also revealed other elements of Bradley's new approach
when he made fresh remarks about his work on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New Jersey, said he
demonstrated through his toils to close tax loopholes and expand
international trade that he has a knack for seeing into the future
of the nation's economic needs. Apparently he is not only trying to
show he is experienced, like Gore, but also that he has a
foundation for proposing his sweeping health care reform package.
</P>
<P>
   More sweeping and more expensive than Gore's, Bradley's plan
calls for the government to spend $25 billion on tax cuts and
subsidies that would allow poor and middle-class families to buy
private health care insurance or use the policy plan that covers
members of Congress and federal workers. Gore has used campaign ads
to criticize the plan as inadequate for some citizens and too
costly for the government. Bradley says the criticism is founded on
untruths.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also used his campaign event Tuesday to hone his
rhetoric on campaign finance reform. Going further than Gore on the
topic, he says the federal government should use tax money to
replace private donations to federal campaigns as a way of blunting
the influence of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a new kind of politics for the new millennium,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's turn-the-other-cheek approach to ``negative''
campaigning did not deliver the surprise win he was looking for in
Iowa. Another test of his lofty approach comes Wednesday night when
he and Gore engage in a televised debate in Manchester, N.H.,
immediately after the Republicans in a debate double feature.
Criticizing Gore would violate Bradley's self-imposed rules, and
not criticizing him might leave him open to the kind of damage he
suffered in Iowa, where Gore hammered on his record's shortcomings
on farm issues to great effect.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is looking to fare better here than in Iowa, partly
because of the mechanics and rules of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has a history of independent thinking,'' he told
reporters Tuesday. ``Nobody tells you what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was apparently a reference to Gore's organizational strength
and support for labor unions in Iowa, where the results are
determined not by balloting but at evening meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where voters register by party or official
nonaffiliation, a third of the voters label themselves independent.
They can switch for the primaries and vote in either the GOP or
Democratic contests.
</P>
<P>
   With their self-described insurgent campaigns, Bradley and
Republican John McCain are considered the most likely to pick up
independent votes. In a bad omen for Bradley, though, a Franklin
Pierce College poll released Monday indicated that independent
voters will tend to break toward the Republican side.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he protests the elevation of campaign tactics, Bradley's
team is not above gimmickry. Before his speech at the high school,
a campaign volunteer handed out blue Bradley campaign signs and
instructed the youngsters to display them toward the TV cameras at
the back to the room. When Bradley came to the microphone, he saw a
sea of white rectangles. The signs were blank on the other side.

   NEW YORK _ With much of the Eastern Seaboard paralyzed by a
larger-than-expected winter storm, New York City moaned and groaned
to life Tuesday, in sometimes improbable ways. One teacher took her
class on an impromptu winter field trip to Central Park. In Upper
Manhattan, a cross-country skier was spotted gliding along a
sidewalk just after 8 a.m., imploring storekeepers as they
shoveled: ``Not so fast! Not so fast!''
</P>
<P>
   By noon, confident city officials had declared victory over the
storm, praising their storm preparations lavishly.
</P>
<P>
   A little luck helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected surge of dry air spared New York and New Jersey
the worst. While North Carolina dug out from 20 inches of snow, the
heaviest local accumulations, up to 12 inches, were reported in New
Jersey, while eastern Long Island had only a few inches. Up to six
inches fell in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was no sleigh ride. Throughout the morning rush,
billowing clouds of snow blew up and down and sideways, and those
who insisted on walking to work felt as if their faces were being
rubbed into a snow bank.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, children awoke to two of their favorite words
_ ``School canceled'' _ and parents, peeking out frost-covered
bedroom windows, pondered their dispensability at work.
</P>
<P>
   La Guardia Airport was closed at 6:10 a.m. Tuesday, but John F.
Kennedy and Newark airports remained open, although with major
delays. Hundreds of flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expected the snow, sleet and freezing rain to taper
off overnight Tuesday. Wednesday and Thursday are expected to be
cloudy and windy, with a few flurries and highs in the low 30s. A
gale warning was in effect for coastal waters off Long Island and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The storm Tuesday was only the second major snowfall in New York
this season. All winter, the service staff at Argento &AMP; Sons in
White Plains, which sells and repairs garden equipment and
snowblowers, twiddled their thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the snow, and Tuesday they leapt into action as dozens
of Westchester residents streamed in with blowers suffering from
snapped belts and clogged carburetors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the roads were cleared it was like mayhem,'' said Jim
Rourke, the parts manager.
</P>
<P>
   It was controlled chaos at many New York City schools, with
fidgety children eager to get out into the snow and parents calling
offices to find out if after-school programs were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess,'' said one frazzled secretary at Public School
132 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey mobilized 1,700 plows, Connecticut deployed 1,000,
New York City a total of 1,300 plows and salt spreaders. To little
effect. Streets everywhere were choked by a goopy, oatmeal-like
slush, and on many highways drivers hugged the center because there
was no way to see lane markers.
</P>
<P>
   The driving was so treacherous that some motorists simply
abandoned their cars, and the police reported hundreds of traffic
accidents, mostly fender benders.
</P>
<P>
   In Rye, N.Y., Chris Acuna, 19, mourned his crumpled right front
fender.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first car that I really owned,'' he said of his
1987 Mitsubishi Montero. ``My brother, who told me not to go out
today, will say, `I told you so.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Water main breaks forced the closing of the Bronx River Parkway
from the Cross County Parkway in Yonkers to 233rd Street in the
Bronx. In Queens, a power failure left about 1,000 people without
electricity. Many malls closed early.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani went so far as to offer advice as how
best to shovel snow, noting that a 58-year-old Staten Island man
had died of a heart attack earlier Tuesday while doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just move the snow out of the way, don't lift it up,'' he
said.

A NEW FEELING FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC forward Brian Scalabrine tore a paper off his
bedroom wall last month that listed his preseason goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were struggling with a 5-5 record, and the 6-foot-9
junior didn't want to remind himself how optimistic he had been
before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it off the wall, and threw it all away and said, `I'll
just tak e it game by game,' '' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he didn't actually throw it away. ``I put it underneath my
stereo, '' Scalabrine admitted.
</P>
<P>
   He might consider tacking the paper back on the wall,
considering USC is 5-0 in the Pacific-10 Conference (12-5 overall)
and ranked 23rd in the Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he'll keep it under the stereo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to talk about goals any more. I don't want
to jinx it,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   As the surprising Trojans head up to Oregon this weekend, more
and more people are beginning to wonder how long this current run
will continue?
</P>
<P>
   Can USC possibly maintain its success, or at least remain in the
top four in the conference with little depth and without leading
scorer and rebounder Sam Clancy, who is sidelined with a broken
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's going to be more difficult,'' said long-time
Pac-10 basketball TV analyst Dan Belluomini. ``Can they sustain it?
If they stay out of foul trouble. Can they stay in the top three?
Yes, without any more injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Belluomini, who coached at the University of San Francisco,
believes the Trojans can remain in the upper half of the conference
because point guard Brandon Granville and shooting guard Jeff
Trepagnier have become dependable players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granville is one of the best point guards in the conference,
and Trepagnier's emerged as an all-around player,'' Belluomini
said. ``And Henry Bibby's as good as any of the top coaches I've
seen in the last 14 years covering the league.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if that's true, there are still plenty of doubts that
USC will remain among the conference's elite, especially
considering the Trojans were picked to finish seventh in the Pac-10
preseason poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people will think are our team is a fluke the whole
season,'' forward David Bluthenthal said. ``Being in the top four,
I think that's the goal. That's what we've been talking about and I
think it'll happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is about to change for the Trojans. After playing
their first five games with little pressure and often as the
perceived underdog, they will not be sneaking up on any more teams,
especially Oregon, which is only a game behind USC with a 4-1
record (13-3 overall).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the big target on our backs now,'' Trepagnier said.
``We know people will be gunning for us. We have to play better
than in the first five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine was skeptical, however, that the Trojans will be a
major focus for teams getting ready to play USC and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the whole bull's eye is on us,'' he said. ``I
still think (Oregon) might be looking to UCLA, as opposed to
overlooking UCLA and thinking let's get USC.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Scalabrine wrote on his paper that USC would
need to go 10-8 in the Pac-10 to make the NCAA Tournament. That
means the Trojans would only have to win five of their remaining 13
games.
</P>
<P>
   No Pac-10 team that has won 10 games has missed the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you're 10-8 in the conference and have some
significant wins over top 25 teams, you can get in,'' Belluomini
said. ``But a lot will depend on the other conference tournaments
around the country. But fourth place in the Pac-10 will get you
in.''
</P>
<P>
   In Scalabrine's mind, it will depend on how much USC's big four
of Bluthenthal, Granville, Trepagnier and himself perform the final
seven weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep this up, we'll do it with David playing at the
level he played at last week, and Jeff and myself stepping up 15-20
percent and Brandon just doing what he's been doing,'' Scalabrine
said. ``I think if we sustain it as individuals, then it will come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, USC coach Henry Bibby is trying to turn the Trojans'
adversity into a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Arizona and they were the No. 2 team in the
country, and have four guys,'' Bibby said. ``This is what we have
to go with. There's no other way. I'm pleased with what we have and
we've been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a negative. Is there pressure on them? Yes,
but that's part of being in first place. I'd rather have that
pressure than be in last place right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC coach Henry Bibby was incensed Tuesday that the
Pacific-10 Conference issued only a public reprimand to Arizona
forward Michael Wright for an ``apparently intentional elbow'' he
delivered to the face of USC forward Abdullah Elmagbari last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was placed on probation for the remainder of the season
by the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had any of the game officials seen the incident, Mr. Wright
certainly would have been ejected from the game,'' Pac-10
commissioner Tom Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bibby: ``It is no action at all by the Pac-10. It's a slap
on the wrist. You can't elbow a guy blatantly and have nothing
happen. I don't know ho w the officials didn't see it. I talked to
Booker Turner (supervisor of officials) and he said they didn't see
it.''

MRS. CLINTON ATTACKS GIULIANI'S SCHOOLS AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton sharpened her attacks on
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's education agenda Tuesday, criticizing
his support for school vouchers and suggesting that his attacks on
the New York City Board of Education were counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton never once mentioned the name of her likely
opponent in this year's race for the U.S. Senate. But she left
little doubt about her meaning in a speech to members of the State
Council of Superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she shrugged off questions by a radio talk show host in
Albany, who asked her why she elicited such intense dislike from
certain people. She first said it might be because she was a woman
but then flippantly added that some people did not like her hair
style. Later in the day, she tried to tamp down efforts by
Republicans who suggested that she was trying to inject ``gender
politics'' into the race.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton sought to keep the focus of her Albany appearances
on an issue that she believes will be important. Giuliani has been
highly critical of the city's school board, orchestrating the
ouster of Chancellor Rudy Crew in December.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton tried to draw clear distinctions between her
solutions and the mayor's, saying she would strive to be a
constructive force in the debate on how to improve the state's most
troubled schools. ``When it comes to education, we have real
problems,'' she said. ``We have real problems that demand action,
not rhetoric or political posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   She also reiterated her opposition to school vouchers, something
that she believes would undermine the public school system.
Giuliani has long wanted to offer vouchers to parents who want to
send their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton offered her own prescription for the problems
plaguing public schools, focusing at one point on a looming
shortage of teachers that schools face. The solution she offered
was a plan to make it easier for retirees and professionals from
other fields to teach in public schools. On the talk show on
WGY-AM, Don Weeks, the host, asked Mrs. Clinton specifically if she
ever wondered why people were ``foaming at the mouth'' at the
mention of her name. After momentary laughter from Mrs. Clinton,
Weeks asked if she ``ever tried to understand that venom and does
it bother you?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton replied: ``I know that it's out there and I think
some of it is because of the positions that I've taken and maybe a
little of it is because I'm a woman taking those positions. And,
maybe some of it is people don't like my hair style. I don't know
what it is.'' Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said:
``First, it was a right-wing conspiracy. Then, we were told about a
secret network of extremists. Now, Mrs. Clinton is blaming her
campaign woes on her gender. What's next?''
</P>
<P>
   After her speech, Mrs. Clinton emphasized that she had only been
kidding, ``Maybe I'm not tall enough,'' she said. ``Maybe I'm not
short enough. You don't know.''

CANDIDATES TO FACE A LESS-CONSERVATIVE NEW HAMPSHIRE 
 
(RESENDING TO RESTORE GARBLED TYPE) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Anyone flying into New Hampshire's largest
city can't help but notice the latest addition to the landscape, a
six-story concrete parking garage that towers over the airport
terminal.
</P>
<P>
   This $46 million structure opened last month to cater to one of
the fastest-growing airports in the nation. It is a visible sign of
the demographic changes that also have transformed the politics of
the state that will be the host to the first presidential primary
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Often stereotyped by its picture-postcard hamlets, crusty
conservatives and rugged White Mountains, New Hampshire has
increasingly become a haven for high-tech baby boomers who have
crowded into the southeastern corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   These new voters shop at the megamalls that hug the increasingly
clogged freeways, and work in the office parks that sprawl across
the outskirts of Manchester and Nashua. They also are more likely
to register as independents, who have eclipsed the Republicans as
the largest group of voters.
</P>
<P>
   This election season, the shift has bolstered the fortunes of
such reform-minded candidates as Republican John McCain and
Democrat Bill Bradley, who have challenged their party's
standard-bearers, George W. Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps explain the gradual transformation of this former
bastion of Republicanism into a two-party state. Democrats now
control the governorship and share power in the state Senate for
the first time in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is getting to be like the rest of New England,'' said Andy
Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire survey center,
which tracks voter attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while New Hampshire voters have traditionally had a
streak of libertarianism, the influx of newcomers, many of them
from nearby Massachusetts, appear to be making the state even more
socially tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   The state celebrated Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday for the
first time this year as an official state holiday. Last year,
lawmakers rescinded the state's longtime ban on adoptions by gay
couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is not as conservative right-wing as it was 10
to 15 years ago,'' said state Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathy
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, taxes still are a tough sell in a state that
has neither an income nor sales tax. Even Democratic Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen has signed a pledge not to establish an income tax and
vetoed such a tax when the state Senate approved one last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not really a Democrat's Democrat,'' said state GOP
Chairman Steve Duprey.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican chief agreed that the newcomers had
moderated the state somewhat, he said the state remains fiscally
conservative, a perception that may explain Bush's focus on tax
cuts when he campaigns in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said his surveys show that even tax cuts don't carry
the same weight they once did. Mirroring views held nationally,
voters here rank education far ahead of taxes as an election-year
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy is just cooking right along, people don't
worry about taxes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire economy is humming. The state unemployment
rate has hovered around 2 percent, and the population is growing
about 13,000 annually with about half of that coming from migration
into the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Manchester Airport symbolizes this enormous growth. Since
1996 the number of passengers has grown from 900,000 to 2.8 million
annually, and the number of jets flying in and out has leaped from
19 to 45 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the state has fully recovered from the economic
recession of the early 1990s, when droves of people left the state.
That downturn contributed to the popularity of conservative
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who rode a message of economic
populism to victory in the 1996 primary and who made a good showing
against President Bush four years before that.
</P>
<P>
   But this year Buchanan, who ditched the Republican Party to run
on the Reform Party ticket, has been barely a blip here.
</P>
<P>
   The changing demographics haven't completely changed the style
of campaigning in a state where voters still expect to look their
candidates in the eyes. The contenders still make the rounds of the
firehouses and town halls in picturesque rural settings.
</P>
<P>
   And in a nod to tradition, they make the pilgrimage to the
Dixville Notch, the hamlet of 33 residents at the northern tip of
the state that prides itself on announcing the election results
before anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final week of campaigning, the presidential
contenders aren't likely to venture far from the southern boom
counties of Hillsborough and Rockingham, where more than half of
the state's 1.18 million people live.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the voters will get their political news from
television, particularly Manchester's ABC affiliate, WMUR, which
years ago eclipsed the state's largest newspaper, the Manchester
Union Leader, as the primary information source.
</P>
<P>
   The waning influence of the archconservative Union Leader was
damaged even more by the recent death of its longtime publisher,
Nackey Loeb, whose late husband, William Loeb, used the front-page
editorials to rip liberals and promote conservatives. This year the
newspaper has backed Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   At the rival Concord Monitor, editor Mike Pride said the current
candidates were campaigning in a state that does not resemble the
one that their predecessors crisscrossed decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no longer a poor rural state by a long shot,'' he
said.

U.S. AND 19 STATES ISSUE STINGING REPLY TO MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite fresh signs that the plaintiffs have not yet agreed on
what sanction to seek against Microsoft, they jointly issued a
stinging and disdainful rebuttal Tuesday to the company's legal
arguments last week that it had not violated the nation's antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a 30-page document filed with U.S. District Court in
Washington, the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company
characterized its arguments as a strained effort at knocking down
legal ``straw men'' and an attempt to ``apply to this case
out-of-context passages from decisions involving patently different
market circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending the business tactics at the center of the sweeping
antitrust suit, Microsoft, the plaintiffs assert, is relying on a
``legal standard that would allow all hobbling of competition that
did not completely destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   That passage addresses the underlying antitrust issue in the
suit: what legal restraints should apply to dominant companies in
high-technology markets. Microsoft has argued that while it is an
aggressive competitor, its business contracts and tough
negotiations with industry partners and rivals do not violate the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the government's brief was ``distorted.'' The
government, said Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, often
``ignored existing law or wants to write new law to suit its
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's filing was the latest volley from both sides, as they
file legal briefs before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. In
November, Jackson issued findings of fact that concluded that
Microsoft was a monopolist that wielded its market power against
rivals and partners alike, stifling competition and harming
consumers. But his final legal judgment will come later, after
hearing concluding arguments in court, scheduled for Feb. 22.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After his findings, which powerfully supported the government's
version of the case, Jackson appointed a mediator to try to
persuade both sides to reach an out-of-court settlement. The weekly
mediation talks began last year in Chicago, before Richard Posner,
chief judge of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Each side
meets separately with Judge Posner one day a week. There are no
talks this week, but they resume next week.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement talks have heightened the focus on what remedy
the Justice Department and states might seek against Microsoft.
Despite recent reports that the government had decided to seek a
breakup of the company, officials close to the talks have said that
no single remedy has been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Montgomery, the attorney general for Ohio, one of the
plaintiffs, said Tuesday that a breakup of Microsoft ``has never
been on my top list.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Ms. Montgomery said
she preferred restraints on Microsoft's conduct instead of the
``structural'' solution of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly,'' she told The AP, ``I indicated to my staff
when we started this lawsuit that I was not looking out for a
structural solution as much as a conduct solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, according to one person close to the
talks, has not yet decided on a single sanction to seek, either in
the settlement talks or in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, according to another person close to the talks, have the
states settled on a single remedy. A breakup of Microsoft, the
person said, is one proposal under consideration. But the
consideration, the person said, is guided mainly by two goals. One
is removing the incentives and the market leverage Microsoft has to
pressure companies not to use competing software. The other is
avoiding a continuing regulatory role for the government or the
courts. &QL;

AT CITY HALL, PROTEST MARS A CEREMONY FOR A CIRCUS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Surrounded by circus clowns and a ringmaster in a
glittery top hat and tails, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was about to
bestow a proclamation honoring the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP;
Bailey Circus Tuesday morning when two animal rights demonstrators
jumped out of their seats in the Blue Room at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   They began throwing fistfuls of fake paper money and shouting,
``The elephants can't buy their freedom, but Ringling bought
you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a brief few seconds, as the green and white play money
swirled around the mayor's lectern and into the laps of reporters
at his daily news conference, it seemed to be part of the event.
Giuliani and other officials, including Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau, looked on uncomprehendingly as police officers
in the City Hall security detail dragged the two protesters from
the room.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Giuliani had presented the proclamation, when a
reporter asked for his thoughts on the demonstrators from the group
called People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, did Giuliani
realize that the outburst had been politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what they were doing this morning?'' the mayor asked.
``I don't know. I thought they were a vast left-wing conspiracy or
something.'' He defended the circus. ``What I have seen of the
treatment of the animals in the circus is that the animals are
cared for very, very well and there's a good reason for it,'' he
said. ``I think the people in the circus love animals. And number
two, the animals are enormously important and the health of the
animals is enormously important to the circus performing
correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ringling Brothers has often been criticized by animal rights
groups like PETA. In a statement Tuesday, the group accused the
circus of acts of cruelty involving a number of animals that have
died in recent years. The circus denies the accusations. In the
same statement, the group also criticized Giuliani for accepting
$2,000 in contributions to his Senate exploratory committee from
Kenneth Feld, the producer and chief executive of the Ringling
Brothers circus.
</P>
<P>
   The two protesters, Luke Downing, 20, and Arathi Jayaram, 23,
sneaked into the Blue Room by posing as journalists. They were
arrested and charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct,
police spokeswoman Valerie St. Rose said. Before the protesters
were charged, Morgenthau, who was at the event to accept free
circus tickets for needy children involved with the Police Athletic
League, said they were unlikely to face serious punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was a source of embarrassment for the
security-obsessed Giuliani administration. Officials said reporters
covering City Hall would no longer be permitted to walk
unaccompanied in the part of the building where the mayor's offices
are.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of animal pop psychology, the mayor said that animals
with a purpose in life were happier than those without one. He
called PETA's objections to animals in the circus ``weird.'' &QL;

DESPITE FRENCH BAR OF COCA-COLA'S BID, ORANGINA IS STILL FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months have passed since the French government halted
Coca-Cola's two-year effort to acquire the Orangina brand from
Pernod Ricard SA, the French conglomerate that was more than ready
to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: what's next for Orangina, and for
Pernod Ricard, a company that likes to acquire other brands and
could have used some extra cash?
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the rejection of the deal with Coca-Cola, Pernod Ricard
executives say the brand is still for sale, but they are in no
rush. They want to get a decent price, even though Coca-Cola's
offer fell from $840 million initially to $733 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't sell it, it's positive, and if we sell it, it's
positive,'' said Patrick Ricard, the chairman of the Paris-based
company, during a recent interview in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Cadbury Schweppes, the candy and soft drink giant,
have hinted that they would be interested in buying Orangina.
Cadbury Schweppes did pick up Hawaiian Punch not long ago, so it is
in acquisition mode _ but not for anything like the price Coca-Cola
had in mind. A spokeswoman for Cadbury in London refused to comment
Tuesday on whether the company was still considering Orangina.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's PepsiCo, a company with a
not-exactly-impressive presence in the global soft drink arena. A
PepsiCo spokesman would not comment when asked if the company was
interested in Orangina; Ricard, who sees his forfeited deal with
Coca-Cola as one more casualty of the cola wars, said PepsiCo has
recently expressed interestin buying the brand, ``but they don't
talk about the price.'' More than two years ago, before the deal
with Coke, Pepsi had been offered a chance to buy Orangina, he
said, ``and they didn't show any interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The point of the sale was to increase Orangina's sales through
the vast Coca-Cola bottling and distribution system, Ricard said.
``We decided to sell Orangina because it was good for Orangina.''
</P>
<P>
   PepsiCo complained to French competition authorities in 1998
about Coca-Cola's offer for Orangina, starting a regulatory chain
reaction. Coca-Cola subsequently revised its original offer
substantially, and many thought it would win approval from the
government as a result, but the French _ perhaps influenced by
politics _ said no to the acquisition on Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was good for France,'' a still-seething Ricard said
several weeks later. ``The decision was stupid. No one understands
the decision. It's an anti-French decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola would have been a good corporate parent for Orangina,
Ricard said, despite all the anti-American sentiment, some of it
directed at Coca-Cola that has swept through Europe in recent
months. ``Coke is a true French company that employs 2,500 people
in two or three factories,'' he said. ``Pepsi is nobody in
France.''
</P>
<P>
   Pernod Ricard's desire to separate itself from Orangina has
everything to do with corporate identity and focus, and nothing at
all to do with any problems with the brand, Ricard said, noting its
double-digit growth last year and its price premium to other soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   With most of Pernod Ricard's holdings in the wine and spirits
business, and others in the fruit processing industry, Orangina was
no longer considered an essential item in the $3.5 billion
company's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Pernod Ricard was formed through a merger in 1975; Ricard's
father, Paul, who died in 1997, was known as ``the king of pastis''
and came up with the recipe for Ricard in 1932, although other
forms of the drink _ a licorice-flavored liqueur whose most
dedicated following is in France _ existed much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no synergy in Orangina sales and spirits sales,''
Ricard said, adding that the company's goals are to double its size
and profit every seven years. At present, wine and spirit sales
account for 43 percent of revenue and 63 percent of profit, and the
company has been growing through acquisitions of popular local
brands as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastern Europe, Pernod Ricard has purchased Becherovka, a
Czech drink, and plans to distribute it using an existing network
of wholesalers. In China, the company started a wine label, Dragon
Seal. It distributes a line of Australian wines called Jacob's
Creek in various regions of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference between them and Diageo, apart from size,
is that Diageo is trying to de-emphasize local brands, and Pernod
Ricard is going in the opposite direction,'' said one industry
analyst, calling the strategy ``a good business, as long as you
don't overpay for the assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently the company has run into international political
problems over its Havana Club rum. It holds the trademark rights to
the name in 180 countries, but a federal judge in New York,
presiding in a lawsuit brought by Havana Club Holdings, a joint
venture between Pernod Ricard and the Castro government in Cuba,
maintained in a ruling last summer that trademarks confiscated by
the Cuban government cannot be upheld in American courts.
</P>
<P>
   Pernod Ricard's position is that the brand was abandoned by its
former owners, the Arechabala family, and registered to Havana Club
Holdings in 1993, but was illegally sold by the family in 1997 to
Bacardi, one of the world's biggest rum producers.
</P>
<P>
   Havana Club was the top-selling brand of Cuban rum for decades.
Bacardi's version is produced in the Bahamas, but shows a famous
seawall in Havana on its label. Pernod Ricard is appealing the
judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Pernod Ricard also owns Yoo-Hoo, a chocolate drink brand that it
plans to sell as well. ``A few companies are looking at it,''
Ricard said. He expects to announce a sale sometime during the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Orangina remains murky. ``We will sell it if it
makes sense for the company, for Orangina and for us,'' Ricard
said. ``The entire world wants to buy it. But I'm not sure the
entire world is prepared to pay for it.''

TIMID AT THE TOP: A QUESTION OF LEADERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year ago, I cornered a group of eminent college and
university presidents. A major study of the impact of
race-sensitive admission policies at selective colleges and
universities had just been published. It asserted that affirmative
action at those institutions had played an important role in
bolstering the black middle class.
</P>
<P>
   All of the assembled thought that was good news.
</P>
<P>
   And so I asked, ``Now that you have evidence that this policy
has worked, don't you have a responsibility to defend it?''
</P>
<P>
   All were silent. Sheepish glances were exchanged. Heads hung
low. No one was willing to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   That timidity by some of the brightest and most articulate men
and women in the nation exemplifies my conclusion that American
colleges have superb faculties, wonderful students, beautiful and
well-wired campuses but weak-kneed, pussy-footing presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The losers, of course, are all of us who are deprived of the
stimulation and thoughtful leadership of the people Thorsten
Veblen, the 19th-century economist, once called the ``captains of
erudition.''
</P>
<P>
   When is the last time a college or university chief made
headlines by speaking out on campaign finance reform, genetic
alteration, the rash of vocationalism (giving rise to
``McUniversities''), national health insurance, tolerance for
homosexuals, the fight over an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum,
the White House sex scandal?
</P>
<P>
   Academic executives sometimes argue that they must mind their
tongues for fear of antagonizing potential contributors, but that
is the sort of rationalization to be expected from profit seekers,
not from broad social thinkers and intellectual leaders who stand
at the helms of great institutions.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way.
</P>
<P>
   A generation or two ago, James B. Conant, the president of
Harvard from 1933 to 1953, served as an adviser to the Atomic
Energy Commission while president and never hesitated to lecture
the country on the importance of civilian control of atomic energy,
educational reform and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   John Silber, who became president of Boston University in 1971,
advised President Ronald Reagan on foreign policy and, in 1990,
took a year off to run for governor of Massachusetts while
excoriating not only the icons of the new left but also such fellow
university presidents as Clark Kerr at the University of California
and Grayson Kirk at Columbia, whom he considered soft on student
radicals.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Maynard Hutchins, the president and then chancellor of
the University of Chicago from 1929 to 1951, was a fearless
fountain of ideas, many of them deliberately provocative. While
dean of the Yale Law School, Hutchins denounced the Massachusetts
court that condemned Sacco and Vanzetti to death. Chief Justice
William Howard Taft sputtered that Hutchins must be in league with
``every Bolshevik communist movement in the country,'' but that did
not faze the Chicago trustees who shortly thereafter named Hutchins
president, thus unloosing a flood of his frequently unpalatable
ideas and opinions.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just the big fellows who refused to hush up.
Stringfellow Barr, who became president of St. John's College in
Annapolis, Md., in 1937 and introduced a radically new curriculum
composed entirely of 100 ``great books,'' fiercely fought off those
who objected to studying Marx and Freud alongside St. Augustine and
St Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, Barr urged the creation of a world government after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Holt, who had been editor of The Independent, a liberal
weekly, before 1925, when he became president of Rollins College in
Winter Park, Fla., spoke out on virtually everything that crossed
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His most daring pronouncement _ the legend on a 1938 war
memorial guaranteed to provoke just about everyone _ was inscribed
on a bronze plaque under a heavy-caliber naval artillery shell
mounted prominently on a pedestal on campus.
</P>
<P>
   It read:
</P>
<P>
   This engine of destruction, torture and death symbolizes
</P>
<P>
   The prostitution of the inventor
</P>
<P>
   The avarice of the manufacturer
</P>
<P>
   The blood-guilt of the statesman
</P>
<P>
   The savagery of the soldier
</P>
<P>
   The perverted patriotism of the citizen
</P>
<P>
   The debasement of the human race
</P>
<P>
   If any would-be contributor did not like it, Holt said, he or
she could go jump in the lake (Winter Park has seven from which to
choose).
</P>
<P>
   One need not agree with all that these feisty chief executives
said in order to recognize and value their contributions to the
intellectual vitality of the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, they made life more interesting.

   Maybe it was genetic. My grandfather was the first professor of
neurosurgery in the world. My father was a neurosurgeon. And as a
kid, I was always taking things apart and putting them back
together. At 10, I made an adding machine out of cardboard, glue
and nuts and bolts.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Hanover, N.H., and Dartmouth College made its
computer center available to middle-school students, so I learned
basic programming at 12. I was enthralled with computers.
</P>
<P>
   And then I made an incredible discovery: people were willing to
pay other people to write computer programs. It set in place my
future career.
</P>
<P>
   I was paid $5 to write programming at Dartmouth. I also had a
job as a teen-ager delivering flowers. It was awesome. I got to
drive a van, and I got to see the expressions of pure pleasure on
people's faces. I get that same sense of pleasure today when I see
people using products I've developed.
</P>
<P>
   I never had that angst of ``What am I going to do with my
life?'' I always knew I would go into engineering. Just last year,
I saw my high school science teacher. He still remembered the title
of my project my junior year: ``Ultra Micro-Miniature Thumb-Sized
Digital Calculator With a Novel Nematic Liquid Crystal for the
Display.'' I almost got it working. I still have it.
</P>
<P>
   My master's project at Stanford was a voice-controlled robotic
arm for quadriplegics, potentially to serve you a drink or brush
your teeth. I used software to link up a robot arm and a
voice-recognition system. It's an ongoing project at Stanford
today.
</P>
<P>
   After Stanford, I got a job as a consultant, saved $2,500 and
took three months off to drive around Europe with my girlfriend,
who is now my wife.
</P>
<P>
   I proposed to her on the northern tip of Scotland. It was 10
p.m. but still light out. We were sitting cross-legged in a field.
At the end of the field was a cliff and beyond the cliff was the
ocean. I was overcome by where we were.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the United States, some friends and I developed the
Macintosh mouse for Steve Jobs at Apple Computer. I'm one of four
patent holders on it. People ask me how much money I made. I say:
Take 400 million mice and multiply by my royalty of zero. We tried
to get a royalty, but Apple was too smart to give one to young
designers like us.
</P>
<P>
   A funny theme in my life is being introduced to important people
and spending hours with them without realizing who they are.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked a woman, ``So what do you do at your company?'' And
she replied, ``Well, since I'm the CEO, I guess I run it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time I had hung out with a guy named Artie. Later on,
somebody asked me, ``What was it like spending all that time with
Arthur Rock,'' the famous venture capitalist? I said, ``Huh? You
mean Artie?''
</P>
<P>
   I have my shortcomings as a boss. I probably avoid confrontation
too much.
</P>
<P>
   My worst boss was a shouter. I once thought the only reason he
didn't make a Business Week list of the 10 Worst Bosses was that
the list didn't start at zero. He once screamed at me as we were
walking down a hallway that I was overpaid and underperforming.
There's no room in American business today for treating people that
way.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Leading members of the Security Council,
deadlocked over the nomination of a new chief arms inspector for
Iraq, have apparently decided to ask Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to withdraw the name of Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat. They want
the job offered to another Swedish disarmament expert, Hans Blix.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the decision could be announced within a day or
two, although the Security Council has not yet acted in any formal
way and the plan could be upset.
</P>
<P>
   France, Russia and to some extent China opposed Ekeus. Tuesday
night, diplomats said that those three, and the United States and
Britain _ all five council members with vetoes _ were close to a
formal agreement on Blix.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Tuesday night, a State Department spokeswoman said
that the department had no immediate comment on the possible
selection of Blix. A senior Clinton administration official said,
however, that Blix appeared to have the technical, managerial and
diplomatic experience required for the the new chief arms
inspector. ``Blix clearly meets the criteria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, 72, was the director-general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, a U.N. organization in Vienna, Austria, from 1981 to
1997. During that period he became a contentious figure among arms
control experts because the agency, which regularly inspected Iraqi
nuclear programs and fuel stockpiles, was accused of failing to
detect a secret weapons program that did not come to light until
after the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has since been considerably strengthened, diplomats
say, because nations that make up its governing board realized that
it had not been given enough power to conduct more intrusive
searches. Agency inspectors who missed the bomb project had in fact
been limited to looking at material Iraq had declared under the
1968 nonproliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Those materials covered by the 1968 treaty, including natural
and low-enriched uranium, still remaining in Iraq were inspected by
the agency this week.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 war, inspectors learned in Iraq that a country
could run a parallel bomb program completely out of sight while
fulfilling all the obligations associated with its peaceful nuclear
projects.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, the atomic agency had uncovered another
secret program in North Korea. Since 1994, when an agreement was
signed with the North Koreans to phase out that program in return
for foreign investment in peaceful reactors, the agency has had
inspectors permanently stationed in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, an expert in international and constitutional law, had
some differences with the U.N. Special Commission, UNSCOM, which
was created after the 1991 war to destroy Iraq's prohibited
biological and chemical weapons and missile systems, and the means
to make them.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM became what diplomats call the senior partner in the Iraq
inspection programs, with the atomic energy agency, which inspected
nuclear facilities, playing a secondary role. Ekeus was UNSCOM's
executive chairman for much of that time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the friction between UNSCOM and the atomic energy agency
_ and between Blix and Ekeus _ was the suggestion Blix made before
his retirement that at some point any inspection commission would
have to decide that it had found all it could find in prohibited
weapons and materials and could then move to long-term but rigorous
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM, on the other hand, was more determined under both Ekeus
and his successor, Richard Butler, to pursue all leads until
virtually every question was answered and every missing item found
or accounted for. The differences were heightened by the fact that
the atomic energy agency was a U.N. body staffed by organization
employees _ ``bureaucrats,'' in the eyes of UNSCOM's more
independent inspectors lent by governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis consistently trumpeted these differences to the
detriment of UNSCOM. If Iraq's past praise for the atomic energy
agency is any guide, the government of President Saddam Hussein
will have to think of new reasons for rejecting Blix as it rejected
the return of Ekeus.

AMGEN REPORTS QUARTERLY EARNINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES -- Biotechnology drug maker Amgen Inc. announced
Tuesday it has filed applications for federal approval to market
two new drugs at the same time it reported record sales and
earnings for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it is awaiting a ruling from the Food and Drug
Administration on whether it can sell NESP, a longer-dose follow-up
to its blockbuster drug Epogen, and Kineret, a rheumatoid arthritis
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Amgen said it filed a simultaneous application
with the European Medicines Evaluation agency -- Europe's
equivalent to the FDA for approval of NESP.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive application schedule is unprecedented for Amgen,
said company spokesman David Kaye. Amgen had said in October that
it would seek approval to market the new drugs by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said the FDA approval usually takes 12 to 15 months from
the application date. Amgen did not specify when the application
was filed.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements were packaged with a year-end earnings report
that showed the biotechnology giant, based in Thousand Oaks north
of Los Angeles, surpassing analyst estimates for both the fourth
quarter and the year.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen reported a 24 percent increase in earnings per share for
1999 and predicted it would achieve earnings between $1.05 and
$1.07 per share in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely pleased. It was a record year,'' Kaye said.
``We passed $3billion in total product sales and $1 billion in net
income, both for the first time ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $281.6million,
or 26cents per share on sales of $847.4 million. This compares with
income of $238.6 million, or a split-adjusted 22 cents per share on
sales of $694.6 million for the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Copithorne, biotechnology analyst with Prudential
Securities, said Amgen's earnings would have missed Wall Street
fourth-quarter estimates were it not for Y2K stockpiling by
wholesalers of the three drugs Amgen is now marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this shift in sales, the company said that 2000
first-quarter sales could be impacted by $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's $45 million in sales that would have occurred in the
first quarter of this year that instead occurred in the fourth
quarter of last year,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   That translates into two cents per share in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are more likely to be forgiving of this shortcoming
since the company is in a building period, making final
preparations for new product launches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are a little less focused on the bottom-line earnings
now than they will be in the future,'' Copithorne said.
</P>
<P>
   She predicts that NESP will achieve sales of $320 million in
2001, while Kineret will hit sales of $30 million this year and
$150 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   She also believes that Kineret will receive accelerated approval
by the FDA and be on the market by year's end because two similar
rheumatoid arthritis drugs -- Immunex's Enbrel and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson's Remicade -- each was approved in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is assuming that the FDA takes at least the full
year period to review them. They're taking a very conservative
view,'' Copithorne said.
</P>
<P>
   Quick approval is up to the federal regulators and is not
something the company will ask for, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen also announced Tuesday that it has completed the final
testing phases for Abarelix, its prostate cancer drug, Kaye said.
The company plans to present its results to the American Society of
Clinical Oncology in May.
</P>
<P>
   The clinical trials show Abarelix to be effective in immediately
reducing testosterone, which helps prostate tumors grow, he said.

EDITORIAL: THE LAW ON CAMPAIGN MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Jan. 26: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court performed a valuable public service on Monday
by demolishing one of the main arguments brandished by
congressional foes of campaign finance reform. In a decisive 6-to-3
ruling, the court reaffirmed the constitutionality of campaign
contribution limits and exposed the emptiness of claims that the
First Amendment presents an insurmountable bar to meaningful action
by lawmakers to restrict the corrupting flow of money into
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved a test of Missouri's $1,075 limit on an
individual's donations to a statewide candidate. A lower appeals
court had struck down the limit on free-speech grounds, in essence
overruling the portion of the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in
Buckley vs. Valeo that upheld the $1,000 contribution limit for
federal candidates as a permissible precaution against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting this invitation to reconsider its approval of the
cap in light of 24 years of inflation, the court put due emphasis
on the corruptive nature of large campaign gifts. It also turned
aside arguments that such limits amount to suppression of speech,
lacking any concrete proof that candidates are prevented from
raising sufficient funds to get their voices heard. ``Leave the
perception of impropriety unanswered, and the cynical assumption
that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of
voters to take part in democratic government,'' wrote Justice David
Souter in the majority opinion signed by five of his colleagues,
including Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the leading
congressional opponent of campaign finance reform, says the opinion
is inconsequential to the ongoing battle over banning the
unregulated contributions to political parties known as soft money.
Yet one immediate effect of the decision is to render laughable
McConnell's attempt to portray himself as a First Amendment
champion for opposing a soft-money ban. The majority opinion did
not address soft money directly. But its endorsement of
contribution limits to protect the integrity of the political
process strongly suggests that legislative steps to prevent
candidates from evading those limits by raising and spending soft
money would also pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the two concurring opinions by Justices John Paul
Stevens and Stephen Breyer underscored, a number of justices are
deeply concerned about the dominant role of big money in politics.
They also seemed concerned about the court's own role in helping to
accelerate the money chase by ruling, in another, highly lamentable
part of the Buckley decision, that limits on campaign spending
violate the First Amendment. In future rulings, the court needs to
allow limits on both contributions and spending of personal funds
by wealthy candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In reaffirming contribution limits, the court decided that those
limits do not harm anyone's rights to free speech. No one is
prevented from speaking, just from buying undue influence.

TO SETTLE CASE, CHASE VOWS NO MORE CUSTOMER DATA TO MARKETERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Colo.)   (bl)  
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Chase Manhattan Bank and a Denver-based Internet
company called InfoBeat will no longer routinely share personal or
financial information about their customers with telemarketing
companies and advertisers under a settlement announced Tuesday by
the state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   While the practice of sharing information with outside companies
_ in Chase's case in return for a commission on its use in sales _
is generally not illegal, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer accused
the companies of engaging in deceptive business practices by
failing to meet their promise to customers about privacy. Under
state consumer protection laws, Spitzer said, the companies could
have been charged fines of up to $500 per violation.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, the attorney general's office said, violated its own
privacy policy when it transferred 20 items of information about as
many as 18 million credit card and mortgage holders nationwide _
including their home addresses, credit card purchases, finance
charges and available credit _ to four marketing companies selling
everything from Burpee seeds to magazine subscriptions. In return,
the bank received up to a 24 percent commission on those sales,
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The other company that settled with Spitzer's office, InfoBeat,
a subsidiary of Sony Music that provides e-mail services to nearly
2.5 million subscribers around the world, has acknowledged that a
software error last fall caused it to inadvertently forward
personal e-mail addresses to advertisers in violation of a privacy
policy posted on its Web site. A company official said Tuesday that
the problem had been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has denied any wrongdoing but agreed not to disclose any
more financial information about their customers, like credit-card
purchases, finance charges and available credit lines, to other
companies. The two companies have agreed to pay a combined total of
$176,500 to the state to cover the costs of Spitzer's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we need to think about what the ground rules should
be for gaining access to this information,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The settlements come at a time of heightened concern nationwide
over financial reforms and technological advances that have made it
easier than ever to gather personal details about consumers. Last
year, Congress repealed a Depression-era law that had restricted
banks from entering the securities and insurance industries, and in
doing so, opened the way for multilayered companies to share data
on their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham Law School, said
companies can freely share personal and financial information with
their affiliates and agents, and also reveal that information to
third parties as long as the customer does not ``opt out,'' or
specifically request not to be included. ``What's been very clear
for the last couple of years, and especially in the last year, is
that Congress is throwing up its hands in protecting citizen
privacy,'' he said.

MAVERICKS' BID FOR DENNIS RODMAN STILL WAITING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dennis the Rebounder. The Showman. The Menace. The
Worm.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever identity Dennis Rodman chooses to wear when he makes
his almost-certain return to the NBA, new Mavericks owner-to-be
Mark Cuban wants ``Brand Rodman'' playing for Brand-X of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban met with Rodman and his agent, Steve Chasman, yesterday,
but an expected one-year deal failed to materialize. Rodman, who
can only sign for just under $500,000 for a half-season because the
Mavericks are over the salary cap, left Dallas after the meeting.
Chasman, who Cuban said was to join him courtside for last night's
Mavericks-Warriors game, was an apparent no-show and was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pulling all these people together, we thought it would be
really possible to come to a deal,'' Cuban said.'' In terms of why
it hasn't been done yet, it's really more in terms of previous
commitments for Dennis and in terms of just organizational things.
Nothing has actually been signed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban's sign-Rodman game plan revolves around making Rodman
believe joining the Mavs is beneficial to his career as a
self-marketer. Cuban is quite happy to provide Rodman his next
stage to re-emerge as a MTV-generation pop icon in exchange for
rebounds and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he is not using Rodman to lure fans into what was a
half-empty Reunion Arena last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dennis, `Let's just get the cards on the table and
whatever I can do to help you market Brand Rodman we're going to do
it,''' Cuban said. ``He knows that Brand Rodman isn't going to sell
unless he produces on the court, and he's the first to realize
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said a deal must be worked out ``now,'' but wouldn't
commit to a time frame, other than within a week or two. Chasman
has said publicly that Rodman is negotiating with four teams. Cuban
could not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I have an interest and I think he can add to this
team,'' Cuban said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks players appear open to bringing Rodman, owner of
five championship rings (two with Detroit, three with Chicago) into
the fold. From purely a basketball perspective, Rodman, 38, makes
sense. He is one of the elite rebounders ever to play the game and
would instantly become the team's top defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an awesome player,'' forward Cedric Ceballos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for it,'' guard Steve Nash said. ``He's been a
terrific player in this league, and he adds two elements that we
aren't strong at: defense and rebounding. So I anticipate his
arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs think they know how to handle Rodman: Let him do as he
pleases. The logic is if Rodman's happy, he'll produce on the
court. Cuban said he believes Rodman can put the Mavs in the
playoffs. Entering last night's game, the Mavs were 14-26, nine
games out of the final playoff spot.

THOMSON EXPECTED TO BUY SYLVAN TESTING UNIT
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Md.)  (nk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Thomson Corp., the data-publishing giant and owner of The
Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto, is expected to announce the
$775 million acquisition Tuesday of Sylvan Prometric, a
computer-based testing company that certifies professionals and
graduate school applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of the Baltimore-based testing company from Sylvan
Learning Systems is part of an effort by Thomson to expand its
reach into corporate education and testing because it considers
test takers a natural market for its reference materials and
training books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the learning space is going to provide
tremendous growth for earnings,'' said Richard Harrington, chief
executive of Thomson, which has units that publish reference and
research books for the library and education markets as well as
electronic offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, seven-year-old Sylvan Prometric posted revenue of
$214 million with 2,900 testing sites in 141 countries and 1,400
employees. The company administers tests for professional licensing
and examinations for employees of corporations like Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hoffman, the chief executive of Sylvan Prometric, said
the union with Thomson would allow his company to move up ``to the
next level of growth'' because of Thomson's financial resources and
technical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is expected to be completed in about 45 days,
executives said. It will also probably result in a name change for
Sylvan Prometric, which in the future will be known as Prometric.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Thomson's acquisitions concentrated on the
educational publishing side, with its $86 million purchase of
Macmillan Library Reference USA from Pearson.

TITANS' MATTHEWS CAST IN SENTIMENTAL FAVORITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In his first Super Bowl in 17 NFL seasons, Tennessee
Titans guard Bruce Matthews is older than the event itself.
</P>
<P>
   He played alongside his present position coach, Mike Munchak,
for his first 11 NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He played college football with his present head coach, Jeff
Fisher, at the University of Southern California in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He came into the NFL during first-term Reaganomics and fully
expects to hang around for at least one more change in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   With the then-Houston Oilers, Matthews preceded Warren Moon and
has blocked for both Earl Campbell and Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks seventh all-time in NFL history in games played (264),
most by an offensive lineman, and has an active streak of 197
consecutive starts that he will take into next season. If he stays
healthy and plays all 16 games in 2000, he will climb into No. 3
all-time (280) behind only George Blanda (340) and Jim Marshall
(282).
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Matthews said yesterday during photo-media day
at the Georgia Dome for Super Bowl XXXIV that he now realizes he
would have felt a void in his career if he had never reached a
Super Bowl, but only after he had resigned himself to thinking that
this game was never going to include him.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans find themselves as one-touchdown underdogs to the St.
Louis Rams on Sunday. Matthews finds himself as the John Elway of
this Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Sentimental Favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, everybody is pulling for Bruce,'' former Rams tackle
Jackie Slater, whose previous NFL longevity record for an offensive
lineman (259) was broken by Matthews this past season. ``It's like
the Elway thing ... except it's, `Let's win one for the guard.'
Offensive linemen normally aren't used to that!''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews is not a normal offensive lineman. He is a genetic
marvel. He comes from the same gene pool as his older brother Clay,
a linebacker who played in 278 NFL games before retiring a couple
of years ago. Their father, Clay Sr., was a two-way player
(defensive end/offensive tackle) for the San Francisco 49ers in the
early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and Clay Jr. are extremely competitive by nature. Growing
up in California, they devised a backyard game using metal-tipped
darts and 2x4 boards. The boards became shields to pick off each
other's throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lasted until the first beanball,'' Matthews said, ``and
then the game was retired by our parents.
</P>
<P>
   When Matthews surpassed Slater for the NFL longevity record for
an offensive lineman, he came home to discover that his brother had
left him a message on his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations!'' Clay's message said. ``This really is a
true testament to your greed and ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans left tackle Brad Hopkins, who plays alongside Matthews,
contributes the latter's longevity to body hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually has a sweater underneath that No. 74 jersey,''
Hopkins said. ``He's more mammal than most men, and apparently the
hair creates a thermal thing, so that Bruce is able to play in
cold-weather games better than anybody in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest that Matthews came to having his consecutive-game
streak end was three years ago at Pittsburgh. Somebody fell across
his knee and ``tweaked'' his medial collateral ligament. The
following week, he was in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``God blessed me with a body than can take a pounding,''
Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the futility of the vagabond Oilers/Titans (two
different states, three different cities and four different
``home'' stadiums over the past four seasons), Matthews was playing
in his first conference championship game Sunday when the Titans
pulled off their second upset of the playoffs at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The low points for Matthews in an Oilers uniform had been
plentiful until this season, when the Tennessee Oilers became the
Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, I re-signed with the Oilers on my birthday. We played
in Houston. We lived in Houston. My kids went to school in Houston
... I didn't even talk to any other teams at the time,'' Matthews
said. ``Then three days later, we went to Knoxville to play the
Redskins in a preseason game ... and we announced that we were
moving to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely was my low point.''
</P>
<P>
   His high point obviously is coming Sunday in Atlanta. Matthews
apologized yesterday for being uncomfortable in talking to ``a
bunch of strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does it well.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets really comfortable, Matthews likes to impersonate
Elvis Presley. Who knows? There are still a couple of days left
before Super Sunday.

EDITORIAL: ELIAN GONZALEZ AND CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Jan. 26: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the case of Elian Gonzalez enters its third month with no end
in sight, it is becoming more and more evident why the fate of this
6-year-old Cuban boy belongs in a federal court rather than in the
streets of Miami or Havana _ or in the halls of Congress.
Congressional moves this week to have Elian declared an American
citizen have added a new level of exploitation to this unseemly
saga.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of Congress from Florida, Sen. Connie Mack and Rep.
Bill McCollum, have introduced bills to grant the boy citizenship
or permanent residency. Their avowed purpose is to remove
jurisdiction over his status from the federal Immigration and
Naturalization Service, where it properly belongs, and hand it over
to a Florida family court as a child-custody dispute. This is an
unacceptable misuse of a citizenship process to manipulate the
venue of a court case.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially troubling when the object of the dispute is 6
years old. There is in fact no basis in law for a custody dispute.
To this day no one has presented evidence suggesting that Elian's
divorced father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is an unfit parent. After
Elian was rescued at sea following an accident that killed his
mother, Gonzalez was interviewed extensively by INS officials in
Havana, and satisfied them that he had a close and involved
relationship with his son. In a country like Cuba, no one can truly
know if a man is speaking freely. But his credibility has been
strengthened this past week by Elian's two grandmothers, who have
traveled to the United States in hopes of retrieving Elian and
returning home with him. Both grandmothers have spoken of their
love for Elian and there is no evidence of coercion.
</P>
<P>
   Holding Elian in this country only plays into Fidel Castro's
hands. His opponents in Miami and their backers in Washington are
subverting uncontested family ties in the interest of an
all-consuming political agenda. They assume that the nature of
one's government is the only criterion in the quality of his life.
In so doing they emulate the totalitarian ideal that they correctly
abhor.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was right Tuesday when he reiterated that
Elian's case should play out in court. As a matter of law, the INS
has authority to determine this boy's lawful guardian, and the
agency has justly found that his father has the right to decide
that his son should be returned to Cuba. Elian's relatives in Miami
have appealed in federal court, and that _ not Congress in an
election year _ is where this case should be resolved.

   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Jan. 26: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mountains, deserts and valleys stretching from Afghanistan
to Pakistan and the disputed Indian state of Kashmir have long been
a hiding place used by Islamic militants. Now the United States has
stepped up the pressure on Pakistan to expel one of the most
militant of these groups, which Washington believes was responsible
for the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet last month. Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, who seized power in Islamabad last October, may find it
politically difficult to crack down on these radicals, but it is in
his own interest to oust them. If the extremists operating within
Pakistani territory are not brought under control, their next
target could be Pakistan itself.
</P>
<P>
   After the hijackers of the Indian Airlines jet released their
passengers, India charged that Pakistan was behind the episode. No
evidence was cited but there was speculation in New Delhi that it
included intercepts of communications between Pakistani
intelligence operatives and the group known as Harkat
ul-Mujahedeen. This group, which used to be known as Harkat
ul-Ansar, is on the State Department's list of terrorist groups. It
is believed to be behind the bloody insurgency in Kashmir, India's
only Muslim-dominated state.
</P>
<P>
   In their recent conflicts, India has exercised laudable
restraint with Pakistan. When Pakistan-backed militants infiltrated
into Indian territory last spring, India did not retaliate by
invading Pakistan territory. Since the hijacking, India has tried
to crack down on Islamic radicals in Kashmir but has been careful
not to escalate clashes on the Pakistan-India border. It is now
Pakistan's turn to exercise restraint, recognizing that any support
for groups threatening India militarily is risky. The world cannot
afford to allow the region's two nuclear-armed nations to increase
their tensions.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is planning to visit India in the spring. His
earlier plan to stop also in Pakistan is said to be on hold,
pending Islamabad's response to the request that it rein in the
militants, ease tensions with India and move toward restoring a
democratic government. The administration should use as much
leverage as possible to get Musharraf's government to expel those
groups whose only interest is to fan hostilities.

EDITORIAL: RETURN OF THE WHITE STUFF 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Jan. 26: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Something about a sudden heavy snow of the kind that fell
Tuesrday carries New York right back to the end of the 19th century
and to a vision of urban winter caught by Alfred Stieglitz. In 1893
he photographed a horse team plodding through deep gray slush along
Fifth Avenue on a similar day of driving snow, diminished
sightlines, rapid accumulation. Tuesday, of course, it was taxis,
not horses, slithering gingerly through intersections. Buses
slipped their wheels on the barely perceptible grade up West 42nd
Street toward the library. During the thickest snowfall the city
seemed almost depopulated. Pedestrians became studies in gray and
white. The skyline withdrew into a pale monochrome, and yet the
fallen snow sharpened the horizontal lines of every building in
sight, just as it did for Stieglitz.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago winter seemed more than improbable, no matter what
the calendar said. Even far north of the city there was no frost in
the ground, and the snow that fell vanished on contact with the
warm earth. So naturally this storm and the week of cold weather
leading up to it feel like retribution for an unnatural December,
payback for all those elevator chats about the upside of global
warming. Winter is never easy _ and for some the past few days have
been a genuine trial _ but it is hard not to enjoy the disarray a
snow squall creates. It occasions a day of subtle misrule. Fashion
_ like alternate-side parking _ is suspended. Promptness is
relaxed, as is a certain amount of neatness around the pants cuffs.
An inordinate amount of attention goes into making the next step
count.
</P>
<P>
   The only recourse is to take pleasure in pure seasonality.
Spring has its defining moments, as do summer and fall. We had
almost forgotten that this is how winter defines itself _ the
crunch of artificial salt underfoot, the rasp of snow shovels on
concrete, a day with all the color of a seagull's plumage, the
sting of wind-blown snow in the ear, a growing, drifting silence as
night sets in. &QL;

SEN. CARL T. CURTIS, 94, STAUNCH NIXON ALLY
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Neb.)  (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl T. Curtis, a former Republican House member and senator
from Nebraska who spent 40 years in Congress preaching a strict
fiscal and social conservatism and was a staunch defender of
President Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate scandal, died on
Monday in Lincoln, Neb. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his tenure, Curtis was a spirited critic of the New
Deal and any program that smacked of social welfare. He opposed the
school lunch program, for example, saying that his own character
had been bettered for having had to carry his own lunch to school
as a youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things, for example, that turned me against school
lunches was that it didn't hurt me to walk to school carrying a
lunch pail,'' he told an interviewer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his career, he was best known as one of Nixon's
most ardent defenders in the Senate during congressional
investigations of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1973, he led a delegation of 10 conservative Republican
senators to the White House in a very public show of support for
Nixon at a time when the Watergate scandal was becoming especially
intense.
</P>
<P>
   He said through his press secretary at the time that he ``felt a
need to talk to the president and let him know that everyone wasn't
deserting him because of Watergate.'' But the meeting also
highlighted Nixon's tenuous political position by virtue of the
many Republican senators who did not attend the session.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon resigned 13 months later, but Curtis continued for years
to inveigh against the people who had opposed the president. On the
first anniversary of the resignation, Curtis said he believed that
Nixon's downfall had been helped by an undisclosed ``double agent''
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Watergate was played all out of proportion,'' he
said in that 1975 interview. ``I believe a different yardstick was
used in dealing with Mr. Nixon than was used on other presidents
and officials.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many people had asked him why he stayed loyal so long.
``If I didn't defend him,'' he said, ``he would have gone
undefended.''
</P>
<P>
   When Curtis retired from the Senate in 1978, Nixon repaid the
loyalty at a testimonial dinner in Washington, telling the audience
by telephone from San Clemente, Calif., that the senator ``always
fought for the principles that made this country great.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Curtis waged a successful battle to defeat Sen. Jacob
K. Javits of New York for the chairmanship of the Senate Republican
Caucus. It was a bitter fight ending in a secret ballot that
nonetheless exposed the deep divisions in the party between
moderates and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although a firm conservative in his public policies and
politics, Curtis was the opposite in his sartorial approach; He
often favored flashy plaid trousers, red blazers and uncommonly
bold striped shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, he steadily voted his conservative
beliefs, opposing many programs that are now accepted as part of
the American social scene including, Medicaid, Medicare, public
housing and food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   He was first elected to the House in 1938 and was re-elected
seven times. He then won four terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was known as ``Mr. Republican'' in Nebraska, he
actually began his political career as a Democrat, a fact that The
Omaha World-Herald said was generally unknown to his many friends
and supporters over the years.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Lois, died in 1970.

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A potent winter storm stunned much of the East
Coast on Tuesday, crimping all but emergency government services
and entirely shutting down the capital's federal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The swift, dense storm roared north overnight to New England
from the Carolinas after burying Raleigh in well over a foot of
snow as the state's National Guard manned shovels to face a state
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   At least five deaths were attributed to the storm, four in
traffic accidents in the Carolinas and a fatal heart attack
suffered by a 58-year-old New York City man while shoveling snow.
In addition, a 5-year-old girl in Massachusetts was missing and
feared dead after falling into an icy river on her way to school.
</P>
<P>
   Brandishing wind gusts of 40 miles per hour and burying the most
stricken areas in the Carolinas in 20 inches of snow, the storm's
severity took weather forecasters by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, businesses and airports were closed or severely
hampered in the thick swath of the storm. It stopped Philadelphia's
new mayor, John Street, from delivering his first budget address as
he took to the streets to deal instead with his first snow
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware legislative session was canceled, while Gov. James
B. Hunt of North Carolina declared a general emergency from snow
accumulations of more than 18 inches in the worst hit areas. ``This
is a dangerous storm and should be treated as such,'' he warned as
utility workers described hurricane-like damage in the storm's
wake.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, close to 200 motorists had to be rescued from
snowdrifts that paralyzed interstate highways. More than 200,000
homes were reported without power along the border of the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful, but it took us by surprise,'' said Karen
Duncan in York County, S.C., speaking from her new home that was
left in 50-degree heat after 10 inches of snow socked in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of ad hoc measures, a visiting Chinese military
delegation in Washington resorted to taking the Metro subway rather
than a motorcade to reach a high-level meeting with officials at
the Pentagon in Virginia. In South Carolina, children freed from
school in the snow-encrusted Midlands improvised sleds from the
boogy boards that they normally ply at the resort area's
beachfronts.
</P>
<P>
   LaGuardia Airport in New York closed, as did Reagan National
Airport across the Potomac River from Washington and airports in
Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore. At the Raleigh-Durham
International Airport, runways were under 17 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the Eastern Seaboard was paralyzed, the New York
City metropolitan area managed to escape the worst of the storm.
But more snow fell in the city than had been predicted: New York
City officials were told to expect only 1 to 3 inches, but up to 6
inches fell in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the extra measure of snow, thousands decided to spend the
day at home. There were 140,000 fewer commuters than normal by bus
or train between New Jersey and New York City. ``Everyone knows
that everyone else is home, so everyone has been e-mailing each
other just to check in and say hi,'' said Joan Gilbert, a public
relations consultant in Ossining, in Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, though, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani offered an upbeat
report, detailing the progress at clearing city streets, rattling
off statistics about the number of plows and salt trucks, even
offering reports on flight delays at Kennedy Airport and the lower
speed limit imposed on the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Snowbound and short of bureaucrats, the federal government was
declared closed in Washington on Tuesday morning as the capital
hardened into an icy still-life, out of bounds to all but the
hardiest pedestrians and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate all the white stuff since we don't have it,''
declared Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, speaking as a delighted
but cautious Mississippian. He yielded to the intense storm and cut
off the government's legislative deliberations soon after the
executive branch shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The executive branch had first attempted a partial work day
under the ``liberal leave'' option that lets individual workers try
to get to work or not. But this was soon abandoned in favor of an
outright shutdown, as the driving snows intensified after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   More than a foot of snow was measured in outlying suburbs where
many of the 250,000 federal workers live. The snow shutdown, the
first in four years, cost an estimated $60 million in lost labor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Overnight predictions had left the city expecting the storm to
be less intense and later in arriving than it proved to be; the
capital awoke to deep drifts and impassable roads. ``Everybody
involved in this would have preferred a longer lead time,''
conceded Dr. Louis Uccellini, director of the National Center for
Environmental Prediction, as the capital shifted to postmortem
critiques even before the snows ceased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, work went forward on President Clinton's
final State of the Union address to be delivered Thursday. There
was play, too, when Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, could
not resist the drifts outside the West Wing and divided the staff
for a snowball fight.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours of steadily falling snow enforced a mood of
small-town serenity upon the capital, exemplified at the Senate
barbershop where two barbers showed up. They quietly snipped away,
talking about the weather with a few equally adventurous customers.
``Nobody told me not to work,'' one barber explained, speaking on
the condition of anonymity that seems to mark even the most
atypical business day at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The only other activity in sight was a news media stakeout
outside room 410 in the Cannon House office building. Reporters
slouched in a corridor clot of wintry mufti, awaiting the visiting
Cuban grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez, the refugee schoolboy at the
heart of the custody struggle raging between Havana and Miami's
Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't touch the snow, we only walked on it,'' one of the
grandmothers gently replied when the news conference, like most
discussions here Tuesday, finally got around to asking about the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked of it at a news conference at which he pledged
federal aid for the buried areas. ``I'm glad you all got here,'' he
told reporters, beaming as he added, ``I thought school was
canceled today.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House, a few tourists bucked the slanting snow
and stood on the base of the security fence to get a better look at
the white-on-white tableau. Officer Stephanie Clark of the U.S.
Park Police shooed them off the fence, then discovered her patrol
car was stuck in a curbside snowbank. ``This is one day where it's
not great to be a police officer,'' she muttered, fetching a shovel
from the trunk and digging the car out.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics continued as usual in snow-inured New
Hampshire as the primary contenders darted about with the help of
blade plows and political spinners. But in South Carolina, where
the contending is usually balmier, the deep snow stopped Elizabeth
Dole's rounds on behalf of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Blustery, icy snow lashed the capital Mall at midday when
Derrick Wooley, from Monterey, La., talked three of his friends
into venturing forth with him to experience what he exulted in
describing as the very first snowfall of his life. ``I love it,''
he said, chewing on some snow. ``Well, I find it makes me thirsty
stomping around in it,'' explained Wooley, a new arrival in town
who is a legislative intern at the American Association of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a hill,'' said his friend, Brian Shaifer, an
intern with the Organization of American States from Natchez,
Miss., another Southerner looking to attempt his very first
sledding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to talk them out of it,'' said Marisa Collins as
the group headed toward the meager slope of Capitol Hill,
brandishing slices of cardboard to serve as sleds. ``I'm from New
York; I've seen this stuff before.''

ENHANCED TV HAS THAT MILLIONAIRE FEEL TO IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regis Philbin is sitting across from you, you're sweating
bullets, the studio lights are spinning and you're out of
lifelines.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: For $1 million ... it's the fourth quarter of Super Bowl
XXXIV. Who will St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner turn to on
third-and-five at the Tennessee Titans' 15? A: Marshall Faulk. B:
Isaac Bruce. C: Ricky Proehl. D: Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: Regis, I know this. It's C, Ricky Proehl.
</P>
<P>
   Regis: Final answer?
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: Final answer.
</P>
<P>
   The online feature known as Enhanced TV is not exactly Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire _ ABC's popular television quiz show. But the
concept that viewers want to interact with a game-show-like
production makes its similar in some respects.
</P>
<P>
   On the Millionaire show, contestants answer questions for big
bucks. Since its launch in September, Enhanced TV _ accessible
through ESPN.com, NFL.com and Superbowl.com, as well as Disney's
GO.com site _ has given more than 2.2 million contestants a chance
to answer trivia and make play-call guesses against others online
users for points.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Enhanced TV developers are using Super Bowl XXXIV on
Sunday as a backdrop to boost their product's new features (more
multimedia and player options) while frequently dropping the
Internet industry's buzzword _ convergence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making the push for true convergence,'' said Jonathan
Leess, executive producer of Enhanced TV.
</P>
<P>
   In its current state, Enhanced TV is far from converged. Use of
the technology requires keeping the TV and computer close.
Contestants must access the Enhanced TV site and divide their
attention among two windows _ one where the users choose who gets
the ball and another for live statistics. Factor in another window
for trivia questions and it's a test for anyone's attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Enhanced TV research shows a typical user remains
logged into the service for an average of 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the enjoyment of the game, as a user on the Internet,
that much more intense,'' said Aram Sinnreich, consumer content
analyst for Jupiter Communications, an Internet industry watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Leess, who plans to make a media presentation of the site today,
said he expects further integration to make Enhanced TV on a single
screen in the next few years. It's not only tough on the viewers,
but hard to sell, Leess said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to go back and forth is not a way to go,'' he said.
``And the advertisers don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers might like Enhanced TV's coming project. The
company, a Disney subsidiary that works out of Los Angeles and New
York, is working with ABC producers on the Millionaire show and
will have an interactive online version by late February or early
March, Leess said.  &LR; subheds:Bytes Dot.com commercials: Expect at
least a dozen commercials at this Super Bowl with Internet
connections, though none has to do with sports. The closest hint of
sports might be Austin-based Netpliance, which kicks off its
national branding campaign with three 30-second commercials.
Advertising Age's site (www.adage.com) predicts the Cowboys
cheerleaders to show off the company's home-friendly Web devices.
</P>
<P>
   It's not Ren and Stimpy, but ... Here's a new cartoon: the
adventures of a 42-year-old NFL quarterback. Pseudo Programs
(www.pseudo.com), a New York-based producer of interactive
Internet-only video programming, plans to debut QB Toons at 5 p.m.
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   QB Toons premiers with Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Warren
Moon. The episode features Moon as he recalls playing in his first
organized football game as a 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Expect more of the same. Pseudo and the NFL Quarterback Club
reached an agreement in the fall to launch a lifestyle-oriented pro
football channel on Pseudo.com featuring the quarterback club's 44
members, including the Cowboys' Troy Aikman. In exchange, NFL QB
Club invested in Pseudo.com and put Bernie Kosar on the company's
board.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday morning, Pseudo.com debuted the hidden drumming
talents of Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie. His band, The
Flutie Gang, performed the song off their new compact disc,
``Ramblin' Scramblin' Man'' on Pseudo.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know about that famous Hail Mary pass, but who knew
Flutie could rock out to ``Proud Mary,'' too?'' said Tony Asnes,
Pseudo Programs president.
 &LR; subheds:Super sites Here is what the big-media sites have planned
for Super Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   CNNSI.com: Atlanta-based site benefits from local information.
Besides the usual exhaustive data, features include access to the
swanky Sports Illustrated and Turner Sports party, live chats, live
video streaming of news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   CBS SportsLine: Analysis and scouting reports, interactivity,
live game stats.

AGGIES BEGIN TO BUILD UNDER WATKINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a season-opening loss to North Carolina A&AMP;T, Melvin
Watkins' basketball team at Texas A&AMP;M was ranked 318th among NCAA
Division I programs by one nationally recognized service.
</P>
<P>
   For those not up to date on their numbers, there are only 318
schools playing Division I basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get much lower than that,'' Watkins surmised.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that this week _ after Saturday's stunning 64-59 upset
of then-No. 12 Oklahoma State _ the Aggies (6-10, 2-3 Big 12) have
meteorically risen 134 spots. The Sagarin/''USA Today'' rating
system pegs the Aggies as the 184th-best team.
</P>
<P>
   Well, neither Rome nor a major-college basketball program was
built in a day, or a game.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's first victory over a ranked team since 1987, coupled with
a controversial road victory at Texas Tech the Saturday before, has
brought the program new-found respect. Watkins, though, said it's
not a turning point in his attempt to build a nationally recognized
program where victories over top-25 teams won't be so startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely a good win,'' Watkins said. ``But a turning point? That
may be a lot said. We've got to back it up now.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's long road toward respect continues tonight at Iowa State,
where second-year coach Larry Eustachy can appreciate Watkins'
plight _ though he started several rungs higher when he took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M's staff is doing a great job,'' Eustachy said. ``They have
a lot of young players, and I can understand how they struggled
early. But they've really come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their win over Oklahoma State makes them very dangerous. I'm
sure they're into respect. They're getting it at a rapid pace these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins could say he told the media so, because he did.
</P>
<P>
   Just after his team tuned up for Big 12 competition by losing at
home to Centenary on Jan. 5, Watkins said, ``Teams better get us
now, because we're going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew how quickly?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet,'' Watkins quickly cautioned. ``But I
wasn't apprehensive about making a statement like that, even though
I knew it was something that could come back and bite me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I was trying to make was that we weren't going to be
playing at that level before the season was over and certainly not
in the future. I've got to make these kids know that when I make a
statement like that, how hard they've got to work to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThe OSU win\S is a great example of why I can make a
statement like that. I've got kids who can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Watkins calls his players kids, it's not coach-speak.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma State game marked the third time this season
Watkins has started four freshmen. Five rookies have started at
least three games, led by a backcourt of Bernard King and point
guard Jamaal Gilchrist. Three other freshmen figure prominently _
forward Larry Scott, 6-11 center Andy Slocum and 6-10 ``small''

the group and who Watkins said has potential akin to Kansas' Luke
Axtell.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of a well-regarded recruiting class, one that was
ranked as high as 14th nationally. Watkins' staff followed that
with a November signing that ranked as high as 18th.
</P>
<P>
   All members of this year's class apparently share a common
trait: the desire to be trailblazers. A&AMP;M had only one winning
season (19-10, 1993-94) during the decade of the '90s and won only
nine conference games in the first three years of the Big 12. They
last played in the NCAA Tournament in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   This year's team is showing the resilience of youth. Witness the
victory at Tech after a home loss to Texas (78-51) and the victory
over Oklahoma State after being worn out by Kansas (78-57).
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like that we can beat anyone on a given night, if we
play well,'' said King, the unassuming guard from a Class B school
(Gibsland Coleman) in northern Louisiana. His 16.3-point scoring
average ranks sixth nationally among Division I freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a low point. Losing has been tough to live
with because I'm not used to it,'' King said. ``But like I've said
all along, I knew it would be like that in the beginning. I wanted
to be part of turning around a losing tradition. And when I found
out what coach Watkins was trying to do, A&AMP;M seemed like the
perfect place.''
</P>
<P>
   King was courted by Purdue, Minnesota, Seton Hall and Louisiana
State, among others. Gilchrist, who played at Middleburg (Va.)
Notre Dame Academy, said his list of schools offering scholarships
included Villanova, Xavier, North Carolina Charlotte (Watkins'
previous stop) and Virginia Tech. But he shared Watkins' and King's
grand design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a part of history,'' Gilchrist said.
</P>
<P>
   And at that, he already may have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a teacher pull me aside after class \RMonday\S and tell
me what a great game we played on Saturday,'' Gilchrist said. ``And
there were people coming up to me on campus that I didn't even know
telling me, `Great game.' That's the first time that has
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   If Watkins is correct, it's not the last.

<P>
   After a season-opening loss to North Carolina A&AMP;T, Melvin
Watkins' basketball team at Texas A&AMP;M was ranked 318th among NCAA
Division I programs by one nationally recognized service.
</P>
<P>
   For those not up to date on their numbers, there are only 318
schools playing Division I basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get much lower than that,'' Watkins surmised.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that this week _ after Saturday's stunning 64-59 upset
of then-No. 12 Oklahoma State _ the Aggies (6-10, 2-3 Big 12) have
meteorically risen 134 spots. The Sagarin/''USA Today'' rating
system pegs the Aggies as the 184th-best team.
</P>
<P>
   Well, neither Rome nor a major-college basketball program was
built in a day, or a game.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's first victory over a ranked team since 1987, coupled with
a controversial road victory at Texas Tech the Saturday before, has
brought the program new-found respect. Watkins, though, said it's
not a turning point in his attempt to build a nationally recognized
program where victories over top-25 teams won't be so startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely a good win,'' Watkins said. ``But a turning point? That
may be a lot said. We've got to back it up now.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's long road toward respect continues tonight at Iowa State,
where second-year coach Larry Eustachy can appreciate Watkins'
plight _ though he started several rungs higher when he took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M's staff is doing a great job,'' Eustachy said. ``They have
a lot of young players, and I can understand how they struggled
early. But they've really come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their win over Oklahoma State makes them very dangerous. I'm
sure they're into respect. They're getting it at a rapid pace these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins could say he told the media so, because he did.
</P>
<P>
   Just after his team tuned up for Big 12 competition by losing at
home to Centenary on Jan. 5, Watkins said, ``Teams better get us
now, because we're going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew how quickly?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet,'' Watkins quickly cautioned. ``But I
wasn't apprehensive about making a statement like that, even though
I knew it was something that could come back and bite me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I was trying to make was that we weren't going to be
playing at that level before the season was over and certainly not
in the future. I've got to make these kids know that when I make a
statement like that, how hard they've got to work to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThe OSU win\S is a great example of why I can make a
statement like that. I've got kids who can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Watkins calls his players kids, it's not coach-speak.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma State game marked the third time this season
Watkins has started four freshmen. Five rookies have started at
least three games, led by a backcourt of Bernard King and point
guard Jamaal Gilchrist. Three other freshmen figure prominently _
forward Larry Scott, 6-11 center Andy Slocum and 6-10 ``small''
forward Tomas Ress, a summer signee who ranks as the surprise of
the group and who Watkins said has potential akin to Kansas' Luke
Axtell.

STARS CAN'T EXPLAIN STREAK AGAINST KINGS _ AND KNOW IT WILL END
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars defenseman Jamie Pushor touched his left
index finger to his lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shhhhh ... '' he said, whispering himself. But with a victory
or tie against the Los Angeles Kings ... ?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' Pushor insisted. ``You don't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is the 21-game unbeaten streak against the Kings that the
Stars carry into tonight's game at Reunion Arena. With a victory or
tie, the streak would become the longest in Stars franchise
history. Yes, the Kings have about the same luck against the Stars
as the Washington Generals do against the Harlem Globetrotters.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all well and good, but the Stars don't want to talk
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can figure out why or how it happens
anyway,'' Stars forward Guy Carbonneau said. ``I find that over the
years you have some teams that even if they are lower than you, you
can't beat them, then you have some teams that, for one reason or
another, you can't lose against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars haven't lost to the Kings since April 6, 1995, and
have won the past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only three players on the current roster _ Mike Modano,
Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk _ were full-time Stars when
they lost to the Kings in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Do they even remember the game? ``No,'' Modano admitted. ``It's
been 21 games. What is that, about five years?''
</P>
<P>
   Four years, nine months and 20 days to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, E-mail went from a fad to a way of life, Monica
Lewinsky went from an intern to household name, and the Cowboys
went from Super Bowl champions to a punch line.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, how time flies when you're winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you look at sports there are different streaks,''
Pushor said. ``Either they haven't won in such-a-such a place or
haven't lost at home to another team. Streaks are a part of sports,
but they're not usually this long.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL record book doesn't include streaks between opponents,
but the Montreal Canadiens had a 34-game unbeaten streak against
the Washington Capitals that ran from 1974 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks haven't defeated the Utah Jazz since Feb. 1, 1997,
a span of 11 games. The New York Yankees have won nine consecutive
playoff games against the Rangers. The Super Bowl-finalist St.
Louis Rams snapped a 17-game losing streak against San Francisco
this season, halting a streak that began in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, streaks, like rules, are meant to be broken. ``If it does
ever happen, which I'm sure it will eventually, that's when people
will start saying `Well, it ended like this or ended like that,' ''
Stars forward Grant Marshall said. ``It's going to end sometime.
Hopefully, we can keep it going for a while longer. We need these
points.''
</P>
<P>
   They're still not talking about ``it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of them won't even admit to knowing about ``it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest certainly aren't relying on ``it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we went into the game against LA and said `Oh,
come on guys. We have a 20 and 0 streak against these guys. Let's
keep it going,' '' Stars forward Mike Keane said. ``That's not
really our pregame speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The streak, they say, doesn't win games. Teams win games.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are an injury-riddled team right now, fighting to get
points until they start getting players back at about the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   So the Kings are just what the doctor ordered, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We don't look
at the \Rjerseys\S that much. It's just kind of our group vs. their
group. That's how you play it.'' \Ntagtop:Jennifer Floyd, (817)

RAMS LINEMAN NO LONGER `KEARSED'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ St. Louis Rams right tackle Fred Miller knew what was
coming yesterday. So when the media blitz hit, he stood his ground.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a two-time All-Southwest Conference selection at Baylor,
was one of the most popular players at Super Bowl XXXIV's media
day. But for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was ``Kearsed'' in an Oct. 31 loss to the Tennessee
Titans. Lined up opposite Tennessee rookie Jevon Kearse, Miller was
penalized six times for false starts, drew another flag for
holding, allowed a sack and was pulled from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that I let my team down, creating so many mental
mistakes with just a lack of concentration,'' Miller said. ``It's
not the style of football we like to play in St. Louis, and it's
not the style of football I like to play. I definitely would have
given the team a better chance to win the football game if I
wouldn't have created so many penalties and put us in so many
third-and-long situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great defense, and they have great personnel. You
just can't win that way when you create so many mental mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse has haunted Miller since that 24-21 loss to the Titans.
Three months later, on the NFL's biggest stage, Miller gets a
second chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are counting on this being Miller's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of confidence in Fred Miller,'' Rams coach Dick
Vermeil said. ``He's a tough kid. He got a little frustrated and
had penalties called on him and that kind of stuff, but he's a
better football player today than he was that day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams (15-3) allowed five Titans to have five sacks of
quarterback Kurt Warner during their meeting in Nashville. Miller
blames some of the Rams' breakdowns on crowd noise. The rest was
all Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely impressed me with his speed,'' said Miller, who
has 40 starts in four seasons. ``It's very rare that you see a guy
that has the type of speed that he has. He's a gifted athlete. I
would say I wasn't focused enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, who set an NFL rookie record with 14.5 sacks, unnerved
many veteran offensive tackles this season. But none more than
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wouldn't say there was fear, but I think he was kind
of rattled,'' Kearse said. ``Now, I think he's over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Miller insists that the worst moment of his career was
put behind him after watching game tapes the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a couple of days to get through it,'' Miller said.
``I went home and just really kind of sat down with my family and
looked at my son and saw how he loved me, and my wife and my dogs
treated me great. So, I still knew I had some people in St. Louis
that loved me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of letting football die for a couple of
days. Come Wednesday, everything was all forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller hopes he becomes forgotten again after Sunday. After all,
an offensive lineman could wish for only two things: a Super Bowl
ring and anonymity.

STANFORD'S MENDEZ SAYS HE HAS CONQUERED LINGERING KNEE INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While rehabilitating an injured knee last summer, Ryan Mendez
abruptly decided on the ultimate test through the influence of a
casual acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of us were climbing up a mountain in Glacier National
Park, and we reached a small lake and stopped to rest,'' said
Mendez, a former high school star at Burleson who is now a swing
guard for No. 2-ranked Stanford. ``We were dead tired, but it was
starting to get dark, so we started hiking back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of the guys lagged behind, and I got impatient, so I
moved out about 50 yards ahead of the group. I reached a little
clearing, looked up ... and there, right in front of me, was a
grizzly bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendez, of course, remained calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you're not supposed to run in that situation,'' he
said, ``but that's exactly what I did. I just took off. In fact, I
ran all the way back down the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the bottom, Mendez checked for missing parts (none) and
came to the realization that the knee was working quite well. For
the rest of the summer, rehabilitation was conducted in the gym, as
Mendez worked to regain the form that made him the top three-point
shooter (47 percent) in the Pacific-10 Conference as a sophomore in
1997-98, when the Cardinal reached the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   His last shot of that season was a three-pointer with 44 seconds
remaining in overtime to cut a Kentucky lead to one point, but the
Wildcats hung on for an 86-85 victory and beat Utah for the
national championship two days later.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Mendez had surgery to correct a longstanding
tendinitis condition in his left knee, which was presumably
repaired when ``they cut a section about the size of the end of
your fingernail out of my patella tendon.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he tried to return that fall, there was still pain in
the knee, and he played only five games before opting for a
redshirt year. Now, returning for his junior season, the 6-foot-7,
210-pound Mendez, who swings between guard and forward, has
improved his rebounding and says he has felt better about his shot
``for about the last seven games.''
</P>
<P>
   There was supporting evidence last weekend, when he had 15
points _ including four-for-four from beyond the arc _ as Stanford
(15-1) defeated California. With Arizona's loss to Southern Cal,
the Cardinal moved up a notch in the national rankings to No. 2
behind Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Although he hit a crucial three-pointer and sank two free throws
to ice an early-season victory against Duke, Mendez said he ``was
still feeling rusty'' when the season began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I actually hadn't played a game healthy in a year and a
half, and that's a pretty long layoff,'' he said. ``I just shot
tons of shots in the gym this summer, but when the season began, I
was only shooting about 25 percent overall, and it was ridiculous.
Now, I'm up to about 39 percent, and I think I'm OK. My body feels
good, and I think we have a team capable of reaching the Final Four
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendez, who once scored 72 points in a high school game and
averaged 38.2 as a senior at Burleson, said he has grown accustomed
to being a role player on the talent-rich Cardinal. An economics
major, he is also appreciative of the role of a degree from
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great place, and I'm playing with a great bunch of
guys,'' he said. ``I still want to wind up as one of the top
three-point shooters in NCAA history, and I still want to play in
the NBA, but this area out here, Silicon Valley, can also open your
eyes to a lot of things. It's a land of opportunity: You see
average people with fairly good ideas driving around in Porsches,
so it makes you think in more depth about your future.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now, my only goal is helping this team get back to
the Final Four. In college basketball, it's /the'' dream, and
having been there once just makes you hungry for more.''

AMYAS AMES, 93, A CHAMPION OF LINCOLN CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Ore.)  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amyas Ames, an investment banker who devoted half his life to
the support of the arts, becoming board chairman of both the New
York Philharmonic and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, died
on Monday at a retirement community in Lexington, Mass. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   During his long business career Ames was managing partner at
Kidder, Peabody &AMP; Co. and chairman of its executive committee. He
also served as president of the Investment Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   But as an amateur pianist and longtime lover of the arts, Ames
realized early on that he did not want to follow the
``straight-business route,'' as he explained in an article in The
New York Times on the occasion of his appointment to the Lincoln
Center post in 1970. ``I wanted to phase out early,'' he said, and
help ``tie the performing arts into political developments, into
the fight to improve the quality of life, the quality of the
environment in our cities.''
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the board of the New York Philharmonic in
1955, became its president in 1963 and served as chairman from 1970
until 1983. In 1970 he also accepted the appointment as chairman of
Lincoln Center, following the retirement of John D. Rockefeller
III; he held the position for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he accepted the Lincoln Center post, the
organization was in its seventh year and facing financial crisis.
Ames believed that the decrease in private and government funding
for the arts was a reflection of more pressing societal concerns
about urban, racial and educational problems. He was a
self-described optimist about the ability of the arts to help these
problems. ``We're fighting the pollution of the inner city, and
along with it we should be fighting the pollution of the inner
mind,'' he said in the same interview.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure at Lincoln Center he headed two major
endowment drives that raised over $28 million. He instigated the
New York Philharmonic's free ``Concerts in the Parks'' series,
which began in 1965 and still thrives, and oversaw the creation of
the ``Live From Lincoln Center'' television broadcasts, the first
of which, in 1976, presented a New York Philharmonic concert with
the pianist Van Cliburn.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, he spearheaded the renovation of the
Philharmonic's concert hall at Lincoln Center, which had opened as
Philharmonic Hall in 1962. To correct the hall's notoriously poor
acoustics, some expensive adjustments were tried during the 1960s.
But it was not until Ames solicited the support of Avery Fisher and
the hall was totally renovated and reopened in 1976 as Avery Fisher
Hall that critics pronounced themselves satisfied with the results.
</P>
<P>
   Ames was born in Sharon, Mass., on June 15, 1906. His father was
a biologist at Harvard University and his mother was an artist and
musician. His grandfather, Oliver Ames, had been governor of
Massachusetts. Ames' unusual first name, Amyas, was an old English
spelling of the family name.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Harvard, playing baseball and also performing on
clarinet in the Harvard Band. After graduating in 1928, he entered
Harvard Business School. The next year the stock market crashed.
Undeterred, his master's degree in tow, Ames joined a Boston
financial firm and three years later moved to New York to begin his
career at Kidder, Peabody.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he served as administrative officer of the
War Shipping Administration in Washington, a civilian government
agency that coordinated the operation of the 4,000 allied ships
that were transporting food and war materials.
</P>
<P>
   For 60 years he was married to Evelyn I. Perkins, a published
poet and author, who died in 1990. In 1995 Ames married Lucia
Millham of Locust Valley, N.Y., who had worked in hospital
administration, and who survives him.
</P>
<P>
   Ames was an avid environmentalist and nature photographer. At
his summer home in Martha's Vineyard he took photographs of flowers
and wildlife, many of which were published with his accompanying
essays in The Vineyard Journal. In 1980 a collection of his
photographs and essays entitled ``The Private Lives of Our Natural
Neighbors'' was published as a book by George Braziller of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Ames is survived by four children from his
first marriage: two sons, Edward and Oakes, both of New York City;
two daughters, Olivia Hoblitzelle of Cambridge, Mass., and Joan
Ames of Eugene, Ore.; 11 grandchildren, and six
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In his final years at the Brookhaven retirement community in
Lexington, Ames designed and oversaw the creation of a nature trail
through the wooded grounds that was accessible to elderly people
with limited mobility.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Psalms 23:4 &QR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ATLANTA _ The Titans weren't supposed to be here, and neither were
the Rams. You won't find anybody anywhere who, last summer,
predicted a Tennessee-St. Louis Super Bowl, except perhaps at the
Liar's Club.
</P>
<P>
   But neither team should be depicted as a miraculous survivor,
Tennessee's ``home run throwback'' and St. Louis' Kurt Warner
notwithstanding. Each team posted a 13-3 season. You have to be
legitimately good to be that consistent. Both bloomed early and
stayed in full flower all year. While luck was part of their
respective winning equations, so is it every season for whoever is
left standing come Super Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There will, however, be one man on the field who, by all rights,
shouldn't be there. For him, miraculous fits. We were reminded of
same Tuesday morning by the pictures of Derrick Thomas' battered
Suburban and the news that the Chiefs' Pro Bowl linebacker, the
most prolific sacker of quarterbacks in the 1990s, is now paralyzed
from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' vehicle spun off an icy Missouri highway and flipped.
Not wearing a seat belt, he was thrown through a window and
suffered spinal damage. He will probably never walk again, a tragic
fate that should have, at the very least, also befallen Rams
receiver Isaac Bruce in early December.
</P>
<P>
   When the left rear tire on Bruce's Mercedes convertible blew out
at 80 mph on I-70, he sent it into a wild skid by hitting the brake
pedal to disengage the cruise control. The car careened into a
gully and rolled over twice before landing upright. Every window
shattered, and the ragtop roof collapsed on him and his girlfriend,
Clegzette Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent repair estimate came in at $25,000. But she
suffered only a minor cut on her forehead. Bruce? He walked away
unhurt. Not a bruise on him. Yet, like Thomas, he wasn't wearing a
seat belt either.
</P>
<P>
   Now, think about that for a moment. Two complete flips in a
convertible? No seat belt, but no injuries? He could have practiced
the next day, and he did play a full game the following Sunday. How
is this possible?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus,'' Bruce said.
</P>
<P>
   He scanned the crowd of reporters in front of his podium and
smiled slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I see your eyes rolling,'' Bruce said. ``You don't
believe me, do you? It's the truth. Yes, it is. I called out Jesus'
name, and he saved me. Just one `Jesus.' That's all it took. If
Derrick had known all he had to do was ask for his help, he'd be OK
today. I'm praying for Derrick and his family. He's someone I've
always looked up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce swears that, when his mother was six months pregnant with
him, she, too, rolled a car and incurred barely a bruise or
scratch. She has been reminding Ike ever since, practically daily,
to rely on Jesus to keep him out of harm's way. So as the Benz
began to tumble, he instinctively took his hands off the wheel,
raised them in the air and screamed ``Jesus!'' as loud as he could.
Then he braced himself against the left door and Clegzette's
shoulder, keeping her pressed against the right door.
</P>
<P>
   When the car settled, Bruce opened the door. Immediately, a man
he describes as being ``short and stocky, with long hair'' appeared
and asked him if he needed an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Yeah, sure. You see the car,''' Bruce said. ``But
when some firefighters arrived, they didn't know anything about a
phone call. And nobody ever saw the guy I described. I tried to
find him to invite him to the next game _ I took nine of the people
who helped us _ but he's never turned up. Nobody knows who he
was.''
</P>
<P>
   You know where this is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was an angel,'' Bruce said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another odd twist to the story. A couple of days before
the accident, Bruce's minister had, out of the blue, asked his
congregation to pray for Ike. That he would do so wasn't out of the
ordinary _ ``He takes care of his flock, and I'm part of the
flock'' _ but the timing was intriguing, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce believes Jesus saved his life, period. Asked why Jesus
didn't protect Thomas to the same extent and why ``God's will'' can
be exercised so capriciously, Ike didn't really have an answer. He
said he would only speak to his own faith, which is absolute, and
he took umbrage at the suggestion that Jesus should be held
responsible for Thomas' crippling injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't God's will,'' he said. ``It's just something bad
that happened. Jesus doesn't try to hurt you. He tries to help you.
Believe me, I can say that for certain. He makes everything good
and perfect come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a Super Bowl? Well, Bruce's being here is a miracle, be it
divine or random. You can decide for yourself.
