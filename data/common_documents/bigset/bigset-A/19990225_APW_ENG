<HEADLINE> Washington Sports Owner Beats Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the owner of Washington's professional  
basketball and hockey teams designed a downtown arena, his 
marketing plan included members of Congress being entertained by 
lobbyists who would buy season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for sports mogul Abe Pollin, when the MCI Center  
opened in December 1997, was the 1995 House gift ban. It prevented 
House members and employees from accepting free tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate rules permitting freebies valued less than $50, and  
Pollin made two key decisions: He intentionally valued midlevel 
club seats just under the limit, and he hired a lobbyist, who 
joined an effort by restaurants and other businesses to persuade 
the House to adopt the Senate standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort met success on Jan. 6, when the House adopted the  
Senate rule in its first major action this year. House members and 
employees can now accept free club tickets to watch the Washington 
Wizards shoot three-pointers and the Washington Capitals score 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the $49.50 price printed on the club-level tickets, the  
special interests buying those seats for the season pay twice as 
much. And regardless of the congressional dollar limits on gifts -- 
$49.99 for each instance and $99.99 annually from the same source -- 
there's nothing to stop lawmakers from attending multiple games 
with tickets provided by different sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional gift rules were much looser when Pollin  
decided to spend $200 million of his own money to build a new 
arena. His marketing plan ``was based on the fact that Washington 
is a company town, and the company is the federal government,'' 
said David Julyan, the lobbyist who waged the successful campaign 
for Pollin. ``So access to that market was critical in that 
planning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Walker, the new staff director of the House ethics  
committee, defended the decision, which was based on the premise 
that lawmakers would not share in amenities, such as waiter service 
and parking, that are included in the costs when club seats are 
sold as season tickets. The season price breaks down to almost $98 
per event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not apply to any other stadium or arena,'' Walker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate adopted its $49.99 gift limit in 1995, and when the  
arena opened, club seats ``were priced with that in mind,'' said 
Pollin spokesman Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The old House ban was muddied with 23 exemptions. Even  
congressional watchdog groups such as Common Cause supported the 
new, clearer system that applied to both houses equally. Their 
problem is with the interpretation that MCI Center club seats are 
worth less than $50. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fix was put in,'' said Meredith McGehee, the Common Cause  
legislative director. ``It's something members aren't going to 
complain much about. It shows that weak enforcement can even make 
the best rule have no meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some club seats are available as single game tickets for  
$49.50, that's not the way they're marketed. Rather, the arena 
tries to sell them under a minimum two-year commitment to 
businesses and organizations that want to entertain guests -- 
especially lawmakers, who could not accept more expensive free 
seats in a luxury box. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term arrangements package the seats with amenities --  
parking in the building, waiter service at the seat, access to the 
club restaurant and use of a business center. Lawmakers and staff 
must forgo the amenities to stay under the gift limit, but there is 
no check to make certain they do. 
</P>
<P>
	The price is $8,025 for this year's Wizards' and Capitals'  
seasons. Under this arrangement, the two teams must be purchased as 
a package -- and for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 4, in a letter to the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call,  
House ethics committee chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and ranking 
Democrat Howard Berman of California reaffirmed an earlier ruling 
that Pollin priced the club tickets properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Berman's spokeswoman, Gene Smith, said the Democrat knew about  
Pollin's lobbying but ``thought it was irrelevant.'' Berman did not 
know the ticket pricing was connected to the gift limit, ``but was 
not terribly surprised,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The staff did an analysis of what would be reasonable for the  
seat without fringe benefits,'' Smith said. ``The staff concluded 
this was a reasonable price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nearest, more expensive individual seats in the arena --  
those built below the majority of club seats -- cost $77 for 
basketball and $60 for hockey. The nearest cheaper seats above the 
club level are $40 for both sports.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Drums Up Elderly Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- President Clinton turned to senior citizens  
Thursday for help in pressuring reluctant Republicans to support 
his plan for mending the ailing Medicare insurance program with 
billions of dollars in budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Republicans agree with his idea to reserve surpluses for  
fixing Social Security, but ``we're not there on Medicare yet. ... 
The people of this country need to make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before an enthusiastic crowd, he dropped biting remarks from his  
prepared text about Republicans ``rethinking their indiscriminate 
tax cut that would squander our surplus'' and favoring tax cuts 
that would ``crowd out Medicare.'' Aides said his draft speech was 
only a guideline. 
</P>
<P>
	In this traditionally GOP Republican state, Clinton received a  
rousing welcome two weeks after being acquitted in his Senate 
impeachment trial. An overflow crowd of 2,000 people, many of them 
elderly, jammed the Tucson Convention Center music hall, and many 
more waited outside under a hot sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe, who voted for three of the  
four articles of impeachment against Clinton in the House, drew 
loud boos from the audience when he was introduced to speak before 
the president. Asked later if he still felt Clinton were unfit for 
office, Kolbe said, ``Impeachment's over, let's talk about Social 
Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, a handful of protesters criticized administration  
policy toward Iraq and the president's personal behavior. One woman 
carried a sign referring to accusations against Clinton. It said, 
``I believe Juanita and Paula and Kathleen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's long day ended in San Francisco at a $1 million  
fund-raiser to help Democrats battle to regain control of the House 
and Senate. The ``Majority 2000'' dinner was the first of nine such 
events in an effort to raise $9 million toward next year's 
congressional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1998 -- for the first time since 1822 -- the party of the  
president in the sixth year of a presidency, won seats in the House 
of Representatives while being outspent by $100 million because of 
what they stood for,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that if anyone had said in 1992 to vote for Bill Clinton  
and there would be a budget surplus within six years, the response 
would have been, ``I will not vote for that man, he's nuts. He's 
kidding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton paid tribute to the fact that Arizona is the first state  
to have an all-female line of succession, from governor to 
superintendent of public instruction. He said he told his wife, 
Hillary, that he was going to begin his speech by saying Arizona is 
the mirror of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, yeah ... the women are in charge at last,'' the  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's seven-hour stop in Tuscon was the city's first  
presidential visit since Gerald Ford dropped by 25 years ago. 
Tucson and surrounding Pima County are Democrat-dominated. The 
county was instrumental in helping Clinton in 1996 become the first 
Democrat to carry Arizona in 48 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very grateful for that,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Opening a six-day trip blending business with vacation, Clinton  
urged support for his proposal to earmark 62 percent of expected 
surpluses to shore up Social Security and 15 percent to overhaul 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	With tensions still frayed by the impeachment struggle, Clinton  
and Republicans are seeking the upper hand in a high-stakes contest 
over how to carve up $4.8 trillion in expected budget surpluses 
over 15 years. While Republicans are wary of Clinton's plan for 
Medicare, however, they remain divided among themselves over what 
tax cuts to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said there appeared to be ``some movement toward  
reaching some consensus about the nature of tax cuts, if they ought 
to be targeted and benefit the people that need it most, and try 
not to get in the way of saving Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his speech, the president stopped by an arts and crafts  
fair. He also visited the spring training camp of the Arizona 
Diamondbacks as they prepare for their second season in the 
National League. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he will deliver a foreign policy address in San  
Francisco and fly to Los Angeles for a $175,000 fund-raiser for the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Clinton heads to Park City, Utah, where he and his  
wife will join daughter Chelsea to celebrate her 19th birthday at a 
ski resort. Clinton will return Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Temple's Chaney Reaches 600 Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- You can usually tell how well No. 24 Temple  
is playing by watching how active John Chaney is on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	If they're playing poorly, the Owls coach doesn't do much  
talking, communicating mostly through intense stares at players and 
referees. If Temple's on a roll, Chaney is louder and more 
animated, pleading for better calls and cajoling his team into 
better performances. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 600th career victory, a 71-49 rout Wednesday night  
over Fordham, Chaney did a lot of yelling. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they're playing poorly, that's when he starts to think  
and is more quiet,'' said assistant coach Dean Demopoulos, who has 
been with Temple (19-8, 13-2 Atlantic 10) for 16 years. ``When 
they're playing well, he doesn't want them to get complacent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Complacent is one thing Chaney hasn't been during a 27-year  
coaching career. It shows in his 600-216 record, 21st place on the 
career victory list and 10th among active coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	In typical fashion, Chaney downplayed the milestone and  
concentrated on the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to us to keep our eyes on what we really want  
to accomplish, and that is getting into the NCAA tournament,'' 
Chaney said. ``That's the bigger mark we want to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After holding an impromptu ceremony last Saturday, when a  
victory over George Washington made Chaney Temple's winningest 
basketball coach, school officials didn't even think about honoring 
Chaney for No. 600. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't even bother. By now, we know what his expectations  
are,'' assistant media relations director Brian Kirschner said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So do his players, and maybe especially Brokenborough, the  
target of many Chaney tantrums during his four years in North 
Philadelphia. You listen when your coach has won 375 games over 17 
years at your school and taken 15 teams to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't concentrate on basketball. It was a real  
emotional night,'' said Brokenborough, who was honored before the 
game and received a warm hug from Chaney at center court. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney's success, and his reputation for handling players, has  
opened the door for promising black coaches around the country, 
said St. John's coach Mike Jarvis. He coached against Chaney at 
Atlantic 10 rival George Washington for eight years before moving 
to New York this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made it possible for young aspiring coaches, and  
African-American coaches, to be looked at in a similar light, that 
they are certainly capable of performing at a top program,'' Jarvis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old Chaney hasn't changed much over the years, said  
St. Joseph's coach Phil Martelli. Chaney's voice sounds hoarse at 
times from all the yelling he does on the court; by the end of 
games, his jacket has long been discarded to a seat on the bench 
and his shirtsleeves are rolled up to his elbows. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just gotten older, but he's stayed the same. Even though  
you see some volatility, his even-keelness is one of the keys'' to 
his coaching success, said Martelli, whose coached at St. Joe's for 
five years and also played on high school and collegiate teams that 
competed against Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might be a little less patient now than he used to be,''  
Demopoulos said. ``But then he's never been a very patient 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney hopes defense will be just enough to overcome any  
offensive shortcomings as the Owls shoot for a spot in the NCAA 
tournament. As for reaching victory No. 600, the Temple coach 
doesn't want to dwell on that too much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it all means,'' Chaney said. ``It just means  
that I've been associated with a lot of kids, a lot of players. 
Maybe it means I've been around too long, too.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Steeler Charged With Forgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER, Pa. (AP) -- Former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike  
Webster has been charged with forging a prescription for Ritalin, a 
stimulant used to treat attention deficit disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in  
1997, has battled recurring financial and health problems since 
retiring from the NFL in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Webster appeared in Beaver County Court for a  
preliminary hearing on the drug arrest. The hearing was rescheduled 
for May 28. Neither Webster nor his attorney would comment to the 
Beaver County Times newspaper. Webster has an unlisted telephone 
number and could not be reached afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were waiting for Webster, 46, when he attempted to pick  
up the Ritalin order on Saturday at a drug store in Rochester, near 
his Monaca home about 25 miles west of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster had dropped off the prescription four days earlier. But  
in verifying the order, the pharmacist learned that the physician 
named on the prescription no longer practiced in Pennsylvania and 
called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster was charged with criminal attempt and obtaining drugs by  
fraud using a forged prescription. He was released Saturday on a 
$2,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Since retiring, the four-time Super Bowl champ has lost his home  
to financial problems and separated from his wife, who filed for 
divorce and took their children to Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	An intensely private man, Webster refused many offers of help  
from his former teammates and Steelers officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster estimated that he spent about 18 months homeless in the  
early 1990s, sleeping in his car and the Pittsburgh bus station 
where he could avoid contact with former teammates or corporate 
executives he knew as a football player. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster said he believed he had a couple of minor heart attacks  
several years ago, causing his lungs to fill with fluid and leading 
to breathing problems. He also has been tested for depression, 
post-concussion disorders and convulsive spasms that disrupt his 
sleep and inhibit his concentration. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Webster's symptoms recalled those of former Steelers  
lineman Steve Courson, who blames his poor health on steroid abuse, 
Webster has denied he used steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	After his Hall of Fame induction, Webster appeared to be getting  
back on his feet. He obtained work at a sports marketing firm and 
was living in a budget motel near the Pittsburgh International 
Airport.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Enjoys D-Backs Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- President Clinton has tried to make peace  
with Israel and the Palestinians, with the Serbs and Croats, even 
with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But resolve a golf dispute between pitchers Todd Stottlemyre and  
Andy Benes? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stopped at the Arizona Diamondbacks spring training site  
Thursday during a visit to Tucson. He was presented with a plaque, 
an autographed baseball, a Diamondbacks jersey with his name and 
No. 1 on it, and a Diamondbacks cap that he wore throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre sought some presidential intervention to resolve an  
argument with Benes that had begun loudly in the clubhouse hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	It began the previous day, when Benes and Randy Johnson were  
playing a best-ball round of golf against Stottlemyre and Greg 
Swindell. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre hit into an area with yellow stakes, then claimed he  
got a free drop. Benes said he had to take a penalty stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	With Benes pitching live batting practice for the first time  
this spring, Stottlemyre thought it was a good time to bring it up 
with the president. Clinton sided with Stottlemyre. Benes refused 
to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe that's the way they play in Arkansas,'' Benes said.  
``But I'm from Indiana, and in Indiana you can't hit the ball into 
a staked water hazard and then pick it up without a penalty 
stroke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The argument continued.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said maybe with your buddy there,'' Benes said, indicating  
Clinton, ``you can do that. If you're the president, you can put 
the ball wherever you want. But this was not a friendly game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benes was a little aggravated by the interruption as  
photographers fanned out across the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time I've ever pitched where guys refused to  
swing because they were afraid they'd hit somebody with a line 
drive,'' Benes said. ``I wanted them to swing. Maybe if they hit 
somebody they'd get out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent nearly an hour with the team.  
</P>
<P>
	He posed for pictures with the old-timers on the Diamondbacks --  
Swindell, Johnson, Stottlemyre, Jay Bell and Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He joked that we all made more money than he did,'' Williams  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He chatted at length with Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he was too late, that I'd already pitched,''  
Johnson said. ``He just seemed like a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was given a chance to take a few swings with reliever  
Bobby Chouinard on the mound but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he would love to get in there, and about that time  
Chouinard threw a breaking ball and he said, `I think I'll pass,''' 
manager Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The public was kept out of the workout. A Secret Service man  
inspected all the baseballs. A weapons-sniffing dog examined 
Showalter's golf cart. Sharpshooters were on duty in the tower 
where Showalter and the coaches sometimes observe workouts. A line 
of school buses blocked the outside view of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks had been flooded with phone calls from Clinton  
critics saying that because of the president's personal behavior in 
the Lewinsky affair, he should not be allowed to come to spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' managing general partner,  
said that when the president asks to visit, it's not right to say 
no. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to segregate personal feelings from what is  
reality,'' Colangelo said. ``The reality is the president of the 
United States deserves a certain amount of respect for the office 
of the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said he didn't want to leave, that it was the highlight of  
his visit,'' Showalter said. ``That made us all feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton shook hands with everybody -- except Brian Anderson.  
</P>
<P>
	The left-handed pitcher is, by his own admission, at the  
opposite end of the political spectrum from Clinton. He's also by 
far the most unpredictable free spirit on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was under orders from top members of management and  
ownership to behave myself and watch my mouth,'' Anderson said. 
``And the next thing I know they wouldn't let me anywhere near 
him.''

<HEADLINE> Fehr Not Worried Yet About Stoppage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Starting his annual spring training tour,  
the head of the baseball players' union says it's too early to 
conclude small markets can't compete under the current labor 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this new agreement they have with us, there is vastly  
enhanced revenue sharing and it keeps getting bigger as the 
agreement goes along,'' Donald Fehr said Thursday after meeting 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we need more, or can we get away with less, or can it be  
directed in different ways?'' Fehr said. ``We won't really be in a 
position for a while yet to make meaningful judgments about that 
because the significant revenue sharing has just begun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's collective bargaining agreement is due to expire  
following the 2000 season, but the union is expected to exercise 
its option to extend it through October 2001. Some owners already 
are saying they will again ask for a salary cap, a demand that led 
to a 32-day lockout in 1990 and a 232-day strike in 1994-95, a 
stoppage that wiped out the World Series for the first time in 90 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the NBA players want that kind of agreement, that's  
great,'' Fehr said. ``I have no reason to believe that major league 
players will consider that an appropriate way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fehr said the relationship with the commissioner's office, often  
acrimonious in the past, is far better than it was before the 1994 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to believe,'' he said, ``that with the way things  
are going and with the increased levels of cooperation we have with 
central baseball and the generally more favorable way baseball is 
being received, that by the time we get there, everybody's going to 
look around and say `Things are going well, let's make sure it 
keeps up. But we'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Stottlemyre, who signed a $32 million, four-year contract  
with the Diamondbacks during the offseason, said fans need to be 
considered as a new agreement is negotiated. Following eight work 
stoppages since 1972, fan tolerance of labor strife is not high. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we learned as a group, as players, as owners, as an  
industry what happened to the game the last time around,'' he said.

	Dragging Death Trial Resumes  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A jury decides today whether a white  
supremacist should die for the dragging murder of a black man. 
Yesterday, John King, convicted earlier this week of the gruesome 
June slaying of James Byrd Jr., refused to sit in the courtroom 
when his ailing, wheelchair-bound father took the stand during the 
trial's punishment phase. Attorneys are set to present closing 
arguments today. Then jurors will begin a second round of 
deliberations to decide if King should be the first white to be 
condemned for killing a black person since Texas reinstated the 
death penalty in the mid-1970s.

	Cuba Cuts Most Phone Service to US  
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's telephone company has carried through on a  
threat to cut phone service to the United States. Cuba pulled the 
plug early today because of lack of payment by American companies. 
Most callers trying to reach the United States instead have gotten 
a recorded message saying the lines are congested. The American 
firms have been withholding funds since December pending a federal 
court case against the communist nation involving relatives of four 
Cuban-Americans whose two unarmed aircraft were shot down by MiG 
jets north of the island in February 1996. Service was cut off just

	41 Years in Solitary Confinement Ends

<P>
	TAEJON, South Korea (AP) -- A North Korean man believed to be the  
world's longest-serving political prisoner walked out of a South 
Korean prison today after 41 years in solitary confinement. ``After 
living for decades in a closed place, I am so happy to walk out 
into this open world,'' Woo Yong Gak, 70, told reporters. Holding a 
bouquet, Woo said he hopes South Korea will allow him to return to 
North Korea, where he reportedly has a wife and son. Woo was freed 
under a special amnesty to celebrate the first anniversary today of 
President Kim Dae-jung's inauguration.

	Israel Blocks US Extradition Effort  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court today ruled that an  
18-year-old Maryland youth cannot be extradited to the United 
States to stand trial for murder. Samuel Sheinbein fled to Israel 
two days after the mutilated and burned body of his acquaintance, 
Alfredo Tello Jr., was discovered in Maryland last September. 
Shortly after arriving, Sheinbein was picked up by police. To 
prevent extradition back to Maryland, where he was charged with 
Tello's murder, Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his 
father, who was born in pre-state Israel. Under Israeli law, 
citizens cannot be extradited for trial abroad.

<HEADLINE> Bush Builds Campaign Brain Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has laid claim to  
the network of friends and campaign supporters collected by his 
father over a political lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the younger Bush, who is two weeks away from announcing his  
own intentions regarding a presidential run, hasn't tapped his 
father's White House advisers in assembling a brain trust. Instead, 
the experts brought in to burnish Bush's views on economic, 
domestic and foreign policy come largely from the Reagan wing of 
the Republican Party. Others are new faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has turned to Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, a  
leading disciple of privatization, for domestic policy advice. 
Lawrence Lindsey, who served on President Reagan's Council of 
Economic Advisers and later was appointed by President Bush to the 
Federal Reserve Board, heads the governor's economic policy team. 
Another Reagan economic adviser, Harvard professor Martin 
Feldstein, also has come aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Condoleezza Rice, a Bush administration foreign policy adviser,  
heads the foreign policy team. Paul Wolfowitz, who held State and 
Defense department posts in the Reagan and Bush administrations, 
also is a key adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The lineup, some suggest, marks a clear effort to send the  
signal that the son's presidency would be far more conservative 
than the father's, which many on the right had viewed as a watering 
down of the Reagan legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would characterize them as conservative thinkers,'' Bush  
said this week of his advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	He is openly stressing his ideological independence from his  
father. ``I'll be a different candidate than the previous George 
Bush who ran for president,'' he told The Dallas Morning News. ``I 
love my dad, but I'm a different person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Kristol, who served in the Bush White House as Vice  
President Dan Quayle's chief of staff, said the governor's strategy 
in picking a kitchen Cabinet makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's emphasizing the outreach to the Reagan wing because he  
knows that his potential vulnerability as a Bush is to a Reaganite 
assault,'' said Kristol, who is editor of the conservative Weekly 
Standard magazine. ``How does he lose the nomination? He loses the 
nomination if someone else can say, `I'm Reagan, he's Bush.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospective Republican field, which Bush and former Red  
Cross President Elizabeth Dole dominate in early polls, includes 
several hopefuls who would seek to outflank Bush on the right. 
Among them are Quayle, billionaire Steve Forbes, TV commentator Pat 
Buchanan, social activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	While declining to read anything into the makeup of Bush's  
advisory team, Goldsmith, the Indianapolis mayor, said the advisers 
are advocates of conservative policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big ideas drive quality of life, and to have even a small part  
in this effort to think through governance is really an enormous 
opportunity for me, and hopefully a way I can contribute a little 
bit,'' said Goldsmith. He has joined in several policy roundtables 
in Austin, Texas, and heads there again Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's choice of counselors may be as much generational as  
ideological, said Norman Ornstein, a senior fellow at the American 
Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is picking people who come from the Reagan-Bush  
administration, but in some ways he's picking a different 
generation,'' Ornstein said. ``The younger Bush administration 
team, as a group, was more ideological than the people who were 
from George Bush's generation.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Schilling Has Back Spasms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Philadelphia ace Curt Schilling came  
down with back spasms Thursday. And because it's not serious, the 
Phillies can laugh about what caused them. 
</P>
<P>
	Add this to the list of bizarre baseball injuries: The Phillies  
say Schilling's back pain was caused by one of the favorite spring 
training pastimes -- standing around. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just got some spasms,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona  
said. ``They stand around a lot. I even told them they'd be 
standing around a lot. You get stiff when you do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling felt pain in his lower back when he woke up Thursday  
morning, a day after throwing batting practice for 10 minutes. The 
right-hander doesn't expect to miss his regular turn to throw on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would kind of heat up and get loose, but it never  
did,'' said Schilling, who shut down his workouts when he couldn't 
get warmed up. ``Maybe we should check my mattress. Maybe that's 
the culprit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling was seen bending over after his throwing session on  
Wednesday, but he said he didn't notice the spasms until the next 
morning. He said he's had back spasms a couple of times in his 
career, and they go away in a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt a little tight, and I kind of assumed throwing would  
probably be the thing to loosen it up,'' Schilling said. ``It just 
got worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling joked that eliminating ground ball drills for pitchers  
would alleviate his stiff back in a hurry. It seemed to be a nice 
break for Schilling, whose interviews normally focus on frequent 
trade rumors involving contenders like Cleveland and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	One reporter's question promptly ended the interview.  
</P>
<P>
	``Will you be ready for Game 1 of the ALCS?'' the writer asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Schilling smiled and walked back into the clubhouse.

<HEADLINE> World Labor Chiefs Gather in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Labor Secretary Alexis Herman is hosting the  
labor ministers from the world's largest industrialized nations 
this week at a forum designed to raise the prominence of labor 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, which President Clinton called for during an  
address to the World Trade Organization, was the first time that 
the labor officials gathered in advance of a G-8 summit and it 
represented another step in the administration's effort to forge a 
consensus on U.S. trade policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk increasingly about the labor dimension and where it  
sits at the global economic table today,'' Herman said Wednesday. 
``Here we have labor ministers coming together for the first time 
basically to say we have to mainstream labor concerns with other 
economic issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since organized labor successfully blocked Clinton's request in  
Congress for renewed fast-track negotiating authority, the 
administration has been paying more attention to labor's concerns 
about global trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who's been addressing the issue more frequently in his  
public addresses, touched on his differences over trade again with 
his allies in labor during a Feb. 21 speech to a conference hosted 
by the United Auto Workers, the Steelworkers and the International 
Association of Machinists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trade has divided Americans for a long time. I want you to  
know, however, that I am determined to do whatever I can to find 
common ground on this issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's trade deficit hit a new high this month, but  
Clinton attributes much of the nation's economic prosperity to 
lowering barriers and increasing trade. But when many working 
Americans fear that increased trade leads to jobs lost to low-wage 
countries, Clinton has had to struggle to, in his words, ``put a 
more human face on the global economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The right kind of trade is good for working families,''  
Clinton said. ``But again I say we can't allow international 
economic competition or adversity elsewhere to become a race to the 
bottom at home or in any other country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders are cheered by the attention the administration is  
paying to labor standards around the world, but they are adamant 
that they will not support fast-track unless it includes language 
that would protect workers and the environment in the core of trade 
pacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman said she hoped the meeting with the trade ministers from  
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, 
and the European Union would yield a commitment to continue to meet 
regularly and a declaration on the importance of dealing with labor 
issues alongside financial concerns in negotiating the frameworks 
of global trade. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also taking the ministers to an employment center in  
Baltimore to show them how the United States deals with displaced 
workers and those in need of more job training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to talk about the labor dimension and putting a  
human face on the global economy,'' she said. ``It's quite another 
thing to look at it in very practical terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Camdessus, the head of the International Monetary Fund,  
was slated to address the group, and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney 
was presenting a report on the need for dealing with the threat to 
labor standards posed by the global economy from an international 
consortium of unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8 summit is being held in Cologne, Germany, in June.

<HEADLINE> Retired Players To Do Charity Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a major increase of its charitable work, the  
Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association announced a 
partnership with Save the Children on Thursday as part of its 
Vision 2010 program. 
</P>
<P>
	Exact details of the deal haven't been worked out, but former  
players expect to be involved in a grass-roots effort to reach 
baseball to children called ``For the good of the kids, for the 
love of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the negative things we hear about athletes and their  
lives, more athletes are doing more to help more people in this 
country and the world than ever before,'' said former star Rusty 
Staub, who attended the news conference along with Tug McGraw, 
Steve Rogers, Billy Sample and Rich Hand. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw said former players owed it to today's children.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believed in the people out there setting things up for us  
even though we didn't show the proper amount of appreciation -- 
because we were kids,'' he said. ``Today, kids don't have the same 
types of chances we had as kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the MLBPAA created a speaker's bureau and purchased  
Marketing Venture Partners of McLean, Va., through its for-profit 
subsidiary, Major League Alumni Marketing, which signed an 
exclusive deal with Ted Williams that covers his activities at this 
summer's All-Star game in Fenway Park.

<HEADLINE> Radio DJ Suspended for Race Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Radio shock jock Doug Tracht, known as  
``Greaseman'', has been suspended indefinitely for a race-related 
remark made on station WARW-FM. 
</P>
<P>
	The station's general manager, Sarah Taylor, announced Wednesday  
that she suspended Tracht without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht made the remark Wednesday during his morning drive-time  
show on the classic rock station. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the Grammy Awards ceremony was scheduled for that  
evening and played a portion of a song by Lauryn Hill, a young 
black hip-hop artist nominated for 10 Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he commented, ``No wonder people drag them behind trucks.''  
</P>
<P>
	The reference was to the torture and death in Texas of James  
Byrd Jr., a black man decapitated while being dragged behind a 
pickup truck. John William King, a white supremacist, was convicted 
of murder Tuesday in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said in announcing Tracht's suspension that she  
``deplored the comment and was appalled by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht faxed this one-paragraph statement to The Washington  
Post: ``I'm truly sorry for the pain and hurt I have caused with my 
unfeeling comment. I have no excuse for my remark, and regret it. 
If I could take it back I would. In the course of my show, split 
second judgment is made over ad-libs. This remark was a grave error 
in my judgment.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Memorabilia Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The nonprofit foundation that succeeded the  
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games paid almost $1 million for 
the personal memorabilia of former Olympics chief Billy Payne, The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne used $606,000 of the $975,000 he received two years ago  
from the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation to pay off the 
personal debt he incurred during the years he worked as a volunteer 
to bring the 1996 Olympics to Atlanta, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne's collection includes a commemorative torch he carried in  
Greece, the first Centennial Olympic Park brick and correspondence 
with heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAAF, which is co-chaired by Payne, held the loan on its  
books, and Payne paid it off with money he received for the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to give me the money to satisfy my personal loan,  
but I wouldn't accept the money without giving something back,'' 
Payne told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	GAAF president Ralph Jernigan Jr. said Wednesday that the  
foundation, whose board of directors is composed of the original 
Olympic bid team assembled by Payne, offered several times to pay 
off Payne's debt with about $12 million in private funds raised 
during the 1987-90 bid effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billy had run up a substantial debt during that period of  
time,'' said Jernigan, a sports marketing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne paid back part of the loan in 1993. GAAF assumed the rest  
from the original lender, identified only as a friend of Payne's. 
</P>
<P>
	After working for three years with no salary, Payne's salary as  
chief executive of ACOG was $519,000 when the organization was 
incorporated in 1991. In 1996, his last full year as Olympics 
chief, he was paid $767,000, according to federal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal-Constitution said details of Payne's financial  
dealings with GAAF emerged during its scrutiny of Atlanta's Olympic 
bid effort amid the Olympic influence-peddling scandal in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne and other Atlanta Olympics officials have maintained that  
they did nothing wrong in obtaining the International Olympic 
Committee vote giving the city the 1996 Games. They also maintain 
that hundreds of boxes of records owned by GAAF and kept at the 
Atlanta History Center contain privately owned material that is too 
sensitive for public inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	ACOG's board of directors turned over the mountains of documents  
to GAAF in the spring of 1996. Jernigan said Payne's personal 
collection was not included. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was stuff he mainly kept at his house,'' Jernigan said.  
``Billy was very careful after we won the bid to be sure his 
personal gifts were kept separate from gifts for the 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ACOG will officially dissolve this summer, but GAAF will remain  
to plan for an Atlanta Olympic museum, fund youth sports and help 
coordinate an Olympic development program.

<HEADLINE>  Guatemala Army Blamed for Massacres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- The Guatemalan army is responsible for the  
vast majority of the more than 200,000 deaths and disappearances in 
the country's 36-year civil war, an official truth commission 
declared Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Its long-awaited report, based on the testimony of 9,200 people  
from all sides in the conflict, was Guatemala's first step in 
bringing reconciliation to a country split since a U.S.-backed coup 
put rightists in power in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has no power to bring those responsible for the  
killings to trial or impose sanctions. But the report recommends 
that the government begin a formal investigation into the army's 
actions and remove any military officers found to have participated 
in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killers, killers! We want justice,'' protesters shouted at  
army officers, including Defense Minister Gen. Hector Barrios 
Celada, as they entered Guatemala City's National Theater to hear 
the report. Barrios Celada refused to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, farmers and union groups unfurled huge banners that read  
``We have not forgotten'' and ``Never again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 42,000 deaths investigated in the report, the army was  
found to be responsible for 93 percent. Three percent were the work 
of the leftist Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, and 4 
percent were unresolved. The report found that 29,000 of the 
investigated deaths involved summary executions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the victims were civilians and Mayan Indians, the  
long-delayed report said. It was originally scheduled to be 
released last year, but the commission wasn't able to get through 
all its work and release the report until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted that ``the government of the United  
States, through various agencies including the CIA, provided direct 
and indirect support for some state operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, U.S. Ambassador Donald Planty said, ``I believe that  
the report's focus is appropriate, that these were abuses committed 
by Guatemalans against other Guatemalans ... the result of an 
internal conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The truth commission's members, appointed as part of the 1996  
peace accords, investigated atrocities committed during a war that 
pitted leftist rebels and their supporters against the army and 
paramilitary death squads. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ``clearly genocide and a planned strategy against the  
civilian population,'' said Christian Tomuschat, a German citizen 
who heads the three-member commission. ``Government forces ... 
blindly pursued the anti-communist fight, without respecting any 
legal principle or even the most elemental ethical or religious 
values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 626 massacres, the report found that government forces  
``completely exterminated Mayan communities, destroyed their 
dwellings, livestock and crops.'' The guerrillas were blamed for 32 
such massacres, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigoberta Menchu, winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, said,  
``I feel that I have accomplished a mission, that we who have 
worked for justice have accomplished a mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Menchu said she would not forgive those responsible until  
the army concedes that such massacres were part of a planned 
strategy of intimidation. Army officials have said the massacres 
were excesses on the part of individual officers.

who heads the three-member commission. ``Government forces ... 
blindly pursued the anti-communist fight, without respecting any 
legal principle or even the most elemental ethical or religious 
values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 626 massacres, the report found that government forces  
``completely exterminated Mayan communities, destroyed their 
dwellings, livestock and crops.'' The guerrillas were blamed for 32 
such massacres, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigoberta Menchu, winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, said,  
``I feel that I have accomplished a mission, that we who have 
worked for justice have accomplished a mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Menchu said she would not forgive those responsible until  
the army concedes that such massacres were part of a planned 
strategy of intimidation. Army officials have said the massacres 
were excesses on the part of individual officers.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Talking More Than Playing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Right now, Mark McGwire is talking more  
than training. 
</P>
<P>
	Reluctant to talk by nature, the 70-homer man realized during  
the winter that he'd have to make himself more accessible. He 
followed an hour-long news conference Wednesday with a series of 
six half-hour interviews on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned to accept it,'' the St. Louis Cardinals star  
said. ``I can't deny the situation I'm in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire is willing to talk about his 1998 season only until the  
end of spring training. Then it will be time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have six weeks to cover the topic and what it meant,''  
McGwire said. ``Everybody knows about it, so if they want to come 
down and talk, I'm more than happy to. I'm prepared for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa does not McGwire to be bogged by  
reporters' questions about his record-breaking season come April. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd better get it out of their systems,'' La Russa said.  
``Because once the season starts he isn't going to want to address 
the past. We're going to be steadfast in trying to make sure he has 
the time to get in his work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the early days of the Maris chase last season, McGwire  
often bristled when the topic of home runs was addressed. He didn't 
loosen up until he reached 50 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's as loose as can be. Remembering the response to his  
62nd home run, with drivers honking horns and all the celebrating, 
still gives him chills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I was in an airplane witnessing this, or on the  
freeway,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there were the personal stories, waves of them. Wherever he  
went, people told him he'd made their summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You put it all together and then you just go, `I had that big  
of an impact on people,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, McGwire wants the emphasis this year to be on how the  
Cardinals do, not how he does. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, having the spotlight constantly on McGwire didn't  
hurt his teammates in September. St. Louis had an 18-7 record the 
final month, the best finish in Busch Stadium history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real clear to me that having people follow our club and  
follow Mark is good for the rest of our team,'' La Russa said. 
``It's tough to have a flat day when you have that kind of 
attendance in the park.''

<HEADLINE> Greene Looks To Break 60m Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- This is the meet Maurice Greene has targeted for  
the world record. Not only does he plan to break the mark, he aims 
to shatter it. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene doesn't think his present record of 6.39 seconds for 60  
meters, set last year in Madrid, Spain, will stand up once he 
crosses the finish line Saturday at the USA Indoor Track and Field 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record is liable to go -- to the low 6.30s or the high  
6.20s,'' the world's top-ranked sprinter said. ``If it comes out 
that way, it will be a beautiful thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I can run faster than it (the record) is.''  
</P>
<P>
	Greene has not seriously approached the record yet this year,  
but he has run some fast times while going undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke his Millrose Games record, winning at 6.51 on Feb.5  
over the slow Madison Square Garden wood floor. Two days later in 
Boston, he ran the fastest time in the United States, 6.45, 
breaking the record of 6.46 he set last year. And on Feb. 13 in Los 
Angeles, he equaled Donovan Bailey's world record for 50 meters of 
5.56. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you beat Maurice, it's because you've done everything  
right,'' said his coach, John Smith. ``When Maurice is at the top 
of his game, he's difficult to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one has beaten him indoors this season, and no one beat him  
in four indoor races in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day championships, beginning Friday at the Georgia Dome,  
will help determine the U.S. team for the World Indoor 
Championships next weekend at Maebashi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	If Greene wins, he will be the prohibitive favorite to become  
the first American indoor 60-meter champion since Lee McRae at the 
inaugural meet in Indianapolis in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I do what I'm doing now, I believe I'll win,'' he said.  
``When I run my race, it's like poetry in motion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene insists he is not peaking for the world indoors because  
he is pointing toward the World Outdoor Championships in August at 
Seville, Spain. There, he will be the defending champion at 100 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indoors is a lot of fun,'' Greene said. ``It gets me prepared  
for outdoors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago in the last outdoor championships in Athens,  
Greece, Greene firmly established himself among the sport's elite, 
He beat Bailey, also the world record-holder in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Greene will take another stab at Bailey's record of  
9.84, set at the 1996 Olympics, and thinks his added strength will 
enable him to break it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That difference has come in the weight room,'' said Greene,  
whose best is 9.86. ``I've gone up in all areas -- bench presses, 
squats and lifts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene has yet to run the perfect race. The closest he came was  
last year at the Prefontane Classic in Eugene, Ore., where he was 
clocked in 9.90. He also ran the 200 in 20.03. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did almost everything right, although I did have some little  
breakdowns, Greene said. ``Nearly everything was ideal ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's goal this year ``is to do basically the same as last  
year, but not to have any down time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he occasionally was slowed by injuries, including  
cramps during the national outdoor championships which forced him 
to miss the final. He said he ran in pain a few times because he 
felt obligated to his fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``An injury can be traumatizing to a career,'' he said. ``The  
best way to run injury free is to run technically right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other top men's performers at the national  
championships will be Charles Austin (high jump), John Godina (shot 
put), Jeff Hartwig (pole vault), Reggie Torian and Dan O'Brien (60 
hurdles), Lance Deal (35-pound weight throw), Jon Drummond (60) and 
Johnny Gray (800). 
</P>
<P>
	The top women include Gail Devers (60), Jearl Miles-Clark (400),  
Joetta Clark and Meredith Rainey Valmon (800), Suzy Hamilton 
(1,500), Regina Jacobs (3,000), Tisha Waller (high jump), Melissa 
Morrison (60 hurdles), Connie Price-Smith (shot put) and Melissa 
Mueller (pole vault). 
</P>
<P>
	The meet begins Friday with trials in the men's and women's 200,  
400 and 800, plus the first four events of the heptathlon. All 29 
championship finals will be held Saturday.

<HEADLINE> `Nightingales' Socially Provocative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly a year after its world premiere at  
London's Royal National Theater and more than six decades after it 
was written, ``Not About Nightingales'' remains a raw, powerful 
piece of social protest. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, the production, which later traveled to the Alley  
Theater in Houston, has gotten even more physical, an intense 
theatrical experience that is almost too grim to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes it all the more startling is the identity of its  
author. Tennessee Williams is a lyrical playwright best remembered 
for such indelible stage creatures as Amanda Wingfield, Blanche 
DuBois and Maggie the Cat, not political theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet ``Nightingales'' was born in 1938, long before ``The Glass  
Menagerie,'' ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ``Cat on a Hot Tin 
Roof.'' It was virtually unknown until actress Vanessa Redgrave 
came across a copy of the script in Williams' papers at the 
University of Texas in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	This production, a collaboration of the Royal National, the  
Alley and Redgrave's Moving Theater, has found its way to Broadway 
where director Trevor Nunn has tailored it for Circle in the 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
	The theater contains an elongated playing area, with the  
audience sitting on three sides. It is a terrific, in-your-face fit 
for this harrowing expose of prison brutality. The tale is told in 
a melodramatic style that would not be out of place in a 1930s 
Warner Bros. gangster film. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams works two stories, side by side. One is the doomed  
romance between Canary Jim, the prison stoolie, and sweet Eva, the 
prison warden's stenographer. 
</P>
<P>
	The other, based on a real-life incident, details a prison  
hunger strike and how the warden breaks the inmates' refusal to 
eat. His method? Placing them in ``Klondike,'' a sweatbox that 
literally boils the prisoners alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn and an accomplished design team create the claustrophobic  
hell of a nameless penitentiary on stage. On one end of the playing 
area are cages, overcrowded with men; on the other, the warden's 
forbidding office. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn is a master at orchestrating large crowds of people. From  
the barricades of ``Les Miserables'' to the outraged townspeople in 
Ibsen's ``An Enemy of the People,'' this director knows how to make 
mob rule theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet despite the sweep of the story, Williams manages to create a  
quartet of fascinating characters, particularly his villainous 
warden. He is portrayed to snarling perfection by Corin Redgrave, 
brother of Vanessa. Redgrave, perpetually beet-red and sweaty, 
gives a florid, Southern-fried performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Finbar Lynch, as the cocky, bantamweight Canary Jim, is superb.  
Jim is sort of a pint-sized precursor of ``Streetcar's'' Stanley 
Kowalski, tough on the outside, but sensitive beneath the bravado. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim, who puts out the prison newsletter, actually wants to  
expose the inhumane prison conditions. He proclaims there is no 
time for such worldly things as the poetry of John Keats and his 
famous ``Ode to a Nightingale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherri Parker Lee has grown in confidence and nuance as Eva, a  
role which could amount to little more than a cliche. Yet the 
actress invests the woman with a heartbreaking desperation as she 
realizes what will happen to the man she loves. 
</P>
<P>
	James Black, bald, squat and barrel-chested, is fierce and  
unforgiving as the animalistic Butch O'Fallon, the prison 
ringleader. Yet there is a tender side to him, too, shown in a 
touching memory sequence when Butch dreamily dances with a 
long-gone but still-cherished girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nightingales'' may have its roots in melodrama, but flashes of  
Williams' famous lyricism -- a theatrical poetry that would burst 
into flower in the later, great plays -- occasionally appears. 
</P>
<P>
	If some of the lesser characters are stereotypes -- there's one  
black, Latin, Jew and even a gay inmate -- the overall effect is of 
a mass of humanity slowly being annihilated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not About Nightingales'' is the kind of theater that doesn't  
get seen much anymore. Direct, preachy even, but undeniably 
dramatic and volatile, particularly when master director Nunn 
starts moving people around the stage.

	Israeli Courts Blocks Extradition  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court today ruled that an  
18-year-old Maryland youth cannot be extradited to the United 
States to stand trial for murder. Samuel Sheinbein fled to Israel 
two days after the mutilated and burned body of his acquaintance, 
Alfredo Tello Jr., was discovered in Maryland last September. 
Shortly after arriving, Sheinbein was picked up by police. To 
prevent extradition back to Maryland, where he was charged with 
Tello's murder, Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his 
father, who was born in pre-state Israel. Under Israeli law, 
citizens cannot be extradited for trial abroad.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hip-hop star Lauryn Hill and the song ``My  
Heart Will Go On'' are the big winners after last night's Grammys. 
Breaking a record for female artists, Hill won five Grammy Awards. 
Another big winner was the ``Titanic'' ballad ``My Heart Will Go 
On'' taking four awards, including song and record of the year. 
Hill stepped away from the Fugees to win album of the year for 
``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' and best new artist. Madonna 
won three Grammys, including best pop album. Shania Twain, Stevie 
Wonder, the Dixie Chicks and the Brian Setzer Orchestra each were 
double winners.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Marcos family and Philippine government  
have agreed to pay $150 million to settle a lawsuit filed by 
thousands of people who were tortured and abused under the late 
dictator Ferdinand Marcos. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real, based 
in Los Angeles, gave preliminary approval to the settlement 
yesterday. A final hearing is scheduled April 14 in Hawaii. The 
lawsuit was filed in Honolulu on behalf of 9,539 Filipinos who in 
1995 won a class-action suit against the Marcos estate for torture, 
executions and disappearances.

Valzur, where two people were killed. The Austrian army said five 
people were missing. Seven miles away, in Galtuer, the death toll 
rose to 25 and rescuers searched for six others missing and still 
believed buried by an avalanche on Tuesday. Twenty-three had been 
rescued there, of which eight were injured, according to Austrian

beauty aids. Amazon.com, which started four years ago selling only 
books, has in the past year added music, videos, toys and

coach Del Harris to push the flamboyant, controversial Rodman into 
the background. ``Already problems,'' Rodman joked during a news 
conference. Rodman, who finally signed a contract with the Lakers 
on Tuesday, showed up for a voluntary practice yesterday at the

have been his last official act as coach, gave the regulars the day

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 33.33 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks finished with only modest losses Thursday  
after recovering from a steep slide sparked by a third straight day 
of surging interest rates in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed 33.33 point lower at  
9,366.34, after bargain hunters shrank a loss of 166 points during 
the final hour of trading. The late recovery wasn't enough, 
however, to prevent the Dow's first three-session losing streak in 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also staged a partial rebound after  
plunging with the bond market, which has been rattled by fears the 
Federal Reserve may boost interest rates to slow the economy and 
contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index finished down 8.39 at 1,245.02  
after sliding as much as 28 points, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index bounced back from a 52-point loss and closed 12.56 
lower at 2,326.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's bond losses came as three new reports were released  
demonstrating the economy's surprising strength. The data followed 
by just one day a warning by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan that the central bank stands ready to raise interest 
rates unless domestic economic growth slows this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The early stock rout came as the price of the benchmark 30-year  
Treasury bond dropped $20.31 for every $1,000 valuation. Its yield, 
which moves opposite the price, hit to another six-month high, 
rising to 5.65 percent from 5.51 percent on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that bonds aren't on our side, the (stock) market found it  
impossible to push onward,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market 
analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in rates caused market bulls to question a bedrock  
premise. For years, equity prices have risen on the assumption that 
low interest rates, by encouraging consumers to borrow and spend, 
would keep the economy and corporate earnings humming. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower rates would also encourage investors to keep buying stocks  
rather than lower-yielding bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have risen in the new year even as it became clear that  
corporate earnings had weakened in the fourth quarter. Some 
analysts said the higher stock prices were justified because 
inflation was almost non-existent and interest rates were low. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lack of earnings power made stock prices more vulnerable  
than usual to interest-rate increases such as the one that occurred 
Thursday, said Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last six months, ``we've lost the earnings momentum  
that could drive stocks higher, so as a result, we're much more 
dependent on other factors, like lower interest rates,'' she said. 
``When you see the long bond move above 5.5 percent, it shouldn't 
be a surprise; it puts a lot of pressure on equities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's economic news, the Commerce Department said demand  
for durable goods surged 3.9 percent in January, the strongest 
increase in 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment  
benefits fell last week, suggesting that low unemployment could 
continue to push wages higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of  
existing homes climbed to a record level in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market's losers cut a wide swath through the market.  
But analysts said so-called ``growth stocks,'' such as technology 
shares, were most adversely affected by higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online led the New York Stock Exchange trading in  
volume, and fell 3/8 to 87 3/16. Dell Computer led the Nasdaq action 
and lost 1 1/2 to 81 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	But as bottom-fishers came in during the final hour, some  
sectors of the market recovered. Financial services stocks, for 
example, which usually fall when interest rates rise, ended the day 
mixed. Among the Dow 30, Citigroup fell 5/16 to 56 5/8, but American 
Express rose 3/16 to 107 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	And oil stocks rose as crude prices climbed for the fourth  
consecutive session. Dow component Chevron rose 3/16 to 78 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 12-to-5 margin, and composite volume was moderately 
heavy at 891.57 million shares, down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 4.14 to 587.43. The American Stock  
Exchange's composite index fell 2.32 to 693.47. The Russel 2000 
fell 2.59 to 392.67. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas stock markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo rose 0.80  
percent. In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt fell 2.05 percent, 
the FT-SE 100 in London fell 1.60 percent, and the CAC in Paris 
dropped 1.45 percent.

products surged 3.9 percent in January, the biggest increase in 14 
months, fed by strong demand for autos and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that the January increase in  
demand for durable goods, items expected to last three or more 
years, followed a healthy 3.4 percent increase in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The January surge caught analysts by surprise. They had been  
projecting that new orders declined 0.1 percent in January 
following what they believed was an unsustainable jump in demand in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	New orders are closely watched by economists as an early signal  
of what industrial output and manufacturing employment will do in 
the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The two back-to-back sizable gains may call into question the  
prevailing view that the U.S. economy will slow this year as world 
financial troubles and a rising trade deficit create a sizable drag 
on what up until now has been strong domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report today demonstrating strength, the Labor  
Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for 
unemployment benefits fell by 5,000 last week to 293,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out some  
of the week-to-week volatility, was down as well, dropping 2,000 to 
292,500. That was the lowest level in a decade and a strong signal 
that labor markets remain tight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, worried about a possible uptick in  
inflation, has been looking for a slowing in the U.S. economy after 
three years of rapid expansion. The Fed is worried that tight labor 
markets, reflected by an unemployment rate which was at a 
28-year-low of 4.3 percent in January, will cause wage pressures to 
intensify and set off a bout of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, delivering the central  
bank's latest economic forecast to Congress this week, predicted 
that the economy, which grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in 
1998, will slow this year to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent 
growth in the gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan hinted that if this slowdown does not occur, the  
Fed will be ready to move quickly to raise interest rates to make 
it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce report on durable goods said the January increase  
of $7.7 billion pushed total orders up to $203.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance was led by a 15.4 percent jump in orders for  
transportation equipment, a $7.1 billion increase that was led by 
increases in aircraft and autos. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic equipment rose $1.9 billion, a 5.7 percent  
advance that followed an even stronger 6.4 percent December gain. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the surge in demand in transportation and  
electronics, orders for industrial machinery fell by 3.1 percent 
last month while orders for primary metals, such as steel, were 
down 3.3 percent, following a 3.4 percent December drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile defense category, durable-goods orders  
were up 3.7 percent in Janaury. 
</P>
<P>
	While new orders have surged for the past two months, those  
gains followed a sustained period of weakness. For all of 1998, new 
orders to factories posted their smallest advance since an outright 
decline in 1991, the year the last recession ended.

<HEADLINE> Canseco Goes To Work for Devil Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Jose Canseco watch is over.  
</P>
<P>
	The slugger, signed by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays to inject power  
into a punchless lineup, reported for spring training Thursday -- 
two days after the club had hoped to see him in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contractually I think I'm early, aren't I?'' Canseco  
responded, noting that baseball's labor agreement doesn't require 
players be in camp until March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me they wanted me to be in early. I told them I had  
something to do first. But I'm happy to be here now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When reporters didn't immediately follow with another question,  
the outfielder-designated hitter smiled and asked: ``Did I get away 
with that one?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco met with manager Larry Rothschild and general manager  
Chuck LaMar, who didn't hide their disappointment when the team's 
biggest offseason acquisition failed to show on the voluntary 
reporting date. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have to be here until March 2, so it's kind of  
difficult to slap him on his hand,'' LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the general manager went ahead and vented his frustration  
Tuesday because he thought not doing so would send the wrong 
message to other players in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``With what we're trying to do (as a young franchise), we didn't  
feel we could just sweep it under the rug,'' LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Devil Rays didn't want to make too big of  
a fuss because it was within Canseco's right to report when he did. 
What bothered LaMar most was that the absence seemed 
``premeditated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The player's agent, Juan Iglesias, had said Canseco was delayed  
while finalizing housing arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time in Canseco's career that he's reported  
to spring training later than requested. He's been a no-show on the 
first day of camp at least five times dating back to 1988, the year 
after he was the American League Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of baseball,'' Canseco said. ``I'm here now and  
ready to get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Canseco hit 46 homers with 107 RBIs for the Toronto  
Blue Jays.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Fell in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds decreased by $573.8 million to $861.59 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $235.5 million to $709.79 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets decreased by $809.3 million to $151.79 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds decreased by $7.60  
billion to $593.69 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets decreased by $6.17 billion 
to $544.82 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds decreased by $1.43 
billion to $48.87 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.455 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.463 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell to  
4.34 percent in the week ended Tuesday from 4.36 percent in the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield fell to 4.37 percent from 4.39 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.44 percent from 4.45  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield fell to 
4.47 percent from 4.48 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
58 days, up from 57 days in the previous week, IBC Financial Data 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.18 percent as of 
Wednesday, down from 2.20 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
held steady at 0.97 percent from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield was unchanged  
at 4.13 percent on six-month certificates of deposit. However, 
yields on 1-year CDs rose to 4.31 percent from 4.30 as they rose on 
2 1/2-year CDs to 4.37 percent from 4.36 percent. Yields on 5-year CDs 
rose to 4.51 percent from 4.49 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Mull Coaching Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- With a straight face, Del Harris said  
he was looking forward to coaching Dennis Rodman. Now, someone else 
will get the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	As the quirky Rodman took part in his first practice with the  
Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, executives Jerry West and Mitch 
Kupchak were announcing the firing of Harris following three road 
losses in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
	West said one of two assistants -- Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew --  
will succeed Harris for at least the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an organizational change; this is just not one person  
wanting to make a change,'' West said. ``The last two games have 
been something that has not been acceptable from our perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see your team perform against opponents that you feel like  
you should beat -- we just felt like there was a deterioration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West referred to a 117-113 overtime loss in Denver on Monday  
night, and a 93-83 loss at Vancouver on Tuesday night. Denver's 
victory was only its second in 10 games this season, and Vancouver 
had never beaten the Lakers in 12 previous games. 
</P>
<P>
	West said longtime assistant Bill Bertka will handle the head  
coaching duties tonight against the winless Los Angeles Clippers in 
Anaheim before a decision is made on Drew or Rambis, both former 
Lakers players. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman John Black said Wednesday night the team hoped to make  
a decision on a successor to Harris ``in the next 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considered one of the teams to beat in the NBA this season  
following the retirement of Michael Jordan and breakup of the 
Chicago Bulls, the Lakers bring a disappointing 6-6 record into 
tonight's game -- the first of two in as many nights against the 
Clippers and four games in the next five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, a member of championship teams with the Bulls the last  
three years and the NBA's leading rebounder the past seven seasons, 
said he expects to play his first game for the Lakers on Friday 
night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unfair to Del Harris,'' Rodman said of the firing.  
``He was in a no-win situation, unless the team won and got to the 
(NBA) Finals. This business is ruthless and it will tear your heart 
out. There is no security at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Harris: ``You don't realize what Dennis Rodman is going to  
bring to this team. He's going to rebound; he's going to set picks; 
he's going to pass the ball and get on those who don't. I was all 
armed and ready to go, I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he had not spoken to former Bulls coach Phil Jackson  
or anyone else about the coaching job because things happened so 
quickly, but felt confident Rambis or Drew ``will be the person 
that will be able to get us to where we want to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always difficult to talk about hypotheticals, but if that  
situation is presented, I know that Phil would look at that 
carefully,'' Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, said when asked if 
his client might be interested. 
</P>
<P>
	West pointed out the Lakers usually hire coaches from within the  
organization, and Harris said he hoped Rambis or Drew would get the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 61, was in his fifth season with the Lakers. He guided  
them to a 224-116 record and improved their regular-season record 
in four consecutive years, a feat accomplished by only eight other 
coaches in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like a loser today,'' he said. ``There will be  
other doors that will open for me. There always have been when 
other doors have closed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that star Shaquille O'Neal missed 22 games last  
season, the Lakers had a 61-21 regular-season record -- one of the 
best in the league. But they were swept by the Utah Jazz in the 
Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In Harris' three previous years, the Lakers won 48, 53 and 56  
games. They won 33 the year before he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team will mature,'' Harris said. ``It's already an  
outstanding team. Forget 6-6. This team is better than 6-6. I don't 
have any excuses to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a reasonable decision,'' Harris said of his  
firing, although he admitted he was disappointed he couldn't at 
least finish the season. ``I enjoyed being with this bunch. Whoever 
takes my place will not have failed if they don't win it this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, whose contract runs out after this season, has 556  
career victories to rank among the top 20 coaches in NBA history. 
He previously coached the Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	West said he spoke with team owner Jerry Buss early Wednesday  
about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just felt like the time was right now,'' West said. ``Right  
now, we look like we're floundering. That's not what the fans pay 
to see. We do feel like we have the talent here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he was ``very shocked'' to hear the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of unfortunate that a good guy like Del is blamed  
for our lack of cohesion, our lack of effort, our lack of energy,'' 
O'Neal said. ``However, one reason I came here is because of my 
faith in upper management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss Del, personally. The only thing I can do is  
wish him well. I'll always be a big fan of his because he taught me 
a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss issued a statement saying: ``I have enjoyed my relationship  
with Del. He is a true gentleman. I want to reiterate that I think 
he's done a truly outstanding job coaching the Lakers. While we 
feel that a coaching change is necessary at this time, I want to 
publicly thank Del for the many things he has accomplished with the 
Lakers and the steady improvement the team made under his 
direction.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks End Day Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar plunged against the yen today as  
investors took profits from gains prompted by U.S. Treasury 
officials' comments. Japanese stock prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.62 yen late afternoon, down 0.74 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
121.80 yen overnight. During the day, it moved from 120.23 yen to 
121.80 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 115 points, or  
0.80 percent, ending the day at 14,470.45. On Wednesday, the 
average closed down 145.20 points, or 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar fell back as U.S. funds and  
Japanese investment trusts took profits. The currency had gained 
earlier on comments from U.S. Treasury officials, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in Seoul  
that the Japanese economy is ``still very troubling'' and urged 
Tokyo to take steps to generate strong domestic demand-led growth. 
Summers arrived in Tokyo today to take part in a financial meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday in Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said  
Japan is ``still in a recessionary mode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 132.78 yen, down from 133.23 yen late  
Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices advanced on hopes for  
government measures to support the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported today that the ruling  
party's panel had decided to allow trust banks to invest corporate 
pension funds in the stock market. The Mainichi said the panel will 
finalize the scheme next week and put it into effect in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section added 3.84 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,124.13. The 
TOPIX closed up 2.52 points, or 0.23 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 463.41 million  
shares, down from 487.25 million shares Wednesday. Advancers 
outnumbered retreaters 595 to 550, with 155 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.920 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.880 
percent, driving down its price to 99.05 yen from 99.36 yen.

<HEADLINE> Gannett, A.H. Belo Swap TV Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Gannett Co. Inc. is swapping a television  
station in Texas for an A.H. Belo Corp., station in northern 
California, under a deal announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the transaction, which is subject to federal regulatory  
approval, Gannett would acquire KXTV-TV, which serves Sacramento, 
Stockton and Modesto, Calif. Belo would get KVUE-TV of Austin, 
Texas. Both are ABC affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil L. Walker, Gannett Broadcasting's president and chief  
executive officer, said the swap ``allows us to better position our 
strong television groups to compete in the next millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett's broadcasting arm owns 21 TV stations in such cities as  
Cleveland, Minneapolis, Denver, St. Louis and Little Rock, Ark. Its 
holdings would cover 17.3 percent of the U.S. television market if 
the trade goes through. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based A.H. Belo owns 17 TV stations across the nation. It  
also manages four other stations and owns three local cable news 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its broadcasting operations, Gannett publishes 75  
daily newspapers, including USA Today and USA Weekend, a newspaper 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo said Gannett would also receive up to $55 million in cash.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is an oustanding transaction for Belo and Gannett,  
allowing both companies to strengthen their presence in markets of 
strategic importance,'' said Robert W. Decherd, Belo's chairman, 
president and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo also publishes The Dallas Morning News and six other  
newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Prepared for Holyfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lennox Lewis had to be too dazed to notice trainer Emanuel  
Steward helping Oliver McCall celebrate winning the WBC heavyweight 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long after that stunning loss on Sept. 24, 1994,  
however, that Lewis looked to the future and saw clearly what he 
had to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it made me a better fighter,'' Lewis said of the only  
blemish on his pro record. ``It created a great relationship 
between me and Emanuel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the man who helped McCall upset Lewis is now preparing him  
for his March 13 fight in Madison Square Garden against another 
former client -- Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward, who has worked with 27 world champions, including  
Thomas Hearns, trained Holyfield when he won his rematch with 
Riddick Bowe on Nov. 6, 1993, regaining the WBA-IBF titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first became involved with Lennox, he was too  
tentative, too cautious,'' said Steward, who replaced Pepe Correa, 
who was more of cheer leader than a trainer. ``The first fight was 
with Lionel Butler, and he was still scarred by the knockout to 
Oliver McCall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis knocked out Butler in the fifth round on May 13, 1995, and  
has won all eight fights since. He regained the WBC title in a 
rematch with McCall, which was stopped in the fifth round because 
McCall refused to fight. Lewis has made four defenses since. 
</P>
<P>
	He was devastating in stopping previously unbeaten Andrew Golota  
in 95 seconds, but he had a narrow escape before stopping Shannon 
Briggs in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the Golota fight, he rose to a new level,'' Steward said.  
``In the Briggs fight he was too confident, too aggressive, and 
that's why he got caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briggs had Lewis in serious trouble in the first round, but the  
challenger became overanxious. He hurt Lewis again in the second 
round, then, for some reason, he backed off. In a similar 
situation, Holyfield would not back off. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward believes Lewis is ready to assert himself as the best  
heavyweight in the world. The 33-year-old Briton certainly has the 
incentive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fight is everything for him,'' the trainer said. ``His  
whole career will be defined on that night. If he doesn't win and 
win aggressively, he'll never be a great fighter or even a good 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appears to be a matchup of the 36-year-old Holyfield's  
experience and warrior instincts against Lewis' size, strength and 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lennox has had big fights, but this is his first super  
fight,'' Steward said. ``Evander has the advantage of being in a 
lot of super fights, but he took a lot of damage in those fights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowe, to whom Holyfield lost two of three fights, was 6-foot-5,  
but, Steward thinks, he could not match the 6-5 Lewis' strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-2 1/2 Holyfield probably will spot Lewis between 30 and 35  
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``With his size, I can't see anybody outboxing Lennox Lewis,''  
Steward said. ``So Evander Holyfield is going to work inside. It's 
very hard to put pressure on a big man. Lennox is not just tall, 
he's strong. There's difference between being tall and being big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will happen 28 years and 5 days after the greatest  
bout in Garden history -- Joe Frazier's 15-round unanimous decision 
victory over Muhammad Ali before a star-studded, frenzied crowd of 
20,455. 
</P>
<P>
	While Holyfield-Lewis doesn't figure to match the Frazier-Ali  
fight, it is an attractive bout, and even with tickets priced as 
high as $1,500, the Garden has been sold out for some time. 
Counting the people in the luxury boxes, the crowd will top 20,000.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Takes on Truth Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- President Nelson Mandela accused  
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of ``artificial 
even-handedness'' Thursday for condemning not only apartheid but 
also some who fought white rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening a debate in parliament on the findings of the panel that  
probed apartheid-era atrocities, Mandela said it appeared that the 
Truth Commission failed to make a moral distinction between those 
fighting an evil system and those defending one. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report, published late last year, the Truth Commission  
condemned the evils of white rule but also criticized some of the 
violence of the black liberation movements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was inevitable that a task of such magnitude ... would  
suffer various limitations,'' Mandela said of the Truth 
Commission's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, expected to succeed Mandela after  
midyear elections, attacked the commission for finding that the 
ruling African National Congress was guilty of human rights 
violations. During apartheid, the ANC had been a banned 
organization and led the fight against white rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``The net effect of these findings is to delegitimize or  
criminalize a significant part of the struggle of our people for 
liberation,'' Mbeki told a packed National Assembly chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The New National Party, which ruled during apartheid, also  
criticized the Truth Commission. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, head of 
the New National Party, accused the commission of being dominated 
by ANC supporters. But he also criticized apartheid, saying it was 
difficult to watch the Truth Commission hearings, which were often 
broadcast on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes when we watched we were ashamed, sometimes angry,''  
van Schalkwyk said. ``Apartheid was an unjust and immoral system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela, who has championed reconciliation, said even though he  
had reservations about the report, he accepted it. Mandela praised 
the efforts of the panel members and its chairman, Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel Prize for leading opposition to 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	Set up in 1995, a year after all race elections ended apartheid,  
the body was charged with promoting racial healing in South Africa 
by uncovering the truth behind atrocities committed by all sides in 
the fight against white rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks on the Truth Commission's report began as soon as it  
was released last October. 
</P>
<P>
	On the report's release, Tutu denounced the ANC's complaints,  
saying, ``I didn't struggle in order to remove one set of those who 
thought they were tin gods to replace them with others who are 
tempted to think they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently on a speaking tour in the United States, Tutu has  
defended the commission's work as the only way to acknowledge 
wrongs, forgive and move on.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Out of Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood, slowed by an upper respiratory  
infection, went home early from the hospital Thursday and will 
return to the Chicago Cubs spring training camp Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who's now had three separate bouts of illness this spring,  
entered Mesa Lutheran Hospital for tests Wednesday that team 
officials thought could take two days. But he'd improved so much, 
he was allowed to go home that same night. 
</P>
<P>
	Team physician Dr. John Marquardt said Wood will continue to  
take medication and will work on his conditioning slowly. The 
21-year-old right-hander hasn't participated in spring training 
since Sunday 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll probably be a week to 10 days before he is operating on  
all cylinders,'' Marquardt said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had an unlucky spring in that he's had three sort of  
distinct illnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Marquardt nor Cubs general manager Ed Lynch could  
predict if the NL Rookie of the Year would be ready for the season 
opener April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's more than a month, so he may well come along nicely.  
It's hard to say,'' Marquardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood came down with a bronchial infection in January and that  
was followed a week ago by a bout of viral gastroenteritis that 
forced him to enter the hospital because was dehydrated. He lost 12 
pounds as a result but has since gained some back. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last weekend, Wood began coughing and the bronchial  
problems had returned, along with chills, fever and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquardt said the illness is a common one in the Phoenix area  
at this time of the year and hospitals are full of patients with 
the same symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood went 13-6 last season, electrifying baseball when he struck  
out 20 Houston Astros in his fifth major league start, tying a 
major league record. He missed the final month of last season with 
a sore elbow before returning to pitch Game 3 of the divisional 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said he has discussed a contract for Wood with his agent  
and was confident something would be in place by the first spring 
training game March 5. Wood made the major league minimum $170,000 
last season.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Cigarette Tax Cuts Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Oregon's tax hike of 30 cents per pack for an  
anti-tobacco campaign has resulted in an 11.3 percent decrease in 
per-capita sales of cigarettes over the past two years, according 
to federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales dropped by about 10 packs per person from 1996 to 1998,  
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. 
During the previous four years, Oregon had a 2.2 percent increase 
in sales per capita. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC calculated that the tax increase alone contributed to a  
6.3 percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon voters in November 1996 raised cigarette taxes to 68  
cents per pack. The extra money went toward smoking prevention and 
education programs and expanding insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon is the third state to report a dramatic drop in smoking  
as a result of the combined use of stiff cigarette taxes and 
aggressive anti-tobacco programs, the CDC said. Similar findings 
have been reported by Massachusetts and California, the federal 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies have shown that for every 10 percent increase in  
price, there is a 4 percent decrease in smoking among adults, the 
CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said smuggling or cross-border sales of cigarettes  
probably did not contribute to the decline in Oregon because a 
large portion of the state's population lives in Portland, near 
Washington state, where cigarette prices are even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, the CDC said, the average annual rate of decline in  
cigarette sales from 1990 to 1997 was 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia To Examine Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA's board of directors  
Thursday unanimously gave chief executive Franco Bernabe the 
authority to study an integration -- including the possibility of a 
merger -- with its 60 percent-owned mobile phone subsidiary, Telecom 
Italia Mobile SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	That potentially could be used as a defensive move to ward off a  
hostile advance by Olivetti SpA, which presented a revamped $58 
billion takeover offer for Telecom Italia earlier Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Market regulator Consob had ruled that Olivetti's initial  
takeover offer announced Saturday was invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's board said that it was reserving judgment and holding  
off on taking action on Olivetti's latest bid as it awaits more 
information. However, the board reiterated that information until 
now appears ``full of holes'' in many aspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also gave Bernabe a mandate to urge market regulatory  
authority Consob to clarify quickly whether Olivetti's bid is in 
order and what Telecom's options are. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti, after many hours of consultations with Italian  
stock-market regulator Consob, said it would offer $58 billion in 
cash, bonds and shares for Telecom's shares. The revised bid did 
not change the basic financial details of Olivetti's original bid, 
announced Saturday, but it added an unspecified day in April as its 
date for a tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Consob's final approval of this offer is expected anytime within  
the next 15 days. With Olivetti's filing, however, Telecom can't 
alter its capital or share structure, in accordance with Italian 
law, unless Consob rules against Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's hostile bid for a company five times its size has  
rocked an industry in which comfortable government-owned monopolies 
were long the norm. Some analysts have described Telecom, the 
world's sixth-largest telecommunications company, as lacking 
direction since the government privatized it in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover battle has reverberated in neighboring Germany,  
where Mannesmann AG announced earlier Thursday that it has agreed 
to pay Olivetti $8.4 billion to raise its stakes in Telecom's two 
biggest Italian competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann's purchase of shares in Omnitel, Italy's  
second-biggest mobile phone company, and Infostrada, the country's 
second-largest fixed-line operator, is conditional upon a 
successful takeover by Olivetti of Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	The tone of the struggle took a rancorous turn when Olivetti  
said Thursday that it was considering legal action following what 
it callled ``defamatory declarations'' by Bernabe. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's statement followed a report in Thursday's Il Corriere  
della Sera newspaper, in which Bernabe was quoted as telling union 
officials that Telecom might cease to be profitable if Olivetti 
took it over. Bernabe reportedly suggested that the large payments 
Olivetti would have to make on loans it borrowed to finance the 
takeover would push Telecom into the red. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom offered no comment on the issue, nor did it comment on a  
separate report that its managing director and chief financial 
officer, Fulvio Conti, had resigned. Conti's secretary has said 
only that Conti was ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's senior management has changed several times in recent  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Italy's Treasury Ministry said Thursday that Morgan  
Stanley Dean Witter has been chosen as the financial consultant and 
coordinator for the placement of the ministry's remaining stake in 
Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom, a former government monopoly, was privatized in 1997.  
The Italian Treasury retained 3.4 percent of Telecom shares, known 
as a golden share, and has veto power over all major decisions 
through the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that veto power, Italy's Premier Massimo D'Alema has  
said his government will not choose sides in the takeover battle.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Rise Again / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose for the fourth consecutive week, Freddie 
Mac, the mortgage company, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average rose to 6.89 percent, the highest level since  
mid-November. It had been 6.82 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	It's remained below 7 percent since mid-June and reached a  
31-year low of 6.49 percent in early October. That helped send 
sales of both new and existing homes to record highs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.51 percent this week, up from 6.46 percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.71 percent, up from 5.67 percent the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Poised To Be No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov is about to replace  
Pete Sampras as tennis' No. 1 player. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Russian, the hottest player in the world this  
year with a victory three weeks ago in the Australian Open, will 
move into the top spot in the ATP Tour rankings with a victory 
Friday over Thomas Johansson of Sweden in the quarterfinals of the 
Guardian Direct indoor. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov put himself in position to knock Sampras off his  
perch with a 6-3, 6-2 second-round victory Thursday over Byron 
Black of Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson, the No. 8 seed, beat Davide Sanguinetti of Italy 6-0,  
6-7 (7-3), 6-2. In other second-round matches, No. 5 Karol Kucera 
of Slovakia beat Guillaume Raoux of France, 6-2, 6-0; Slovak 
Dominik Hrbaty defeated countryman Jan Kroslak 6-2, 6-3; and No. 3 
Greg Rusedski of Britain beat Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 6-3, 
7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	If Kafelnikov beats Johansson, he will become only the 15th  
player to hold the top spot since rankings were begun in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, taking the week off, had 3,695 ATP ranking points going  
into this week and Kafelnikov had 3,637. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not putting too much pressure on myself,'' Kafelnikov  
said. ``I know this year it is going to happen, but I hope that it 
will happen here this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it really helps tennis to see a bit of change,'' he  
added. ``I'm playing as well as I have ever played. For sure, I 
know someday I will not be so good, but that is the way it is now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't ask for any better. I'm happy to get through and I'm  
looking forward to the quarterfinal. I'm sure I'll be excited if I 
win but I have to take the match as seriously as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov has a 4-2 edge in head-to-head matches with the  
19th-ranked Johansson. They are 1-1 in matches on carpet, which is 
surface being used here. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras was knocked out of the No. 1 spot for six weeks last  
year, both times by Chile's Marcelo Rios. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, 27, returned to No. 1 on Aug. 24 and set an ATP Tour  
record by finishing No. 1 for the sixth straight season. He has 
held the No. 1 spot for 260 weeks -- 10 short of the ATP record held 
by Ivan Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov won the Australian Open three weeks ago, then added  
an indoor title last week in Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	He would become the first Russian player to ever hold the No. 1  
ranking and the first from a former Eastern Bloc country since 
Lendl and Ilie Nastase.

	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- U.S. Open champion Lindsay Davenport,  
former No. 1 Monica Seles and the fast-rising Williams sisters -- 
Venus and Serena -- on Thursday were named to the 1999 U.S. Fed Cup

April 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept of team sports is very important to me, and KB Fed  
Cup is the pinnacle in women's team tennis,'' King said. ``By 
naming this squad of top Americans for Fed Cup, we can assemble the 
best teams for each tie. We are putting all of our efforts into 
bringing back the Fed Cup to the U.S.A. before the year 2000.''

<P>
	The Fed Cup is the premier women's international team tennis  
competition. The competitors will be announced no later than April 
7.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When it comes to bizarre baseball injuries, add Curt Schilling  
and Brian McRae to the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling was slowed by back spasms Thursday. And the  
Philadelphia Phillies say the problem was caused by one of the 
favorite spring training pastimes -- doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stand around a lot,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona  
said at Clearwater, Fla. ``I even told them they'd be standing 
around a lot. You get stiff when you do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling does not expect to miss his regular turn to throw  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would kind of heat up and get loose, but it never  
did,'' he said. ``Maybe we should check my mattress. Maybe that's 
the culprit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McRae missed part of the New York Mets' first full workout  
because of an odd occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He broke a tooth when he was running,'' manager Bobby  
Valentine said at Port St. Lucie, Fla. ``It was cracked and 
sensitive, but it didn't go into the root.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood, meanwhile, went home early from  
the hospital after being slowed by an upper respiratory infection. 
He is scheduled to return to camp in Mesa, Ariz., on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Team physician Dr. John Marquardt said the NL Rookie of the Year  
will continue to take medication and will work on his conditioning 
slowly. The 21-year-old right-hander hasn't participated in spring 
training since Sunday 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll probably be a week to 10 days before he is operating on  
all cylinders,'' Marquardt said. ``He's had an unlucky spring in 
that he's had three sort of distinct illnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Marquardt nor Cubs general manager Ed Lynch could  
predict if Wood would be ready for the season opener April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's more than a month, so he may well come along nicely.  
It's hard to say,'' Marquardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood came down with a bronchial infection in January, and that  
was followed a week ago by a bout of viral gastroenteritis that 
forced him to enter the hospital because was dehydrated. He lost 12 
pounds as a result but has since gained some back. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last weekend, Wood began coughing and the bronchial  
problems had returned, along with chills, fever and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees are not sure if they will have Darryl  
Strawberry on opening day, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, one of four left field candidates, underwent colon  
cancer surgery last October. He had a second procedure in January 
to remove scar tissue and will undergo weekly chemotherapy at least 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Also of concern is Strawberry's previously injured left knee,  
which has slowed him the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
	The two recent surgeries prevented Strawberry from his offseason  
running program, affecting his overall conditioning program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would not surprise me at all that by the time we're ready  
to leave, he would not be physically ready,'' Yankees manager Joe 
Torre said. ``I could be wrong, but again, if he needs another week 
or whatever it is, that's the most important thing to make sure he 
gets ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who plans on beginning a light running program next  
week, will not play in the early exhibition games. Torre also 
indicated Strawberry may not make an outfield appearance until late 
in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be ready by opening day. We'll see how things work  
out,'' Strawberry said. ``If they work out fine, if they don't, 
fine. That's the way I look at it.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Remain in Solitary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Jail officials are disputing claims by  
Mike Tyson's lawyer and wife that he was denied antidepressant 
medication before an incident in which he threw a television. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is in solitary confinement for 25 days at the Montgomery  
County Correctional Center for disorderly conduct, destruction of 
county property and assaulting officers who say they were hit by 
shards of plastic from the TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jail did not cut him off of medication,'' jail spokesman  
Eric Seleznow said Wednesday after a disciplinary board ordered 
that he remain in isolation through March 16 and be deprived of 
such privileges as phone calls and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Seleznow said ``he was offered it (medication) at all times'' if  
he would see a jail psychiatrist. Tyson's lawyer, Paul Kemp, has 
said the boxer refused to see the jail psychiatrist because he was 
being treated by a private doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is undisputed the contracting psychiatrist with the  
Detention Center, not an employee, had ordered a reduction and then 
termination in his medication, Zoloft, which he needs for treatment 
of chronic depression.'' Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has been under the care of Dr. Richard Goldberg, chairman  
of the psychiatry department at Georgetown University Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctor Goldberg spoke to the therapist at the Detention Center  
and informed him that it would be medically inadvisable to 
discontinue the medication,'' said Tyson's wife, Monica, a medical 
doctor who practices in the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyer noted that his client's medication was restored  
Saturday when Goldberg was able to see him. Kemp contended that 
withholding Tyson's medication contributed to the TV-throwing 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hopeful that upon review of this, before any action is  
finalized by the discipline review board, that the persons at the 
Detention Center look at this fact very carefully,'' Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson began serving a one-year jail term Feb. 5 after he was  
sentenced in connection with his plea of no contest to charges he 
assaulted two men following a minor traffic accident in August. He 
has until March 7 to appeal the sentence. Kemp said he would decide 
whether to appeal by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Seleznow also denied reports that a guard might have provoked  
Tyson by hanging up the phone while the boxer was using it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson also is on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty  
pageant contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was 
released from prison in March 1995 after serving three years. 
Indiana officials are considering whether to revoke his probation 
based on his legal problems in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, Tyson's probation officer, George Walker, said  
authorities there still are awaiting to hear whether the boxer will 
appeal his sentence in Maryland before taking any action. ``We're 
still waiting,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Organizer Sold Memorabilia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A nonprofit foundation paid Billy Payne $975,000  
for memorabilia he collected while organizing the 1996 Olympics, 
but he used most of the money to pay off personal debts incurred 
while preparing for the games, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the sale was the only way he would accept money from  
the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, the group that succeeded 
the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to give me the money to satisfy my personal loan,  
but I wouldn't accept the money without giving something back,'' he 
told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Payne, former head of ACOG, owed $606,000 to  
the foundation and used the proceeds of the sale to erase the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAAF, which Payne and former Atlanta mayor Andrew Young  
co-chair, does not receive public funding. ACOG also used no public 
funding to run the 1996 games, although public funds were used for 
security and for beautification and infrastructure improvements 
before the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne disclosed the sale of his memorabilia during an interview  
with the newspaper in which he also continued to insist that 
Atlanta did nothing wrong during the Olympic bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta bid is one of many being scrutinized by the  
International Olympic Committee in the wake of a bribery scandal 
involving the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Games.

	The GAAF's purchase of Payne's memorabilia was in 1997. Included  
was the first commemorative brick sold for Centennial Olympic Park, 
the torch Payne carried in Athens, Greece, after the lighting of 
the Olympic flame, and letters from several chiefs of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the collection was appraised at more than  
$1.5 million, and will be carried on GAAF's books as an asset in 
that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	According to GAAF president Ralph Jernigan Jr., the foundation  
offered several times to pay off Payne's debt with about $12 
million in private funds raised during the 1987-90 bid effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billy had run up a substantial debt during that period of  
time,'' said Jernigan, a sports marketing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation had assumed the loan from an unidentified  
investor, a friend of Payne, who lent him the money during the bid 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne worked as an unpaid volunteer during the three years  
leading up to the bid, but then was paid $519,000 when ACOG was 
incorporated in 1991. In 1996, his last full year as Olympics 
chief, he was paid $767,000, according to federal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	ACOG will officially dissolve this summer, but GAAF will remain  
to plan for an Atlanta Olympic museum, fund youth sports and help 
coordinate an Atlanta Community Olympic Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAAF also holds all of ACOG's and the bid committee's  
official records, but has not made the documents public, saying 
they are too sensitive.

<HEADLINE> Kmart To Buy 11 Caldor Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Kmart Corp. will buy 11 stores for $75  
million from Caldor Corp., which is currently selling all of its 
145 stores as it goes out of business for good. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Thursday, includes stores in Connecticut,  
Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Delaware and is subject to 
a bankruptcy court approval expected within 60 days, said Kmart 
spokesman Robert Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, Kmart said it would acquire the operating leases,  
fixtures and equipment at the 11 stores after inventory clearance 
and would convert the stores ``as soon as possible,'' Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Caldor announced that it would close its doors as  
the discount retailer struggled to revive its ailing company. More 
than 20,000 Caldor employees will lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	After three years of operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court  
protection, the decision to liquidate followed the refusal of a 
group of creditors to agree to a plan of reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwalk, Conn.-based company has started to sell off its  
holdings. On Tuesday, Caldor sought approval to sell Kohl's 33 
stores in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland for $142 
million. Wal-Mart wants to buy 12 stores in Connecticut, 
Massachusetts and New York for $72.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Including today's Kmart purchase, that leaves Caldor with 89 of  
its 145 stores still left to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	The stores in the Kmart offer include seven in New York,  
specifically in Yorktown Heights, Mahopac, Pelham Manor, Woodmere, 
Middle Village, Bronx, and White Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining stores in the offer are in Salem, Mass.; West  
Orange, N.J.; Bristol, Conn.; and Wilmington, Del.

<HEADLINE> McConaughey Condemned for Slur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- An Asian-American group condemned Matthew  
McConaughey for using a racial slur on Rosie O'Donnell's show. 
</P>
<P>
	McConaughey, who is filming the World War II movie ``U-571'' in  
Italy, made the comment Tuesday when Ms. O'Donnell referred to his 
short hair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it you're doing a movie. That's the new hairdo?'' she  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' McConaughey answered. ``I'm over in Rome fighting  
Germans and Japs from World War II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no audible reaction from the studio audience and Ms.  
O'Donnell continued the conversation without pause. 
</P>
<P>
	``The term `Jap' has historically been used to dehumanize an  
entire race of people -- not just Japanese nationals. During World 
War II, the slur was used against Japanese-Americans,'' said Masaru 
Kent Kawai, president of the watchdog group Media Action Network 
for Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	McConaughey publicist Jennifer Allen and Laura Mandel, a  
spokeswoman for Ms. O'Donnell's show, said Thursday that the actor 
meant no offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the nicest young man there is,'' Ms. Allen said.

<HEADLINE> DJ Fired After Dragging Case Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A radio station fired a longtime shock jock  
for making light of a grisly Texas racial killing, but if history 
is a guide he may be back on the air somewhere soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington radio host Doug ``Greaseman'' Tracht's firing  
Thursday followed a remark on WARW the day before. Tracht played a 
portion of a song by Grammy award-winning singer Lauryn Hill and 
remarked, ``No wonder people drag them behind trucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comment linked Hill, who is black, to the dragging death in  
Jasper, Texas, of a black man. A white supremacist was sentenced to 
die Thursday in James Byrd Jr.'s killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht deserved to be fired for a remark that ``was stupendously  
stupid and double-stupendously evil,'' said Michael Harrison, 
editor of Talkers Magazine, an industry monthly. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Harrison estimates a shock jock gets the boot about  
once a year somewhere in the country, the genre and its 
practitioners endure. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the best-known recent example of a shock jock firing  
was Bob Grant's dismissal from WABC in 1996 after saying he was ``a 
pessimist'' for believing that Commerce Secretary Ron Brown had 
survived a plane crash. Brown, who was black, died in the crash 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, who in the past had referred to blacks as ``savages,'' is  
back on the air at a rival New York station. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we will always strongly support the right of our on-air  
artists to express a wide range of opinions, even those that are 
unpopular or offensive to some, WARW cannot be associated with the 
trivialization of an unspeakable act of violence,'' a statement 
from the station said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stations choose the format knowing the hosts will probably  
offend people, but will also attract listeners that matter to 
advertisers -- notably young men. 
</P>
<P>
	``This goes with the territory,'' said Robert Lichter, president  
of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan study 
group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of broadcast depends on being shocking and  
disgusting and occasionally will hit a nerve at the wrong time and 
somebody will get suspended or fired,'' Lichter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then things will go back like they were.''  
</P>
<P>
	Other radio hosts regularly get in hot water with listeners,  
including the widely syndicated Howard Stern and Don Imus. 
</P>
<P>
	Short of an individual broadcaster's decision to suspend or fire  
a host, there is little punishment for radio raunchiness. The 
Federal Communications Commission regulates indecency to a point, 
but free speech rights generally protect tastelessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht's remark did not violate FCC standards of decency, a  
spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the largest settlement of its kind, Stern's bosses at  
Infinity Broadcasting Corp. agreed in 1995 to pay the federal 
government $1.7 million to resolve more than 100 claims of 
indecency on his show. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht, who delivers his routine of jokes and sexual titillation  
in a distinctive, high-pitched baby talk, has been a fixture on 
Washington radio for nearly two decades. He also has been 
syndicated. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been in trouble before. In 1986, while on another  
station, Tracht was talking about the Martin Luther King holiday 
and said: ``Kill four more and we can take a whole week off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The station got bomb threats, but Tracht kept his job.

<HEADLINE> Disney Promotes Iger to ABC Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- ABC president Robert Iger, considered a  
potential successor to Walt Disney Co. chairman Michael Eisner, is 
being asked to oversee Disney's overseas operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burbank company on Thursday promoted Iger to ABC's chairman  
and president of Disney's international operations. Steven 
Bornstein, ESPN chairman and ABC Sports president, will replace 
Iger as ABC's president and will continue to report to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob's new role is designed to consolidate all of Disney's  
international operations under common leadership so Disney can act 
internationally with the same single voice and vision that it does 
domestically,'' Eisner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Inc. includes the broadcast network, television and radio  
stations, and stakes in the ESPN, Lifetime and A&AMP;E cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney, which acquired Capital Cities/ABC Inc. three years ago,  
created the new positions for Iger. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney last year lost several key executives -- including chief  
financial officer Richard Nanula and cable TV programming boss 
Geraldine Laybourne -- resurrecting questions about Eisner's ability 
to cultivate an eventual successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Iger has been mentioned as one of several possible contenders to  
eventually run Disney. In addition to ABC, Disney's sprawling 
entertainment operations include films, theme parks and pro sports 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Iger, 48, was president and chief operating officer of Capital  
Cities/ABC and continued as president of ABC after Disney's 
acquisition. Before that, Iger was president of the ABC network, 
which in recent years has suffered from low ratings and a dearth of 
hit shows. 
</P>
<P>
	His successor, Bornstein, is being promoted for the second time  
in three months. In November, he was upped from ESPN president to 
chairman in order to concentrate on further expanding the leading 
cable sports network. 
</P>
<P>
	Bornstein had been ESPN's president since 1990 and joined the  
network in 1980, shortly after its launch. Under his presidency, 
ESPN added a radio network, three new cable channels and a magazine 
to challenge Sports Illustrated.

<HEADLINE> Yanks, Nets To Be One Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a move that shakes up sports cable TV but  
won't change George Steinbrenner's role as The Boss, the New York 
Yankees and the New Jersey Nets signed a letter of intent to merge 
the two teams into one company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday creates a new holding company,  
YankeeNets, that the teams value at about $1.4 billion. The 
baseball and basketball teams will remain as separate subsidiaries 
under their current leadership, with Steinbrenner running the 
Yankees, and Lewis Katz and Ray Chambers running the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is going to change here,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing the deal would fall in place and give the World Series  
champions increased cash flow made Steinbrenner comfortable to 
trade for Roger Clemens last week, according to a source with 
knowledge of the talks who spoke on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	When Toronto first talked about trading Clemens last fall, the  
Yankees showed little interest, with general manager Brian Cashman 
saying the payroll was at the maximum. The team didn't hesitate 
last week when the Blue Jays called again, even though the trade 
increased the Yankees' payroll to $88 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on early projections of their next TV deal, the Yankees'  
revenue in 2001 could approach $250 million, which will send a 
shudder through small-market teams, whose annual revenue is as low 
as $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's location, location, location,'' said analyst Bob  
Gutkowski, the former president of the Madison Square Garden 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said the chief  
executive officer of the new holding company had not been 
determined. But Steinbrenner isn't know as The Boss for nothing, 
and he is expected to dominate Katz and Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest change will be in television, with the new company  
expected to approach both Time Warner Inc. and The Walt Disney 
Co.'s ESPN unit about starting a new regional sports cable network. 
The Yankees' $486 million, 12-year contract with Cablevision System 
Corp.'s MSG Network expires after the 2000 season, and the Nets' 
contract with Fox Sports New York, another Cablevision unit, 
expires after the 2001-02 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The announcement puts them in play in terms of third parties  
who may want to start a regional sports channel, give them a rights 
fee and an equity position,'' said TV analyst Neal Pilson, the 
former president of CBS Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner had been in negotiations last year to sell the  
team, which with 24 Series titles is baseball's premier franchise, 
to Cablevision. But the deal fell apart when Cablevision chairman 
Charles Dolan wouldn't allow Steinbrenner total control of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, who led a group that purchased the Yankees from  
CBS Inc. in 1973 for about $10 million and owns about 60 percent of 
the team, then approached the Nets, who were bought last autumn for 
about $150 million, with Katz and philanthropist Raymond Chambers 
heading the group and comedian Bill Cosby a minority owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday values the Yankees at about $700  
million and the Nets at about $150 million. About $550 million in 
cash will be contributed by new partners, such as the the 
investment bank Allen &AMP; Co. Inc., and the real estate company 
Tishman Speyer Properties Inc., according to a baseball official 
speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	That money, the official said, could be used as partial  
financing for reconstruction of Yankee Stadium or a new Manhattan 
ballpark, or a new arena for the Nets, who would like to leave 
Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., for a new 
facility in Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen &AMP; Co., which is heavily involved in media deals, could  
eventually get a return on its investment from an equity stake in a 
new regional sports channel. Tishman Speyer, the landlord of 
Manhattan's Rockefeller Center, could get the construction 
contracts for new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision, which pioneered the regional sports business in the  
New York area with SportsChannel in the 1970s, put Steinbrenner in 
a quandary two years ago when, with financing partly provided by a 
division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., it gained control of both 
regional sports channels in the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision owns a controlling interest in Madison Square  
Garden, the NBA's New York Knicks, the NHL's New York Rangers, the 
MSG Network. Cablevision also owns 60 percent of FSNY, which has 
the broadcast rights to baseball's New York Mets, the Nets and the 
NHL's New Jersey Devils and New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	One baseball official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  
speculated Thursday's deal could cause Cablevision approach Mets 
co-owners Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday about taking an equity 
position in that team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We congratulate the Yankees and Nets on today's  
announcement,'' Cablevision said. ``Cablevision has enjoyed 
longstanding, productive relationships with both organizations, and 
we look forward to continuing those relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN, whose parent company owns baseball's Anaheim Angels and  
the NHL's Anaheim Mighty Ducks, is one logical partner for 
YankeeNets. One TV executive, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity, said Steinbrenner already had met with ABC president 
Robert Iger, who has ESPN in his corporate domain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always looking at the regional sports business,'' ESPN  
spokesman Chris LaPlaca said. ``If presented with opportunities 
that make good business sense, we'll definitely pursue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner, which owns baseball's Atlanta Braves, the NBA's  
Hawks and the NHL's expansion Thrashers, who start play this 
October, is launching a regional sports and entertainment network, 
Turner South, this October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had no discussions with this group about being a  
carrier, and it's our understanding there are certain incumbent 
rights,'' Turner Sports president Harvey Schiller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of the new holding company will include Steinbrenner,  
Katz and Chambers, plus Harold Steinbrenner and Stephen Swindal, 
Steinbrenner's son and son-in-law; Cosby; Lester Crown, a long-time 
Yankees limited partner; Tishman Speyer president Jerry Speyer; 
former Coca-Cola Co. president Donald Keough, the current Allen &AMP; 
Co. chairman; former Capital Cities-ABC chairman Thomas Murphy; 
real estate investor Jerry Cohen; and Rubenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, who was in Tampa, Fla., wouldn't comment on the  
deal, and Rubenstein said Katz and Chambers wouldn't speak, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were unconcerned with the corporate politics.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would venture should you go around the room, 98 percent of  
the players won't know what you're talking about,'' Yankees pitcher 
David Cone said in Tampa. ``By and large, most players worry about 
their manager.''

<HEADLINE> Canseco Goes To Work for Devil Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Jose Canseco watch is over.  
</P>
<P>
	The slugger, signed by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays to inject power  
into a punchless lineup, reported for spring training Thursday -- 
two days after the club had hoped to see him in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contractually I think I'm early, aren't I?'' Canseco  
responded, noting that baseball's labor agreement doesn't require 
players be in camp until March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me they wanted me to be in early. I told them I had  
something to do first. But I'm happy to be here now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When reporters didn't immediately follow with another question,  
the outfielder-designated hitter smiled and asked: ``Did I get away 
with that one?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco met with manager Larry Rothschild and general manager  
Chuck LaMar, who didn't hide their disappointment when the team's 
biggest offseason acquisition failed to show on the voluntary 
reporting date. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have to be here until March 2, so it's kind of  
difficult to slap him on his hand,'' LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the general manager went ahead and vented his frustration  
Tuesday because he thought not doing so would send the wrong 
message to other players in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``With what we're trying to do (as a young franchise), we didn't  
feel we could just sweep it under the rug,'' LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Devil Rays didn't want to make too big of  
a fuss because it was within Canseco's right to report when he did. 
What bothered LaMar most was that the absence seemed 
``premeditated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The player's agent, Juan Iglesias, had said Canseco was delayed  
while finalizing housing arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time in Canseco's career that he's reported  
to spring training later than requested. He's been a no-show on the 
first day of camp at least five times dating back to 1988, the year 
after he was the American League Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of baseball,'' Canseco said. ``I'm here now and  
ready to get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Canseco hit 46 homers with 107 RBIs for the Toronto  
Blue Jays.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Library Plan Remains Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- There are folks in Little Rock who  
can't figure out why the city plans to spend $15 million for a 
Clinton presidential library when the Clintons might end up living 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would look kind of strange if he doesn't live  
here,'' said Nora Harris, an opponent of the library plan. ``I'm 
sure that there will be a lot of citizens who will question that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When President Clinton announced in 1997 that a library honoring  
him would be built in Little Rock, the city scrambled to find the 
money. It finally settled on using money from a bond issue 
benefiting parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential library is slated to be built near Little  
Rock's River Market district on more than 17 acres of land. 
Construction is expected to cost about $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But now there is speculation that the Clintons will move to New  
York so the first lady can run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harris has sued the city to prevent it from using money set  
aside for parks and the city's struggling zoo, which lost its 
accreditation last year and has been criticized for what some 
regard as outdated exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Rutherford, a Clinton friend in Little Rock leading the  
library project, said the Clintons will be citizens of the world 
after the president leaves office, adding: ``But we've always 
expected that this will be their home base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Clintons don't live in Arkansas again, Rutherford said,  
the library project will live on. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Jim Dailey said he won't feel betrayed if the Clintons  
decide to live elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they would ever turn their backs on Arkansas,''  
Dailey said. ``I just know the Clintons too well. I believe that 
they will always -- even as the president does now -- consider this 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said this week that the Clintons  
have been planning to move to New York even if Hillary Rodham 
Clinton decides not to run. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that the president has  
not indicated to him where he will reside after his presidency.

<HEADLINE> Mets' McRae Breaks Tooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- The first full workout for the New  
York Mets on Thursday was marked by a most unusual injury to 
outfielder Brian McRae. 
</P>
<P>
	``He broke a tooth when he was running,'' manager Bobby  
Valentine said. ``It was cracked and sensitive, but it didn't go 
into the root.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McRae was running sprints when the injury happened and there was  
no contact with any other player. He left camp early. 
</P>
<P>
	Every member of the Mets' 40-man spring training roster was in  
camp. The team began the day with a morning meeting, then went 
through a three-hour workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year, the starting lineup and batting order is  
virtually set for opening day. The only hedging that Valentine did 
came when he discussed who was going to bat fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a major secret or anything. For the most part it's  
pretty well set, I don't think there's that much decision making,'' 
Valentine said. ``Assuming guys stay healthy and play up to their 
abilities, the balance of these guys neutralize the different type 
of pitchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The projected lineup will bat in this order: Rickey Henderson  
(CF), Edgardo Alfonzo (2B), John Olerud (1B), Mike Piazza (C), 
Bobby Bonilla (RF), Robin Ventura (3B), Brian McRae (CF) and Rey 
Ordonez (SS).

<HEADLINE> Construction Cos. Turn to Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The construction industry is trying to  
build a bridge across the gender gap, recruiting women to do jobs 
once thought to be the exclusive domain of men. 
</P>
<P>
	With the economy booming and buildings going up left and right,  
contractors are facing a severe labor shortage. As a result, 
recruiters have been looking to a new sector of the labor market -- 
women straight out of high school and former homemakers returning 
to the work force. They're even talking to grade-schoolers to prime 
the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry is just dying for people. We don't care what kind  
-- man, woman, whatever. They just need to have skills,'' said 
Robert Moorhead, spokesman for the National Center for Construction 
Education and Research in Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is, as an industry, we have an image problem,''  
Moorhead said. That problem: the notion that all construction 
workers are burly, unshaven men who like to lift large pieces of 
sheet metal and dig ditches. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Labor Women's Bureau says just 2 percent  
of the 4.84 million hands-on construction jobs in the United States 
are filled by women. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the industry has had a shortage of between 30,000 and  
40,000 workers for the past two years, said Howard B. Stussman, 
editor-in-chief of Engineering News-Record, a trade publication 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has been losing 200,000 workers per year for the  
past 10 years, Stussman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer young people are entering the industry to replace their  
retiring elders so the average age of a craft worker, such as an 
electrician or carpenter, has risen to 49, Moorhead said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its recruitment effort, the industry stresses that technology  
has eliminated many old questions about whether women have the 
upper body strength to handle the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the heavy lifting requirements have been made  
obsolete through machinery -- through cranes, tractors and other 
types of equipment. There are alternative methods to lifting 
materials. The person doesn't have to break their backs,'' said 
Dennis Day a spokesman for the Associated General Contractors, an 
industry group based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, women seem to be gravitating towards positions  
where manual dexterity is at a premium: electrical and plumbing 
crafts, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women make great tapers, plasterers and spacklers because it's  
very methodical detail work,'' said Stephanie Collier, executive 
director of Alpha Development Group Inc., a nonprofit economic 
development group in New London, Conn. ``It's like wallpapering, 
and women get into that. Men just want to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene Berger, 47, a carpenter in Waterford, Conn., for 17  
years, finds the work highly rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense of accomplishment,'' she said. ``I can drive  
all over ... and look at the work I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Salvatore, 42, a mother of three and a site engineer  
for C.R. Klewin Northeast, a construction company in Norwich, 
Conn., said she occasionally gets some ribbing about her long 
fingernails, but doesn't feel sexual harassment is a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
	``With some men, it's kind of a joke that we're here,'' she  
said. ``You have to be pretty tough to last, but it's worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to recruiting adults, the industry is also hoping to  
make children think differently. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated General Contractors recently started an  
educational program for fifth-graders showing construction jobs in 
a more positive light. 
</P>
<P>
	Patsy Smith, president of the 6,200-member National Association  
of Women in Construction, said her organization is also going into 
schools to change perceptions 
</P>
<P>
	``Young people are taught that they have to have a college  
education if they're going to have a decent job, and then they're 
confronted with the slam of, 'Well if you don't get an education, 
you can always dig ditches,''' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not what everyone in construction does, and even those  
that do are making good money,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Morris Goes Home After Brother Shot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) -- American golfer Marianne Morris has  
headed home from the Australian Ladies Masters following the 
shooting death of her brother John Michael Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	John Michael Morris was discovered dead in his suburban Atlanta  
golf shop with a bullet wound to the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-year professional with earnings of more than $820,000,  
Marianne Morris received the news when she arrived on the Gold 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament officials arranged for her golfer to fly home.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible thing to have happened,'' said fellow American  
tour pro Kris Tschetter. ``All the girls heard about it and were 
very upset. Marianne is very well known and extremely well liked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Michael Morris had been a big influence on his sister's  
career since she graduated in 1988 from the University of South 
Carolina and turned professional. In 1996, she recorded seven top 
10 finishes, earning $299,438. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a call Monday that a person was unconscious at the  
Golf Shack, police found the body of John Michael Morris, 39, of 
Lawrenceville, Ga. They believe he died from gunshot wounds 
inflicted during a robbery late Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Bush Builds Campaign Brain Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has laid claim to  
the network of friends and campaign supporters collected by his 
father over a political lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the younger Bush, who is two weeks away from announcing his  
own intentions regarding a presidential run, hasn't tapped his 
father's White House advisers in assembling a brain trust. Instead, 
the experts brought in to burnish Bush's views on economic, 
domestic and foreign policy come largely from the Reagan wing of 
the Republican Party. Others are new faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has turned to Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, a  
leading disciple of privatization, for domestic policy advice. 
Lawrence Lindsey, who served on President Reagan's Council of 
Economic Advisers and later was appointed by President Bush to the 
Federal Reserve Board, heads the governor's economic policy team. 
Another Reagan economic adviser, Harvard professor Martin 
Feldstein, also has come aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Condoleezza Rice, a Bush administration foreign policy adviser,  
heads the foreign policy team. Paul Wolfowitz, who held State and 
Defense department posts in the Reagan and Bush administrations, 
also is a key adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The lineup, some suggest, marks a clear effort to send the  
signal that the son's presidency would be far more conservative 
than the father's, which many on the right had viewed as a watering 
down of the Reagan legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would characterize them as conservative thinkers,'' Bush  
said this week of his advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	He is openly stressing his ideological independence from his  
father. ``I'll be a different candidate than the previous George 
Bush who ran for president,'' he told The Dallas Morning News. ``I 
love my dad, but I'm a different person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Kristol, who served in the Bush White House as Vice  
President Dan Quayle's chief of staff, said the governor's strategy 
in picking a kitchen Cabinet makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's emphasizing the outreach to the Reagan wing because he  
knows that his potential vulnerability as a Bush is to a Reaganite 
assault,'' said Kristol, who is editor of the conservative Weekly 
Standard magazine. ``How does he lose the nomination? He loses the 
nomination if someone else can say, `I'm Reagan, he's Bush.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospective Republican field, which Bush and former Red  
Cross President Elizabeth Dole dominate in early polls, includes 
several hopefuls who would seek to outflank Bush on the right. 
Among them are Quayle, billionaire Steve Forbes, TV commentator Pat 
Buchanan, social activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	While declining to read anything into the makeup of Bush's  
advisory team, Goldsmith, the Indianapolis mayor, said the advisers 
are advocates of conservative policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big ideas drive quality of life, and to have even a small part  
in this effort to think through governance is really an enormous 
opportunity for me, and hopefully a way I can contribute a little 
bit,'' said Goldsmith. He has joined in several policy roundtables 
in Austin, Texas, and heads there again Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's choice of counselors may be as much generational as  
ideological, said Norman Ornstein, a senior fellow at the American 
Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is picking people who come from the Reagan-Bush  
administration, but in some ways he's picking a different 
generation,'' Ornstein said. ``The younger Bush administration 
team, as a group, was more ideological than the people who were 
from George Bush's generation.''

<HEADLINE> Meissi's Slalom Streak Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARE, Sweden (AP) -- Alexandra Meissnitzer's superb giant slalom  
streak of top three finishes ended after her worst mistake of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meissi's'' miss in the next-to-last GS on the World Cup  
circuit gave veteran teammate Anita Wachter another nice memory 
from Scandinavia's leading ski resort. Five years ago, Wachter 
clinched the season-long World Cup giant slalom title on one of her 
favorite hills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like everything about this town except the cold weather,''  
Wachter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachter, 32, won Wednesday's race after Meissnitzer fell about  
halfway down the illuminated Gastrappet course. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer, who had won Monday's GS under the lights ahead of  
Wachter, skied smoothly on the difficult top section. The 
visibility was poor on the top of the hill because of a thick fog 
that rolled in during the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Having cleared that part, ``Meissi'' made an inside ski mistake  
after going through a gate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't take a lot of risks in the upper part because I  
wanted to have a clean run and the visibility wasn't so good,'' she 
said. ``I was ready to attack on the lower part, but it was a very 
hard slope. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just crashed. Things like this happen when you take all the  
risks. I'm upset, but this is part of the sport and I have to 
accept it. Now I'll just have to focus on the last race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Wachter, who had a two-run total of 2 minutes, 16.36  
seconds, it was the 12th career World Cup GS win and third this 
season. Her career total ties her for fifth with Hanni Wenzel of 
Liechtenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Vreni Schneider of Switzerland leads with 20 career GS triumphs.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have won if she (Meissnitzer) had come through,''  
Wachter said. ``I was lucky this time. I had a very strong second 
run. I wasn't so pleased with my first run. I made a few mistakes. 
So I knew I had to ski better in the second to make the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not thinking about winning the GS title. I have very  
little chance. I'm just looking to have a good race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer, who finished on the podium in all seven previous GS  
races this season, leads Wachter 620 points to 536 before the 
season finale next month in Sierra Nevada, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	If Wachter wins again -- a win is worth 100 points -- ``Meissi''  
only needs to finish 15th to clinch the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer also has a big lead over Hilde Gerg of Germany --  
1,430 points to 1,001 -- as she chases her first overall title. She 
has a chance to win the Super-G and downhill titles as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer led Norway's Andrine Flemmen by .66 seconds and  
Wachter by .78 seconds after the first run, which was held in 
perfect conditions under sunny skies in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Flemmen finished second on 2:16.42. She placed third behind the  
two Austrians in Monday's GS here. 
</P>
<P>
	In the recent World Championships at Vail, Colo., Flemmen was  
the silver medalist behind Meissnitzer in that discipline. Former 
double Olympic and world champion Deborah Compagnoni of Italy fell 
in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, a former World Cup overall champion  
who won the combined and took a slalom silver in Vail, fell in the 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Lalive of the United States was the only North American  
who qualified for the second run. She placed 21st among 24 
finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	A sprint downhill, the first for the women in World Cup history,  
will be held Saturday on the Olympia course designed by former 
Swiss downhill great Bernhard Russi.

<HEADLINE> Calcium Solution Keeps Melons Fresh / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a shelf life of only seven to 12 days,  
melons do not have much time to make it from the vine to consumers' 
mouths. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers with the Agriculture Department have found the  
key to prolonging their freshness: a special calcium solution that 
extends shelf life for an additional two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant physiologists with the Agricultural Research Service,  
USDA's research arm, in Houston and Weslaco, Texas, focused on 
calcium because aging melons need the element in their rinds to 
protect against spoilage. 
</P>
<P>
	But in ripe melons, calcium moves from the rinds to the seeds,  
making rinds susceptible to losing firmness. 
</P>
<P>
	Using greenhouse-grown melons, the scientists first tried to  
find concentrations of a solution containing calcium that would 
help thwart the loss of calcium to the seeds without harming the 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	They then submerged melons grown in the fields after their  
harvest in a solution for up to 20 minutes in solutions. The mix 
contained as much as 4 grams of calcium per liter. 
</P>
<P>
	The new treatment may create an even larger market for  
vine-ripened fruit. All types of melons together rank second to 
bananas as the most-consumed fresh fruit in the United States. 
Melons treated with the calcium solution and slowed down from 
becoming soft could also be shipped by surface transportation, 
rather than having to be flown abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Very sweet, unblemished, green-fleshed melons have proven  
popular, especially in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the worst weeds plaguing millions of  
acres in the United States now has an enemy of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists with the Agriculture Department have imported a small  
beetle named Eustenopus villosus from Eurasia to combat the weed, 
known as yellow starthistle. The weed can kill horses that feed on 
it, and can also displace other plants as it spreads, rendering 
acres and acres of prime grazing land useless. 
</P>
<P>
	The insects were released after years of safety and efficacy  
testing by several scientists with the Agricultural Research 
Service, the USDA's research arm. The female beetles lay eggs in 
older buds of the wheat. Larvae then eat most of the maturing seeds 
before they can spread and cover the land. 
</P>
<P>
	The beetles are the latest of five natural enemies imported by  
the service to combat the weeds. Scientists believe biological 
control is the best way to manage yellow starthistle, which is hard 
to stop once it takes over. Chemical controls may also be less 
desirable because of costs and environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Balciunas, an entomologist at the Exotic and Invasive Weeds  
Research Unit in Albany, Calif., is leading an ARS project to use 
biological controls on yellow starthistle. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of his research focuses on comparing seed production of the  
weed in the United States to one of its native countries, Turkey, 
where the weed does not grow out of control.

<HEADLINE> High Jumper Sports Dazzling Outfit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Competition was in full swing during the Millrose  
Games at Madison Square Garden, when suddenly more than 15,000 
spectators saw a shocking sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ripped off my warmups,'' high jumper Amy Acuff said, ``and  
there was a gasp in the crowd. The noise level rose quite a bit 
after that. People were talking ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	What caught the fans' attention was Acuff's stunning competition  
outfit -- a gray, fur tube top and black briefs with fur trim around 
the top. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not your ordinary high-jumping suit. Not since the late  
1980s and early 1990s -- when Florence Griffith Joyner, the world 
record-holder in the 100 and 200 meters, and Sandra Farmer-Patrick, 
the former world record-holder in the 400 hurdles, were wearing 
form-fitting, lacy, tassled outfits -- had track and field seen such 
flamboyant attire during competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Acuff had no intentions of copying FloJo or Farmer-Patrick, she  
just wanted to be different. 
</P>
<P>
	``FloJo was her own original entity,'' Acuff said Thursday. ``In  
track and field, we do ourselves a disservice by lumping everyone 
together and looking like clones. Anything that deviates from the 
spandex norm is good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to see everyone exercise individuality.''  
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Acuff and the fans at the two-day USA Indoor  
Championships, which began today at the Georgia Dome, she will not 
wear any eye-catching uniforms. Not because she didn't want to, but 
because after the Millrose Games, she was in Europe competing and 
didn't return until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That did not give Anne Klein, the company which designs her  
outfits, enough time to create something different for the 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outdoors, you will see some unique and creative outfits,''  
Acuff, the world's fifth-ranked high jumper, said. ``Ann Klein is 
designing some new outfits for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got tired of looking like everyone else. It's no fun showing  
up wearing the same thing as the other competitors. I want to be 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That she is.  
</P>
<P>
	A biology major at UCLA who graduated in 1997 and plans to enter  
medical school after her competitive career, Acuff began modeling 
in early 1998 in her spare time for the Click Agency in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	One national television spot last year was for Fruit of the  
Loom. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't show my face, so that was good because I didn't  
get teased,'' said Acuff, who was ``strolling by in my underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	``My head was above the frame. That's the way they edited the  
commercial. They took shots of my face, but they weren't used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long-legged, 6-foot-2 Acuff now is being featured in a TV  
commercial for TV Guide and has done other electronic and print 
ads, but there's one special modeling job she's anxious to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to work on a Sports Illustrated swimsuit  
edition,'' she said. ``People get a lot of attention for that. That 
would be a dream for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other competitors were not upset by Acuff's attention-getting  
attire at the Millrose Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them beforehand what I was going to do because I didn't  
want them to get distracted or upset,'' she said. ``They said it 
was a great idea and wished they had thought of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be great if it becomes a trend.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tisha Waller, Acuff's chief rival in the United States and the  
world's second-ranked high jumper, is in favor of the creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have been self-conscious, but it was exciting and  
different,'' Waller said. ``I think the fans liked seeing the 
different outfit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'll have to come up with something different. It  
brings out your personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some people were concerned that Acuff's fur would start  
flying during competition because there were no straps, she was not 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tightly attached,'' Acuff said about the artificial  
fur. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Acuff and Waller, the top women's competitors at  
the championships will be Gail Devers and Inger Miller (60 meters), 
Regina Jacobs (3,000), Suzy Hamilton (mile), Jearl Miles-Clark 
(400), Joetta Clark and Meredith Rainey Valmon (800), Melissa 
Mueller (pole vault), Connie Price-Smith (shot put) and Melissa 
Morrison (60 hurdles). 
</P>
<P>
	The top men include Maurice Greene and Jon Drummond (60), Reggie  
Torian and Dan O'Brien (60 hurdles), John Godina (shot put), Jeff 
Hartwig (pole vault), Charles Austin (high jump) and Lance Deal 
(35-pound weight throw). 
</P>
<P>
	Today's program included trials in the men's and women's 200,  
400 and 800, plus the first four events of the heptathlon. All 29 
championship finals will be Saturday.

<HEADLINE>  Is It Really a Nigerian Democracy? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- It looks, at first glance, like a  
political campaign in any democracy: Rallies jammed with thousands 
of cheering supporters, millions of campaign posters and candidates 
jetting around in last-minute attempts to secure votes. 
</P>
<P>
	But, just days before presidential elections marking the final  
phase in Nigeria's transition to civilian rule, some in this 
junta-weary nation say the real choice for Nigeria's next president 
was made long ago, by the country's power brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the repressiveness of the old Nigerian dictatorships is  
gone -- and Saturday's vote remains a historic move to end 15 years 
of military rule -- some Nigerians are wondering just how democratic 
this new process really is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are there really free and fair elections?'' asks Clement  
Nwankwo, a prominent human rights lawyer. ``I have serious 
doubts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics cite military backing for the presidential front-runner,  
retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a lack of campaign issues and 
blatant vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lagos' poorer neighborhoods, residents say a vote goes for as  
little as 100 naira -- about $1.10. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't give Nigerians money, they won't vote,'' Idowu  
Sulyman, a ward boss for Obasanjo's Peoples Democratic Party, said 
during last week's legislative elections. 
</P>
<P>
	To the transition's critics, though, it is the influence of  
Nigeria's military -- particularly its powerful and rich retired 
generals -- that most jeopardizes the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo, they say, was hand-picked by the generals months ago  
to give Nigeria a half-step toward democracy: to leave behind the 
brutal excesses and crippling corruption of Nigeria's late 
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, but also enable them to hold onto their 
money and influence. 
</P>
<P>
	From their plush mansions and polo clubs, critics say, the  
generals dispense the money and connections Obasanjo needs to 
succeed in the insular world of Nigerian politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone says the military is not pulling strings behind the  
scenes, they are deceiving themselves,'' said Mudi Sipikin, a 
northern politician who has opposed many of Nigeria's military 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo appears to offer something both to the north -- long the  
power holder -- and to the south, which has long felt excluded. 
</P>
<P>
	In a country where political loyalty is often determined by  
ethnicity and geography, Obasanjo -- a southerner, as well as a 
Yoruba Christian -- is acceptable to the Muslim northern generals 
who are largely from the ethnic Hausa-Fulani group. While he was a 
career military officer and junta leader, he also handed over power 
to an elected civilian government, and was later imprisoned during 
Abacha's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the PDP does not always bother to downplay the soldiers'  
influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The generals need somebody in power they can relate to, and  
that somebody is Obasanjo,'' said Abubakar Danmusa, a regional 
party leader in the northern town of Katsina. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo's opponent, Olu Falae, argues that Obasanjo's army ties  
will only make him beholden to his military backers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an accusation that infuriates Obasanjo.  
</P>
<P>
	``To say one who has retired from the military since 1979 is a  
military man, that is wrong,'' he said earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the core of Obasanjo's financial support comes from Gen.  
Ibrahim Babingida, another former military ruler and one of 
Nigeria's wealthiest men. 
</P>
<P>
	Babingida's regime, while less bloody than Abacha's, is widely  
blamed for fostering the corruption that now flourishes in Nigerian 
society, crippling the economy and destroying the nation's 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, oil-rich Nigeria barely functions, with telephone,  
electricity and water service all-but-unknown through large swaths 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Nigeria's democratic process is flawed, even critics  
admit that the political climate has dramatically improved since 
June, when Abacha's police state ended with his sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret police, who once terrorized this nation with arrests  
and executions, have been reined in, political prisoners have been 
released and people can again freely express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nation with such a repressive and corrupt history, some say  
a half-step to democracy may be just what is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``These elections are the beginning of our road on democracy,  
but things won't happen overnight,'' said Danmusa, the northern PDP 
boss. ``At least it's a start, a big plus instead of a minus.''

<HEADLINE>  Is It Really a Nigerian Democracy? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- It looks, at first glance, like a  
political campaign in any democracy: Rallies jammed with thousands 
of cheering supporters, millions of campaign posters and candidates 
jetting around in last-minute attempts to secure votes. 
</P>
<P>
	But, just days before presidential elections marking the final  
phase in Nigeria's transition to civilian rule, some in this 
junta-weary nation say the real choice for Nigeria's next president 
was made long ago, by the country's power brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the repressiveness of the old Nigerian dictatorships is  
gone -- and Saturday's vote remains a historic move to end 15 years 
of military rule -- some Nigerians are wondering just how democratic 
this new process really is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are there really free and fair elections?'' asks Clement  
Nwankwo, a prominent human rights lawyer. ``I have serious 
doubts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics cite military backing for the presidential front-runner,  
retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a lack of campaign issues and 
blatant vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lagos' poorer neighborhoods, residents say a vote goes for as  
little as 100 naira -- about $1.10. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't give Nigerians money, they won't vote,'' Idowu  
Sulyman, a ward boss for Obasanjo's Peoples Democratic Party, said 
during last week's legislative elections. 
</P>
<P>
	To the transition's critics, though, it is the influence of  
Nigeria's military -- particularly its powerful and rich retired 
generals -- that most jeopardizes the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo, they say, was hand-picked by the generals months ago  
to give Nigeria a half-step toward democracy: to leave behind the 
brutal excesses and crippling corruption of Nigeria's late 
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, but also enable them to hold onto their 
money and influence. 
</P>
<P>
	From their plush mansions and polo clubs, critics say, the  
generals dispense the money and connections Obasanjo needs to 
succeed in the insular world of Nigerian politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone says the military is not pulling strings behind the

<HEADLINE> HMOs Profiting From Higher Premiums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of anemic stock growth and flat  
earnings, HMOs are starting to please Wall Street again. 
</P>
<P>
	By raising premiums and squeezing reimbursement rates to doctors  
and hospitals, the nation's largest health maintenance 
organizations increased profits in the fourth quarter. Aetna-U.S. 
Healthcare, United Healthcare and PacifiCare all beat earnings 
expectations this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the year where we finally are seeing a recovery in the  
managed care field,'' said Joel Ray, an analyst with Wheat First 
Union in Richmond, Va. ``What's driving it is very simple: We 
finally have premium increases outpacing medical inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, HMOs that for years sacrificed profits to add  
members, have quit that strategy and decided to start pleasing 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs have enacted rate increases by an average of 5 percent to  
10 percent in recent months, while health costs last year rose 
about 5 percent. That's a big change from the prior three years, in 
which HMOs kept rates virtually flat as an effort to attract new 
members while their medical costs were rising. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, HMO profits have fallen steadily since 1994. Most  
HMOs lost money in 1996 and 1997, according to InterStudy, which 
tracks HMO trends. 
</P>
<P>
	PacifiCare Health Systems and Coventry HealthCare on Tuesday  
both reported fourth-quarter earnings that were stronger than 
expected. Earlier this month, Humana, which was among the first 
health plans to seek significant rate increases in 1997, reported 
profits that were in line with analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Oxford Health Plans became the latest large HMO to  
beat Wall Street estimates, even though it continued to lose money. 
Once the darling of HMO investors, Norwalk, Conn.-based Oxford 
trimmed its fourth-quarter loss to $19 million from $285 million a 
year ago. That worked out to the equivalent of a loss of 42 cents a 
share, not including unusual expenses, beating the 78-cents loss 
that analysts expected, according to a survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford, which now has 1.7 million members, narrowed its losses  
by quitting several unprofitable Medicaid markets and raising rates 
an average of 10 percent. Despite losing 9 percent of its members 
in the last year, Oxford expects to return to profitability later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``HMOs have culled back and walked away from unprofitable  
business, they've gone back to the basics,'' said Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO profits should rise even more this year because many plans  
reduced money-losing coverage of Medicare enrollees starting Jan.1. 
The industry has largely abandoned Medicare, saying the federal 
government no longer provides them adequate fees to care for the 
seniors. About 440,000 seniors had to change health plans or return 
to traditional Medicare because their plan left Medicare as this 
year began. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in tactics isn't pleasing consumer advocates, who now  
are complaining about rising health care costs after years of 
assailing HMOs about the quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers have accepted the higher premiums from HMOs this year  
largely because many have not faced significant rate increases 
since 1994. Employers expect health plans to raise rates by at 
least 8 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a buyers perspective, I don't think there is an  
overwhelming sense of alarm,'' said Paul Shumway, a health 
consultant for Towers Perrin in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Yanks, Nets May Merge Biz Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees and the NBA's New Jersey  
Nets will merge their business operations under a joint ownership 
agreement, according to newspaper reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, citing four unidentified sources with  
knowledge of the talks, said the deal was expected to be announced 
today and would include TV rights, marketing, sponsorships and 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The Record of Hackensack, N.J., and The Courier-News of  
Bridgewater, N.J., also said an announcement could come as early as 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said there  
would be an announcement later in the day. Howard Rubenstein said a 
conference call was planned and would include a representative of 
both the Yankees and Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said the teams are expected to establish a 50-50  
ownership arrangement, in which they will exchange some stock and 
the Nets will pay some cash. The Courier-News also said the teams 
will mesh with a 50-50 arrangement of television rights, marketing 
and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would bring together Steinbrenner, the Yankees'  
majority owner, and Nets lead investors Raymond Chambers, Lewis 
Katz and Finn Wentworth. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would give the teams increased bargaining power in  
upcoming cable television negotiations and possible moves from 
Yankee Stadium and Continental Airlines Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams' cable rights are held by divisions of Cablevision  
Systems, which made an unsuccessful bid to buy the Yankees last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are entering the 11th season of a 12-year, $486  
million contract with Madison Square Garden Network, and the Nets' 
deal with Fox Sports New York runs through the 2001-02 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating together, the Yankees and Nets also would be in  
position to form their own sports channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The TV play is where the upside is,'' Marc Ganis, president of  
SportsCorp. Ltd., a sports consulting firm in Chicago, told the 
Times. ``And maybe there could be some more at some point with a 
public offering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are exploring several stadium possibilities, while  
the Nets are interesting in building their own arena in Newark, 
N.J.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Kostner Fastest in Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARE, Sweden (AP) -- Isolde Kostner of Italy had the fastest time  
in Thursday's training run for the first sprint downhill in women's 
World Cup ski racing this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Kostner sped down the 1,780-meter Olympia course in 1 minute,  
3.56 seconds. Racing conditions were ideal with a temperature in 
the 40s, virtually no wind and sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kostner, 23, has three second-place finishes this season,  
including the last race at Cortina, Italy, and is fifth in the 
World Cup downhill standings. She finished ninth in the recent 
World Championships at Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Regina Haeusl of Germany, seventh in the DH standings, posted  
the second-fastest time in 1:03.64 with Melanie Suchet of France 
third in 1:03.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaela Dorfmeister led the powerful Austrians, clocking the  
fourth-fastest time of 1:03.85 followed by Renate Goetschl in 
1:03.91. Alexandra Meissnitzer was 14th and Stephanie Schuster 
32nd. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl led an Austrian sweep of the top four places at Vail,  
with Dorfmeister, Schuster and Meissnitzer next in that order. 
Meissnitzer, who leads the overall standings and is third in 
downhill, won the giant slalom here Monday, but skied out in the 
second GS on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided that the Olympia  
course, designed by former Swiss downhill great Bernhard Russi, 
would be a test site for a women's sprint DH. The men have had 
similar races. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ``mini'' downhill will be held Saturday morning, the  
second in the afternoon. The racer with the fastest aggregate time 
wins the downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many advantages with a sprint downhill,'' said Olle  
Rolen, the race director for this World Cup meet. ``A shorter 
downhill with a lower starting position is not so 
weather-sensitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	High wind and bad weather at the top of the hill are the main  
reasons why so many downhills are either postponed or canceled. 
Last season, 11 downhills were postponed or canceled on the World 
Cup tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Are Resort Enterprise AB, which owns the lift system in  
Scandinavia's biggest ski center, plans to illuminate part of the 
Olympia course if the sprint competition is successful. The 
adjacent Gastrappet hill is the only one in the world approved for 
World Cup giant slalom and slalom night races by FIS. There are 104 
illumination posts on both sides along the 1,500-meter course. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Monahan of Aspen, Colo., led the North Americans in  
Thursday's training run, finishing 16th. Canada's Melanie Turgeon 
was 18th, Kirsten Clark of Raymond, Maine was 19th and Megan Gerety 
of Anchorage, Alaska was 21st. Another training run is scheduled 
for Friday.

<HEADLINE> UAW Leadership at Saturn Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) -- Saturn Corp. workers who for the first  
time last year voted to give their union leaders the authority to 
call a strike now have voted for new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 1853 President Rick Martinez, who replaced Joe Rypkowski  
when Rypkowski took a UAW staff job last fall, was defeated by Ron 
Hankins, the union announced following voting yesterday. Hankins is 
the outgoing mayor of Spring Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeep Williams, who was vice president, was picked to replace  
bargaining chairman Mike Bennett. Bennett, a union leader at Saturn 
since the General Motors Corp. subsidiary began operating nine 
years ago, was a strong supporter of the company's unique work 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are ready for a change here,'' said Doug Malinowski, a  
skilled tradesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said he didn't think the vote indicates Saturn workers  
want to scrap the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our opposition ran a pretty good campaign that said it could  
be better than it is now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a ``risk-and-reward'' pay program, Saturn's 7,200 Spring  
Hill employees average about 12 percent less in salary than GM's 
other workers but can add to their base pay by hitting certain 
production goals. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier years, annual bonuses reached $10,000 and Saturn  
workers made about $4,000 more than their GM counterparts. But as 
the small car market has shrunk, so has the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, workers voted 2-1 to retain the contract after  
Rypkowski, Bennett and other union leaders urged them to keep it 
while they sought concessions from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four months later, with talks stalled, workers voted to  
give their union leaders authorization to call a strike. The 
workers were concerned about possible job cuts from work being sent 
to other plants, sliding bonus pay and a decreasing role in 
management decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	No strike was called and in September the union announced GM had  
agreed to spend $230 million to add another production line and 
make other changes at the plant to accommodate production of a new 
sport utility vehicle. Production is expected to begin in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Mutola Sets Record in 1,000 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Maria Mutola made it easy for clerks  
updating their lists of world records. 
</P>
<P>
	To list the world record for the women's indoor 1,000 meters,  
all they'll have to change is the time and one digit in the year -- 
the day, city and name remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutola, of Mozambique, ran the race in 2 minutes, 30.94 seconds  
in the Globen Galan meet Thursday, exactly three years after she 
set the previous record on the same track with 2:31.23. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm familiar with the track. I know where to go,'' she said in  
a pearl of understatement that was followed by a bit of 
bewilderment about what else she could accomplish in Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is come back and try again,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the meet, Mutola had been widely expected to be the star  
of the night, but the crowd got a surprise with another world 
record -- Nicole Humbert of Germany vaulted 14 feet, 11 1/2 inches, 
breaking the 11-month-old mark of 14-11 by Emma George of 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Humbert herself seemed stunned, not only at the record but at  
beating Zsuzsa Szabo of Hungary, who had been the favorite in the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to jump 4.51 ... it was in my head,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Gail Devers' winning run in the 60 meters of 7.03  
seconds wasn't close to a record, the American was bubbling over 
afterwards. She'd just returned to competition 10 days ago after 
being sidelined by Achilles tendon trouble since May. 
</P>
<P>
	She ran the event in 7.04 in Birmingham, England on Feb. 15 and  
shaving that hundredth of a second in Stockholm reassured her that 
she was back in full form. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know -- whoo! -- there's a lot of work to be done,'' she said,  
laughing. But ``I can't be upset, because my best time has been 
7.04. ... I've come a long way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In men's events, Javier Sotomayor of Cuba won the high jump,  
making it look easy with his style of launching almost vertically, 
instead of lunging at the bar like his competitors. But Sotomayor's 
winning jump of 7 feet, 7 1/4 inches was far less than the world 
record of 7-11 1/2 that he set a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Ivan Pedroso won the long jump at 27-4 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Nkansah of Ghana won the men's 60 in 6.58, edging favorite  
Deji Aliu of Nigeria by 0.03 seconds. Kenya's Laban Rotich won the 
1,500 in 3:33.39 and compatriot Paul Bitok took the 3,000 in 
7:49.12. 
</P>
<P>
	American Courtney Hawkins won the 60-meter hurdles in 7.54,  
Cuba's Norberto Tellez edged Roberto Chirchir of Kenya by a tenth 
of a second to win the 800 in 1:47.02 and Robert Martin of Jamaica 
took the 400 in 46.73. 
</P>
<P>
	In other women's events, Jamaica's Sandie Richards won the 400  
in 52.30 and Magdalena Khristova of Bulgaria won the long jump at 
20-10 1/2.

<HEADLINE> DirecTV To Lose CBS, Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Thousands of satellite dish owners will need  
something they thought they'd never bother with again -- a rooftop 
antenna -- to watch CBS and Fox shows next week. 
</P>
<P>
	U. S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt granted a restraining order  
Thursday, preventing DirecTV, the nation's largest satellite TV 
company, from providing the network shows directly to its 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how many people will be affected by the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV has more than 4.6 million customers and offers about 185  
channels. Spokesman Jeff Torkelson did not return telephone 
messages seeking comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Petersburg Times has reported that about 700,000  
customers nationwide will lose programming Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, satellite TV companies can't provide network  
programming if customers can pick the shows up with an antenna. 
They are permitted to provide network signals from faraway stations 
to those who can't. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters, including the four major networks -- CBS, Fox, ABC  
and NBC and their affiliates -- complain that satellite companies 
rob them of advertising revenue by allowing viewers to bypass local 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nesbitt ruled last year that Prime Time 24, a major supplier of  
network programming for satellite TV, had done so illegally. She 
ordered the practice to stop Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming the order applied only to Prime Time 24, DirecTV made  
its own arrangements to get CBS and Fox shows for its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's frankly outrageous that DirecTV has done this  
little stunt,'' said attorney Tom Olson, who represents the 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	A DirecTV lawyer said the company was only trying to protect  
customers who are entitled to the programming. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no effort to pull a shenanigan, to utilize a  
loophole,'' said Alan Greer.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down With Stocks, U.S. Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against major currencies  
Thursday, undercut by a sharp selloff in U.S. stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.63  
Japanese yen, down from 121.80 on Wednesday. Also in late trading, 
the euro was quoted at $1.1032, up from $1.0990. 
</P>
<P>
	Dollar traders took their cues from the Treasury and equity  
markets, which fell sharply again in the aftermath of comments by 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinting at a boost in the 
central bank's lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In his semiannual report to Congress Tuesday and Wednesday,  
Greenspan presented a balanced outlook on the economy, but 
indicated the Fed was done cutting interest rates and might even 
raise them to prevent inflationary growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, fresh data released Thursday suggested continued  
strength, heightening fears the Fed may act to slow things down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that demand for durable goods  
surged 3.9 percent in January, the strongest increase in 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Labor Department said new claims for  
unemployment benefits fell by 5,000 last week, and the National 
Association of Realtors reported that existing homes climbed 0.8 
percent to a record level in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data are likely to prompt speculation of a move to a  
tightening bias by the Fed in the near future,'' said Neil Parker, 
treasury economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland's London office. 
</P>
<P>
	The mounting concerns boosted bond-market interest rates to  
another six-month high, pushing stocks into a steep selloff. The 
Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 166 points before 
trimming its losses, closing just 33.33 lower at 9,366.34. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar spent most of the day falling, but settled into quiet  
range trading as the Dow industrials cooled off. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4390 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4485, and 1.5090 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4979. The British 
pound rose to $1.6033, up from $1.5962. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7727 German 
marks, down from 1.7797; 5.9453 French francs, down from 5.9701; 
and Italian lire, 1,754.39, down from 1,760.56.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Brings Platform West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- President Clinton turned to senior citizens  
Thursday for help in pressuring reluctant Republicans to support 
his plan for mending the ailing Medicare insurance program with 
billions of dollars in budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Republicans agree with his idea to reserve surpluses for  
fixing Social Security, but ``we're not there on Medicare yet. ... 
The people of this country need to make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before an enthusiastic crowd, he dropped biting remarks from his  
prepared text about Republicans ``rethinking their indiscriminate 
tax cut that would squander our surplus'' and favoring tax cuts 
that would ``crowd out Medicare.'' Aides said his draft speech was 
only a guideline. 
</P>
<P>
	In this traditionally GOP Republican state, Clinton received a  
rousing welcome two weeks after being acquitted in his Senate 
impeachment trial. An overflow crowd of 2,000 people, many of them 
elderly, jammed the Tucson Convention Center music hall, and many 
more waited outside under a hot sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe, who voted for three of the  
four articles of impeachment against Clinton in the House, drew 
loud boos from the audience when he was introduced to speak before 
the president. Asked later if he still felt Clinton were unfit for 
office, Kolbe said, ``Impeachment's over, let's talk about Social 
Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, a handful of protesters criticized administration  
policy toward Iraq and the president's personal behavior. One woman 
carried a sign referring to accusations against Clinton. It said, 
``I believe Juanita and Paula and Kathleen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's long day was ending in San Francisco at a $1 million  
fund-raiser to help Democrats battle to regain control of the House 
and Senate. The ``Majority 2000'' dinner at the Fairmont Hotel was 
the first of nine such events in an effort to raise $9 million 
toward next year's congressional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton paid tribute to the fact that Arizona is the first state  
to have an all-female line of succession, from governor to 
superintendent of public instruction. He said he told his wife, 
Hillary, that he was going to begin his speech by saying Arizona is 
the mirror of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, yeah ... the women are in charge at last,'' the  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's seven-hour stop in Tuscon was the city's first  
presidential visit since Gerald Ford dropped by 25 years ago. 
Tucson and surrounding Pima County are Democrat-dominated. The 
county was instrumental in helping Clinton in 1996 become the first 
Democrat to carry Arizona in 48 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very grateful for that,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Opening a six-day trip blending business with vacation, Clinton  
urged support for his proposal to earmark 62 percent of expected 
surpluses to shore up Social Security and 15 percent to overhaul 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	With tensions still frayed by the impeachment struggle, Clinton  
and Republicans are seeking the upper hand in a high-stakes contest 
over how to carve up $4.8 trillion in expected budget surpluses 
over 15 years. While Republicans are wary of Clinton's plan for 
Medicare, however, they remain divided among themselves over what 
tax cuts to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said there appeared to be ``some movement toward  
reaching some consensus about the nature of tax cuts, if they ought 
to be targeted and benefit the people that need it most, and try 
not to get in the way of saving Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his speech, the president stopped by an arts and crafts  
fair. He also visited the spring training camp of the Arizona 
Diamondbacks as they prepare for their second season in the 
National League. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he will deliver a foreign policy address in San  
Francisco and fly to Los Angeles for a $175,000 fund-raiser for the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Clinton heads to Park City, Utah, where he and his  
wife will join daughter Chelsea to celebrate her 19th birthday at a 
ski resort. Clinton will return Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Invited to Missile Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon will let Russian officials  
monitor U.S. missile launch warning data from mid-December to 
mid-January to bolster their confidence that America is not 
attacking, even if the Year 2000 computer bug creates glitches or 
gaps that prompt their own radars to indicate otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Information that would be made available to the Russians would  
be based on both satellite and land-based sensors but would not 
divulge secrets about American ballistic missile systems, said 
Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense for strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The single thing it will show is whether we launch or not,''  
he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner made the proposal to Russian defense officials last week.  
He said they did not accept but agreed to come to the United States 
next month to discuss it in more detail, including whether the 
arrangement would be reciprocated to give U.S. officials data from 
Russia's early warning radars. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and President  
Clinton agreed to pursue the development of a joint early warning 
center in Russia to enable both nations to continuously share data 
on ballistic missile launches. That is not likely to come to 
fruition before year's end, Warner said, and therefore it was 
decided to invite Russian early-warning specialists to Colorado 
Springs, Colo., for the Year 2000 transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our proposal would give them extensive coverage, including  
coverage of potential U.S. launches,'' Warner said. ``We have no 
intention to make any launches, but it would give them coverage of 
those areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to boost Russia's confidence that it will have  
adequate early warning of potential long-range missile launches 
from the United States at the start of the New Year, when some fear 
the ``millennium bug'' will strike and disrupt computer systems 
that have not been altered to compensate for possible Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said the Russians were invited to a ``specially setup  
facility'' in Colorado Springs, but he was not more specific. Aides 
later said they did not know exactly where the facility would be 
established. Colorado Springs is home to the North American 
Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Space Command. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has said it is certain its early warning system  
will not be disrupted by the Year 2000 ``bug.'' Some U.S. officials 
have expressed concern that the Russians are late in working out 
Y2K bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said that in his talks in Moscow last week, the Russians  
did not ask for U.S. financial help to speed their rehabilitation 
of Russian computer systems to make them handle the Year 2000 
change smoothly. He said they seem ``highly motivated'' to make 
necessary preparations for the turn of the millennium, but ``We did 
not get enough detailed information to understand the status of 
where they are now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the computers used to control Russia's own nuclear  
missiles, Warner said, ``Their assertion is they have looked into 
those systems, and they are actively working on them, and that they 
were coping with whatever problems they were confronting.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Buys Web Drugstore Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now Amazon.com shoppers can by some Viagra with  
that new John Grisham novel and Lauryn Hill compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet bookseller took another step Wednesday toward  
building an online retail empire with the purchase of a 46 percent 
stake in drugstore.com, a new Web site selling pharmaceuticals and 
beauty aids. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com, which started four years ago selling only books, has  
in the past year added music, videos, toys and electronics. 
Amazon.com didn't disclose the value of its stake in Redmond, 
Wash.-based drugstore.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugstore.com, which will be launched today, gives Amazon.com a  
new product mix -- which will include everything from the impotence 
pill Viagra to Crest toothpaste -- as well as a broader base of 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs are among the latest products being hyped on the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
	A company called Soma began an online drugstore in January, and  
PlanetRx is slated to open in the coming months. Traditional 
retailers such as Rite Aid only have limited businesses online as 
they focus more on store expansion than the Internet frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based Amazon.com sees huge growth in this business  
as consumers look for more convenient ways to buy prescriptions, 
especially for those medications they don't need immediately -- like 
birth control or heart drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at this business and thought this was a great  
segment where you can truly empower customers,'' Jeff Bezos, 
Amazon.com's founder and chief executive, said in announcing the 
deal. ``This shopping experience could completely revolutionize the 
drug store industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Americans bought $13.8 billion worth of prescription  
drugs through the mail, which represented about 13.4 percent of the 
$102 billion in total prescription sales, according to the National 
Association of Chain Drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Amazon, this is a product that is very different from what  
they are selling and it's a very logical investment,'' said Ken 
Cassar, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, an Internet 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pharmacy drug market is an enormous one,'' he said. ``It  
makes the $24 billion book market look like a joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But drugstore.com and others still have work ahead of them.  
Marketing medications on the Internet is far more difficult than 
books, especially since consumers need to feel that their private 
medical information is secure online. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, however, say that once an online pharmacy wins over a  
customer, she will likely be loyal to the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a certain bond that shoppers will develop with these  
online drugstores,'' said Jae Kim, an analyst at Paul Kagan &AMP; 
Associates in Carmel, Calif. ``They will earn business by being 
good pharmacists, like keeping tabs on what drugs can interact and 
other health issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Earning repeat customers is key to being a successful online  
retailer today, and Amazon.com knows that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugstore.com will sell 15,000 brand-name health and beauty  
products as well as prescription and over-the-counter medications. 
Consumers can mail in new prescriptions, have existing 
prescriptions transferred from other pharmacies or have doctors 
call in prescriptions to a toll-free line 1-800-drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugstore.com will handle the prescription orders, but they will  
be filled by an outside company, RxAmerica, which is already in the 
mail-order drug business. 
</P>
<P>
	To publicize the new venture, Amazon.com will give drugstore.com  
a link on its home page.

	Death Sentence in Dragging Case  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Jurors decided today that John William King  
should be executed for dragging a black man to his death behind a 
pickup truck. The 11 white jurors and their elected black foreman 
took just under three hours to render the decision, about the same 
time they took to find King guilty. They rejected tearful pleas 
from the white racist's sickly father to spare his life. Jurors 
convicted the 24-year-old King of capital murder Tuesday in the 
death of James Byrd Jr. last June. 

</P>
<P>
	Israel Blocks Teen Extradition  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court blocked the extradition  
today of a U.S. teen-ager suspected in the dismemberment of an 
acquaintance. The reluctant tones of the judges' 3-2 decision 
keeping Samuel Sheinbein from returning to Maryland to stand trial 
reflected wider embarrassment in Israel over a blanket ban on 
extraditing Jews -- a ban many now believe to be outdated. Justice 
Theodor Orr, writing for the majority, said the law contradicts 
extradition treaties Israel has signed -- but that as long as the 
law was on the books, he had to uphold it. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Urges Medicare Plan  
</P>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- President Clinton turned to senior citizens  
today for help in pressuring reluctant Republicans to support his 
plan for mending the ailing Medicare insurance program with 
billions of dollars in budget surpluses. He said Republicans appear 
to be moving away from the across-the-board tax cuts toward 
targeted tax breaks that ``benefit people that need it most.'' 
Clinton's speech at the Tucson Convention Center was the first 
piece of a six-day presidential trip through Western states. 

</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Rebels Battle Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo rebels and the Yugoslav army  
clashed today in defiance of NATO and U.S. warnings that the 
enemies hold to a cease-fire during a 2 1/2-week suspension in peace 
talks. Yugoslav army tanks and mortars were firing near Bukos, a 
village about 20 miles northwest of Pristina where rebel forces are 
concentrated, Associated Press photographers said. More than 2,000 
people have died during fighting in the past year between ethnic 
Albanians and Serb-led Yugoslav forces. 

</P>
<P>
	China Vetoes Macedonia Peacekeepers  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- China lashed back at Macedonia today for  
establishing ties with Taiwan, vetoing a Security Council 
resolution that would have kept U.N. peacekeepers in the strategic 
Balkan country for another six months. Overriding concerns that the 
conflict in neighboring Kosovo could cross the border, Chinese 
Ambassador Qin Huasun cast the vote. It's the fifth time that 
Beijing has used its council veto. 

</P>
<P>
	Austria Avalanche Deaths Rise  
</P>
<P>
	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- The death toll from two Austrian  
avalanches rose today to 33. In the western village of Galtuer, 
where at least 28 people were killed, scores of rescuers used long 
metal probes to search for at least three people still believed 
buried beneath tons of snow. U.S. Army helicopters helped to fly 
supplies into the stricken area. 

</P>
<P>
	Snow Hits New England  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Low pressure off the coast today brought heavy  
snow to southeastern parts of New England, with up to a foot of 
snow or more in some areas. The heavy snow coupled with wind gusts 
up to 50 mph led to near-blizzard conditions across eastern 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Dozens of flights out of Boston's 
Logan Airport were canceled while hundreds of schools throughout 
the region also were closed. 

</P>
<P>
	Tomb of Unknowns May Alter  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon probably will place an  
inscription at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National 
Cemetery in memory of those lost in the Vietnam War rather than 
place new remains in the tomb, officials said. Spokesman Kenneth 
Bacon said Defense Secretary William Cohen had not made a final 
decision but concurred with the view of aides. They concluded that 
it is not possible to say with complete confidence that any future 
remains from Vietnam will be unidentifiable. 

</P>
<P>
	Dow Ends Down 33.33  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A spike in interest rates today pushed stocks,  
which have benefited for a long time from reasonable borrowing 
costs, sharply lower. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 
33.33 at 9,366.34. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 1,962-1,057. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 12.56 to 2,326.85.

	Yanks, Nets To Merge Cos.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees and the NBA's New Jersey  
Nets have signed a letter of intent to merge the two teams into one 
company. However, the teams' current management will remain in 
place, with George Steinbrenner running the Yankees and Lewis Katz 
running the Nets, the teams announced today. The new company, 
called YankeeNets, will enable the Yankees to gain better leverage 
in selling their local broadcast rights.

<HEADLINE>  Another Collapse by Norman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- There's no better way for a tournament  
to gain major status than for Greg Norman to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman did his bit for the Match Play Championship on Thursday,  
blowing a 3-up lead with four holes remaining in a second-round 
match against Eduardo Romero. Ironically, Norman might not have had 
the opportunity had he not championed a world golf tour five years 
ago that led to creation of this $5 million event. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman, who has a history of crashing and burning in the final  
round of major championships, was seemingly home free with four 
holes remaining. He needed to win just one more hole, or halve two, 
to finish off the Argentine and advance to a third-round marquee 
matchup with local favorite Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Norman let Romero reel him in, catch him on No. 18 and  
then beat him in 21 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what match play is all about,'' Norman said.  
``Congratulations to him. He was a great competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took what Romero called the best shot in his life -- giving  
him two of those in a span of eight days -- to tie the match and 
force extra holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero won the 15th hole with a birdie and the 16th when Norman  
bogeyed. After halving the par-5 17th, they came into the decisive 
18th with Norman 1-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero's second shot was 169 yards to the flag, into the wind.  
He hit a 7-iron with a little fade, putting it a foot from the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perfect. So I think it was the best shot in my life,'' said  
Romero, who had said the same thing about his hole-in-one in the 
opening round of the Qatar Masters eight days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman said Romero's shot at 18 ``was as good as any I have  
seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romero's birdie putt sent the match to extra holes. Romero could  
have won it on the second extra hole, when Norman's tee shot went 
left, landed on a cart path and went out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is nothing but bad luck,'' said Norman, who missed the  
cut in his own tournament in Australia three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero missed a par putt that would have won it, but sank a  
25-foot birdie putt on No. 3 for the victory that put him into 
Friday's match with Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very happy,'' Romero said. ``I know it is match play. You  
never know in match play what is coming on. I am a very hard guy 
when playing the match play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Norman's proposal for a world tour went nowhere, it  
helped lead to the creation of the World Golf Championships, which 
pull together the best players on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman came into the Match Play Championship seeded 28th and  
Romero 60th in the field of 64.

	Romero's birdie putt sent the match to extra holes. Romero could  
have won it on the second extra hole, when Norman's tee shot went 
left, landed on a cart path and went out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is nothing but bad luck,'' said Norman, who missed the  
cut in his own tournament in Australia three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero missed a par putt that would have won it, but sank a  
25-foot birdie putt on No. 3 for the victory that put him into 
Friday's match with Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very happy,'' Romero said. ``I know it is match play. You  
never know in match play what is coming on. I am a very hard guy 
when playing the match play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Norman's proposal for a world tour went nowhere, it  
helped lead to the creation of the World Golf Championships, which 
pull together the best players on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman came into the Match Play Championship seeded 28th and  
Romero 60th in the field of 64.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Feeling Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood, slowed by an upper respiratory  
infection, went home early from the hospital and will return to the 
Chicago Cubs spring training camp Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who's now had three separate bouts of illness this spring,  
entered Mesa Lutheran Hospital for tests Wednesday that team 
officials thought could take two days. But he'd improved so much, 
he was allowed to go home that same night. 
</P>
<P>
	Team physician Dr. John Marquardt said Wood will continue to  
take medication and will work on his conditioning slowly. The 
21-year-old right-hander hasn't participated in spring training 
since Sunday 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll probably be a week to 10 days before he is operating on  
all cylinders,'' Marquardt said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had an unlucky spring in that he's had three sort of  
distinct illnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Marquardt nor Cubs general manager Ed Lynch could  
predict if the NL Rookie of the Year would be ready for the season 
opener April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's more than a month, so he may well come along nicely.  
It's hard to say,'' Marquardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood came down with a bronchial infection in January and that  
was followed a week ago by a bout of viral gastroenteritis that 
forced him to enter the hospital because he was dehydrated. He lost 
12 pounds as a result but has since gained some back. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last weekend, Wood began coughing and the bronchial  
problems had returned, along with chills, fever and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquardt said the illness is a common one in the Phoenix area  
at this time of the year and hospitals are full of patients with 
the same symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood went 13-6 last season, electrifying baseball when he struck  
out 20 Houston Astros in his fifth major league start, tying a 
major league record. He missed the final month of last season with 
a sore elbow before returning to pitch Game 3 of the divisional 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said he has discussed a contract for Wood with his agent  
and was confident something would be in place by the first spring 
training game March 5. Wood made the major league minimum $170,000 
last season.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets' LaFrentz Is Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Denver rookie Raef LaFrentz will miss the rest of  
the season after tearing a ligament in his left knee Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	LaFrentz, the third pick in last June's NBA Draft, tore an  
anterior cruciate ligament on a drive to the basket in the first 
quarter of Denver's 90-81 loss to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime someone is playing as well as he was and goes down for  
the year, it's tough,'' said Nuggets coach Mike D'Antoni. ``But we 
can't feel sorry for ourselves. We have to have a couple of guys 
step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaFrentz was averaging 14.9 points and 8.1 rebounds in his first  
11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mavericks also lost a player when No. 2 scorer Cedric  
Ceballos fractured his right wrist and will miss six weeks. 
Ceballos, who hurt the wrist when he was knocked to the floor on a 
layup attempt in the first quarter, stayed in the game.

<HEADLINE> CDC Pinpoints Physical Inactivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Physical activity tends to be lower among people  
-- particularly older adults -- who perceive their neighborhoods to 
be unsafe, according to a new federal study of five states. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control  
and Prevention found that 39.3 percent of people ages 18 to 64 
living in neighborhoods they characterize as ``not at all safe'' 
reported no physical activity or exercise in the preceding month. 
</P>
<P>
	That compared to 30.5 percent for people living in areas they  
deemed to be ``extremely safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest disparity was among those 65 and older. The study  
found that 63.1 percent living in unsafe neighborhoods were 
physically inactive, compared with 38.6 in safer areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were based on a 1996 survey of 12,767 people in  
Maryland, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger adults are more likely to leave their neighborhoods for  
work and other activities. For older adults, walking tended to be 
the most common form of activity, and thus neighborhood safety 
played a more important role. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not give factors contributing to the overall  
increase of physical inactivity as neighborhood safety decreases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The importance of this is it points out we really don't know  
what's going on and we need to look a little closer at what role 
neighborhood safety plays in physical activity,'' said Dexter 
Kimsey, an epidemiologist with the CDC's Division of Nutrition and 
Physical Activity.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asked to Condemn China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate urged the Clinton administration to  
sponsor a resolution condemning China for human rights abuses when 
the U.N. Human Rights Commission meets next month in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors of the measure said Thursday's 99-0 vote, although not  
legally binding, would send a powerful message to the Beijing 
government as well as to democracy advocates in China in advance of 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arrested dissidents and their courageous supporters  
deserve our full backing in their historic struggle to bring 
democracy to China,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., a sponsor 
of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton ignored a similar resolution passed by  
Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration had pushed human-rights condemnations of  
China at past Geneva sessions but declined to do so in 1998 because 
Clinton was then planning a visit to China. 
</P>
<P>
	But since that trip last July, and despite Beijing's promises to  
exhibit more tolerance, China's communist leaders ``have 
intensified their crackdown,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
``The pattern of abuse is clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for our secretary of state to have that message  
when she goes to China,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is scheduled to meet Chinese officials on Monday and  
Tuesday for talks on an array of concerns, including human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before the House International Relations Committee,  
Albright said Thursday she should would ``bring a strong message of 
support for international norms of respect for human rights, and 
this will come as no surprise to Beijing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me stress,'' she said, ``in our relations with China,  
engagement is not endorsement. We continue to have sharp 
differences with Beijing, but we also believe that the best way to 
narrow those differences and to make progress where our interests 
coincide is through regular contact and dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright told a Senate panel Wednesday that the administration  
hadn't yet decided whether to offer an anti-China resolution at the 
upcoming Geneva meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told the Senate:  
``There continue to be terrible human rights violations in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he deliberately scheduled the measure second on the  
Senate calendar to emphasize its importance. The first, passed 
Wednesday, was a big pay raise for the military. Republican leaders 
are trying to demonstrate that the Clinton impeachment trial didn't 
undermine their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the China resolution had great Democratic  
support. 
</P>
<P>
	The only senator who didn't vote in the unanimous roll call was  
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution asserts that ``the government of the People's  
Republic of China continues to commit widespread and 
well-documented human rights abuses in China and Tibet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also accuses China of continuing ``coercive implementation of  
family planning policies and the sale of human organs taken from 
executed prisoners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States should introduce and make all efforts  
necessary to pass a resolution criticizing the People's Republic of 
China for its human rights abuses in China and Tibet,'' states the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors said that even though China signed an international  
covenant on civil and political rights Oct. 5, it had not yet taken 
steps to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know human rights conditions have only deteriorated in  
China and Tibet,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.

<HEADLINE> Boeing To Sell Technical Subsidiary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. has signed a letter of intent to sell  
its McDonnell Douglas Technical Services subsidiary to a group of 
managers and an affiliate of Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
	MDTSC is a wholly owned subsidiary formed in 1989 and inherited  
by Boeing when it bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997. It provides 
engineers and technicians on a temporary contract basis to 
companies throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Long Beach, Calif., MDSTC has about 150 employees and  
represents about 2,300 contract workers, Boeing spokeswoman Barbara 
Anderson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing, with about 228,000 employees worldwide, has suffered  
financially during the past two years. It is undergoing a 
top-to-bottom review to weed out products and programs that aren't 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	MDSTC is ``just not a fit with our businesses,'' Anderson said.  
</P>
<P>
	A sale price was not disclosed. Anderson said final terms were  
still being negotiated, but the sale is expected to close by the 
end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	The MDTSC management team is led by subsidiary president Ellen  
Roy, Mark Masterson and Dennis Bashuk. It is buying MDSTC with CIVC 
Partners, a $500 million private equity fund whose sole limited 
partner is Bank of America.

<HEADLINE> Viacom Profits Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. gave an upbeat fourth-quarter profit  
report Thursday thanks to the strength of its MTV and Nickelodeon 
cable networks, Paramount Pictures and the Blockbuster video rental 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The media company said profits from operations were $296.3  
million, a 36 percent gain from the $217.4 million earned in the 
last quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income, however, fell 97 percent, to $18.5 million or 10  
cents per share, because the previous year's results were boosted 
by a gain from selling its half of USA Networks. In the fourth 
quarter of 1997, net earnings were $573 million, or $1.54 per 
share, thanks to $1.2 billion in proceeds, before taxes, from the 
USA Networks sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The company beat analyst expectations in a key component,  
earnings per share from continuing operations, which came in at 30 
cents. Analysts polled by the research firm First Call had 
predicted just 13 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's Class B shares, which had already risen sharply on  
expectations of a strong report, climbed a modest 12 1/2 cents to 
$86.75 on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter rose 15 percent to $3.34 billion from  
$2.91 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from networks and broadcasting rose 15 percent  
on improved results from the MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon and Showtime 
cable networks, as well as Viacom's television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's entertainment division posted a 73 percent rise in  
operating profit on strong U.S. box-office results from ``The 
Rugrats Movie,'' the overseas releases of ``Saving Private Ryan'' 
and ``The Truman Show,'' and video sales of ``Titanic.'' Paramount 
co-produced ``Titanic'' with 20th Century Fox and ``Saving Private 
Ryan'' with DreamWorks SKG. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's video and theme parks unit posted a $19.3 million  
operating profit, reversing a loss, on Blockbuster's yearlong 
revival. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishing operating profits rose 28 percent. Viacom sold most  
of the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house but retained its consumer 
business, which released best-sellers by Stephen King and Mary 
Higgins Clark during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major dark spot in the report was that the UPN  
broadcast network, which Viacom owns with Chris-Craft Industries 
Inc., continued to lose money. The company didn't disclose the 
specific figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Viacom announced a 2-for-1 stock split and said  
trading of its shares will move to the New York Stock Exchange from 
the Amex on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Viacom lost $122.4 million, or 42 cents per share,  
reversing a profit of $793.6 million, or $2.07 per share, in 1997. 
The loss was due to second-quarter charges to cover revenue-sharing 
pacts with Hollywood studios, which have fueled the video chain's 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $12.10 billion from $10.68 billion.

<HEADLINE> Radio Shock Jock 'Greaseman' Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A shock jock who made light of a grisly racial  
killing lost his job Thursday, a relatively rare case of radio 
shock deemed simply too shocking. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's Doug ``Greaseman'' Tracht was suspended by station  
WARW Wednesday after he played a portion of a song by Grammy 
award-winning singer Lauryn Hill and remarked, ``No wonder people 
drag them behind trucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comment linked Hill, who is black, to the dragging death in  
Texas of a black man, James Byrd Jr. A white supremacist was 
sentenced to death Thursday in Byrd's killing. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the station announcing Tracht's firing Thursday  
apologized to listeners who were offended. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we will always strongly support the right of our on-air  
artists to express a wide range of opinions, even those that are 
unpopular or offensive to some, WARW cannot be associated with the 
trivialization of an unspeakable act of violence,'' the statement 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht deserved to be fired for a remark that ``was stupendously  
stupid and double-stupendously evil,'' said Michael Harrison, 
editor of Talkers Magazine, an industry monthly. 
</P>
<P>
	But if history is a guide, Tracht may be back on the air  
somewhere before too long. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Harrison estimates a shock jock gets the boot about  
once a year somewhere in the country, the genre and its 
practitioners endure. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the best-known recent example of a shock jock firing  
was Bob Grant's dismissal from WABC in 1996 after saying he was ``a 
pessimist'' for believing that Commerce Secretary Ron Brown had 
survived a plane crash. Brown, who was black, died in the crash 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, who in the past had referred to blacks as ``savages,'' is  
back on the air at a rival New York station. 
</P>
<P>
	Other radio hosts regularly get in hot water with listeners,  
including the widely syndicated Howard Stern and Don Imus. 
</P>
<P>
	Stations choose the format knowing the hosts will probably  
offend people, but will also attract listeners that matter to 
advertisers -- notably young men. 
</P>
<P>
	``This goes with the territory,'' said Robert Lichter, president  
of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan study 
group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of broadcast depends on being shocking and  
disgusting and occasionally will hit a nerve at the wrong time and 
somebody will get suspended or fired,'' Lichter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then things will go back like they were.''  
</P>
<P>
	Short of an individual broadcaster's decision to suspend or fire  
a host, there is little punishment for radio raunchiness. The 
Federal Communications Commission regulates indecency to a point, 
but free speech rights generally protect tastelessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht's remark did not violate FCC standards of decency, a  
spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's guidelines expressly state that free speech  
protects ``programming that stereotypes or otherwise offends people 
with regard to their religion, race, national background, gender or 
other characteristic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the largest settlement of its kind, Stern's bosses at  
Infinity Broadcasting Corp. agreed in 1995 to pay the federal 
government $1.7 million to resolve more than 100 claims of 
indecency on his show. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht, who delivers grossout jokes and sexual titillation in a  
distinctive, high-pitched baby talk, has been a fixture on 
Washington radio for nearly two decades. He has also been 
syndicated. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been in trouble before. In 1986, while on another  
station, Tracht was talking about the Martin Luther King holiday 
and said: ``Kill four more and we can take a whole week off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The station got bomb threats, but Tracht kept his job.

<HEADLINE> Reader's Digest Plans New Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With circulation at its flagship magazine  
declining, Reader's Digest Association Inc. wants to lend its name 
to credit cards, insurance policies and other new products. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Thomas Ryder said Thursday the company plans to  
launch a range of non-publishing products -- focusing first on 
financial services and health -- as it continues efforts to revive 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other media companies, Reader's Digest is also boosting its  
presence online, investing $100 million to upgrade its current Web 
sites, buy other sites or create new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are talking about is a giant conceptual step,'' Ryder  
said in an interview after presenting his expansion plans to 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The news pushed Reader's Digest stock up 56 1/4 cents to $31.12 1/2  
per share in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryder has been overhauling the company since taking over last  
April, slashing costs and seeking ways to attract younger customers 
as the mostly older circulation base of its flagship magazine has 
been declining. 
</P>
<P>
	Reader's Digest is still the most widely read consumer magazine,  
but circulation fell to nearly 13.8 million at the end of last 
year, down from 15 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	With its latest plan, the company now seeks to entice readers  
over 50 to buy other products with the Reader's Digest brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will explore partnerships with financial  
services firms to introduce credit cards, insurance and other 
financial products. It hopes to reach agreements by June. 
</P>
<P>
	Reader's Digest also is thinking of taking advantage of its  
experience in direct marketing to sell pharmaceuticals and 
vitamins, and is in discussions with several unnamed partners. In 
addition, the company wants to expand its health-related magazine 
and book publishing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Reader's Digest had revenue of $2.6 billion in its last fiscal  
year, which ended in June 1998. Ryder said that about 80 percent of 
that amount came from publishing, which he said defined as 
magazines, books, catalogs and videos. Ryder estimated the 
expansion plan will double the company's revenue by 2004, with 
about 50 percent to 60 percent coming from publishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryder's announcement extends his aggressive push to turn around  
the company since arriving from American Express Co.'s publishing 
business. His efforts have included cutting back on sweepstakes 
pitches and selling parts of the company's valuable art collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits have begun to recover since Ryder came aboard. Reader's  
Digest struggled for years because of its failure to attract new 
customers for the records, videos and books sold through its huge 
marketing database. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the company bought Good Catalog Co., which publishes  
nine catalogs selling health and fitness, home furnishing, 
gardening and other products. Ryder said the company will also seek 
to expand the catalog business.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Cuts Most U.S. Phone Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Telephone service between Cuba and the United  
States was cut early today because of lack of payment by American 
companies to Cuba's phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	The American firms have been withholding funds since December  
pending a federal court case against the communist nation involving 
relatives of four Cuban-Americans whose two unarmed aircraft were 
shot down by MiG jets north of the island in February 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Service was cut off just after midnight. Cellular telephone  
service was also interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers attempting to reach the United States instead got a  
recorded message saying that lines were congested and asking them 
to call back later. 
</P>
<P>
	Some calls did get through after the deadline passed, apparently  
because they were rerouted through third countries or onto Sprint 
telephone service, which was not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, some delays or disruptions were expected to  
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Foreign Ministry announced last week that it supported  
the decision by Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A., known 
as ETECSA, to cut service to the American phone companies AT&AMP;T, 
MCI, LDDS, IDB and YWILTEL. 
</P>
<P>
	Service to Sprint and TLDI of Puerto Rico was maintained because  
both have continued to pay their bills, the government said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a federal judge in Miami awarded a $187 million  
judgment to the relatives of the Cubans who were shot down. Since 
then, they have tried unsuccessfully to collect the money from the 
Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	They were spurned in an effort to recover the funds from Cuban  
assets frozen in the United States. They then sought to tap into 
the money being paid to ETECSA by the U.S. telephone companies for 
long-distance calls from the United States to Cuba. That amounted 
to an estimated $60 million to $70 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has opposed the families' case.  
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Foley said this week that the  
telecommunications payments cannot be seized because the Cuban 
telephone company is a separate entity from the government and is 
not legally responsible for the debts of the two defendants in the 
case -- the Republic of Cuba and the Cuban Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The families' request to garnish the telephone payments is being  
considered by U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King. The 
judge said he would rule after Friday, the deadline for attorneys 
to file additional motions.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Slightly Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Friday after the  
release of a Japanese government report showing better-than 
expected industrial output. Tokyo share prices slipped in light 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.26 yen in late morning, down 1.36 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its level of 119.63 yen in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average shed 22.33 points, or 0.15 percent, to  
14,448.22 points at the end of the morning session. On Thursday, 
the index closed up 115 points, or 0.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar retreated against the yen after  
Japanese trust banks and institutional investors bought yen as they 
adjusted positions ahead of the end of the month, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen also got support after the Ministry of International  
Trade and Industry released data showing that Japan's industrial 
output rose by 0.8 percent in January from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry said industrial output is beginning to stabilize,  
and it forecast rises for February and March of 0.7 percent and 0.4 
percent, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors were watching for comments from visiting  
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who is scheduled 
to meet with Japanese officials later Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.80 yen, down  
from 132.78 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices were slightly lower at midday  
Friday on higher U.S. bond yields and a drop earlier on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, the market remains supported at current  
levels on buying from foreign investors and continued hopes for 
government support for share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market won't drop that sharply,'' said Naoki Takahashi, a  
manager at the futures department of Marusan Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 33.33  
points to 9,366.34. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 0.21 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,124.34 
points. The TOPIX rose 3.84 points, or 0.34 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.925  
percent from Friday's finish of 1.915 percent, driving its price 
down to 99.01 yen from 99.09 yen.

<HEADLINE> Clark Misses Wife at Orioles Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Will Clark can be pardoned if his  
mind isn't completely on baseball this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has more things to worry about than merely driving the  
ball to the opposite field, fielding sharp grounders at first base 
or getting to know his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, who usually joins him for spring training, is home in  
Louisiana recovering from open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been kind of a rough offseason for me, so I was looking  
forward to getting on the field,'' Clark said Thursday after 
donning a Baltimore Orioles uniform for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Clark, 33, was experiencing chest pains and shortness of  
breath before a routine physical determined that she had a tiny 
hole in her heart. The subsequent three-hour operation went well, 
but she only recently left the hospital and is forbidden from 
driving or flying on a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	So Clark will go at it alone this month as he prepares for his  
14th major league season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a while before she's completely well. I  
really didn't know whether I could report on time,'' Clark said. 
``It was hard to prepare for (spring training) because your 
priorities, needless to say, are in other places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After spending several weeks thinking about little else but the  
health of his wife, Clark almost welcomed the idea of turning his 
focus to baseball. The task is easier because of his new 
environment -- after spending the past five seasons with the Texas 
Rangers, he now has the chance to work alongside players whom once 
were considered the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A change of scenery helps a lot of people,'' he said. ``To  
come here and look at Cal Ripken -- Mr. Baseball and a future Hall 
of Famer -- and to see guys like Harold Baines, Jesse Orosco ... I 
don't want to say I feel like a rookie again, but I'm eager to be 
one of the guys to fit into the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken is certain that Clark will make himself right at home in  
the clubhouse, and he welcomes his intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's someone who has a real passion for the sport, someone who  
wants to win and has a great deal of desire,'' Ripken said. ``The 
highest compliment you can pay anybody is that he's a gamer. He 
wants to be at the plate in the tough situations and seems to 
thrive on close ballgames. You have to respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next few weeks Clark hopes to immerse himself into  
becoming an integral part of the team. If nothing else, it will 
shift his thoughts from Lisa for at least a few hours each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very stressful the last few weeks,'' he said.  
``Being down here gives you something else to think about so you 
don't worry all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Ghanaian Leader Seek Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An East Room set aglow by opulent gold place  
settings and the richly colored fabrics worn by the Ghanaian 
delegation provided the backdrop as President Clinton promised to 
further his alliance with the African nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The state dinner tribute for Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings  
Wednesday night also gave Clinton a chance to show his appreciation 
for the warm reception he received when visiting Ghana last year. 
The first American president to visit that nation, Clinton said he 
still ``never tires'' of telling people he was greeted by a half 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
	That Ghana was the first stop on Clinton's tour of Africa was no  
accident, the president said in his toast to Rawlings. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``allowed us to highlight for all Americans the progress  
Africa has made and the promise of our future together,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings echoed the sentiments in his own toast, but stressed  
that the future of this partnership would also hinge on such issues 
as trade and regional stability. 
</P>
<P>
	He shared his conviction ``that Ghana can be secure and  
prosperous only when Africa is secure and prosperous'' and called 
on the United States and the international community to act 
decisively in promoting stability in all African nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Conflicts in some African regions warrant the kind of  
international concern and involvement shown to problems in Kosovo, 
the Balkans and the Middle East, Rawlings said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was in town meeting with  
congressional leaders on such issues as U.S. arrears to the United 
Nations, attended the dinner. Annan also used his Washington visit 
to speak with leaders about the need for more international 
peacekeeping in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very pleased with the discussions,'' Annan said Wednesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	During the visit, the president also lent his support for a  
proposal by the Ghanaian parliament to extend dual citizenship to 
black American descendants of African slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ghana does this, it certainly won't hurt in trying to get  
more Americans interested in Ghana, going to Ghana and contributing 
to Ghana's future,'' said Clinton, at a news conference earlier in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``My continent is the mother not of all continents, but humanity  
today,'' Rawlings said. ``There is no reason why I would deny my 
fellow black African the right to enjoy the same citizenship that I 
enjoy as an African.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 200 state dinner guests celebrated the growing  
alliance between the two nations and their respective leaders. Poet 
Maya Angelou called the tribute ``fitting'' for ``two young men 
that have great hope for their countries. They both are 
courageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Taylor, editor-in-chief of Essence Magazine, said she  
considers Ghana a second home and owns property there. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she would consider taking up the offer of dual  
citizenship, she responded: ``Absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the evening, White House chefs prepared an ice cream dessert  
flavored with mango and pineapple -- two of Ghana's favorite fruits 
-- and decorated with a traditional kente sash. Worn by noblemen and 
kings in Ghana and used for ceremonies, the kente cloth is also one 
of the most famous products from the hometown of Rawlings' wife -- 
Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of her official state gift, Ms. Agyeman-Rawlings  
presented Mrs. Clinton with three framed pieces of the Ghanaian 
cloth. Rawlings offered Clinton a symbol of authority -- an Ashanti 
stool -- as his official gift. 
</P>
<P>
	Contemporary jazz artist Najee got the audience moving to the  
rhythm in their seats, with his saxophone and flute performances 
after dinner but could not tempt Clinton into picking up saxophone 
as well. Guests dined on grilled yellow tail snapper and marinated 
duck on tables covered with deep green-colored damask tablecloths.

<HEADLINE> Explanation Offered in Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot may have been fooled by  
the terrain when he flew his jet into the cable of an Italian ski 
gondola, killing 20 people, a defense witness testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Cmdr. Fred Patterson, an expert on visual phenomena, said  
Capt. Richard Ashby may have used a horizontal line formed by rocks 
and buildings as a reference point, and that could have made him 
think he was flying higher than he was. Ashby is scheduled to 
testify Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the open valley would have limited the  
peripheral-vision cues that might have told Ashby if he was going 
too fast, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was  
flying the EA-6B Prowler too low and too fast when it hit the cable 
about 370 feet above the ground last February. He is charged with 
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and other charges and could 
get more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contend the government-issue map Ashby used  
did not show the Mount Cermis ski lift near Cavalese, Italy; the 
jet's altimeter malfunctioned; and an optical illusion made Ashby 
think he was flying higher than he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said when Ashby entered the valley where the ski lift  
was located, mountains blocked the real horizon, so he may have 
focused on a horizontal line formed by white rocks and buildings at 
the end of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a sped-up video of the valley shot during a helicopter  
flight after the accident, Patterson said the false horizon could 
draw a pilot lower and cause him to fly straight through the ski 
lift cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said if the EA-6B Prowler were equipped with what he  
called a ``heads-up display,'' which beams the true horizon 
somewhere in the cockpit, Ashby would not have been drawn to the 
line made by the rocks. Marine Prowlers do not have the displays, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, a prosecutor said the Marine Corps  
requires aircraft lacking the display to maintain 1,000 feet of 
altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Mershon, a human perception expert from North Carolina  
State University, testified that eyewitness accounts about the 
jet's low flying in the moments before it hit the cable are liable 
to be inaccurate. He said few people can judge the distance of 
objects in the sky with any accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will tend to perceive the distance as closer than it  
should be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Loftus, a University of Washington psychology  
professor and expert on suggestibility, testified that Italian 
media coverage might have altered eyewitness recollections. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses were not interviewed until weeks after the  
tragedy and by then the media's ``biased discussion ... about 
retaliation would have caused some witnesses to say things were 
lower, faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., faces a separate trial on similar charges in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were dismissed against the two backseat crewmen.

<HEADLINE> Palmer To Cut Back on Senior Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Arnold Palmer, bothered by the way he is  
playing, said Thursday he is planning to cut back on his Senior PGA 
Tour tournament schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who will turn 70 in September, is playing in this week's  
ACE Group Classic at the Bay Colony Golf and Country Club and has 
played in a minimum of 12 Senior PGA tournaments every year since 
1983. But he said that will likely end this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played last week (at the GTE Classic), I'm playing this week  
... and that could be it probably for a long time,'' Palmer said. 
``If my golf game continues to be as poor as it is, I won't play at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is committed to the PGA Tour's Bay Hill Invitational in  
Orlando next month and his 45th consecutive Masters Tournament in 
April. After that, he is uncertain about when he will play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, whose last official victory on the Senior Tour came at  
the 1988 Crestar Classic, said he may skip the PGA Seniors 
Championship in April. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision to limit his Senior Tour schedule has nothing to do  
with his health. Palmer said he has fully recovered from prostate 
cancer surgery in January of 1997 and has no other serious 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing making him sick these days is his iron play. At  
the GTE Classic in Tampa last week, Palmer shot 76-77-76 
(16-over-par) to finish 70th out of 76 golfers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing in Naples because my sister lives here and I'm  
doing a golf course here,'' he said. ``But I'm not happy with my 
game. My iron play is atrocious and it has not been good for a long 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Padres' Hoffman Sets Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- San Diego Padres closer Trevor Hoffman has  
set the end of spring training as a deadline for signing a contract 
extension with the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball is 100 percent in their court,'' agent Rick Thurman  
said Thursday. ``He doesn't want to take it into the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Padres general manager Kevin Towers declined to comment on  
whether the club is preparing a new offer, but had lots of praise 
for the 31-year-old right-hander just days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish you could take the Trevor Hoffman mold and make more  
like him. He's just a very genuine guy,'' Towers said. ``I think 
what makes him special is he cares so much about other people, his 
teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman converted 53 of 54 saves last season, the best  
percentage (.981) in baseball history, and finished second in the 
Cy Young voting to Atlanta's Tom Glavine. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurman, who will be in Phoenix for the weekend, said he doesn't  
think Hoffman is expecting much from the Padres. Hoffman, who will 
make $4.1 million this season, is believed to be seeking a 
four-year, $30 million extension with a no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres last offered $24 million for four years before talks  
broke down in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been dragging their feet for a long time now,''  
Thurman said. ``Every day that goes by, the mark continues to 
rise.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Tripp Attorney Won't Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- One of Linda Tripp's former attorneys  
does not have to appear before a grand jury hearing evidence about 
her secret tapes of Monica Lewinsky, a judge has decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys said the decision could derail a state investigation  
of Mrs. Tripp, who prosecutors say may have violated wiretapping 
laws by taping her conversations with the former White House 
intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard County Circuit Judge James Dudley ruled Thursday on  
behalf of attorney Jim Moody, who appeared before the grand jury 
last December and declined to answer virtually all questions about 
Mrs. Tripp's recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody also refused a prosecutor's request to hand over any tapes  
featuring Ms. Lewinsky's voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody was Mrs. Tripp's attorney in January 1998, when she told  
independent counsel Kenneth Starr about an affair between Clinton 
and Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury is investigating whether Mrs. Tripp broke state  
law in 1997 when she recorded phone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky 
about her affair with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes have been widely distributed, but Mrs. Tripp received  
federal immunity for her testimony. Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli 
must establish independently that Mrs. Tripp made the tapes and 
knew that taping Ms. Lewinsky without her knowledge was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody called Montanarelli's requests a violation of  
attorney-client privilege. He said Montanarelli's order ``utterly 
destroys'' the attorney-client relationship ``if lawyers can be 
turned into the key witness against their client.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montanarelli did not return telephone messages seeking comment  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said Moody's knowledge of the tapes ``is essential to the  
state's burden to prove that (Mrs.) Tripp illegally taped Monica 
Lewinsky.''

<HEADLINE> Giant Gives Up Switch Hitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The last time J.T. Snow hit  
right-handed, he was recovering from shoulder surgery and checking 
out his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't intend to hit on the right side of the plate again.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco Giants first baseman is giving up on  
switch-hitting, hoping to earn more time in the lineup. From now 
on, even in batting practice, Snow plans to be a full-time lefty. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I do well enough that I'm playing every day, it will be  
really satisfying,''' he said. ``If not, I'm not going to get 
discouraged, I'll just keep working on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow, a four-time Gold Glove winner, agreed to the change in  
part because of concerns he could lose more playing time to Charlie 
Hayes. Snow will face left-handers as a lefty, something he tried 
last September because of a shoulder injury. He went 1-for-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants manager Dusty Baker plans to give Snow a chance to  
develop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just play it as if he's a left-handed hitter,'' Baker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes, for his part, was nonchalant.  
</P>
<P>
	``I played a lot more last year than I ever thought I'd play,''  
he said. ``I don't know how much I'm going to play this year, but I 
don't worry about it. If (J.T.) is capable of playing every day, 
that will help our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder in  
December. He tried a few right-handed swings during his 
rehabilitation, but has been concentrating in the offseason on 
batting lefty. He worked out this summer at Chapman University in 
Southern California with his brother-in-law, the baseball coach 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt good,'' he said. ``It's like anything -- the more you  
see, the more comfortable you're going to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Snow hit just .159 in 69 at-bats from the right  
side. Overall, he fared better, hitting .248 in 137 games with 79 
RBIs and 15 home runs. He won his fourth consecutive Gold Glove. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was a year filled with stress for Snow, whose mother,  
Merry Carole Snow, died last June, while he was dealing with the 
nagging shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough to go through,'' he said. ``I wouldn't wish that  
on anybody. But as they say, time heals all wounds. This year is a 
new year and I'm ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow, one of the Giants' most popular players, came to San  
Francisco from Anaheim in 1997 when he was traded for pitchers 
Allen Watson and Fausto Macey. 
</P>
<P>
	He got off to a rocky start. During his first spring training  
with the Giants, he was beaned in the left eye by Randy Johnson. 
Snow recovered in time for opening day and went on to hit a 
career-high 28 home runs with 104 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Johnson has moved from Seattle to the Arizona Diamondbacks,  
in the same division as the Giants. Snow isn't worried about the 
possibility of facing the 6-foot-10 lefty more often. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Dusty has me in there -- I'm in there,'' he said. ``I want  
to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow, who will be a free agent at the end of the season,  
admitted it won't be easy to stand up against Johnson -- or any of 
the other left-handed pitchers. Like any new endeavor, he expects 
his ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the best left-handed batters struggle against the best  
left-handed pitchers,'' he said. ``So I'm not going to be 
ashamed.''

<HEADLINE> Sheriff Waves Anti-Abortion Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A sheriff who called an abortion doctor  
a ``baby killer'' is hearing more complaints, this time for 
displaying an anti-abortion sign during a parade celebrating Thomas 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee County Sheriff John McDougall put a red-and-white sign  
denouncing abortion in his car at Saturday's annual Edison Festival 
of Light parade. Since then, he's refused to promise parade 
organizers he won't do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a right to free speech,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lee County's sheriff traditionally rides in the parade, and all  
participants are given rules banning political statements, said 
Bill Valenti, president of the festival. It is the biggest annual 
celebration in Fort Myers, where the inventor kept a winter home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not what he said, but that he said something political,''  
Valenti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said that if organizers say he can't ride in the  
parade with his sign, he'll carry it alongside the procession. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a doctor who wrote to McDougall for help against  
anti-abortion demonstrators was branded a ``baby killer'' and told 
that officers would ``do everything within our power to assist the 
protesters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in 1997, McDougall caused an uproar by warning visitors to  
stay away from Florida because the release of a batch of violent 
felons made the state dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Braves Ligtenberg Ready for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Kerry Ligtenberg never wants to forget  
that desperate feeling of pitching in the Prairie League. 
</P>
<P>
	He always wants to remember his father's pleas to forget about  
baseball and get on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	There will always be a place in Ligtenberg's psyche for the time  
he was traded for bats and balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was as far away (from the major leagues) as I could  
get,'' said Ligtenberg, the Atlanta Braves closer who last year 
became the first rookie in a dozen years to save 30 games. ``It's 
just a good check for me to realize that if I don't keep working 
hard, somebody is going to take my job and I could be back there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, it seems highly unlikely. Ligtenberg may have  
been the most valuable Braves player in 1998, assuming the leading 
role in the bullpen when Mark Wohlers fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three years removed from the Southern Minny Stars,  
Ligtenberg assumed the job for good in July and saved 23 games in 
25 chances, compiling a 1.25 ERA over his final 35 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	His forte was pinpoint control and a surprisingly dominating  
repertoire of pitches: fastball, slider and splitter. After issuing 
11 walks in his first 12 innings, Ligtenberg walked only 13 batters 
in the final 61 innings. He also had 79 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see a lot of determination out there,'' pitching coach  
Leo Mazzone said. ``I don't know whether it's his background or if 
that's just Kerry, but it's very obvious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg wasn't drafted after finishing his college career at  
Minnesota, one credit short of a degree in chemical engineering. 
His father urged him to finish college, but the son wasn't ready to 
walk away from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Prairie League, and the rest of the story is  
well documented: The Minny Stars were managed by former Braves 
catcher Greg Olson, who was so impressed that he recommended 
Ligtenberg to his old team, who showed their appreciation by 
shipping Olson two dozens bats and six dozen baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to actually think that I was back there a  
couple of years ago,'' Ligtenberg said. ``That was about as far 
away (from the majors) as I could get. It's just a good check for 
me to realize that if I don't keep working hard, somebody is going 
to take my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once he signed with the Braves in 1996, Ligtenberg wasted no  
time reaching the major leagues. He started out in Class A, but was 
pitching in Atlanta by the final month of the '97 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's traveled fast,'' said manager Bobby Cox, who was reminded  
that Ligtenberg was hardly an overnight sensation. ``Well, he was 
in slow gear for a long time, but it's really been fast ever 
since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg takes nothing for granted, even refusing to admit  
that he's the closer though it's been obvious from day one of 
spring training with Wohlers still struggling to find his control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured last year was my do-or-die season. Either I was  
going to be up here the whole year or I was going to be gone and 
never get another chance. I just came in and worked my butt off and 
did well,'' Ligtenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, I did the same thing, knowing I need to have  
another good season and basically prove last year wasn't a fluke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, he worked even harder that usual on his  
conditioning program, mindful of the tired arm he felt at the end 
of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Unaccustomed to the 162-game season and grueling playoffs,  
Ligtenberg gave up a game-losing homer to San Diego's Ken Caminiti 
in Game 1 of the NL championship series, plus a two-run homer to 
Greg Myers in the ninth inning of Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I want him to do different is tell me when he  
needs a day off,'' Mazzone said. ``He would take the ball every day 
if we let him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg did make one concession to his new status as the  
Braves' closer. He married his girlfriend of 10 years, Sara, in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, when you're playing in the independent leagues, the  
kind of path I took, we were not where we wanted to be financially 
because I wasn't making a lot of money,'' he said. ``But everything 
worked out.''

<HEADLINE> Trade Center Bombers Back in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The first four Islamic militants convicted in  
the World Trade Center bombing are back in court, arguing for a new 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack six years ago today brought terrorism home to the  
American public like nothing before. The blast killed six people 
and injured hundreds of others as it left a huge crater beneath the 
110-story towers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then -- and since the Oklahoma City blast two years later --  
there is not only increased scrutiny within the nation's borders 
but a push by the government to crack down on terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men arrested soon after the bombing -- and a fourth  
seized in Egypt -- argue that new evidence should mean a new trial. 
In the first week of hearings, they largely challenged forensic 
evidence from their six-month trial that ended with a conspiracy 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	They attacked the credibility of the FBI laboratory in  
Washington, saying investigators were pressured to slant their 
findings. They presented a 500-page Justice Department study 
scathingly critical of the lab work on both the Trade Center 
bombing and that in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy plans to resentence the four,  
possibly next week, as required by a federal appeals court which 
concluded that the men were not represented by lawyers when each 
was sentenced to 240 years in prison in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	For prosecutors, more important than the initial four suspects  
was Ramzi Yousef, who was arrested in Pakistan in 1995 in response 
to a $2 million reward. He is considered the mastermind of the 
attack and his links to other accused terrorists have given a 
picture of a pattern of cooperation among Islamic radicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Yousef was sentenced to 240 years in prison for the  
bombing. Duffy called him an ``apostle of evil'' just after Yousef 
announced, ``Yes, I am a terrorist and am proud of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who the United States says was  
behind explosions Aug. 7 that killed hundreds at two U.S. embassies 
in Africa, had loose links to Yousef and to Sheik Omar Abdel 
Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric convicted of conspiring to blow 
up New York landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two major terrorism trials in federal court in  
Manhattan have involved defendants brought to the United States 
from the Middle East. The next one may include more than a dozen 
men accused in the embassy attacks.

<HEADLINE> Thome Says Indians' Need Intensity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- If the Cleveland Indians need a leader  
to keep them from the mid-season doldrums this year, Jim Thome 
would be happy to fill the role. As long as he doesn't have to talk 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be a leader, but I'm not really a guy who talks a  
lot,'' Thome said. ``If my performance does it, fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But like many others in the Indians organization, Thome thinks  
the Tribe needs to play with more intensity this year if it wants 
to make its third trip to the World Series in the last six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland coasted to its fourth straight AL Central title in  
1998, despite going 39-38 after the All-Star break. The Indians 
then lost the AL championship to a New York Yankees team that won 
125 games and never seemed to let up. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome's making the need for intensity known now, and hoping to  
lead by example later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to get back to the World Series, and to do it we  
will have to get past the Yankees,'' Thome said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do that, we've got to get to the point where we play at the  
same level all season. We've got to stay away from those long 
stretches where we don't play well fundamentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome said that even the AL Central can be a challenge if the  
Indians don't play well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teams in our division are very good,'' he said. ``By no  
means can we be lackadaisical and expect them to hand us anything. 
For us to think we are going to run away from everyone, that's not 
realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome is one of the players Cleveland can count on to give his  
best effort every time he's on the field. The first baseman is in 
his seventh year in the big leagues and has been a consistent 
producer for Cleveland at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	He's coming off a decent 1998 season that could have been great,  
if he had not missed six weeks with a broken hand. In 123 games, 
Thome hit .293, with 30 home runs and 85 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that makes him so valuable,'' manager Mike  
Hargrove said, ``is that you look at his track record, and you can 
just about count on him to produce those kinds of numbers year in, 
year out. That's the kind player Jimmy is. And those are types of 
guys you build your club around.''

<HEADLINE> Around Alone Leader Loses His Mast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A French sailor who suggested that a competitor could have  
benefited from rescuing another solo racer last week nearly needed 
to be saved himself Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Thiercelin of France was leading on the third leg of the  
27,000-mile Around Alone yacht race when he lost his mast in 
roiling south Atlantic seas 180 miles west of the Falkland Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard a loud crack and the mast snapped in two,'' he told  
France's RTL radio. ``The top of the mast fell just next to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian racer Giovanni Soldini at first changed course to come  
to Thiercelin's aid, but race director Mark Schrader's request for 
a rescue was rescinded later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin averted any danger of sinking by sawing away the  
toppled mast and its snarled rigging. 
</P>
<P>
	By late Thursday, Thiercelin was heading to Port Stanley in the  
Falklands, but it was not clear if he had jury-rigged a sail or if 
he was simply being propelled by a fierce storm that was moving in. 
Soldini, 80 miles behind, was heading for Punta del Este, Uruguay, 
the finish point for the third leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather forecasters said the sailors were facing their worst  
storm yet -- a malestrom even more intense than the one that struck 
the Sydney-to-Hobart race in December, killing six sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Van Liew of Santa Monica, Calif. -- the sailor said to be in  
the worst position for the storm -- reported 80 mph gusts late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin drew intense criticism last week for not going to  
rescue fellow sailor Isabelle Autissier, who was trapped in her 
overturned boat for 24 hours. Soldini went instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin was actually closer, 120 miles away to Soldini's 200  
miles, but claimed he had problems with his boom that would not 
allow him to move quickly upwind. That earned him the condemnation 
of sailors worldwide, who noted that he managed to build up a 
400-mile lead during the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Making things worse, Thiercelin later told French media that  
Autissier -- one of the world's most respected sailors -- should 
``keep her mouth shut'' and not help Soldini now that she was on 
his boat. He even suggested that Soldini detour and drop Autissier 
off in Tierra del Fuego, a plan Soldini rejected because he felt it 
would cost too much time. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin had an 18-hour lead over Soldini when the fleet left  
Auckland, New Zealand, on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini's Feb. 16 rescue of Autissier was nothing short of  
astonishing. Braving 30-foot seas, he arrived at 2 a.m. in the inky 
darkness, began a search, and finally found her 60-foot yacht 
bobbing upside down. Soldini tossed a hammer at the hull, and a 
grateful Autissier popped out of a waterproof hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Having two sailors on board has occurred three times in the  
race's history and the rules are clear ---- the rescued racer cannot 
in any way help sail the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am clearly out of the race, and Gio chooses his tactics,  
makes sail changes when he wants to and goes where he feels like 
it, alone,'' Autissier said after her rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of Thiercelin overwhelmed the Around Alone Web site,  
forcing its operators to declare that no new messages on the 
subject would be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of complaining that Isabelle might be `helping' the  
man who saved her life, Thiercelin himself has a lot of explaining 
to do!'' wrote Raymond Koch, a retired Navy officer from Arlington, 
Va. ``As for the French press, and anyone else supporting 
Thiercelin's views, I'd say to them that they are not worthy of 
emptying Giovanni Soldini's slop bucket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even other solo sailors -- who seldom criticize their own -- were  
surprised, including Josh Hall. He had been racing in the same 
60-foot class as Thiercelin, Soldini and Autissier until his mast 
snapped earlier this leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pathetic. I don't know what's the matter with  
Thiercelin,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who was rescued by a competitor in the same race in 1994,  
says that Autissier would be more of a distraction than a 
competitive advantage to Soldini. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it messes them up more than it helps,'' he said,  
referring to the structured routines solo sailors develop to cope 
with the enormous strain of guiding their craft through some of the 
world's most dangerous stretches of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini will be awarded extra time to compensate for his rescue,  
an amount to be determined by a race jury in Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-leg race began in Charleston, S.C., in September and  
the first yachts are expected to arrive back there in May.

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Arena Set for Demolition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- No one knows better than Fred Corsi how much of  
a dump the Arena was in its final years of operation. He was the 
guy in charge of making the place halfway presentable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hard place, operationally, to work in,'' Corsi said.  
``Every time it got cold, we'd have a water pipe break. The oil 
heaters didn't work a lot of the time, the sump pumps backed up all 
the time, the drains backed up. Everything was pretty dated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corsi, director of operations at the Arena for 5 1/2 years and now  
with the new Kiel Center, can go on and on. He remembers rain and 
snow pouring into the building from the loading docks, the cramped 
locker rooms and the booming rat business for two resident tom 
cats. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, now that the place is about to exit the St. Louis  
landscape, even Corsi gets a little misty-eyed. The 70-year-old 
Arena is scheduled to be imploded on Saturday, and he's not sure he 
can bear to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sad to see it go,'' Corsi said. ``It had a charm to it,  
and now that it's going away I remember that a little bit more than 
all the problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arena, once home to the NHL's St. Louis Blues, two NCAA  
Final Fours, rock concerts and the annual Illinois-Missouri 
basketball game, has been empty since 1995 as business interests 
and preservationists wrestled to take command of its future. It had 
been mentioned as the site of a museum or aquarium, but proposals 
in that vein always seemed to lack financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the city sold the 26-acre site for $9 million to a  
company that plans an office park. Mayor Clarence Harmon hopes the 
2,000 to 4,000 jobs that could be generated will compensate those 
outraged that the landmark is being flattened. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who played in the Arena, the reaction is more sadness  
than outrage. Brett Hull, who reached 50 goals in 50 games in the 
early '90s at the Arena, said that was his favorite place to play, 
even though he has moved on from the Blues to the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Federko, the Blues' career leading scorer, has nothing  
but fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old Chicago Stadium and the Boston Garden were awesome,  
but there was nothing like our building,'' said Federko, now a 
radio analyst for the Blues. ``I think that's why it was so much 
fun to play there all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see it knocked down. Progress, I guess. We have the  
suites and everything here, but it's going to be a shame to see it 
go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memories came flooding back last weekend when the Blues'  
``Monday Night Miracle'' game, their comeback from a 5-2 
third-period deficit to beat Calgary in the 1986 playoffs was aired 
on a classic sports channel. Fans were closer to the action than in 
modern buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how you can hear the noise, even on TV,'' Federko  
said. ``You don't hear that kind of noise in the new buildings. 
It's unreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Calgary playoff game was the first in the NHL career of  
Cliff Ronning, a diminutive center who now plays for the Nashville 
Predators. He, too, mentioned the special setting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sound just echoed in that building,'' Ronning said. ``It  
was an upbeat, happy atmosphere. The boards made a big, big crash 
when you got hit into them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fortunate to be a baby Blue. That's where it all  
started for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a few days earlier this decade, the Arena appeared nowhere  
near the end of its days. Corsi's staff, using paint and curtains 
judiciously, made it a showplace once again for the 1992 NCAA 
Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, it's no job at all to make the $135 million Kiel  
Center, built in 1994 and home of the Blues, Saint Louis University 
basketball and the Ambush professional soccer team, look good. 
Events are preceded by the announcement: ``Welcome to Kiel Center, 
setting the standard in sports and entertainment ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Operationally and practically, this building is so superior  
it's unfair to try to compare anything,'' Corsi said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he can empathize with those who are fighting the demolition  
to the last. He was born and raised in Cleveland and witnessed old 
Municipal Stadium's date with the wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The infrastructure was just in terrible shape, concrete  
heaving all over the place, and the toilets, you might as well go 
to a cattle trough,'' Corsi said. ``You knew the place had to go 
down, but sentimentally it was very, very difficult to watch it go 
away.''

<HEADLINE> Grammy Ratings Slightly Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly 25 million people tuned in to watch  
hip-hop star Lauryn Hill, Madonna and the ``Titanic'' song, ``My 
Heart Will Go On,'' become big winners on CBS's Grammys telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's 16.6 rating and 26 audience share represented a  
slight dip from the 1998 Grammy show, which delivered a 17.0 rating 
and 27 share for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Wednesday night's telecast was the second most-watched  
Grammy Awards since 1993. The Grammys hit a low of 17 million 
viewers in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's long-awaited interview with Juanita Broaddrick, who  
accused President Clinton of sexually assaulting her 21 years ago, 
delivered a slight bump in the ratings for ``Dateline NBC'' despite 
the Grammy competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazine had a 9.7 rating and 15 share, airing opposite  
the first hour of the Grammys, according to Nielsen Media Research 
on Thursday. That was above the show's average for Wednesday nights 
of an 8.8 rating and 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.

<HEADLINE> Andro Still an Issue for McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	If Mark McGwire thought dealing with all the attention last year  
was tough, just wait. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that the redheaded slugger reported for work  
the other day looking tanned, rested and ready to pick up where he 
left off. He charmed a battery of cameras and microphones for an 
hour. His smile looked wide and his arms looked big. McGwire was 
frank and funny and confident by turns, sounding like a man who 
knows what he's up against. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news? There is still some uneasiness about how he got  
there. Reporters might be asking him about the use of ``andro'' 
still, except Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty decided five 
``andro'' questions were enough. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire knows that won't be the end of the matter. And so he  
should remember that best way to put a story behind him is tell the 
truth. He knows better than to keep saying somebody ``stuck their 
nose'' in his locker. That's not what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	What did happen, though, was this: McGwire publicly acknowledged  
taking androstenedione the day after a club official was asked for 
comment. But a day earlier, this was what that club official said: 
``Use the stuff? He didn't even know how to spell it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt McGwire knows how to spell androstenedione now. And as  
he rightly reminded everyone again, the supplement is not banned in 
his game, as it is by the NFL, NCAA and International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's legal. Major League Baseball is not the IOC,'' he said.  
``It has absolutely nothing to do with me hitting a baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he would continue using it, McGwire replied, ``It has  
something to do with me getting through the workouts during the 
season when you're worn down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fair enough. His health is certainly one of the bigger planets  
that are going to have to fall in perfect alignment again for 
McGwire to even get a shot at his old self -- a 50 home-run man -- 
let alone top it. But he defends it at his own risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The only danger of using ``andro'' is not that it will diminish  
McGwire's accomplishment. People know he hit 70 home runs fair and 
square. There is a very real danger that it could damage his 
health. It's already taken a little off the top of his standing as 
a role model. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime later this year, perhaps even during the season, a pair  
of Harvard researchers hired by baseball are expected to issue a 
report on ``andro.'' It will almost certainly give the matter a 
fresh set of legs. McGwire sounded ready for that, and more. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I did last year hadn't been done in 37 years,'' he said.  
``To break 70, I think you'd have to have 40 at the All-Star break, 
and I can't fathom the pressure, although nothing could be worse 
than what I had to deal with in September. That was more pressure 
than any athlete in any sport has ever faced. I said last year that 
I was in awe of myself, and I'm still in awe thinking of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the rest of us, he'd be wise to get over it -- and  
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure McGwire faced last season might have been exceeded  
only by the attention he got after it. He met the pope. He kissed 
Helen Hunt. He saw two people go eyeball-to-eyeball over his 66th 
home run ball on ``The People's Court.'' None of it seemed to have 
gone to his head. He did not hire bodyguards to walk around. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it's not going to be business as usual. McGwire has  
climbed into that rare air that few athletes ever sniff, the space 
that Michael Jordan just vacated. He is about to learn that it is 
tougher staying there than it was making his way up. 
</P>
<P>
	Somebody asked him to set the degree of difficulty. McGwire did  
not flinch. Instead, he threw out a number. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've set a standard of hitting 50,'' he said. ``Even  
with what I did last year, a standard of hitting 50 is still a very 
good number. I'm sure no matter what I do this year, if I don't 
reach 70 again, someone will say I had an off year.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel Backs Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation declaring deployment of a national  
missile defense system to be official U.S. policy is advancing in 
Congress, with bills now ready for floor action in both the House 
and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite Clinton administration objections, the bills are  
drawing considerable bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 50-3 margin, the House Armed Services Committee approved a  
bill Thursday that, while committing the administration to pursue 
such a system, sets no timetable. A Senate version could come up 
for a full vote by early March. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton included money in his fiscal 1999 budget for  
beginning to build such a system but has delayed until June 2000 a 
decision on whether to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am encouraged by the administration's announcement that an  
additional $6.6 billion has been identified for a national missile 
defense that might be deployed,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a 
sponsor of the House bill, ``but I am concerned that the 
administration has not committed to deploying this system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure by Weldon and Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., states  
simply: ``It is the policy of the United States to deploy a 
national missile defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a system, to protect against incoming nuclear missiles, has  
been a favored project of congressional Republicans since 
then-President Reagan proposed a space-based shield against 
incoming missiles in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's firing of a ballistic missile by North Korea, and  
reports that Iran is developing a missile program, has drawn a lot 
of Democratic support to the program as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee vote ``represents an important step in the debate  
over defending the American people against the threat of ballistic 
missile attack,'' the committee chairman, Floyd D. Spence, R-S.C., 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence said the margin of the vote ``reflects the committee's  
strong bipartisan belief that all Americans deserve to be protected 
against the growing threat of ballistic missile attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voting against the measure were committee Democrats Wayne Evans  
of Illinois, Cynthia McKinney of Georgia and Tom Allen of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate version by Sens. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and Daniel  
Inouye, D-Hawaii, could be brought to a vote early next month. It 
declares as national policy to deploy an antimissile defense ``as 
soon as technologically possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though it would not compel Clinton to act, the  
administration has threatened to veto the Senate version. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee the legislation could undermine efforts by the 
United States to negotiate with Moscow changes in the 1972 
Antiballistic Missile Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	That treaty restricts both nations' abilities to build missile  
defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enactment of this legislation clearly would be interpreted by  
Russia that the United States is not interested in working toward a 
cooperative solution,'' she said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version thus far has not drawn a veto threat.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Mull Coaching Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- With a straight face, Del Harris said  
he was looking forward to coaching Dennis Rodman. Now, someone else 
will get the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	As the quirky Rodman took part in his first practice with the  
Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, executives Jerry West and Mitch 
Kupchak were announcing the firing of Harris following three road 
losses in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
	West said one of two assistants -- Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew --  
will succeed Harris for at least the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an organizational change; this is just not one person  
wanting to make a change,'' West said. ``The last two games have 
been something that has not been acceptable from our perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see your team perform against opponents that you feel like  
you should beat -- we just felt like there was a deterioration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West referred to a 117-113 overtime loss in Denver on Monday  
night, and a 93-83 loss at Vancouver on Tuesday night. Denver's 
victory was only its second in 10 games this season, and Vancouver 
had never beaten the Lakers in 12 previous games. 
</P>
<P>
	West said longtime assistant Bill Bertka will handle the head  
coaching duties tonight against the winless Los Angeles Clippers in 
Anaheim before a decision is made on Drew or Rambis, both former 
Lakers players. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman John Black said Wednesday night the team hoped to make  
a decision on a successor to Harris ``in the next 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considered one of the teams to beat in the NBA this season  
following the retirement of Michael Jordan and breakup of the 
Chicago Bulls, the Lakers bring a disappointing 6-6 record into 
tonight's game -- the first of two in as many nights against the 
Clippers and four games in the next five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, a member of championship teams with the Bulls the last  
three years and the NBA's leading rebounder the past seven seasons, 
said he expects to play his first game for the Lakers on Friday 
night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unfair to Del Harris,'' Rodman said of the firing.  
``He was in a no-win situation, unless the team won and got to the 
(NBA) Finals. This business is ruthless and it will tear your heart 
out. There is no security at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Harris: ``You don't realize what Dennis Rodman is going to  
bring to this team. He's going to rebound; he's going to set picks; 
he's going to pass the ball and get on those who don't. I was all 
armed and ready to go, I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he had not spoken to former Bulls coach Phil Jackson  
or anyone else about the coaching job because things happened so 
quickly, but felt confident Rambis or Drew ``will be the person 
that will be able to get us to where we want to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always difficult to talk about hypotheticals, but if that  
situation is presented, I know that Phil would look at that 
carefully,'' Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, said when asked if 
his client might be interested. 
</P>
<P>
	West pointed out the Lakers usually hire coaches from within the  
organization, and Harris said he hoped Rambis or Drew would get the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 61, was in his fifth season with the Lakers. He guided  
them to a 224-116 record and improved their regular-season record 
in four consecutive years, a feat accomplished by only eight other 
coaches in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like a loser today,'' he said. ``There will be  
other doors that will open for me. There always have been when 
other doors have closed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that star Shaquille O'Neal missed 22 games last  
season, the Lakers had a 61-21 regular-season record -- one of the 
best in the league. But they were swept by the Utah Jazz in the 
Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In Harris' three previous years, the Lakers won 48, 53 and 56  
games. They won 33 the year before he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team will mature,'' Harris said. ``It's already an  
outstanding team. Forget 6-6. This team is better than 6-6. I don't 
have any excuses to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a reasonable decision,'' Harris said of his  
firing, although he admitted he was disappointed he couldn't at 
least finish the season. ``I enjoyed being with this bunch. Whoever 
takes my place will not have failed if they don't win it this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, whose contract runs out after this season, has 556  
career victories to rank among the top 20 coaches in NBA history. 
He previously coached the Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	West said he spoke with team owner Jerry Buss early Wednesday  
about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just felt like the time was right now,'' West said. ``Right  
now, we look like we're floundering. That's not what the fans pay 
to see. We do feel like we have the talent here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he was ``very shocked'' to hear the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of unfortunate that a good guy like Del is blamed  
for our lack of cohesion, our lack of effort, our lack of energy,'' 
O'Neal said. ``However, one reason I came here is because of my 
faith in upper management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss Del, personally. The only thing I can do is  
wish him well. I'll always be a big fan of his because he taught me 
a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss issued a statement saying: ``I have enjoyed my relationship  
with Del. He is a true gentleman. I want to reiterate that I think 
he's done a truly outstanding job coaching the Lakers. While we 
feel that a coaching change is necessary at this time, I want to 
publicly thank Del for the many things he has accomplished with the 
Lakers and the steady improvement the team made under his 
direction.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Rebukes Clinton Critic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Clinton critic went too far when he tried to  
grill Linda Tripp's former stepmother about her divorce and other 
personal matters, a federal judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Larry Klayman promised not to question the woman about  
her personal or professional life, but did so anyway, U.S. District 
Judge Royce Lamberth wrote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth ordered Klayman to pay J. Lowe Davis' legal fees.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the first such setback for Klayman in his $90 million  
suit alleging Clinton administration mishandling of FBI files. 
Klayman has won court permission to question a host of current and 
former Clinton staffers, including Tripp herself. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition of Ms. Davis last June, Klayman and his  
conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, wanted to know where Ms. 
Davis learned that Tripp blamed her for the breakup with Tripp's 
father, the judge noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Klayman also asked about an incident in which Tripp allegedly  
vandalized her father's car because he wouldn't let her attend a 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Testimony on why Davis and her ex-husband were divorced and  
the story of Tripp allegedly vandalizing her father's car clearly 
involves private family matters,'' Lamberth wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Judicial Watch also asked several questions related to Ms.  
Davis' job as a newspaper editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp, a Pentagon secretary, recorded conversations with Monica  
Lewinsky about her young coworker's relationship with President 
Clinton. She turned the tapes over to Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, leading eventually to Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Klayman wanted to know more about the source of a New Yorker  
magazine article last year that said Tripp was arrested in 1969 but 
hid the arrest when she later applied for a Pentagon security 
clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judicial Watch was seeking to determine whether the  
information published by Jane Mayer of the New Yorker came from 
White House files, such as FBI files, or Ms. Davis,'' Klayman said 
Wednesday. ``Obviously if the information was accurate, it was more 
likely that it came from Ms. Davis. Judicial Watch inadvertently 
did not explain this well to the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klayman said he never intended to get into matters that were not  
already public, and said he will ask the judge to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Davis' lawyer, Robert Bernius, was out of town and did not  
respond to a request for comment.

<HEADLINE> Nixon Tape Tells of 1972 Burglary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Richard Nixon contemplated the unraveling  
Watergate affair that led to his resignation, he spoke of a 
lesser-known break-in of the Chilean Embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``That thing was part of the burglars' plan, as a cover,'' he  
told his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	His comment was recorded on a secret taping system in the White  
House and was among 54 minutes of recently declassified 
conversations released Thursday at the National Archives. They had 
been withheld from earlier releases for national security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when we get down, for example, to the break-in, the  
Chilean Embassy -- that thing was part of the burglars' plan, as a 
cover. Those (expletive) are trying to have a cover -- or a CIA 
cover. I think Dean concocted that,'' Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversation occurred May 16, 1973, on the eve of Senate  
hearings into the break-in at Democratic Party headquarters and the 
subsequent cover-up. White House Counsel John Dean was going to be 
a witness at the hearings, and the president and his lawyer, J. 
Fred Buzhardt Jr., were in the Oval Office discussing what Dean 
might disclose. 
</P>
<P>
	Buzhardt concurred with his boss. ``I think Dean concocted it,''  
he repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Thursday, Dean disputed Nixon's  
supposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't,'' Dean said. ``They're full of baloney. But at that  
point they had me concocting everything back to original sin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dean, who pleaded guilty in October 1973 to one count of  
conspiring to obstruct justice in the Watergate scandal and served 
three months in jail, said he has never heard that the White House 
was behind the May 13, 1972, burglary at the embassy. Files were 
rifled and official documents, books and radios were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean said he believes Nixon's talk of a ``cover'' is a reference  
to an attempt by lawyers for James McCord, one of the burglars 
arrested at the Watergate, to get his case dropped on grounds 
further investigation would reveal national security secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	McCord, a former CIA agent and security chief for the Committee  
to Re-Elect the President, was trying to get the government to stop 
investigating the Watergate break-in by saying the probe would lead 
to the revelation that there ``had been some sort of surveillance 
of the Chilean Embassy,'' Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy break-in occurred one day after Chile's socialist  
president, Salvador Allende, asked his country's legislature to 
nationalize the Chilean Telephone Co., which was largely owned by 
International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. ITT had opposed 
Allende's election in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	In other conversations:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Nixon talks in the Oval Office on July 2, 1971, with his  
assistant Peter Flanigan about giving ambassadorships to large 
contributors. They discuss making one GOP donor ambassador to 
Belgium. ``Understand, that's only if he gives a quarter-million,'' 
Nixon says. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nixon talks in the Oval Office on July 1, 1971, with domestic  
adviser John D. Ehrlichman, aide Charles Colson and chief of staff 
H.R. Haldeman about the ``Pentagon Papers'' -- a classified study of 
U.S. involvement in Vietnam prepared by the Defense Department and 
leaked to the press -- and what they said about the 1963 
assassination of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon blamed President Kennedy for Diem's death.  
</P>
<P>
	``Kennedy decided to go forward and got us involved and it shows  
that Kennedy was the one who got us in the damn war,'' Nixon said. 
``We got the Kennedys in this thing now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the tapes were opened to the public, the Nixon Library &AMP;  
Birthplace Foundation in Yorba Linda, Calif., for the first time 
provided transcripts of the conversations on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	John Taylor, executive director, said the library released the  
transcripts and commentary so the public could read them and 
compare them with the audio tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Except under court order, the archives never makes transcripts  
because there is no way to ensure the accuracy of the 
interpretation, said Karl Weissenbach, director of the Nixon 
project at the archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Transcripts are difficult to prepare because of background  
noise, people talking at once, the difficulty of identifying voices 
and the quality of the recordings, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Plunge for Third Day / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices plunged in frenzied trading  
Thursday, extending a steep selloff to a third straight day, as 
fresh signs of expansion in the U.S. economy worsened fears that 
the Fed will raise interest rates to keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 30-year bond rose to a new six-month high of  
5.65 percent from 5.51 percent Wednesday as its price, which moves 
in the opposite direction, dropped 2 1/32 points, or $20.31 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the highest yield for the 30-year bond yield, a benchmark  
for long-term interest rates, since August. Bonds with shorter 
maturities also were falling, but most of the damage was 
concentrated on the 30-year bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp drop in bonds on top of price declines of more than 1  
point on both Tuesday and Wednesday added pressure to the selling 
Thursday as traders sought either to lock in earlier profits or to 
limit losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate causes for concern among bond investors were fresh  
economic reports Thursday of surprising signs of strength 
throughout the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	New orders to factories surged 3.9 percent in January, the  
largest increase in 14 months, and sales of existing homes climbed 
to a record in the same month, the government reported. Separate 
private reports suggested continued strength in the labor market 
and optimism about prospects for expansion in the months ahead for 
both the manufacturing and construction industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports raised fresh challenges to forecasts that the long  
economic expansion was running out of steam. Instead, traders now 
fear the economy may be heating up too fast, which could lead to an 
interest rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan touched off a wave of  
bond selling over the previous two days with testimony before 
Congress in which he suggested that the central bank may have gone 
too far in cutting a key short-term rate three times late last 
year. The impression among traders is that the Fed is ready to 
raise rates quickly if the economy doesn't cool down. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates hurt the market for bonds and other investments  
paying a fixed rate of return by making bonds currently in 
circulation less attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Fed does not raise rates at its next meeting on  
March 30, Greenspan may want to talk up long-term rates in the bond 
market, said David M. Jones, chief economist for bond dealer Aubrey 
G. Lanston &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he wants to do is let market bond yields go to a level  
that will eventually slow growth,'' Jones said. ``He doesn't want 
to burst the balloon, he just wants to let some of the air out of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on long-term bonds hit historically low levels last fall  
as a combination of low U.S. inflation, a bumpy ride in the stock 
market and overseas financial turmoil sent many investors rushing 
to U.S. Treasury securities, a traditional haven for funds in 
uncertain times. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff in Treasury bonds this week may be an early sign  
that investors are more optimistic about prospects for overseas 
markets battered by the financial crisis, meaning less of a need to 
seek the safe haven of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were driven to artificially low levels of bond yields last  
fall, and with the global crisis settling down for now, some of the 
money is flowing back out of bonds as investor fears recede,'' 
Jones said. ``It's a view that the world isn't quite as dangerous 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down between 1/4 point and 1/2 point, and intermediate maturities 
were off 11/16 point to 1 5/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, was plunged 
10.33 points to 1,276.85 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.62 percent as the

<HEADLINE> Gore To Unveil Domestic Abuse Grant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, seeking to do more  
to protect women from domestic violence, is awarding $223 million 
in anti-abuse grants and asking the attorney general to investigate 
stalkers who prowl the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore scheduled a White House event today to  
announce grants. They are intended to help communities provide 
services to victims and foster collaboration between victims' 
advocates, prosecutors, police officers and judges in handling 
domestic abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was asking Attorney General Janet Reno to conduct a  
review of ``cyber stalking,'' develop strategies to combat the 
problem and report back in 90 days. Cyber stalking is persistent, 
unwanted harassment communicated over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is presenting us with cases we have never seen  
before,'' Gore said in a statement. ``And make no mistake -- this 
kind of harassment can be as frightening and as real as being 
followed and watched in your neighborhood or in your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was announcing that $138 million will go to 56 states and  
territories under the S.T.O.P. Violence Against Women program, to 
strengthen the criminal justice system's response to violence 
against women. States must allocate at least 25 percent of the 
money to law enforcement, prosecutors and victim services. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $62 million will go to battered women's shelters  
through the Department of Health and Human Services, Gore said. The 
funding will pay for counseling, legal assistance, emergency aid 
such as transportation or meals and referral services for women and 
children seeking to escape a violent home. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, $23 million will go to 32 states and five territories for  
coordination of criminal justice efforts against domestic violence 
such as creating centralized units of police, prosecutors and 
judiciary officials to handle those cases.

<HEADLINE> IOC Bribe Controversy Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizers intend to produce air  
travel vouchers, courtesy notes and lodging reservations to 
substantiate claims that Salt Lake boosters lavished favors on 
Australian IOC member Phil Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune said in a copyright story today that it  
obtained documents that undermined Coles' protests against the Salt 
Lake Organizing Committee ethics report that he received thousands 
of dollars worth of benefits during trips to Utah during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 9 report by the ethics committee said Salt Lake City  
bid boosters paid for four U.S. visits by the families of Coles and 
another International Olympic Committee member, Willi Kaltschmitt 
of Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC spokeswoman Caroline Shaw said the committee was sending  
copies of all the supporting documents, including airline receipts, 
to Coles and the IOC. The material was inadvertently left out of an 
appendix of the 300-page ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't seen the evidence and we wanted to get it off to  
him,'' said Shaw, who declined to provide copies of the materials. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members are not supposed to accept gifts worth more than  
$150, and Coles is under investigation by the IOC for allegedly 
breaking that rule. Coles stepped down from the organizing 
committee of the 2000 Sydney Games a day after he was named in the 
Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report said ``some IOC members treated their site  
visits more like vacations,'' and then discussed the case of the 
Coles and Kaltschmitt families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coles and Kaltschmitt families stayed at expensive hotels  
and followed the same recreational itinerary. Two of these trips 
were only four months apart in 1995, including a Super Bowl trip 
that does not appear to have included a visit to Salt Lake City. 
Mr. (Tom) Welch (then head of SLOC) served as their host at the 
Super Bowl; the expenses were paid as reimbursements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has strongly denounced those allegations and challenged  
Salt Lake City officials to produce the documentation. He 
complained that the only thing missing from his media treatment was 
``the guillotine in the city square.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his denials Tuesday for The Australian newspaper,  
saying that he and his family spent Christmas 1995 with fellow IOC 
member Jim Easton at Easton's condominium in Deer Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed there. We cooked our own meals and did everything  
ourselves, and my records show that,'' Coles said. ``These people 
have got it wrong again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easton, one of two American IOC members and a SLOC trustee, told  
The Tribune on Wednesday that ``I saw him and we skied during that 
time. But he was staying at someone else's condo. I don't know 
whose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said bills and paperwork indicate the bid committee  
largely picked up Coles' tabs for a weeklong stay in Deer Valley in 
February 1993 and a five-day stay in February 1995 -- four months 
before the IOC voted to award Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the documents that it had obtained were not  
above dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, an itinerary for the 1995 trip said Coles and his  
partner, Patricia Rosenbrock, were to have Christmas dinner at the 
home of Park City Mayor Brad Olch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say categorically `no,' that Coles did not have  
Christmas anything with me,'' Olch said. ``I can remember having 
dinner with them (Coles and Rosenbrock) a couple of times at 
restaurants ... but I couldn't tell you whether it was 1995 or 
1993.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deer Valley Lodging sent an $8,027 bill for ``Coles -- IOC  
members'' to the SLOC office to cover the two-week stay at a 
two-bedroom condo, The Tribune said. The itinerary of that 1995 
trip suggests Welch took the Coles to see a Utah Jazz-Portland 
basketball game and feted them at an $85-per-person New Year's Eve 
party also attended by Atlanta Olympic organizing committee 
president Billy Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	A reimbursement request shows bid committee Vice President Dave  
Johnson sought two Coles-Kaltschmitt-related repayments -- one for a 
Stein Ericksen Lodge dinner costing $1,982. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, credit-card receipts indicate the bid committee  
paid for two-round trips tickets from Sydney to Los Angeles for 
Coles and Rosenbrock at a cost of $11,667. Coles has said this was 
his one formal site visit allowed under IOC rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years earlier, the Coles apparently split their Utah stay  
between two nights at Brigham Street Inn and four nights at Stein 
Ericksen Lodge, The Tribune said. Johnson received a reimbursement 
check of $1,837 for ``expenses incurred during visit of Phillip 
Coles'' at Stein Ericksen. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the documents, the bid committee reimbursed Coles'  
$4,500 air fare, bought him ski gloves, stretch pants and bindings, 
an NBA basketball and ``an additional day of ski instruction during 
Phillip Coles' visit to Deer Valley -- $397.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, African Olympic official Jean-Claude Ganga is trying  
to mobilize support from his own continent in a desperate bid to 
fight expulsion from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IOC member, accused of receiving more than $200,000 in  
cash and inducements from Salt Lake City, has little backing for 
his cause, African Olympic officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, president of the Association of National Olympic  
Committees of Africa, has called an emergency meeting of the 
organization's executive committee for next Tuesday in Gabon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, of the Republic of Congo, wants ANOCA's support before he  
argues against his expulsion at the March 17-18 general assembly of 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But two senior African Olympic officials, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said several ANOCA delegates are refusing to attend 
the Gabon meeting out of disdain for Ganga.

<HEADLINE> Cronenberg To Head Cannes Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- David Cronenberg, whose movie ``Crash'' prompted  
both boos and raves at the Cannes film festival three years ago, 
will head this year's jury, the festival announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be intoxicating and thrilling, and I can't  
wait,'' the Canadian director said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cronenberg, who also directed ``The Fly'' and ``Dead Ringers,''  
won the 1996 Grand Jury prize at Cannes for ``Crash,'' which 
stunned many with its scenes of lovers getting their kicks from car 
crashes. Despite the award, there were boos and walkouts, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``With David Cronenberg, the `angelic shadow of the bizarre' ...  
will without a doubt loom over the Croisette (boardwalk),'' said 
Gilles Jacob, director of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that it was the first time in 52 years that a Canadian  
will preside over the festival jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's jury president was American director Martin  
Scorsese. 
</P>
<P>
	At this year's Berlin Film Festival, Cronenberg was represented  
with a sci-fi mystery, ``eXistenZ,'' which was awarded a special 
jury prize for outstanding artistic achievement.

<HEADLINE> UCLA's Gadzuric Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Freshman Dan Gadzuric, UCLA's fifth-leading  
scorer and third-leading rebounder, underwent arthroscopic surgery 
on his left knee Thursday and will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Matthew Shapiro, who performed the 90-minute operation,  
estimated that it will take six weeks before Gadzuric starts 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadzuric injured his knee during practice Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dan has been an important member of our basketball team this  
season and his presence will be greatly missed,'' said UCLA coach 
Steve Lavin. ``As a team we must also rise to the occasion of 
facing our remaining games without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 center has started 17 games this season for the  
No. 15 Bruins, including last Sunday's 93-69 victory over No. 24 
Syracuse. He is averaging 8.6 points and 5.7 rebounds and leads the 
team in field goal percentage and blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been hampered all season with tendinitis in both knees,  
but had 12 points and nine rebounds against Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Consolidate Control of Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers are no longer  
Eddie DeBartolo's team, at least not for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	That much was made clear Wednesday by co-owner Denise DeBartolo  
York, who put her husband in charge of the team while imposing new 
restrictions on her brother, reinforcing DeBartolo's open-ended 
exile from the club. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to 49ers employees, York told them that DeBartolo, who  
withdrew from active ownership 14 months ago due to legal problems 
in Louisiana, no longer is authorized to draw money from club 
accounts and would have no involvement in personnel or other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the memo had to be stated that way so it was  
clarified,'' said general manager Bill Walsh, the former 49ers 
coach brought back last month to run the team's football 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie is our friend. Eddie is my close friend. He is my  
colleague. Denise and Eddie have a good relationship. But I'm sure 
you question who was running the 49ers. We had to make a definitive 
statement. This should clarify where the 49ers are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Singer, a spokesman for York, said her memo formalizes the  
team's new command structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denise is in charge of the team for the foreseeable future,''  
Singer said. ``We don't know when Eddie will return, but Denise is 
happily taking helm of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The development is the strongest sign yet that DeBartolo's  
banishment won't end any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said last month that the suspension  
of DeBartolo would likely be extended at least through the 1999 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not known how the latest management changes will affect the  
49ers' stalled plans for a $525 million stadium and mall. York has 
put that project on hold because of soaring construction cost 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	York, chairwoman and chief executive officer of the 49ers parent  
firm, the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. of Youngstown, Ohio, gave her 
husband, John York, and an aide, Keith Lenhart, oversight 
responsibility for the team. John York is a DeBartolo Corp. senior 
vice president and member of the board of directors. Lenhart is the 
corporate controller. Both men will add the title of 49ers vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said that the football operations have been unaffected by  
the ownership tumult, but conceded that plans for a new stadium are 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't honestly think there is any difference at this time  
between how Eddie DeBartolo would be managing this team and Denise 
DeBartolo's management,'' Walsh said. ``I don't see any difference 
in philosophy. ... Stadium-wise, I'm not sure of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo had no immediate comment and did not return a phone  
call to his San Mateo office. League spokesman Greg Aiello said the 
NFL viewed the management moves as a team matter. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo stepped down as head of the team's operations in  
December 1997 when his role in a federal gambling and bribery case 
in Louisiana became public. He pleaded guilty in October to a 
federal felony -- failure to report an alleged extortion attempt in 
connection with the government's prosecution of former Louisiana 
Gov. Edwin Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	In the memo, obtained by the San Francisco Examiner, Denise York  
ordered 49ers personnel not to answer DeBartolo's questions about 
club management unless they are put in writing and forwarded to 
club executive John McVay, with copies sent to her. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said she must preapprove any request by DeBartolo for  
cash reimbursements for his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Eddie was involved in the direct management of this team,  
he enjoyed many of the benefits, which are earned when undertaking 
such responsibility. He no longer functions in that capacity,'' 
Denise York wrote.

	FCC Rules on Internet Dial-Up Calls  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer user's dial-up calls to the  
Internet are interstate communications subject to federal 
jurisidiction, federal regulators concluded today. Until now, 
Internet dial-ups have been treated as local calls. The Federal 
Communications Commission insists that today's action merely 
resolves a dispute among phone companies over how to compensate 
each other for Internet connections and to clarify the role of 
state and federal regulators. But consumer groups and FCC 
Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, who protested by not 
participating in the vote, believe the action could inadvertently 
open the door to higher future charges for Internet access by 
computer users. 

</P>

	SEC Charges 13 With Internet Fraud  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Extending their sweep against Internet  
investment scams, federal securities regulators announced today 
they had charged nine people and four companies with fraud online. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged separate schemes 
that deceived investors around the world by fraudulently promoting 
stocks in Internet junk mail, online newsletters, Internet message 
board postings and Web sites. The market watchdog agency made the 
allegations in a civil lawsuit and three administrative actions. In 
the new lawsuit, the SEC alleged that P. Joseph Vertucci, an 
insider of Interactive MultiMedia Publishers, and Bruce Straughn, a 
former Chicago stockbroker, manipulated the company's stock price 
in a ``pump and dump'' scheme. All four cases involved people 
allegedly promoting stocks without disclosing they were paid for 
it.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A spike in interest rates today pushed down  
stocks, which have benefited for a long time from reasonable 
borrowing costs. At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow 
Jones industrial average had trimmed sharp losses dramatically as 
bond futures began to recover. But the Dow still closed down 33.33 
at 9,366.34, and it got as low as 9,233.59, down 166 points, during 
the session. It was the first time in a month that the Dow had lost 
ground three days in a row. Broader stock indicators sank, too, 
with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index down 8.39 at 1,245.02, and the 
Nasdaq composite index down 12.53 at 2,326.85.

	Durable Goods Orders Jump in Jan.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket  
products surged 3.9 percent in January, the most in 14 months, fed 
by strong demand for autos and aircraft. The Commerce Department 
said today that the January increase in demand for durable goods, 
items expected to last three or more years, followed a healthy 3.4 
percent increase in December. The January surge fooled analysts who 
had expected a 0.1 percent decline. In another favorable economic 
report, the national Association of Realtors said sales of existing 
homes rose to a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.07 
million units in January, up 0.8 percent from the December figure.

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Teamsters Local 560, for decades considered  
the most mob-riddled union in the nation, was returned today to the 
direct control of its members for the first time in nearly 12 
years. In removing his court-ordered trustee, U.S. District Judge 
Harold A. Ackerman accepted assertions from the trustee and law 
enforcement officials that the northern New Jersey union was 
finally free of a Mafia ``cancer'' that drained its pension fund 
and murdered dissidents. ``I never dreamed it would be such a long 
time,'' said Ackerman, who got the case when the U.S. Justice 
Department sued the union in 1982. In 1986, he imposed the order, 
the first federal takeover of a union. 

</P>
<P>
	FCC Moves To Protect Mobile Phones  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators moved forward today on a  
plan that would protect Americans with new mobile satellite phones 
from having them confiscated or subject to hefty duties when they 
travel to other countries. The Federal Communications Commission in 
a 5-0 vote offered a proposal under which a U.S. company could 
obtain FCC approval for its equipment without also having to get 
similar approvals from countries where the phones would be used. A 
final plan could be adopted by year's end. A number of countries -- 
including all members of the European Community, Japan, Korea, 
Canada and Kenya -- have agreed to a reciprocal plan: They would 
honor U.S. equipment authorizations, while the United States would 
honor theirs. 

</P>
<P>
	House Approves Phone Privacy Law  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted 403-3 today for a bill to  
strengthen privacy laws by making it illegal to intentionally 
intercept or disclose wireless telephone communications. The 
legislation, which now goes to the Senate, also extends to new 
digital technology restrictions on the manufacture of scanners that 
can be easily altered to receive cellular frequencies. 

</P>
<P>
	Internet Group Battles Intel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Internet civil liberties group said today  
it will file a formal complaint with federal regulators tomorrow 
alleging that new technology in Intel Corp.'s latest Pentium 
computer chip represents ``unfair and deceptive trade practices.'' 
The Center for Democracy and Technology said it will ask the 
Federal Trade Commission to investigate a controversial technology 
built into its new Pentium III chips. The technology enables 
Pentium III to transmit a unique serial number internally and to 
Web sites that request it, to help verify the identity of 
consumers.

	Ford Making Biggest SUV

	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is rolling out the industry's  
biggest sport utility vehicle yet, a nine-seat colossus of the road 
that the Sierra Club warns will ``guzzle enough gas to make Saddam 
Hussein smile.'' The 3.5-ton, six-door Ford Excursion -- at 19 feet 
nearly a foot longer than the current biggest sport utility, the 
Chevrolet/GMC Suburban -- will go on sale in the fall as a 2000 
model. It is expected to sell for $45,000 to $50,000, with a 
per-vehicle profit of between $12,000 and $20,000. That will make 
it one of the most profitable vehicles on the road.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Jump in Jan. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket  
products surged 3.9 percent in January, the most in 14 months, fed 
by strong demand for autos and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that the January increase in  
demand for durable goods, items expected to last three or more 
years, followed a healthy 3.4 percent increase in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The January surge caught analysts by surprise. They had been  
projecting that new orders declined 0.1 percent in January 
following what they believed was an unsustainable jump in demand in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	New orders are closely watched by economists as an early signal  
of what industrial output and manufacturing employment will do in 
the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The two back-to-back sizable gains may call into question the  
prevailing view that the U.S. economy will slow this year as world 
financial troubles and a rising trade deficit create a sizable drag 
on what up until now has been strong domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	A slowing of the U.S. economy after three years of rapid  
expansion would be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which is 
worried that the lowest unemployment rates in three decades will 
cause wage pressures to intensify and set off a bout of higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, delivering the central  
bank's latest economic forecast to Congress this week, predicted 
that the economy, which grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in 
1998, will slow this year to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent 
growth in the gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan hinted that if this slowdown does not occur, the  
Fed will be ready to move quickly to raise interest rates to make 
it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce report on durable goods said the January increase  
of $7.7 billion pushed total orders up to $203.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance was led by a 15.4 percent jump in orders for  
transportation equipment, a $7.1 billion increase that was led by 
increases in aircraft and autos. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic equipment rose $1.9 billion, a 5.7 percent  
advance that followed an even stronger 6.4 percent December gain. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the surge in demand in transportation and  
electronics, orders for industrial machinery fell by 3.1 percent 
last month while orders for primary metals, such as steel, were 
down 3.3 percent, following a 3.4 percent December drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile defense category, durable-goods orders  
were 3.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While new orders have surged for the past two months, those gain  
followed a sustained period of weakness. For all of 1998, new 
orders to factories posted their smallest advance since an outright 
decline in 1991, the year the last recession ended.

<HEADLINE> CBS Might Buy NBC if Feds OK It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. chief executive Mel Karmazin said  
Thursday his company would be interested in buying NBC if the 
government eased rules that prevent one company from owning two 
broadcast television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin told a group of advertising executives at a conference  
in New Orleans that NBC would be a better fit with his company than 
NBC parent General Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that if Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. -- the nation's  
biggest oil companies -- could merge, then CBS and NBC should be 
allowed to combine. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Dana McClintock said the remarks came in response  
to a question during the American Association of Advertising 
Agencies conference, but would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Karmazin's remarks, GE spokesman Bruce Bunch  
said: ``NBC's strong earnings ... make it a perfect fit with GE's 
business model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin has often said he wishes regulators would relax rules  
that limit the number of TV stations, radio stations and broadcast 
networks one company can own. Last month, he told Electronic Media 
magazine that he would especially covet NBC if CBS were allowed to 
buy a second network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is considering loosening  
rules that limit the number of local TV and radio stations that a 
single company can control. But the issue of owning multiple TV 
networks is not a priority for regulators, said Vinton Vickers, a 
broadcasting analyst with ING Barings Furman Selz 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the likelihood of that happening is fairly remote  
right now,'' Vickers said.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Rich in Pitching Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Top pitching prospect A.J. Burnett caused  
a stir when he headed for the showers following the Florida 
Marlins' first spring training workout, and not because of the 
95-mph fastballs he threw in drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett wears a ring in each nipple, which prompted double-takes  
by teammates and a smile from manager John Boles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wins 20 games a year, I'll wear one, too,'' Boles said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rings aside, Burnett is one of the jewels in an organization  
loaded with hard-throwing youngsters. Forget the franchise's 
financial woes; Florida may be richer in pitching prospects than 
any other team in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a comforting feeling,'' general manager Dave Dombrowski  
said. ``We do have a lot of great arms. The strength of the 
organization is the young arms we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They may not pay immediate dividends, although Boles gives  
Burnett an outside shot at making the leap from Class A to the No. 
5 spot in the rotation. More likely, the 22-year-old Burnett will 
begin the season at Double-A. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the depth of young pitching provides a formidable  
foundation as the Marlins rebuild from last year's 108-loss season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have guys who someday will be able to dominate hitters,''  
Boles said. ``I know it's going to happen -- the question is when. 
It's going to be a whole lot of fun around here when we get there, 
because these kids have ability. It doesn't take a rocket scientist 
to see that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins' pitching plethora is partly the result of good  
scouting, and partly due to deals made in dismantling the 1997 
World Series champions. Pitching prospects were acquired in deals 
for Al Leiter, Edgar Renteria and Robb Nen. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the most promising youngsters spent time in the Marlins'  
rotation last year, with little success. Ryan Dempster went 1-5 
with a 7.08 ERA in 14 games, and Joe Fontenot went 0-7 with a 6.33 
ERA in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are just 21 and optimistic they'll do better this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``How can you not be confident being 21 and pitching in the big  
leagues?'' Dempster said. ``Maybe if you're 35 and getting hit hard 
it would be different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as taking my lumps, what pitcher hasn't?'' Fontenot  
said. ``I learned a lot from it, and there's nothing better than 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both are candidates this spring for the final spot in the  
rotation, Boles said, along with Burnett, Rafael Medina and two 
veteran knuckleballers, Kirt Ojala and Dennis Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett, Dempster and Fontenot throw in the low to mid 90s. So  
do prospects Nelson Lara, 20; Braden Looper, 24; Bobby Rodgers, 24; 
and Hector Almonte, 26. All are right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like if you're not a hard thrower, you don't belong  
on this team,'' said new Marlins catcher Jorge Fabregas, who is 
just getting acquainted with the young talent. ``It's good, because 
it's been so cold here this week. Catching these guys, I've been 
heating up my hand pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest hurdles for the youngsters, Boles said, are a lack  
of command with their pitches and lack of confidence in their 
changeup. Fastballs alone aren't enough, even when delivered at 95 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a couple of the kids could make the team this spring.  
Looper, a 6-foot-5 reliever acquired from St. Louis in the Renteria 
deal, has perhaps the best shot. 
</P>
<P>
	But the premier prospect is Burnett, another 6-foot-5 power  
pitcher who was acquired in the Leiter trade. He reached 97 mph on 
the radar gun even in the late innings last season at Class A Kane 
County, which is one reason he averaged 14 strikeouts per nine 
innings with a 10-4 record and 1.97 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes he's ready for the Marlins.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've seen me pitch,'' he said. ``If I go out against major  
league hitters and do what I've been doing, why not? 
</P>
<P>
	``If not, I won't be upset. I know I'll be there shortly.''

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Brings Out Fans, Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Mark McGwire was back behind the  
microphones Wednesday, laughing off predictions of 80 home runs and 
defending his use of muscle pills. 
</P>
<P>
	It was like he never left.  
</P>
<P>
	As about 100 reporters watched and three sports networks  
broadcast the spring training news conference live, McGwire said he 
was willing to discuss his record 70 home runs only until the new 
season starts in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mentally prepared to talk about last year up until the  
last day of spring training,'' McGwire said. ``Once the season 
starts, talking about 70 is gone. I think it's foolish to think I'm 
going to carry this over and talk about last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he would continue using androstenedione, the  
controversial muscle-building supplement that is prohibited by the 
NFL, NCAA and International Olympic Committee. At a drug conference 
last month, IOC vice president Dick Pound said baseball had allowed 
McGwire to become a ``souped-up hero'' by not banning andro. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major league baseball is not the IOC,'' McGwire said. ``And it  
has absolutely nothing to do with me hitting a baseball. I don't 
endorse the produce. I never did. Someone stuck a nose in my 
locker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At spring training last year, only about 20 reporters showed up  
for the first full-squad workout. But that was before McGwire beat 
Roger Maris' single-season record by nine home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, fans crowded against the fence to watch McGwire  
and his teammates go through their first full-squad workout, a 
mostly humdrum routine. They even kept track of the 12 home runs he 
it in batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe the turnout from the fans,'' McGwire said.  
``That was amazing. Then all of you guys. I've never been in a 
first day of spring training like this ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He talked almost disbelievingly about all the attention he  
received in the offseason, being interrupted in restaurants by fans 
who told him how much his accomplishment meant to them -- where they 
were when it happened and how some had named their children after 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had so many people join me for dinner,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest revelation during the hour-long news conference was  
that the most pressure he felt last season came after he topped 
Maris and had to fend off Sammy Sosa. McGwire had insisted that he 
didn't care who ended up with more homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sammy Sosa had a pretty damn good year and he was right there  
with me,'' McGwire said. ``When I broke that record, I knew there 
was a lot of time left in the season, and I knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``All across America, the most-asked question was, `Did he hit  
one?' That's sort of tough when you're playing a team sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two major milestones are up ahead for McGwire. He needs 43  
homers to become the 16th player to reach 500, and can become the 
first to hit 50 or more in four consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Can McGwire top 70?  
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa predicted 75 for McGwire in January and  
new teammate Carlos Baerga forecasts 80. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought another laugh from McGwire.  
</P>
<P>
	``Geez, I'd definitely retire if I did that,'' he said.  
``There's no more reason to play after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McGwire said he won't be disappointed if he falls far short  
of 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that no matter what I do this year, if I don't hit  
70, someone will say I had an off year,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he'd like to play at least five more years, but  
that he would ``walk away'' from baseball if there was another work 
stoppage. The current labor agreement is likely to expire after the 
2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also criticized a story last week that exaggerated his  
security arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I do not have bodyguards,'' he said. ``I don't need any  
bodyguards. I don't want any.''

<HEADLINE> Rates Will Eventually Hit Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As interest rates creep up in reaction to the  
bond market's selloff, consumers can expect higher borrowing costs, 
although not immediately, market experts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is so far the selloff ... hasn't meant very much  
to consumers,'' said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH 
Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbinger said mortgage rates are little changed from a week ago  
-- hovering at just under 7 percent for 30-year fixed-rate 
conventional loans and at around 6.6 percent for 15-year loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the picture is still brighter than last year. For the  
final week of February 1998, the 30-year rate was 7.22 percent and 
the 15-year rate 6.86 percent, according to HSH. 
</P>
<P>
	The interest charged on a new 30-year mortgage is often  
calculated at a fixed level above the yield on the 10-year Treasury 
bond -- which has been about 5.3 percent of late. 
</P>
<P>
	Other consumer rates, which sometimes react more slowly to  
changes in interest rates, were also little changed, according to 
Bank Rate Monitor, a West Palm Beach, Fla., publication that tracks 
consumer interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	New car loans averaged 8.32 percent this week, up from 8.31  
percent last week, while the rate on a standard fixed-rate credit 
card was 13.39 percent, about the same as last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Savings rates have remained the same. The rate on a five-year  
certificate of deposit was 4.54 percent, unchanged from last week, 
according to BRM. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices have fallen sharply in recent days, partly on fears  
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year 
to slow the economy and guard against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates hurt bonds and other investments paying a fixed  
rate of return by making bonds currently in circulation less 
attractive to investors. Fixed-income investments are also less 
appealing when inflation concerns arise. 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-afternoon Thursday, the price of the Treasury's main  
30-year bond was down more than 1 1/2 points, or $15 per $1,000 in 
face value. It's yield climbed to around 5.6 percent, a six-month 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbinger cautioned that if prices in the government bond market  
continued to plummet, and rates move even higher, mortgage rates at 
least will follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wouldn't be surprised if the rate on the 30-year loan  
rose above 7 percent by early next week. Also, holders of 
adjustable rate mortgages currently up for their yearly evaluation 
might see a slight uptick as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they hadn't locked up already, they should have,''  
Gumbinger said of home buyers now seeking mortgages. ``Lenders are 
absorbing the increase in their cost of credit without passing that 
on to consumers ... although they cannot ignore the hard selloff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drop in bond prices, Dan Seto, senior economist with  
Nikko Securities International Co. in New York, says he doesn't see 
a sustained selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the markets are adjusting to the possibility that the  
Fed may tighten later in the year,'' he said, noting this week's 
semiannual report by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to Congress. ``Fed 
Chairman Greenspan offered that suggestion, and that suggestion is 
not to be taken lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem like they (Fed officials) are attacking  
inflation or any kind of problem in the economy. They're tapping 
the brakes a little bit.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Calls North Korea a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling North Korea a ``huge threat'' to the  
United States, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday 
there can be no improvement in relations until American concerns 
about a suspected nuclear construction site are eased. 
</P>
<P>
	She also expressed deep concern about North Korea's missile  
development program. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright commented in testimony before the House International  
Relations Committee as President Clinton prepared for a meeting 
Friday on North Korea with former Defense Secretary William Perry, 
who is reviewing U.S. policy on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Key committee Republicans also expressed uneasiness about the  
North Korean military buildup, including a program to develop 
missiles capable of reaching U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., said, ``For 40  
years, North Korea posed a threat to 37,000 American troops and the 
South Korean capital of Seoul. Now they are threatening our 
mainland. In short, we must now worry about our safety in Seattle, 
not just Seoul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the U.S. food assistance program  
for North Korea enables that country to divert funds for its 
military program. He said such assistance should be cut off, but 
Albright indicated the administration will continue providing food 
aid based on appeals for donations by the U.N. World Food Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has been demanding unconditional  
access to the suspected nuclear construction site at Kumchang-ni, 
but the North Koreans have been demanding $300 million as the price 
for admission. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has refused to pay compensation but has  
hinted that North Korea may agree to access in exchange for an 
additional food donation even though there would be no explicit 
link between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides will hold a third round of talks on the  
Kumchang-ni site starting Saturday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry met with senior officials from Clinton's national security  
team last week and will bring Clinton up to date during their 
meeting Friday in San Francisco. Perry is due to make a return 
visit to East Asia some time in March. He previously has visited 
Japan, South Korea and China. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration maintains that North Korea renounced nuclear  
weapons in a 1994 agreement with the United States as part of a 
broader program to put Pyongyang on the non-nuclear path. 
</P>
<P>
	A key element of the deal involves the North Korean surrender of  
plutonium-producing nuclear reactors and their replacement with 
safer reactors, which are to be financed largely by Japan and South 
Korea. As part of the arrangement, the United States has been 
providing North Korea with 500,000 tons of fuel oil during the 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been growing skepticism in Congress and elsewhere  
about the 1994 agreement. Former Secretary of State James Baker has 
called U.S. policy toward North Korea an ``abject failure'' because 
the communist regime has no understanding of concepts such as 
``accommodation, negotiation and compromise.''

<HEADLINE> No IOC Members Dropped From Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All IOC members implicated in a scathing ethics  
panel report on the Salt Lake bribery scandal remain under the 
threat of expulsion, the committee's chief investigator said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, an International Olympic Committee vice president  
from Canada, said 10 members identified for the first time plus 
three previous cases remained the focus of his inquiry, which meets 
this weekend to decide the delegates' fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not narrowed it down at all,'' Pound said.  
</P>
<P>
	Two conference calls among the six member of the IOC's  
commission dealt with procedural and logistical questions, the 
Montreal attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get together the day before (the weekend meetings) to  
work up the files,'' Pound said. ``We'll see what information we 
have and what we lack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who also is in charge of IOC marketing and  
television-rights contracts, said reforms expected to be enacted at 
a special assembly next month should satisfy critics, including 
sponsors and U.S. senators. He said the changes would include 
frequent audits and biennial financial reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's commission was appointed after initial word that Salt  
Lake City bidders had given scholarships to family of IOC members 
during the city's quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a Salt Lake ethics panel reported that 24 IOC  
members or their families had benefited from more than $1.2 million 
in cash, travel, medical care and other improper inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members resigned or were expelled in the first phase of  
Pound's investigation. Three other members remained under 
investigation by the IOC, while a fourth was given a warning. 
Another of the members has since died. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry into the worst scandal in Olympic history was  
revived when the Salt Lake report implicated 10 new members and 
provided details on gifts to those whose cases remained open. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's commission will meet in the IOC's headquarters in  
Lausanne, Switzerland, Saturday and Sunday. In contrast to the 
first round of dismissals and warnings last month that drew 
hundreds of journalists for an internationally televised news 
conference, Pound said this weekend's session would be ``very 
quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his commission would review evidence and hear from IOC  
members who want to defend themselves in person. It then will 
recommend expulsion or other action to the IOC executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	While he declined to say how many of the 13 might show up to  
speak, Pound said he expected testimony from Phil Coles, an IOC 
member from Australia who has been linked to lavish travel and 
vacations allegedly paid for by Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles is one of the most influential sports officials in the  
country that will host the next Olympics in Sydney in 2000. He has 
vehemently denied any wrongdoing and threatened court action 
against the Salt Lake investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Also expected to be at the center of the IOC deliberations is  
Kim Un-yong, an executive board member from South Korea and 
president of the confederation of Olympic sports bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those who remained under investigation after the initial  
phase of the IOC inquiry, Kim used his influence to get lucrative 
jobs in television and entertainment for his children, Salt Lake 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune reported Thursday that Kim helped arrange  
classes at the University of Utah for the daughter of the general 
director of a leading Russian recording company that had a contract 
with Kim Hae-jung, the IOC official's daughter and a concert 
pianist. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim's high rank and threats of retaliation would not sway the  
commission's decision if it found he violated the IOC's ethics 
rules, Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All members are members, and the standards are the same,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new cases would be judged against the same criteria used in  
the initial review, he said, including ``getting cash and accepting 
benefits or allowing your family to accept benefits''

	All the commission's recommendations thus far had been by ``full  
consensus, without the need for raising hands and counting votes, 
and I hope there won't be any need for that,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's panel also will review files from about a dozen cities  
that bid for the Olympics between 1996 and 2004. The IOC had asked 
the cities to document any wrongdoing by IOC members during their 
bids, and Pound said further information probably would be needed 
in that investigation, although he had not seen the files already 
submitted.

<HEADLINE> Ripken, Belle Differ on the Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Cal Ripken is convinced his record  
run of playing in 2,632 consecutive games will one day be broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle, whose current string of 334 successive games is  
the most among active players, is just as certain that Ripken's 
streak will never be topped. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken shattered Lou Gehrig's seemingly unbreakable record of  
2,130 straight games in September 1995, then added 501 successive 
starts before voluntarily ending his run by sitting out the 
Baltimore Orioles' final home game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Belle, who signed with the Orioles as a free agent in  
December, as baseball's reigning ``iron man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised when Cal ended the streak last year,'' Belle  
said Thursday. ``It was fun while it lasted. I remember the 
excitement of seeing him break the record a few years ago when I 
was in Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By playing in every Orioles game from May 30, 1982, to Sept. 20,  
1998, Ripken raised the bar of longevity to a seemingly 
impossible-to-beat number. If Belle played in every game for 14 
more seasons, he would still come up short. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means I'll be playing past when I'm 40 years old,''  
Belle, 32, said. ``I figure I have only eight or nine years left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Belle falls short, Ripken said Thursday that his record  
may not stand the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Privately, I think if I did it, somebody else can do it,'' he  
said. ``There's a lot of luck involved, a lot of desire. I don't 
know what all the other ingredients are, but the fact of the matter 
is that I don't consider myself superhuman. If I can do it, then 
certainly somebody else can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle begs to differ.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's one record he doesn't ever have to worry about being  
broken,'' he said. ``It's hard to imagine. Day games after night 
games are tough, going to the west coast with no off day is even 
tougher. Even when you're going good, it's tough to go out there, 
mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, in fact, is already planning for his next day of rest.  
</P>
<P>
	``I made a vow that once we clinch the pennant that will be my  
day off,'' he said. ``I haven't won a pennant since 1996 (with 
Cleveland) and that was the last time I had an off day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will Clark, who has played in 162 games only once during his  
13-year career, figures no one will ever come close to breaking 
Ripken's record run. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way. To take the pounding you take every day for 16 years  
straight, it's not going to happen,'' Clark said. ``They don't make 
'em like Cal anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken made his comments before the Orioles' first workout with  
a full squad and Belle spoke afterward. Belle, in his second 
session with the media within three days, addressed his reputation 
as a volatile individual. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't control my image anymore and I'm not going to try  
to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, was peppered with questions about his future.  
Ripken, who is signed through this season with an option for the 
2000 season, said he hasn't started considering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can make that decision now,'' he said.  
``Towards the end of your career you have to go with the flow, then 
you have to make some tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't lie to yourself and can't not be real. You have to  
look at what's going on, you have to look at how you feel and make 
judgments. I'd love to play the game as long as I can, but if I 
can't be competitive then I won't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers say he's not done yet. Ripken hit .271 with 14  
homers and 61 RBIs and led AL third basemen in fielding percentage. 
This season he could reach two milestones -- 3,000 hits (he needs 
122) and 400 homers (he's at 384).

</P>
<P>
 *Medtronic fell 3 9/16 to 72 3/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The medical-device maker said late Wednesday it will close five  
manufacturing facilities and cut 1,600 jobs. The company took a 
surprisingly large $302 million pretax charge against its fiscal 
third-quarter earnings, mostly for its recent acquisitions of 
Sofamor Danek Group Inc. and Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc. In 
addition, Medtronic set aside reserves for existing litigation 
against Sofamor Danek, and said it will take another pretax charge 
of $45 million in the fourth quarter for actions related to the 
mergers. Third-quarter operating earnings were 36 cents a share, a 
penny shy of Wall Street estimates. Meanwhile, the company's 
chairman said he is confident that Medtronic can achieve earnings 
of about $1.55 a share in 1999 and $1.85 a share in 2000. Those 
figures are below consensus estimates of $1.56 and $1.91, 
respectively. 

</P>

 *CHS Electronics Inc. fell 2 3/8 to 7 13/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company said late Wednesday it is investigating accounting  
irregularities connected to the fees it pays its vendors. The 
investigation could cause the company to restate fourth-quarter 
earnings of 49 cents a share, which were even with last year but 
below analysts' projected 73 cents. 

</P>
<P>
 *Waste Management fell 1 3/16 to 49 1/4.

</P>
<P>
	The company restated fiscal 1998 revenues downward to account  
for its acquisition of BGS Systems Inc. The revision lowered its 
revenue growth for so far for 1999 to 33 percent from 44 percent. 
Prudential Securities downgraded the stock to ``accumulate'' from 
``strong buy.''

revenue increased but was hurt by the National Basketball 
Association lockout.

<HEADLINE> Australian IOC Member May Sue SLOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Australian IOC member Phil Coles is  
threatening legal action over what he called inaccurate allegations 
by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, which on Thursday released 
more documentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has objected to the SLOC ethics panel's report Feb. 9,  
which accused him of taking four vacations paid for by the 
committee that sought the 2002 Winter Games. Copies of canceled 
checks, correspondence and airline tickets that SLOC says back up 
that allegation were released on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentation, SLOC said, had been ``inadvertently'' left  
out of the report's appendix and was forwarded to the IOC and to 
Coles on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said the organizers of the Salt Lake Olympics still  
haven't proven that he enjoyed largesse from the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``SLOC has been caught out with having conducted a sloppy and  
inaccurate investigation into my visits. It is now attempting to 
justify its wrongdoing by relying on facts and circumstances which 
it must know do not support its defamatory allegations,'' Coles 
said in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be taking legal action against Salt Lake City and the  
media after I am cleared of any wrongdoing by the IOC Commission 
and the IOC executive board,'' Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, documentation released Thursday did not fully support  
the ethics panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, two of the four trips to Salt Lake occurred after  
Salt Lake won the bid in June 1995. Those two occurred in late 1995 
and early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The report had said Coles and IOC member Willi Kaltschmitt of  
Guatemala made a total of four vacation visits together to the 
United States at bid committee expense. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentation released Thursday included correspondence  
indicating Coles had visited Salt Lake in 1990 and 1991, but there 
was no documentation that the bid committee paid for those trips. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentation also contradicted Coles' contention that he  
visited only once during the bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee and its employees paid more than $14,000 for a  
Coles visit in February 1993 and $9,000 for a visit in January and 
February 1995, the documents indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	The expenses included some travel, posh hotels, a $1,992 dinner  
with two IOC members and their guests, ski instruction and 
equipment and a Utah Jazz NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
	Former bid president Tom Welch received more than $18,000  
reimbursement from the committee for an expense cryptically noted 
as ``Superbowl'' and, under ``Key Biscayne-Hotels'' the names 
``Coles/Kaltschmitts.'' The documentation provides no more details 
on the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has contended that he and Kaltschmitt and their partners  
were guests of a broadcaster at the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles also visited Salt Lake over the Christmas holidays in 1995  
-- six months after the IOC voted to give Salt Lake the games -- and 
what was by then the organizing committee picked up the $9,200 Deer 
Valley Resort condominium expense. 
</P>
<P>
	During that stay, Coles and his partner, Patricia Rosenbrock and  
her two sons, were hosted at a Utah Jazz game and at an 
$85-per-person New Year's Eve party. 
</P>
<P>
	``My visit in December 1995 was one of these post bid visits and  
which I have fully disclosed to President Samaranch and the IOC 
Commission chaired by Dick Pound,'' Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles also contended he and his family were guests of IOC member  
Jim Easton, who has a Deer Valley condominium, ``and friends or 
sponsors of the 2002 Winter Games'' in return for advice relating 
to hosting the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	But Easton told The Salt Lake Tribune Coles did not use his  
condominium on that trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee also showed the SLOC making  
reservations at another $785 per night condominium for Coles and 
Rosenbrock in February 1997. The total cost was $6,051, although 
the documentation did not prove the committee paid it. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles and Rosenbrock were also hosted to a Utah Jazz game during  
that visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC rules do not apply to visits outside the bid, whether  
before or after,'' Coles said in Sydney on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments on Thursday, the Chicago Tribune reported  
that IOC executive committee member Kim Un Yong of South Korea 
arranged University of Utah studies for a woman whose father helped 
Kim's daughter's musical career. 
</P>
<P>
	An ethics panel investigating the scandal for SLOC earlier this  
month reported that Kim, the most powerful IOC member implicated, 
several times asked Salt Lake bid committee officials to help 
arrange studies for a Russian student, Ekaterina Soukhorado. The 
bid committee paid $15,000 of her expenses from 1991 through 
mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the relationship between Kim and Soukhorado was  
not clear, but the Chicago Tribune reported that her father, Valery 
Soukhorado, is general director of Melodiya, a prominent Russian 
recording company. 
</P>
<P>
	Melodiya in 1992 issued a recording of Kim's daughter, pianist  
Kim Hae-Jung, playing Rachmaninoff piano concertos with a Soviet 
orchestra led by a renowned conductor. It was Kim Hae-Jung's first 
significant recording. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC six-member investigative commission will meet this  
weekend to discuss the cases pending against three members, 
including Kim, and new cases involving 10 more members. A final 
decision on any recommendation for expulsion will be made at a 
special session of the entire IOC membership March 17-18.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Poised To Be No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov is about to replace  
Pete Sampras as tennis' No. 1 player. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Russian, the hottest player in the world this  
year with a victory three weeks ago in the Australian Open, will 
move into the top spot in the ATP Tour rankings with a victory 
Friday over Thomas Johansson of Sweden in the quarterfinals of the 
Guardian Direct indoor. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov put himself in position to knock Sampras off his  
perch with a 6-3, 6-2 second-round victory Thursday over Byron 
Black of Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson, the No. 8 seed, beat Davide Sanguinetti of Italy 6-0,  
6-7 (7-3), 6-2. In other second-round matches, No. 5 Karol Kucera 
of Slovakia beat Guillaume Raoux of France, 6-2, 6-0; Slovak 
Dominik Hrbaty defeated countryman Jan Kroslak 6-2, 6-3; and No. 3 
Greg Rusedski of Britain beat Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 6-3, 
7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	If Kafelnikov beats Johansson, he will become only the 15th  
player to hold the top spot since rankings were begun in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, taking the week off, had 3,695 ATP ranking points going  
into this week and Kafelnikov had 3,637. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not putting too much pressure on myself,'' Kafelnikov  
said. ``I know this year it is going to happen, but I hope that it 
will happen here this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it really helps tennis to see a bit of change,'' he  
added. ``I'm playing as well as I have ever played. For sure, I 
know someday I will not be so good, but that is the way it is now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't ask for any better. I'm happy to get through and I'm  
looking forward to the quarterfinal. I'm sure I'll be excited if I 
win but I have to take the match as seriously as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov has a 4-2 edge in head-to-head matches with the  
19th-ranked Johansson. They are 1-1 in matches on carpet, which is 
surface being used here. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras was knocked out of the No. 1 spot for six weeks last  
year, both times by Chile's Marcelo Rios. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, 27, returned to No. 1 on Aug. 24 and set an ATP Tour  
record by finishing No. 1 for the sixth straight season. He has 
held the No. 1 spot for 260 weeks -- 10 short of the ATP record held 
by Ivan Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov won the Australian Open three weeks ago, then added  
an indoor title last week in Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	He would become the first Russian player to ever hold the No. 1  
ranking and the first from a former Eastern Bloc country since 
Lendl and Ilie Nastase.

<HEADLINE> Lycos Loses $9.3M in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lycos Inc., the popular World Wide Web gateway  
which is being bought by USA Networks Inc., reported Thursday it 
lost $9.3 million in the recent quarter due in part to the costs of 
its own acquisitions. But the results edged Wall Street 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos, the fourth-most popular Web destination, said the loss in  
its fiscal second quarter, ended Jan. 31, came to 22 cents a share. 
That compared to a profit of $301,119, or 1 cent a share, in the 
year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding Lycos' acquisitions last year, the company would have  
lost $1.5 million, or 3 cents a share. That was less than the 4 
cents loss predicted by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Waltham, Mass.-based Lycos, which provides Internet search  
and information services, said its revenues more than doubled to 
$30.6 million from $12.6 million, lifted by a sharp increase in 
advertising and licensing fees from its Web operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos has lost money every year since it was started in 1995,  
</P>
<P>
	USA Networks announced early this month plans to forge a  
three-way deal, merging its cable television network with Lycos and 
Ticketmaster Online Citysearch, an online seller of tickets to 
concerts and other events. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the plans have appeared in jeopardy after Lycos'  
largest shareholder started wavering in its support of the $22 
billion deal because of a sharp decline in Lycos' stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced after the recent quarter ended.  
</P>
<P>
	Lycos' quarterly results were released after the close of  
financial markets Thursday, when its stock rose $2.50 to $93 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended Jan. 31, Lycos lost $23.9 million, or  
56 cents a share, compared to a profit of $408,599, or 1 cent a 
share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue more than doubled to $55.3 million from $21.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Match Play Differs From the Norm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- In any other tournament, Nick Price  
would have been among the leaders after getting to 6-under-par 
after 15 holes of his opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Match Play Championship, all it got him was an invitation  
to second round play. 
</P>
<P>
	For players used to grinding it out over 72 holes of stroke  
play, going head-to-head with a playing partner for the first time 
in 14 years on the PGA Tour has required some adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day you start over again,'' Price said. ``It's really a  
different beast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The return of match play in the $5 million tournament at La  
Costa Resort has players trying to figure out everything from how 
to play strategically to when to concede a putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the fans are having to adapt.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did he just give him that putt?'' one asked after Greg Norman  
did just that to John Cook in an opening round match. ``Why did he 
do that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of some friendly practice rounds or occasional Ryder Cup  
play, players simply don't play match play with much at stake 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed this week, with 64 of the world's best golfers  
chasing a $1 million first prize. For once, there was almost as 
much riding on who you were playing as how well you played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Match play is weird,'' Paul Azinger said after beating Ernie  
Els in the first round. ``Sometimes the best player doesn't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was more than apparent in first round matches that saw five  
of the top 10 players in the world get beaten. Some played poorly, 
while others played well but just ran into opponents who played 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 72-hole stroke play tournament, a mediocre opening round  
might just be a setup to a strong weekend finish. Here, it is a 
plane ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	The format has made gamblers out of some normally very cautious  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play so much stroke play that you don't always want to take  
a chance on a hole,'' Price said. ``In match play you're forced to 
take a chance. It's a change of mentality, a change of approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For some, that change has been easier than for others.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my favorite form of golf,'' said David Duval, who  
might be a little biased because of his success in stroke play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like it because I don't have to play my foul balls,'' said  
Steve Pate, who surprised Davis Love III with a first round win. 
</P>
<P>
	Price played enough match play as an amateur to formulate his  
own way of winning matches. 
</P>
<P>
	It has nothing to do with coughing during an opponent's back  
swing to try and get him to hit it sideways. In fact, it is much 
like stroke play.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Legal Fund Raised $4.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment did not slow  
down contributions to his legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund, created a year ago to help the president pay his legal  
bills, raised $2.3 million between mid-August, after Clinton's 
first public admission of an improper relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky, and mid-February, when the Senate acquitted the president 
of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the fund raised $4.5 million in its first year of  
operation from contributions as large as $10,000. Trustees said 
Wednesday they had received 50,000 contributions. The average 
donation was $90, and 95 percent of the donors gave $100 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	The money helped whittle the Clintons' outstanding legal bills  
from $9 million to $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trust's first year has been more successful than I or any  
of the trustees could have predicted,'' said the defense fund's 
founder, former Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	More money is expected. The fund recently sent out letters that  
noted: ``The effort to impeach President Clinton is only the latest 
in a series of legal actions that have left the First Family with a 
staggering personal debt. ... If you are disturbed by the way 
politics is conducted today, then what better response than to 
offer the first family your own gesture of support?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton received 56 contributions of $5,000 or more during the  
last six months, including $10,000 apiece from singer Tony Bennett; 
and Don Henley, a member of the Eagles musical group. Author 
Stephen King and actor Robert DeNiro each gave $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	One $10,000 donor, Atlanta businessman J.B. Fuqua, said wealthy  
individuals who prospered under the Clinton administration have an 
obligation to help the president financially. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew when he ran for president the first time that he  
played around with women,'' Fuqua said. ``I don't approve of it, 
but nevertheless that's a fact of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last six months, the fund has sent out hundreds of  
thousands of letters to prospective donors, cultivating its mailing 
list from a variety of sources including Democratic Party 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the fund will ask earlier contributors to give  
again, executive director Anthony Essaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund so far has paid $3 million of Clinton's legal expenses  
from the now-dismissed Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, the 
impeachment trial and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
continuing investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $5.2 million remains to be paid, as well as any new  
legal expenses the president may incur, Essaye said. He said he 
expects the Clintons' total legal bills to reach $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six people -- all small donors -- have asked for refunds,  
Essaye said.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Futures Up on Supply Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gasoline futures led other energy prices higher Thursday on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange as a spate of refinery outages boosted 
concerns about availability going into the peak driving season. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures fell sharply, while grain and  
soybeans continued their long retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline futures jumped 3.4 percent after San Antonio-based  
Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. said it will reduce crude 
processing in March by 10 percent at its 52,000 barrel-a-day 
refinery in Michigan and on Monday will cut processing by 55,000 
barrels a day for 10 days at a unit in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes on the heels of Tosco Corp.'s decision to  
shut down a refining unit in New Jersey for six weeks and as others 
shut down amid fires or maintenance operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had speculated narrow profit margins caused by low  
prices would lead to additional shutdowns. Some market participants 
now are becoming nervous about the potential for spot shortages, 
particularly in the important Northeast market, as Americans shake 
off the winter and begin taking to the road in increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline for March delivery rose 1.18 cents to 36.03 cents a  
gallon; April crude rose 7 cents to $12.68 a barrel; March heating 
oil rose 0.60 cent to 32.95 cents a gallon; April natural gas fell 
3.8 cents to $1.659 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures tumbled on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York as prices already on the defensive from the arrival of ample 
supplies from this year fell even further amid indications next 
year may not be better. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian Association of Coffee Exporters forecast this crop  
year will bring a harvest of 26.6 million bags weighing 132 pounds 
each, which raises the potential for large inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	May arabica coffee fell 2.85 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $1.038  
cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybeans futures continued their retreat on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, with most contracts posting new lows amid 
concerns about ample supplies and weak world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the losses, posting new 23-year lows, on talk that  
the decline in Brazil's currency will make that nation's exports 
cheaper. With both Brazil and Argentina getting set to harvest 
bumper competing supplies, market participants are worried the 
world market will be overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also were pressured by reports that buyers of competing  
Malaysian palm oil had canceled or defaulted on orders, a sign that 
world demand remains extremely weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. Agriculture Department reported weekly  
exports rose 3 percent over the previous week, but still were 8 
percent below the four-week average and 23 percent below year-ago 
levels at this point in the marketing year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and corn futures also fell amid general perceptions of  
world oversupply. Prices also fell amid concern the beginning of 
the delivery period against the March contract month would see 
greater-than-expected marketings. 
</P>
<P>
	March wheat fell 5 1/2 cents to $2.38 3/4 a bushel; March corn fell 2  
cents to $2.06 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3 cents to $4.54 1/2 a 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mark McGwire will have to talk about last year's record-setting  
season for another month. Ron Gant wants to put his feud with 
former manager Tony La Russa behind him right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mentally prepared to talk about last year up until the  
last day of spring training,'' McGwire said Wednesday in his first 
news conference of spring training. ``Once the season starts, 
talking about 70 is gone. I think it's foolish to think I'm going 
to carry this over and talk about last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As about 100 reporters watched and three sports networks  
broadcast the spring training news conference live, McGwire laughed 
off predictions that he would shatter his record of 70 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa predicted 75 for McGwire in January and new teammate  
Carlos Baerga forecasts 80. 
</P>
<P>
	``Geez, I'd definitely retire if I did that,'' McGwire said.  
``There's no more reason to play after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McGwire said he won't be disappointed if he falls far short  
of 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that no matter what I do this year, if I don't hit  
70, someone will say I had an off year,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa and Gant have been ripping each other since the  
Cardinals traded the left fielder to Philadelphia three months ago. 
Gant criticized La Russa's lineups, and La Russa fired back about 
the slugger's lack of production. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Gant named several players who didn't like La Russa  
and were mistreated by him. All the players were black, leaving the 
comments to be interpreted as an accusation of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize to the fans, to my fans, to the families. This  
shouldn't have happened,'' Gant said. ``We both are adults, and we 
have to put it behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa has said he was trying to find Gant's phone number so  
the two could talk, but La Russa said Wednesday that he still 
didn't have the number. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would talk with La Russa if the manager called, Gant  
said: ``Probably so. I'm that type of person. As far as I'm 
concerned, it's behind me. I hope it's behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood was hospitalized for  
precautionary testing after missing his third straight day of 
spring training workouts because of a lingering illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for putting him in is to get some blood cultures  
and see if we can pin down exactly what the cause is and just be 
careful and stay ahead of it,'' Cubs team physician Dr. John 
Marquardt said of last year's NL Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Vinny Castilla sprained his right ankle during the Rockies'  
first full-squad workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, a two-time All-Star third baseman, rolled on the ankle  
after making a throw to third base during a bunt-defense drill. He 
limped off the field and was able to take batting practice after 
getting the ankle taped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I slipped a little bit,'' Castilla said. ``I don't think it's  
serious. I heard a little bit of a pop, but I stood up and there 
wasn't too much pain. ... I got a little bit scared, but I hope 
it's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Former Braves closer Mark Wohlers, trying to rebound from a  
dismal season, had the most impressive performance of his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	While throwing several pitches in the dirt and admitting he  
wasn't working at full speed, Wohlers used all of his pitches and 
was pleased by his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm on the right path,'' said Wohlers, who inexplicably  
lost the ability to throw strikes last season, finishing with a 
10.18 ERA for the Braves and a 20.43 ERA during a stint in 
Triple-A. ``I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Adrian Beltre's first day at Dodgertown ended after the pinky  
finger on his right hand was slammed inside a car door. Beltre 
received two stitches and is listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cecil Fielder was greeted with bear hugs from Carlos Delgado  
and Dave Stewart as he rejoined the Blue Jays for the first time in 
11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toronto has a real good chance of going all the way. They have  
excellent pitching and they got an 18-game winner for a 20-game 
winner,'' Fielder said about the deal that brought David Wells, 
Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush to the Blue Jays in exchange for Roger 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't lose that much in the trade. The Yankees aren't as  
dominating as they are given credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Joe Torre signed his long expected two-year contract extension  
with the Yankees. The deal with owner George Steinbrenner, worth 
about $2 million a year, covers 2000 and 2001. While leaning toward 
stepping down when the new deal expires, Torre has not ruled out a 
longer stay. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Kansas City Royals agreed to a minor league contract with  
outfielder Curtis Pride, who is recovering from arthroscopic 
surgery on his right wrist.

<HEADLINE> Match Play Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Credit Kimberly Roberts with a big  
assist for her husband Thursday in the second round of the Andersen 
Consulting Match Play Championship at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	Loren Roberts was 1-up on Paul Azinger when his tee shot on No.  
15 flared to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wound up hitting my wife in the back of the leg and  
bounding out to the fairway,'' Roberts said. ``She took one for the 
team. I was wondering if this was a penalty or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts and Azinger both shot par to halve the hole. Roberts won  
the 16th with a birdie, and by halving 17, he won the match 2 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, who was 2-down to Azinger after just three holes, will  
face Shigeki Maruyama in Friday's third round. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AIR SHIGEKI:* Maruyama has a fixation with the No. 23, which is  
on his bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Michael Jordan for many different reasons,'' the  
Japanese golfer said. ``First of all, when I became a pro, I was 
23. And so that is about the same time Michael Jordan became a pro 
and I really feel close when I hear about him and his interviews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How big of a Jordan fan is Maruyama? ``I am desperate to meet  
him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maruyama has had a Jordan experience, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``Two years ago I went to Michael Jordan's store in Chicago.  
That is one of the most happiest time I have ever had. I bought my 
shoes and clothing, and I ate cheeseburger there, and it was 
delicious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maruyama beat Justin Leonard 4 and 2 Thursday to advance to  
Friday's third round against Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	Maruyama said unless he wins a big tournament, it won't really  
matter much back in Japan ``because a lot more Japanese people are 
interested in baseball than in golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *N-N-NERVOUS?:* Fred Couples, who beat Scott Hoch 1-up, isn't  
enamored with match play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am afraid I can't 2-putt from 30 feet,'' he said. ``This is  
nerve-wracking stuff. I don't even know who I play tomorrow, but 
this stuff makes me so nervous I will be choking like a dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples will play Steve Pate, who beat former UCLA teammate  
Brandt Jobe 1-up on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson, who would have played Greg Norman on Friday had  
he not collapsed against Eduardo Romero, said he was already 
nervous about that third-round match. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait until I get out on the golf course,'' Mickelson  
said. ``Really, it is only those three to four hours that it is 
easier to relax because I am in a position to do something. It is 
very difficult to sleep at night, knowing who you have to play, but 
not knowing what you have to shoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOCAL KNOWLEDGE:* Mickelson, who grew up in San Diego, won the  
Mercedes Championships here in 1994 and 1998, the last year it was 
held at La Costa before moving to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson said he has memories of those tournaments to fall back  
on, but said the course is different from when he won here last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is much faster,'' he said. ``the fairways are rolling. I  
hit 6-iron into No. 12 today and I would never hit 6-iron in 
January. So, it is playing totally different.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SEE YA:* Many of the players who've lost in the first and  
second rounds of this win-or-go-home tournament have either refused 
to talk to reporters or left the clubhouse through a back door. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we're not used to that, it's difficult for some  
players to deal with,'' Mickelson said of the match play format.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Reports Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG reported  
higher-than expected merger costs Thursday, but analysts were 
encouraged by a 38 percent increase in the German-American 
automaker's operating profit for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger costs of $804 million lowered earnings to $5.6 billion,  
down 26 percent from the combined 1997 earnings of about $7.6 
billion, including unusual items, for the former Chrysler Corp. and 
Daimler-Benz AG. Earnings per share were $6.05, which analyst 
Andrew Blair-Smith of Commerzbank in Frankfurt said were in line 
with expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretax operating earnings for the year were up to $10.1 billion  
from $7.31 billion in 1997. Excluding merger costs and 
non-recurring items, net earnings totaled $6.12 billion, up 29 
percent from $4.76 billion in the earlier year. 
</P>
<P>
	Group sales rose 12 percent or $155 billion, in 1998. The  
company did not break down the results among divisions, saying 
details would be presented March 31 at its annual year-end news 
conference in Stuttgart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are surprised with the size of the merger cost that was  
booked,'' said analyst Tom Aney of HypoVereinsbank in Munich. ``But 
even when taking that effect into account, the operating earnings 
situation remains strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A proposed dividend of $2.76 per share was to be considered by  
DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board at its March 30 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler shares closed down 5 percent in Frankfurt  
trading, while the overall market index was off 2.8 percent. 
Analysts attributed the slide mainly to profit-taking, since the 
stock had outperformed the market recently while rival German 
automakers Volkswagen AG and BMW AG had slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fundamentally, the company is doing very well,'' said Rolla  
Kautz, an analyst with BHF Bank in Frankfurt. ``It's definitely a 
good start. There's nothing to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	London-based analysts at Merrill Lynch raised their  
recommendation on DaimlerChrysler stock to ``long-term accumulate'' 
from ``neutral'' this week, forecasting DaimlerChrysler's net 
earnings would increase this year from strong North American sales. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler had announced in December that its 1998 profits  
would be ``significantly higher'' than the combined 1997 results of 
Daimler-Benz and Chrysler and that sales would be up about 13 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said then that substantial benefits from the merger,  
completed in November, would appear in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler declined on Thursday to issue an earnings  
outlook for 1999, surprising some analysts. After Volkswagen took 
investors off-guard late Tuesday by issuing a 1999 profit warning, 
traders had expected DaimlerChrysler to present an upbeat forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler did disclose that about 81,000 U.S. employees  
will receive profit sharing payments averaging $7,400, up 61 
percent from the average payment for 1997 but below 1994's record 
of $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	President Thomas Stallkamp said more than 19,000 management and  
professional-administrative employees will be eligible for profit 
sharing payments under the same formula. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 figures were calculated on a dollar/mark exchange rate  
of 1.667, the noon buying rate on Dec. 31, as required by the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. The average exchange rate in 
1998 was 1.7597.

<HEADLINE> NBA Theme Restaurant Opens in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- At a time when theme restaurants' stock  
have fallen and owners are shuttering one after another, NBA 
officials and players have broken ground on a basketball-oriented 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	National Basketball Association legends Dolph Schayes, John  
Havlicek and James Worthy, Orlando Magic center Ike Austin and the 
WNBA's Nykesha Sales were on hand for the groundbreaking ceremony 
Thursday for the 17,000-square-foot NBA City restaurant at 
Universal Studio's Citywalk entertainment district. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard Rock Cafe, which operates 99 rock-themed restaurants in 35  
countries, will build the NBA City restaurant and plans to spend 
$90 million over the next four years opening nine more NBA City 
restaurants around the globe. Each restaurant will cost between $8 
million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA officials said last year when they announced plans for the  
restaurant that it would open early this year. The opening has 
since been pushed back to this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lending the NBA's name, video clips and memorabilia to the  
restaurants gives the league a presence, especially abroad, where 
there are no NBA teams but plenty of fans, said NBA Commissioner 
David Stern. The next NBA City will likely open in Japan and other 
restaurants are planned in Asia, Latin American, Europe and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another demonstration of our global reach,'' Stern said.  
``We're a global brand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant will be divided into three parts: a dining area,  
a merchandise shop and an interactive recreation area where diners 
can shoot baskets and test their NBA trivia skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard Rock first approached the NBA about the restaurants because  
market studies showed that it was the fastest-growing sport in 
popularity for people ages 18 to 25, a market the company hoped to 
target because they will be eating at restaurants for many more 
years, said Hard Rock president and CEO Jim Berk. The NBA also was 
attractive because of its international appeal, personalities and 
its sizable marketing and retail components, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard Rock officials are predicting 1 million people will eat at  
the restaurant in its first year, generating $15 million in 
revenue. Unlike other themed restaurants, many which have closed in 
the past year after patrons found them overpriced and offering bad 
food, Berk promised the menu, not basketball, would be the focus at 
the NBA City restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando restaurant, billed as upscale casual, will offer  
American cuisine such as grilled salmon, roasted bell pepper pizza 
and pork chops. It will be situated between Universal Studios' two 
theme parks where an estimated 15 million people will pass through 
each year. Universal's second Florida theme park, Islands of 
Adventure, opens in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus (at some theme restaurants) has been parading movie  
stars down some red carpet and charging $10 for a hamburger,'' Berk 
said. ``We know we have to be first and foremost a restaurant.''

<HEADLINE> Jays' Johnson Says Vietnam Can Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Tim Johnson has decided Vietnam can wait.  
</P>
<P>
	Spring training officially began for all of the Toronto Blue  
Jays on Thursday when the last of the position players reported to 
camp, joining the pitchers and catchers already at work. 
</P>
<P>
	That seemed to set the stage for Johnson's planned group apology  
for telling Vietnam battle stories to some players last season, 
even though he never saw action. 
</P>
<P>
	But the second-year manager -- one of several club officials due  
to address the 60 players in camp -- chose not to formally apologize 
for his war tales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have so many new guys . . . that it's unnecessary when guys  
weren't here,'' Johnson said. ``They don't know what's going on or 
anything that happened. It's a personal thing between me and that 
players that were here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 50, has endured much public humiliation since admitting  
stories he told players about combat in Vietnam were false. The 
manager was also embarrassed by revelations that his biography in 
last year's Blue Jays media guide incorrectly stated he was an 
all-American basketball player in high school and was offered a 
scholarship at UCLA before signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those revelations, along with his much-publicized feud with  
longtime pitching coach Mel Queen, has tarnished Johnson's image. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Johnson said when the Blue Jays officially opened  
spring training that he would meet individually with returning 
players and apologize personally. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson has yet to sit down with them and now says he isn't  
sure when he will or whether he'll do so individually or as a 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	All Johnson would say Thursday is that he does plan to address  
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to me because I feel it's something I want to  
do,'' Johnson said. ``If you ask the players now it's behind them, 
it's like nothing ever happened and it really didn't to 99 percent 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``But personally I want to do it for myself. It's just clearing  
the air and saying it's a new year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, publicly at least, Johnson appears to have some key  
veterans on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a personal choice for him,'' pitcher Pat Hentgen said  
of the manager's decision to hold off on a team apology. ``He has 
to make that decision himself whether he wants to address the team 
or not. The players are going to play, that's just the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A player who blossomed under Johnson, outfielder Shawn Green,  
said the issue of an apology isn't on his teammates' minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not focused on any of that. I think for the most part  
guys respect him and are behind him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Outfielder Jose Cruz Jr. agreed to a $400,000, one-year 
contract. Catcher Kevin Brown also agreed to a one-year deal. The 
Blue Jays have eight unsigned players, and spokesman Howard 
Starkman said their contracts will be renewed if they don't sign by 
March 2.

<HEADLINE> SEC Charges 13 With Internet Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ``CyberForce'' of the Securities and  
Exchange Commission, whose 125 members do computer surveillance for 
online investment fraud, has struck again. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing its crackdown against Internet investment scams, the  
SEC announced Thursday it had charged nine people and four 
companies with fraud online. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged separate schemes that deceived investors around  
the world by fraudulently promoting stocks in Internet junk mail, 
online newsletters, Internet message board postings and Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency made the allegations in a civil  
lawsuit and three administrative actions. All four cases involved 
people allegedly promoting stocks without disclosing they were paid 
for it. The lawsuit also involved an alleged ``pump and dump'' 
scheme, in which promoters pushed up a stock's price by making 
false claims about the company and later sold their own shares to 
cash in on the artificially high price. 
</P>
<P>
	The accused individuals, including one current and two former  
stockbrokers, promoted more than 56 publicly traded companies and 
received more than $450,000 for doing so, the SEC said. The 
companies are fairly small and their stocks are relatively cheap, 
risky and thinly traded. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency ``continues to be vigilant in its efforts to stamp  
out fraud on the Internet,'' said SEC Enforcement Director Richard 
Walker. ``If you're trying to cheat investors on the Internet, we 
are watching and we will catch you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actions were the latest moves in a nationwide crackdown  
against investment fraud in cyberspace started by the SEC in 
October. The agency has been targeting people promoting stocks over 
the Internet who don't disclose they are paid to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Such stock promotions are known as ``touting.'' Stock touting is  
not illegal in and of itself, but any compensation received from 
the companies must be fully disclosed, including the nature and 
amount of payment in cash or stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new lawsuit, the SEC alleged that P. Joseph Vertucci, an  
insider of Interactive MultiMedia Publishers, and Bruce Straughn, a 
former Chicago stockbroker, manipulated the company's stock price 
in a ``pump and dump'' scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Vertucci and Straughn also are accused of arranging for  
publications to tout Interactive MultiMedia, a software development 
company, on the Internet and elsewhere. They allegedly paid the 
touters with cheap or free company stock, which the touters failed 
to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
	Interactive MultiMedia's stock later collapsed and the company  
ceased operating, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency sued Vertucci, Straughn and five other people  
allegedly involved in the scheme, seeking unspecified civil 
penalties and repayment of illegal profits from some of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Vertucci denied any wrongdoing, saying he was deceived when he  
bought Interactive MultiMedia. The SEC ``missed the point. ... What 
they're doing is wrong,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Straughn said he hadn't seen the details of the case yet and had  
no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three administrative actions, the SEC alleged that:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Scott Flynn and his company, Strategic Network Development  
Inc., used Internet junk mail and a Web site called 
Stockprofiles.com to disseminate favorable information about 
several companies without fully disclosing his payments from the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn, a former stockbroker convicted of securities fraud in  
another case, is said to have received at least $183,200 in cash 
and 322,500 shares of stock from at least 10 of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn could not immediately be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	--Hastings Communications, the owner and publisher of  
Stockprofiles.com, promoted the companies without fully disclosing 
its payments from the same companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a settlement with the SEC, Hastings Communications agreed to  
refrain from such violations in the future. The company neither 
admitted nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Max Ramras, through a business named RCG Capital Markets Group  
Inc., touted the stocks of nine companies on a Web site without 
disclosing payments in cash and stock options from the companies. 
RCG Capital Markets allegedly made more than $100,000 from the 
companies since November. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Wall, an attorney in Phoenix for Ramras and his company, did  
not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flynn and Ramras cases will be heard by SEC administrative  
law judges, who will determine whether the allegations are true and 
whether any remedial actions should be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE: The SEC advises investors to read its Cyberspace  
Alert before buying any investment promoted on the Internet. The 
publication is available on the investor assistance and complaints 
link of the agency's Web site at www.sec.gov. It also is available

<HEADLINE> Players Chosen Olympic Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When the U.S. men's basketball team tries to qualify for the  
2000 Olympics, Shaquille O'Neal won't be there. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, contrary to earlier reports, was not among the nine  
players selected for the Americas Zone qualifying tournament in 
July and the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Gary Payton, Tim  
Hardaway, Steve Smith, Tom Gugliotta, Allan Houston and Vin Baker 
are the first nine members of the team, The Associated Press 
learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three non-NBA players will be added later this year to the team  
that will represent the United States in the qualifying tournament 
July 14-25 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States must finish first or second in that tournament  
to qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NBA players will be added to the Olympic team after the  
1999-2000 season, with O'Neal almost certain to receive one of the 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner Sports and the New York Post reported Wednesday that  
O'Neal -- not Hardaway -- would play on the qualifying team, but 
several NBA sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 
report was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich will coach the U.S. squad  
in both the qualifying tournament and the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	If the U.S. qualifies, it will use NBA players for the third  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Dream Team won the gold medal in the 1992 Olympics  
at Barcelona, and an American team comprised entirely of 
professionals won the gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of NBA players was selected to represent the United  
States in last summer's World Championships at Athens, but those 
players were replaced when they would not commit to playing in the 
event of a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine players were chosen last week during a meeting of USA  
Basketball.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Sets Olympic Criteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This year's Women's World Cup will be used in  
part to determine qualifiers for the 2000 Olympics soccer 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, on Thursday said that  
if the eight quarterfinalists in the 16-team World Cup include 
Australia, then those eight teams all will make the field for the 
Sydney Games. If not, the four semifinalists and the best three 
losing quarterfinalists get in. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, as the host nation, automatically gets a spot in the  
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-step tiebreaker will be used to determine the best three  
losing quarterfinalists: 
</P>
<P>
	--Those teams with the lowest margin of defeat in their  
quarterfinal matches get the berths. 
</P>
<P>
	--If teams are equal in their margin of defeat, the next criteria  
will be the higher total of goals scored. 
</P>
<P>
	--If teams lose by the same score in the quarterfinals, the teams  
with the best performance in their group matches will advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The best performance in group matches will be determined first  
by points, then by goal difference, then by goals scored. 
</P>
<P>
	In the unlikely event the teams remain tied after all those  
tiebreakers, FIFA Fair Play rankings will be used. 
</P>
<P>
	The final tiebreaker would be for FIFA to draw lots.  
</P>
<P>
	FIFA also announced the roster size for the Women's World Cup  
will be 20 players. Those rosters must be submitted by 10 days 
before a team's first match. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup begins June 19.

<HEADLINE> Writer Andre Dubus Dies at 62 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVERHILL, Mass. (AP) -- Andre Dubus, praised by many as one of  
the finest short-story writers of his generation, has died. He was 
62. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately available. Dubus was  
discovered unconscious Wednesday night in his Haverhill home and 
later pronounced dead at Hale Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubus was the author of ``Dancing After Hours'' and  
``Meditations From a Movable Chair.'' His stories focused on 
discontented New Englanders and his own struggle after losing a leg 
in an automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a writer of absolute integrity and humanity,'' said  
Tobias Wolff, author of ``This Boy's Life'' and the short-story 
collection ``The Barracks Thief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, his collection of short stories ``Dancing After Hours''  
was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle awards and won 
a $30,000 Rea Award. His book ``Broken Vessels'' was a runner-up 
for a Pulitzer Prize in 1992 for general nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to Dubus' short stories, author Kurt Vonnegut once  
wrote, ``My old friend Andre has ripened, as many of us knew he 
would, into one of the world's living masters of this most 
difficult of all art forms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former Marine Corps captain, Dubus lost a leg and was confined  
to a wheelchair after a 1986 highway accident, a trauma he said 
stole his writing ``voice'' for many years. He had stopped to help 
two stranded motorists when he was struck. 
</P>
<P>
	He recorded his years of grief and self-pity in a book of essays  
published last year, ``Meditations From a Movable Chair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What impressed me so much was his Catholicism. It sustained  
him, no matter what happened to him. He thought God meant to make 
him useful in some way,'' Vonnegut said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the accident, Vonnegut and other writers such as John  
Updike and John Irving held a special literary benefit to raise 
more than $100,000 to cover Dubus' medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubus returned to writing and in gratitude for the help of his  
peers, he held free workshops in his home to encourage local 
writers in their own work. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Fisketjon, an editor at the Alfred A. Knopf publishing  
house, said Dubus had recently completed a handful of short stories 
set -- uncharacteristically for him -- in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubus was also completing a short novel, but it was not  
immediately clear whether it or the short stories would be 
published posthumously, Fisketjon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other honors, Dubus received a $310,000 MacArthur  
``genius'' grant in 1988, a Guggenheim grant, the PEN-New England 
Award for literary distinction and an award from the American 
Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by four daughters and two sons, including the  
novelist Andre Dubus III. The funeral is scheduled for Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Strawberry May Need Longer Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's comeback from cancer may  
take a little bit longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would not surprise me at all that by the time we're ready  
to leave, he would not be physically ready,'' New York Yankees 
manager Joe Torre said Thursday. ``I could be wrong, but again, if 
he needs another week or whatever it is, that's the most important 
thing to make sure he gets ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, one of four left field candidates, underwent colon  
cancer surgery last October. He had a second procedure in January 
to remove scar tissue and will undergo chemotherapy once-a-week 
through at least April. 
</P>
<P>
	Also of concern is Strawberry's previously injured left knee,  
which has slowed him the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
	The two recent surgeries prevented Strawberry from his offseason  
running program, affecting his overall conditioning program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be ready by opening day. We'll see how things work  
out,'' Strawberry said. ``If they work out fine, if they don't, 
fine. That's the way I look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Torre and Strawberry agree that the most important thing is  
avoiding any setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting there. That's the key ... I'm not going  
backwards,'' Strawberry said. ``I think that's the whole key Joe's 
looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who plans on beginning a light running program next  
week, will not play in the early exhibition games. Torre also 
indicated Strawberry may not make an outfield appearance until late 
in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned about his playing the outfield until he's  
ready to physically. It may turn out to the last two or three games 
of spring training, if then,'' Torre said. ``He feels better today 
than he has the last couple days in the fatigue area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees went through a second day of live batting practice  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the pitchers throwing were Mariano Rivera, Jeff Nelson,  
Darren Holmes and Mike Stanton. None reported any problems after 
their 10-minute sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte will likely throw batting practice on Saturday.  
The left-hander experienced throwing elbow tenderness following a 
bullpen session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't thrown off the mound. My elbow was just a little  
tender (afterwards) and I just wanted to make sure,'' Pettitte 
said. ``Everything is all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After not working out Wednesday, Pettitte took part in long toss  
drills Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens is scheduled to throw batting practice for the  
first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking forward to it, '' Torre said. ``I'm sure the  
hitters are not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Yankees' starting pitchers are scheduled to throw in  
intrasquad games Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Torre said the Yankees expect to find out in the next week  
if left-hander Jimmy Key has any interest in coming out of 
retirement. ... Designated hitter Chili Davis has been working out 
at first base and could be used there in an emergency situation.

<HEADLINE> Economy Begins 1999 at Fast Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders for big-ticket durable goods shot  
up at the fastest pace in 14 months while sales of existing homes 
climbed to an all-time high in January, indicating that the U.S. 
economy had plenty of momentum as it entered the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Thursday that orders to  
American factories for durable good jumped 3.9 percent last month, 
led by a big surge in demand for aircraft. Home resales advanced by 
0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.07 million 
units, highest on record. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a third report, the number of Americans filing new claims  
for unemployment benefits fell by 5,000 last week, pushing the 
four-week moving average to its lowest level in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	All the good economic news hammered Wall Street, with bond  
prices and stock prices both plunging. Investors saw the 
unexpectedly strong economic reports as a worrisome signal that the 
Federal Reserve may soon be forced to start raising interest rates 
to cool off an American economy that is growing so rapidly that it 
threatens to reignite inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 100 points  
in late afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is booming. These numbers are uniformly strong and  
that has the markets worried,'' said Mark Zandi, economist at 
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``Mr. Greenspan 
made clear in his testimony this week that if the economy doesn't 
slow, that will argue for the Fed to do some tightening pretty 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, delivering the central  
bank's latest economic forecast to Congress this week, predicted 
that the economy, which grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in 
1998, will slow this year to 2.5 percent to 3 percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan strongly hinted that if this slowdown does not  
occur, the Fed will be ready to move to raise interest rates to 
make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's next meeting is March 30. While economists think a Fed  
rate increase at that time is unlikely, they said an upward move at 
the May meeting is a growing possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department report on initial jobless claims showed the  
four-week moving average declining to 292,500, its lowest level 
since the week of Feb. 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign that labor markets remain extremely tight, the  
Conference Board, a private business research group, said that 
help-wanted advertising in major U.S. newspapers rose in January 
with an index of monthly advertising increasing to 93, up from 88 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Job demand remains as strong as it was a year ago -- a surprise  
to those who thought the financial problems in Asia and Latin 
America would come home,'' Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, orders for durable goods, items expected to last  
three or more years, increased by $7.7 billion. Most of the 
strength came in a huge $7.1 billion rise in transportation orders, 
primarily reflecting a big gain in orders for civilian aircraft, an 
extremely volatile sector. Aircraft orders shot up 145.1 percent in 
January after having fallen 29.6 percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Durable goods excluding transportation were up a more modest 0.4  
percent in January. In addition to transportation, demand for 
electronic products rose 6.4 percent. However, orders for 
industrial machinery fell 3.1 percent and demand for primary 
metals, including steel, were off 3.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The housing report from the National Association of Realtors  
showed that the 0.8 percent rise in home resales in January 
followed a 3.1 percent sales increase in December. The January gain 
occurred even though mortgage rates have been edging up recently. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of January, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, reported  
30-year mortgages averaged 6.79 percent, up from a 6.74 percent 
average in December but still below the 6.99 average for 30-year 
mortgages a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddie Mac said that rates rose again this week, the fourth  
consecutive weekly increase. Thirty-year fixed rate mortgages 
climbed to 6.89 percent, the highest level since mid-November of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While rising mortgage rates are likely to put a crimp in home  
sales as the year wears on, many analysts said there could be a 
spring rush by buyers hoping to get homes before rates rise 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any weakness will not emerge until late spring and will still  
leave activity at very high levels,'' said Ian Shepherdson, 
economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting firm in 
Valhalla, N.Y.

week, will not play in the early exhibition games. Torre also 
indicated Strawberry may not make an outfield appearance until late 
in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned about his playing the outfield until he's  
ready to physically. It may turn out to the last two or three games 
of spring training, if then,'' Torre said. ``He feels better today 
than he has the last couple days in the fatigue area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees went through a second day of live batting practice  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the pitchers throwing were Mariano Rivera, Jeff Nelson,  
Darren Holmes and Mike Stanton. None reported any problems after 
their 10-minute sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte will likely throw batting practice on Saturday.  
The left-hander experienced throwing elbow tenderness following a 
bullpen session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't thrown off the mound. My elbow was just a little  
tender (afterwards) and I just wanted to make sure,'' Pettitte 
said. ``Everything is all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After not working out Wednesday, Pettitte took part in long toss  
drills Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens is scheduled to throw batting practice for the  
first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking forward to it, '' Torre said. ``I'm sure the  
hitters are not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Yankees' starting pitchers are scheduled to throw in  
intrasquad games Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Torre said the Yankees expect to find out in the next week  
if left-hander Jimmy Key has any interest in coming out of 
retirement. ... Designated hitter Chili Davis has been working out 
at first base and could be used there in an emergency situation.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizers intend to produce air  
travel vouchers, courtesy notes and lodging reservations to 
substantiate claims that Salt Lake boosters lavished favors on 
Australian IOC member Phil Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune said today it obtained documents that  
undermined Coles' protests against the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee ethics report that said he received thousands of dollars 
worth of benefits during trips to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 9 report by the ethics committee said Salt Lake City  
bid boosters paid for four U.S. visits by the families of Coles and 
another International Olympic Committee member, Willi Kaltschmitt 
of Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC spokeswoman Caroline Shaw said the committee was sending  
copies of all the supporting documents to Coles and the IOC. The 
material was inadvertently left out of an appendix of the 300-page 
ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't seen the evidence and we wanted to get it off to  
him,'' said Shaw, who declined to provide copies of the materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles issued a statement today in Australia, saying the  
allegations are unfounded and constitute gross defamation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be taking legal action against Salt Lake City and the  
media after I am cleared of any wrongdoing by the IOC Commission 
and the IOC executive board,'' Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles also attacked the SLOC for the way it handled the matter,  
saying documents were faxed to him hours after they were released 
to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again I must voice my concern at the way that Salt Lake  
City appears intent on a deliberate course of defaming me,'' Coles 
said. ``Salt Lake City has been caught out with having conducted a 
sloppy and inaccurate investigation into my visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now attempting to justify its wrongdoing by relying on  
facts and circumstances which it must know do not support its 
defamatory allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members are not supposed to accept gifts worth more than  
$150, and Coles is under investigation by the IOC for allegedly 
breaking that rule. Coles stepped down from the organizing 
committee of the 2000 Sydney Games a day after he was named in the 
Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report said ``some IOC members treated their site  
visits more like vacations,'' and then discussed the case of the 
Coles and Kaltschmitt families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coles and Kaltschmitt families stayed at expensive hotels  
and followed the same recreational itinerary. Two of these trips 
were only four months apart in 1995, including a Super Bowl trip 
that does not appear to have included a visit to Salt Lake City. 
Mr. (Tom) Welch (then head of SLOC) served as their host at the 
Super Bowl; the expenses were paid as reimbursements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles told The Australian newspaper that he and his family spent  
Christmas 1995 with fellow IOC member Jim Easton at Easton's 
condominium in Deer Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed there. We cooked our own meals and did everything  
ourselves, and my records show that,'' Coles said. ``These people 
have got it wrong again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easton, one of two American IOC members and a SLOC trustee, told  
The Tribune on Wednesday that ``I saw him and we skied during that 
time. But he was staying at someone else's condo. I don't know 
whose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said bills and paperwork indicate the bid committee  
largely picked up Coles' tabs for a weeklong stay in Deer Valley in 
February 1993 and a five-day stay in February 1995 -- four months 
before the IOC voted to award Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the documents that it had obtained were not  
above dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, an itinerary for the 1995 trip said Coles and his  
partner, Patricia Rosenbrock, were to have Christmas dinner at the 
home of Park City Mayor Brad Olch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say categorically `no,' that Coles did not have  
Christmas anything with me,'' Olch said. ``I can remember having 
dinner with them (Coles and Rosenbrock) a couple of times at 
restaurants ... but I couldn't tell you whether it was 1995 or 
1993.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deer Valley Lodging sent an $8,027 bill for ``Coles -- IOC  
members'' to the SLOC office to cover the two-week stay at a 
two-bedroom condo, The Tribune said. The itinerary of that 1995 
trip suggests Welch took the Coles to see a Utah Jazz-Portland 
basketball game and feted them at an $85-per-person New Year's Eve 
party also attended by Atlanta Olympic organizing committee 
president Billy Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	A reimbursement request shows bid committee Vice President Dave  
Johnson sought two Coles-Kaltschmitt-related repayments -- one for a 
Stein Ericksen Lodge dinner costing $1,982. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, credit-card receipts indicate the bid committee  
paid for two-round trips tickets from Sydney to Los Angeles for 
Coles and Rosenbrock at a cost of $11,667. Coles has said this was 
his one formal site visit allowed under IOC rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years earlier, the Coles apparently split their Utah stay  
between two nights at Brigham Street Inn and four nights at Stein 
Ericksen Lodge, The Tribune said. Johnson received a reimbursement 
check of $1,837 for ``expenses incurred during visit of Phillip 
Coles'' at Stein Ericksen. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the documents, the bid committee reimbursed Coles'  
$4,500 air fare, bought him ski gloves, stretch pants and bindings, 
an NBA basketball and ``an additional day of ski instruction during 
Phillip Coles' visit to Deer Valley -- $397.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, African Olympic official Jean-Claude Ganga is trying  
to mobilize support from his own continent in a desperate bid to 
fight expulsion from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IOC member, accused of receiving more than $200,000 in  
cash and inducements from Salt Lake City, has little backing for 
his cause, African Olympic officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, president of the Association of National Olympic  
Committees of Africa, has called an emergency meeting of the 
organization's executive committee for next Tuesday in Gabon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, of the Republic of Congo, wants ANOCA's support before he  
argues against his expulsion at the March 17-18 general assembly of 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But two senior African Olympic officials, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said several ANOCA delegates are refusing to attend 
the Gabon meeting out of disdain for Ganga.
